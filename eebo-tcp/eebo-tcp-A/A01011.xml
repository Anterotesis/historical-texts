            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Diſcourſe was intended at firſt, as the Concluſion and cloſing vp of the Treatiſe I termed, <hi>The Church Conquerant ouer human VVit</hi>: but being when I wrote it, in great doubt, that the ſayd Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe was loſt in the tranſporting therof from one place to another (which often happens in Countries which are infeſted with warre) I reſolued to make this Diſcourſe more large, by the diſcouery of many other Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this our Aduerſary, and with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of ſuch tergiuerſations, as Cauillers might deuiſe, to ſtay piouſly diſpoſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, from yielding prompt and aſſured aſſent to this moſt important Verity.</p>
            <p>And as they who make <hi>Bills of Account,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue ſet downe diſtinctly for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, the particular Summes of expences; are accuſtomed in the end in few Cyphers to

abbreuiate the <hi>Totall Summe</hi>; ſo this Treatiſe comming after the former, as the Concluſion thereof; I haue giuen it the name of <hi>Totall Summe,</hi> the Argument handled therein being worthy of that ſtile.

            <p>Verily this is the pith, the marrow, the Summe, the quinteſſence of all Controuerſies ventilated betwixt Proteſtants and vs: and in particular it was the ſole ſcope of that short ſubſtantiall Treatiſe <hi>Charity miſtaken by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>; which being by <hi>D. Potter,</hi> in his <hi>VVant of Charity,</hi> impugned, was defended and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the learned labours and elucubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Charity maintayned.</hi> For the maine Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy debated in theſe three bookes is, <hi>whether Roman Catholiques &amp; Proteſtants may both be ſaued in their ſeuerall Religions:</hi> or which comes to the ſame iſſue, ſeing Proteſtants grant we may be ſaued in our Religion, becauſe our Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

are not Fundamentall and damnable, <hi>whether it is not want of Charity in vs, that we will not requite them with the like mild, gentle, and comfortable doome</hi>; but conſtantly maintayne, that Saluation cannot be had in any courſe of Separation, and Oppoſition againſt Doctrine propoſed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as matter of faith.</p>
            <p>And though this our Catholique determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hath beene in the before named <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> demonſtrated, eſpecially in the two laſt Chapters thereof; which shew all Sects &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſioners, all <hi>Protesters,</hi> and Oppoſers againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be guilty of the two moſt heynous crimes, <hi>Schiſme,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hereſy:</hi> yet I haue thought fit &amp; conuenient, to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle this <hi>Totall of Controuerſies</hi> in a particular short Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atiſe: wherin omitting the former two heads of proofe, I haue vrged peculiar, and proper Arguments, grounded vpon euident Truths confeſſed, approued, confirmed euen by this our Aduerſary, whoſe Booke Proteſtants ſo much eſteeme as they ſtand thereon againſt the cleere demonſtrations for the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> brought by <hi>Charity maintayned.</hi>

Your euaſions and ſhiftes, I will particularly refute, and lay open their falſhood and vanity; wherby it ſhalbe made apparent, that both the booke of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity maintayned</hi> reſteth hitherto vnanſwered, and that this Argument drawne from the confeſſion of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, is altogether vnanſwerable. I ſhall firſt propoſe our Argument, ſtrenthened with <hi>D. Potters</hi> ſuffrage. <hi>Secondly,</hi> diſcouer how impudently you deny <hi>D. Potters</hi> text. Thirdly, how at laſt you acknowledge it, &amp; giue an explication therof full of groſſe ignorance. Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thly, how weakly, and in vayne you would ſeeme to contemne this Argument as poore, and ſeely. Fiftly, I will declare the force of this Argument, and ſhew the reaſon why Proteſtants (that be wiſe, and not diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with furious zeale) dare not condemne the Roman Religion &amp; Communion, as <hi>damnable of it ſelfe.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:18604:5"/>
Finally, that not only Roman Catholikes, but that you your ſelues dare not maintaine, that the <hi>Religion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants is a ſafe way to ſaluation</hi>; yea you grant the ſame not to be free from errours <hi>damnable of themſelues.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. THe Argument I ſet downe in this manner. No man ſhalbe, or can be damned eternally, for errours, which be not damnable of themſelues. This is cleere; Becauſe God being iuſt, <hi>who renders to euery one according to their deſerts,</hi> cannot puniſh men more then their offences do of themſelues deſerue, but rather <hi>ſomewhat vnder their merit.</hi> But the errours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be found in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> cannot of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But ſome may obiect, that <hi>D.

I anſwer, this is a ſubtilty which findeth <hi>a difference</hi> where there is no diuerſity. As to ſay of a potion, that it is not of it ſelfe deadly to ſuch as drinke it, &amp; take it into their bowells and heart, is all one as to ſay, it is deadly to none, but harmeleſſe and innoxious in it ſelfe: ſo to ſay, our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours <hi>are not in themſelues damnable to ſuch as heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue and profeſſe</hi> them, is as much as to ſay, <hi>they are of themſelues damnable</hi> vnto none, but abſolutely <hi>veniall</hi> &amp; of their owne nature not deſtructiue of Saluation. For to whome may they be <hi>in themſelues damnable,</hi> if they be not ſo to them that take them into their heart by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and cordiall beliefe. As none can be damned for ſinne, but ſuch as commit ſinne; ſo none can be damned for erring, but ſuch as erre, and are guilty of erring.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18604:8"/>
Now thoſe that in their heart belieue not errours, do not erre, nor are guilty of erring: wherefore, ſuch nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, nor can be damned for erring, or holding of errours. For if they hypocritically, profeſſe Errours which they do not belieue, they be damnable indeed; but not for erring, <hi>but for their hypocriſy and diſsimulation,</hi> as <hi>D.

For is it not damnable,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18604:19"/>
and execrable Pride, for a ſimple and ignorant man, to abandon the Roman Church, adorned with ſo many glorious markes of the true Chriſtian Church; to reiect the definition of Generall Councels without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and inforing reaſons, without any ſure ground, or euident certainty that they be errours? No doubt ſuch an one, the more ignorant that he is, the more damnable wretch he is; and by ſo much is his pride more deteſtable. Wherfore Proteſtants, if in their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking and venturing to reiect the definition of Councels, and the receaued Traditions of ſo many former Chriſtian ages, they chance to erre, though but out of ſimplicity and ignorance, this ſimplicity and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, will not excuſe and mitigate, but rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and aggrauate the crime of their erring preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pride.</p>

If Proteſtants anſwere,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18604:39"/>
that ſuch as haue their taſt diſtempered, to them hony is bitter; ſo Infidels, through preiudice and diſtemper of paſſions, do not perceaue, and taſt the Diuinity of the Doctrines of the Scripture. Againſt this, the reply is ready and conuincing: For they who through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of their palate, <hi>iudge hony</hi> to be <hi>bitter,</hi> do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the true taſt of <hi>hony,</hi> but a taſt contrary to the true taſt thereof; which being in their palate, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue it to be in the meate.

            <p n="6">6. Finally, if the Proteſtants beliefe of Scripture be grounded vpon ſight of the truth thereof, this their beliefe is not ſauing fayth: for Fayth by which men are ſaued (as hath beene ſayd) is that wherby they ſubmit by voluntary obedience, their vnderſtanding to Gods word; belieuing firmely and aſſuredly vpon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof, things in themſelues incredible, and aboue the reach of human reaſon.

that your texts make the matter <hi>queſtionable</hi>; yet your abandoning the Roman Church is damnable.

becauſe this buſineſſe is the maine and the totall, I will here repeate ſome of the paſſages though very briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, conuicted by the wordes of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> you grant, that the <hi>viſible Catholique Church is the pillar and ground of truth, that is, the teacher of all neceſſary, and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table truth by duty and office; yea that ſhe is always in fact the teacher of all truth neceſſary to Saluation.</hi> For (ſay you) <hi>that the true Church alwayes ſhall be the maintayner and teacher of all neceſſary truth, we grant, and must grant: For it is of the eſſence of the Church to be ſo; and any company of men were no more a Church without it, then any thing can be a man, and not be reaſonable.</hi> Thus you grant, that there is and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſhall be <hi>a Catholique Church,</hi> which ſhall not only <hi>belieue</hi> inwardly and in heart; but alſo <hi>teach</hi> and (a) <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe without fayle all diuine reuelation</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">The viſible Church ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>without fayle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> ſo much of Gods reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will not be the viſible Church.</note> 
               <hi>neceſsary to Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For it is her very eſsence to be ſo.</hi> Wherefore not only in belieuing, but alſo in teaching and propoſing all ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſary truth, ſhe can no more faile then from her owne being which is indefectible. Hence ſhe is (and you muſt grant ſhe is) <hi>an infallible guide in Fundamentalls</hi>: Becauſe to ſhew men the way to heauen, by teaching them all reuealed truth that is neceſſary to bring them thither; what is it, but to be a guide of men vnto Saluation; ſhewing them the Fundamental doctrines of Chriſtian Religion, without which no man is ſaued?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, the viſible Catholique Church, being (as you grant ſhe is) an infallible <hi>teacher or guide in Fundamentalls,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be alſo <hi>infallible in all her propoſalls.</hi> The neceſſity of this conſequence you deny a thouſand tymes, and almoſt in euery period of your third Chapter; yet you affirme it in expreſſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. <hi>Pag.</hi> 105 <hi>n.</hi> 139. <hi>lin.</hi> 23. <hi>To ſay, that the Church is an infallible guide in Fundamentals,</hi> were to oblige <hi>our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18604:49"/>
to find ſome certain Society of men, of whome we might be certain, that they neither do, nor can erre in</hi> Fundamentals; <hi>nor in declaring what is</hi> Fundamental, <hi>and what is not: and conſequently to make any Church an infallible guide in</hi> Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals <hi>would be to make her infallible in all thinges ſhe propoſes</hi>; and requires to be belieued. Which truth you proue vnanſwerably. <hi>Pag.</hi> 148. <hi>n.</hi> 36.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the viſible Catholique Church being <hi>a guide in Fundamentals,</hi> that is, alwayes a Teacher of all neceſsary truth, is a Church (c) of <hi>one denomination, that is, ſome ſettled certaine Society of Christians knowne and distinguiſhed from other Societies, by adhering to ſuch a Biſhop.</hi> This is proued by this Syllogiſme, wherein both the premiſes be your owne formall aſſertions. The Church is appointed of God <hi>to be the teacher and guide of men in the way of Saluation,</hi> and ſo ſhe is able and fit for that office. For God would not by his word haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed her an office, for which ſhe is vnfit and vnable to perferme it; yea, you ſay, the Church is not only able to performe the office of guide; but alſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>in fact</hi> ſhe doth exerciſe the ſame in teaching all neceſſary truth.

            <p n="4">
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:18604:49"/>4. From theſe moſt certaine truthes by you gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, approued and proued, it is neceſſarily and euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſequent; that the Roman Church is <hi>the Viſible Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church of God, an infallible Teacher of all fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and neceſſary truth: yea infallible in all thinges she propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as matter of fayth</hi>: This I ſay, is cleerely conſequent of the former grants. For the <hi>viſible Church</hi> being <hi>the Guide, Teacher and Directour</hi> of men, is on the one ſide a Church of <hi>one denomination</hi>; elſe ſhe could not performe that office of guide which ſhe doth (as you confeſse) alwayes actually performe. On the other ſide, being the <hi>Catholique,</hi> that is, the Vniuerſall Church, ſhe muſt be ſpread ouer the face of the earth; as the <hi>Roman</hi> is in <hi>Europe, Africa, Aſia, America,</hi> and in many of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Kingdomes, and Prouinces of theſe foure quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the world. So that the wordes of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> come to be verified no leſſe now, then at that time, <hi>your fayth is renowned and published in the whole world.</hi> Which vniuerſality, or vniuerſal Vnity agrees to no other Church of one denomination, as is manifeſt. Wherefore the Roman Church is the Holy Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church, the infallible guide of men in the way of Saluation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hence is concluded the ſecurity of Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, that they cannot poſſibly erre about matters of fayth, ſo long as they follow the dogmatical dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and definitions of the Roman Church. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe they who oppoſe what they know to be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by her, as matter of fayth, erre Heretically &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, and cannot poſſibly be ſaued without expreſse repentance of their errours.</p>
