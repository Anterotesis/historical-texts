            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vpon earth, as are cauſed or intimated
by extraordinary apparitions of Comets

            <p>Now becauſe the fixed ſeat of the new
Star was in diſtance from the <hi>Aequator</hi>
Northward about 62. degrees, that
tract of the earth which lieth in the
Northen latitude of 62. is to be taken
as principally intended: which in our
part of the knowne world rangeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
from the Weſt through <hi>Norvegia,
Swedia, Finlandia, Livonia, Moſcovia,</hi> and
<hi>Tartaria.</hi> In all which Countries thoſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:27739:11"/>
parcells which lye vnder the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

<hi>Hic labor, hoc opus eſt.</hi> There lies
the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Learned <hi>Tycho</hi> guided his Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
by the very firſt New Moone
after the firſt appearing of the Starr:
which New Moone fell vpon the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>Nouember,</hi> ſeauen houres thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
minutes ⅔ in the afternoone, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
the time by the Meridian of
<hi>Tycho's Iland:</hi> at which inſtant the new
Starr was in the Meridian of 53 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
from the Weſt, and ſo became in
that inſtant verticall and higheſt to that
place of the earth, which lyeth in the
longitude of 53, and latitude of 62:
being ſituated in reſpect of the Citie of
<hi>London</hi> twentie Degrees more Eaſterly,
and about ten Degrees more Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:27739:11"/>
So now, in regard of the ayme of this

of 62 may be called the Butt, &amp; the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian

beyond the Meridian of 53. as evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeareth by the ſituation of <hi>Kinaveb

draw thoſe parts a little more to the

world (eſpecially thoſe that are leſſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented

So that now hee is poſſeſſed of ſome

whitherward our <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>

With this ſmall force he marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

he took the one by aſſault in the open

            <p>From thence marching without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay

vpon <hi>Tilly,</hi> putting him to flight, entred

as they ſtood furniſhed with meat vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Tables prepared by them, who
now had no liſt to returne to that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but rather left it to thoſe for whom
God had provided it.</p>
            <p>The flying enemy was ſhrowded by
the black mantle of the night, ſo that the
conquering King could not further pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
his Victory till the next morning,
when drawing out a thouſand horſe he
in perſon followed them eight Dutch
myles, cutting off 1000 of the foot, and
taking priſoners 3000 more.</p>
            <p>The loſſe on <hi>Tyllies</hi> part is eſteemed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:27739:19"/>
at 18000, whereof ſlaine 8000, and

the other part not aboue 1200 men as
by the more ſtrange &amp; truer Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>The ancient Latines called that <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtum,</hi>
which was <hi>bonis avibus geſtum,</hi>
acheived according to the foreſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
