            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that of <hi>Earth,</hi> to defeat the deſigns of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
by the ſame method he had made uſe of
to overcome. But as the <hi>Objects</hi> were diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,

alſo. For whereas the <hi>Devil,</hi> as St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
ſays, <hi>took</hi> our Savior <hi>up</hi> into an exceeding
high Mountain; that is (according to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
beſt agreeing with the Context)
carried him through the Air (as an Angel had
formerly done <hi>Habacuch)</hi> without giving
him the leaſt trouble or <hi>pain</hi> to aſcend;<note place="margin">Dan. 14. 35.</note> the
ſame St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, that our <hi>Savior</hi> did
not <hi>ſo</hi> with his Diſciples, but that he <hi>led them
up; duxit illos,</hi> that is, <hi>went</hi> himſelf before
them, and cauſed them to follow him, <hi>on
foot,</hi> to give us to underſtand, that the <hi>Way</hi> to

               <hi>Perdition</hi> is <hi>pleaſant</hi> and eaſie; <hi>ducunt in bonis

to <hi>true Glory</hi> is <hi>hard</hi> and difficult; <hi>Strait is the
Gate and narrow the Way which leadeth unto Life,</hi>
Matth. 7. 14.</p>
            <p>But how ſtrait and narrow, how hard and
difficult ſoever it be, the greatneſs of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
more than recompences the Labor of
acquiring it, as appears by what paſſed with
the Diſciples of my Text; for being arrived
at the top of the Mountain, our Savior there
became <hi>transfigured before them,</hi> ſo that the
<hi>brightneſs</hi> of his <hi>Face</hi> vy'd with that of the <hi>Sun</hi>
in his richeſt Attire of Light, and the <hi>whiteneſs</hi>
of his <hi>Garments</hi> with that of the <hi>Snow</hi> when
array'd in its whiteſt Dreſs. Which of Us,
Dear Chriſtians, had he been preſent at this
Glorious ſight, would not have cry'd out
with St. <hi>Peter, Domine, bonum eſt nos hic eſſe;
Lord, it is good for us to be here!</hi> And who is
there of us now, that is not inflam'd with a
holy Deſire, or, as I may call it, <hi>Curioſity,</hi> as
<hi>Moſes</hi> was when he beheld the <hi>burning Buſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 3.</note>
to know <hi>how</hi> it came to paſs that the Body
of our Savior, which till then had appeared
different in nothing from the Bodies of other
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55647:4"/>
Men, ſhould be ſuddenly inveſted with a
<hi>brightneſs</hi> like that of the <hi>Sun;</hi> and <hi>what End</hi>
or Deſign he had in the doing of it?</p>
            <p>To ſatisfie this two-fold demand of <hi>how</hi>
and <hi>why</hi> he would be thus transfigured, is
what I have deſign'd for the Subject of my
preſent Diſcourſe, and accordingly ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
it into Two Parts. In the Firſt I ſhall
give you an Account (as God ſhall ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
me) of the <hi>Myſtery</hi> it ſelf, that is, <hi>how</hi> it
came to paſs that the <hi>Body</hi> of our Savior was
ſo <hi>transfigured,</hi> that it became <hi>bright</hi> and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as the <hi>Sun.</hi> In the Second, <hi>why</hi> he would
work this wonderful change in his <hi>Face</hi> and
<hi>Garments,</hi> and that in the <hi>ſight</hi> of his Diſciples:
<hi>Et transfiguratus eſt ante eos; And he was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
before them,</hi> or in their ſight.</p>
            <p>Whil'ſt the Diſciples were abſorpt with
wonder at this Glorious Spectacle, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt
ſays, that a <hi>bright Cloud</hi> over-ſhadowed
them; which Cloud, St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays, was a
Symbol of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
(as he formerly had done in the
<hi>Figure</hi> of a <hi>Dove</hi> at our Savior's Baptiſm) to
Grace the Solemnity with his Preſence: That
the Aſſiſtance of this <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> may not be

            <p>TO give an Account <hi>how</hi> the Body of our
Savior was ſo <hi>transfigured,</hi> as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
bright and ſhining as the <hi>Sun,</hi> it will be
neceſſary to enquire into the meaning of the
word <hi>Transfiguration.</hi> When we ſay a thing
is <hi>disfigured,</hi> every one underſtands the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it: but if we ſay a thing is <hi>transfigured,</hi>
the ſenſe is not ſo eaſie and obvious to all, at
leaſt to the Unlearned, as not to require ſome
Explication: Which yet I ſhall endeavor to
manage ſo, that whil'ſt I am inſtructing thoſe
of the loweſt Form, ſuch as are in a higher
Claſs may not loſe their time; remembring,
with the great Apoſtle, that I am a <hi>Debtor</hi> to
both; <hi>Sapientibus &amp; inſipientibus debitor ſum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A thing then is ſaid to be <hi>transfigured,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the proper acceptation of the
word, when its <hi>Shape</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> not its Eſſence,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55647:5"/>
is alter'd, ſo that it puts on another appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
more Noble and Glorious than it had
before; for the Particle <hi>trans</hi> here ſignifies an
<hi>exceſs,</hi> or <hi>paſſing beyond</hi> or above what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
and uſually found in the Thing. An
Example of this we have in a <hi>Cloud,</hi> which of
it ſelf is nothing but a <hi>dark Vapor</hi> or <hi>Miſt</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled
from the Bowels of the Earth: yet dark
and miſty as it is, no ſooner is it penetrated by
the Rays of the Sun, but preſently it becomes
<hi>bright</hi> and <hi>ſhining;</hi> and what before ſeem'd a
<hi>black Veil,</hi> which muffled the Light of that
Glorious Planet, having now drank in his
Beams, is transform'd into a radiant Mirror,
in which he ſeems to rejoyce to behold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo gloriouſly reflected. This <hi>change</hi> of the
Cloud ſo much for the better, may fitly be
called its <hi>Transfiguration;</hi> and gives us, tho'
not a <hi>Parallel,</hi> yet a glimpſe at leaſt of what
paſſed in the <hi>Transfiguration</hi> of our Savior;
when his <hi>Body,</hi> till then dark and obſcure,
like thoſe of other men, became <hi>bright</hi> and
<hi>ſhining</hi> like the <hi>Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, becauſe this <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> or
change ſo much for the better, may proceed
from a two-fold cauſe; either from <hi>without,</hi>
as in a <hi>Cloud,</hi> when penetrated with the Rays
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55647:5"/>
of the Sun; or from <hi>within,</hi> as when a <hi>Globe</hi>
of Chryſtal is enlightned by a burning and
ſhining <hi>Lamp</hi> ſet in it: the Queſtion ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
Whether this bright Illumination
which diſcover'd it ſelf in the Face and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our Lord, proceeded from ſome
Coeleſtial Splendor <hi>without,</hi> like that which
appear'd to the Shepherds at his Birth; or
from ſome Intrinſical <hi>Principle,</hi> or Fountain
of <hi>Light,</hi> which, like the <hi>Lamp</hi> upon the
Chryſtal, diffuſed it ſelf upon his Body?</p>
            <p>The Solution of this Queſtion depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that generally known Doctrin of Divines
with St. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. P. q. 34. a. 4.</note> That the <hi>Soul</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
by vertue of the Hypoſtatical Union
with the Word, enjoy'd the <hi>Beatifical Viſion,</hi>
or ſight of the Divine Eſſence, and ſo was
full of <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Brightneſs</hi> from the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
of his Conception;<note place="margin">Ibid. q. 45. a. 2.</note> And that from

Emanation, a Communication of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
<hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Brightneſs</hi> to his <hi>Body.</hi>
For,<note place="margin">Ep. 56. ad Dioſcorum.</note> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, <hi>Tam potenti Natura De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55647:6"/>
of Man of ſo powerful a Nature, that from
the fulneſs of its <hi>Bliſs</hi> there ſhould redound
alſo upon the Body a <hi>fulneſs</hi> of <hi>Health,</hi> or <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor</hi>
of <hi>Incorruption,</hi> under which terms he
comprehends all the four Prerogatives of a
<hi>Glorified Body,</hi> viz. <hi>Clarity</hi> or Brightneſs, <hi>Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Immortality,</hi> and <hi>Impaſſibility.</hi> All theſe
<hi>Qualities</hi> then were <hi>due</hi> to the <hi>Body</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior,
as being united to his <hi>Glorified Soul,</hi> from
the firſt inſtant of his Conception. But the
end of his coming into the World being to
Suffer and Die for our Salvation, 'twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
his <hi>Glory</hi> ſhould remain ſhut up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his <hi>Soul,</hi> without being communicated to
his <hi>Body;</hi> for had his <hi>Body</hi> been <hi>glorified</hi> as
well as his <hi>Soul,</hi> he had not been in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſuffer for us. Thus did the deſire he had
to ſuffer for us cauſe him to work a conſtant
and prodigious Miracle upon Himſelf, by
forcing, as I may ſay, the <hi>Stream</hi> of his <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
like the Waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> to roul it ſelf
up, and ſtand on a heap, without pouring it
ſelf forth upon his <hi>Body,</hi> which otherwiſe it
would have done. But now the time being
come, in which the Divine Wiſdom thought
fit, not ſo much for His Own ſake as for Ours,
that his Pure and Innocent Body before it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55647:6"/>
ſhould enjoy one <hi>Sun-ſhiny</hi> day among
ſo many <hi>Cloudy</hi> ones: Behold He opens the
<hi>Sluce,</hi> as I may call it, of that <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi>
which till then had been kept ſhut up within
the Floudgates of his Will, and gives it leave to
pour it ſelf forth in a full <hi>Stream</hi> upon his <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
which preſently was ſo penetrated and
ſteep'd in a glorious Floud of <hi>Light,</hi> that (as
the Text ſays) <hi>his Face ſhined like the Sun,
and his very Garments became white as Snow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it was, Dear Chriſtians, that the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
of our Savior became ſo gloriouſly <hi>transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured,</hi>
not by an Illumination from <hi>without,</hi>
but by an Irradiation from <hi>within;</hi> by which
it appears to have been not ſo much the effect
of a <hi>New Miracle,</hi> as the <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of a former one. For as in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Jordan</hi> the <hi>Miracle</hi> conſiſted in that they
ſtood on a heap, and not that they afterwards
<hi>flowed</hi> into the Sea, for that was their natural
courſe: ſo in the <hi>Transfiguration</hi> upon Mount
<hi>Thabor,</hi> the <hi>Miracle</hi> was, that the <hi>Stream</hi> of
<hi>Glory</hi> ſhould remain pent up within the <hi>Soul</hi>
of our Redeemer from the firſt Inſtant of his
Conception, without any other Bank than
that of his own Will, and not that it poured
it ſelf afterwards upon his <hi>Body,</hi> for that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55647:7"/>
was but that natural conſequence of the Glory
of his Soul.</p>
            <p>And now, Dear Chriſtians, (to make ſome
Application of this to our ſelves) how much
are we bound to our Deareſt Redeemer, both
for the One and the Other! Firſt, that he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed</hi>
his <hi>Glory,</hi> and kept it from communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
it ſelf to his Body, through the whole
courſe of his Life for the ſpace of three and
thirty years; and then that he let it <hi>flow</hi> and
manifeſt it ſelf in his <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> in the
<hi>brightneſs</hi> both of his <hi>Face</hi> and <hi>Garments,</hi> ſince
both were done for our ſakes! Had he not
been pleaſed once at leaſt to permit that
<hi>Floud</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> of which his Soul was full, to
pour it ſelf forth upon his <hi>Body,</hi> happily we
had been, if not wholly ignorant, yet
not ſo ſenſible at leaſt of his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
in miraculouſly <hi>ſuſpending</hi> its Emanation all
the reſt of his Life, that he might be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to ſuffer and die for us. And is it not
reaſon, that now we know it we ſhould both
<hi>thank</hi> him for it, and make it, in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
our condition will permit, the Pattern of
our <hi>Imitation?</hi> Not that we can <hi>transfigure</hi>
our <hi>Bodies</hi> as His was; this is a Privilege re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
for the next Life: but that we <hi>may</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55647:7"/>
               <hi>muſt</hi> prepare and diſpoſe theſe vile and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Bodies of ours to be <hi>configured</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſaith) <hi>to the brightneſs of his Glorified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
hereafter,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> by <hi>repreſſing</hi> within us at preſent
a <hi>Floud</hi> of another nature, that <hi>Floud</hi> I mean
of <hi>Original Corruption,</hi> which we bring with
us into the World from our firſt Parent <hi>Adam.</hi>
For ſuch is the condition of man ſince his
Fall, that the <hi>Soul</hi> is no ſooner united to the
<hi>Body,</hi> (which is in the very firſt Inſtant of its
Creation) but it contracts the <hi>Guilt</hi> of <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sin,</hi> and together with it a ſtrong <hi>Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
or Inclination to the <hi>Love</hi> of it ſelf, and
of all thoſe Objects which are grateful to <hi>Fleſh</hi>
and <hi>Bloud.</hi> So that the <hi>heart</hi> of man is like
a corrupted <hi>Fountain,</hi> out of which, as our
Savior himſelf hath told us,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 19.</note> 
               <hi>proceed evil

            </p>
            <p>This is what we oblig'd our ſelves to do,

renouncing the Suggeſtions of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the
Deſires of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the Pomps and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of the <hi>World.</hi> And that the doing of this
is a <hi>Miracle,</hi> and ſuch an one as <hi>may</hi> and
<hi>ought</hi> to be done by us,<note place="margin">Ecclici 31.</note> the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
when ſpeaking of the <hi>Juſt man,</hi> whom

for one of the conditions of his <hi>Beatification,</hi>
that he has done <hi>Miracles</hi> in his Life; <hi>fecit

know what <hi>Miracles</hi> theſe were, he preſently
adds, <hi>Qui potuit tranſgredi, &amp; non eſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;

not; and when he could have done the evil,</hi> to
which his corrupt Nature inclin'd him, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
himſelf from committing it.</hi> And for this
reaſon it is, that when our <hi>Savior,</hi> among
other <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Miracles</hi> which he foretels
ſhould be done by thoſe that believed in him,
puts <hi>this</hi> for one,<note place="margin">Marc. 16.</note> That <hi>if they drink any thing

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:55647:8"/>
tells us,<note place="margin">St. Greg. Hom. 29. in Evang.</note> That <hi>then</hi> it is this <hi>Miracle</hi> is wrought
in a more Sublime, becauſe Spiritual manner,
by the Faithful, when feeling in themſelves
the venemous ſuggeſtions and perſuaſions of

are not drawn by them to commit any thing
that is evil. <hi>Dum peſtiferas ſuaſiones audiunt,

            </p>
            <p>And now, if the <hi>repreſſing</hi> the firſt motions

               <hi>or which is more, experienced
in himſelf the different degrees of difficulty which
occur in the ſubduing of Vices, knows very well,
that the Sin of Pride and Vainglory is the chief,
if not the only one, to which thoſe who have attani'd
to Perfection are obnoxious; and as it was the
firſt which infected the Soul, ſo alſo it is the laſt
that is overcome.</hi> From whence St. <hi>Peter Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Here then it is, that a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> truly ſhews
himſelf to be a <hi>Thaumaturgus,</hi> or Worker of
<hi>Miracles,</hi> when finding thoughts of Pride,
Envy, Gluttony, Impurity, Anger, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
Revenge, and the like, to ariſe in his

with the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which was

and will not ſuffer them to gain upon his
conſent, nor to <hi>reign</hi> in his Mortal Body;
<hi>Fecit mirabilia in vita ſua;</hi> he hath done <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
in his life: And by depriving himſelf of
thoſe <hi>undue delights</hi> and ſatisfactions which
are the natural conſequences of <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi>
he both <hi>prepares</hi> and diſpoſes his own mortal
<hi>Body</hi> to be <hi>configured</hi> to the <hi>Brightneſs of the
Body of his Glorified Redeemer;</hi> and ſhews his
<hi>Gratitude</hi> to him, for having deprived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of that <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Brightneſs</hi> which was
due, and as ſuch would and ought to have

his <hi>Soul,</hi> (had he not miraculouſly repreſs'd
and kept it back) from the firſt Inſtant of his
Conception to the day of his <hi>Transfiguration.
Why</hi> he permitted it then to pour it ſelf forth
in a glorious <hi>Floud</hi> of Light upon his <hi>Body</hi>
and <hi>Garments,</hi> and that in the <hi>preſence</hi> and
<hi>ſight</hi> of his Diſciples, is what I come now to
treat of, as the Subject of the Second Part of
my Diſcourſe.</p>
         </div>

            <head>The Second Part.</head>
            <head type="sub">Transfiguratus eſt ante eos; He was transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured

            <p>AND why <hi>before them,</hi> or in their <hi>ſight,</hi>
but to <hi>excite</hi> them <hi>more efficaciouſly</hi> to
labor for the obtaining of ſo Glorious a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?</hi>
To give light to this Anſwer, it may
not be unuſeful to premiſe, what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
relates to have paſs'd with the Patriarch
<hi>Jacob,</hi> when his Sons brought him the News
of his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s being alive. The Caſe
was this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſeph</hi> being now <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 45.</note> and
having made himſelf known to his Brethren,
commanded them to go tell his Father <hi>Jacob</hi>
of <hi>all his Glory,</hi> and to bring him along with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55647:10"/>
them into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to preſerve him from the
Famin, which was yet to laſt five years. To
accompliſh this deſign, he provided them of
Carriages, and all things neceſſary for the
way, adding over and above a Preſent of
the <hi>good things of Egypt,</hi> which might ſerve as
an Earneſt or Pledg of the Riches of the
Place, to excite him to the Journey. No
ſooner were they arrived in the preſence of
their Father, but they acquainted him with
the good News; <hi>Joſeph, Filius tuus, vivit &amp;
dominatur in univerſa terra Aegypti; Joſeph,</hi>
that Son of thy <hi>Love,</hi> whoſe <hi>Abſence,</hi> not to
ſay <hi>Death,</hi> thou haſt ſo bitterly lamented for
ſo many years, is <hi>yet alive,</hi> and is <hi>Governor</hi>
over all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and nothing is
wanting to complete his Happineſs, but to
have his Father <hi>Jacob</hi> with him. How may
we imagin was the heart of the Holy Man
tranſported with joy at the <hi>hearing</hi> of this
News? and how would he give order to get
all things ready for the Journey, that he might
go and enjoy the preſence of his Beloved <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph?</hi>
This indeed might have been expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but not a word of any ſuch thing. On
the contrary, the Scripture ſaith, That when
<hi>Jacob</hi> had heard theſe things, <hi>his heart fainted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55647:10"/>
within him;</hi> or (as the <hi>Vulgar</hi> hath it) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
as a man <hi>awaking out of a heavy ſleep,</hi>
without knowing what to think, for he did
not <hi>believe</hi> them; <hi>Quo audito Jacob quaſi de
gravi ſomno evigilans, tamen non credebat eis.</hi>
What then was to be done? They give him
a more particular account of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>words</hi> of
<hi>Joſeph</hi> which he had ſaid to them. And when
this availed as little as the former, they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him the <hi>Wagons</hi> and <hi>rich Preſents</hi> which
<hi>Joſeph</hi> had ſent him; and the Text ſaith,
That when he had <hi>ſeen</hi> them, <hi>cum<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> vidiſſet
plauſtra &amp; univerſa quae miſerat,</hi> his Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
within him, <hi>revixit Spiritus ejus;</hi> and,
as if he were now no more the ſame man,
but another, he ſaid, <hi>It is enough,</hi> I am now
convinc'd that my Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> is yet living;
and ſo, without regarding either the Feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Old Age, or the Difficulties of the
Way, he reſolved to go and ſee him before
he dy'd. Behold here, how much <hi>more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully</hi>
our Affections are mov'd to act by the
things we <hi>ſee,</hi> than by thoſe we only <hi>hear!</hi>
And can we then wonder, if our Deareſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi>
whoſe <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſuggeſted, and <hi>Goodneſs</hi>
prompted him to make uſe of the <hi>moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious</hi>
means to inflame our Affections with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55647:11"/>
the Love of Heaven, led the Diſciples of
my Text up to the top of Mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> and
was there <hi>transfigured before them!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had often <hi>told</hi> them of the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
and propos'd it as a <hi>Reward</hi> to all thoſe
who ſhould <hi>deny</hi> themſelves, and take up their
<hi>Croſs</hi> and follow him. He had foretold them
alſo, that himſelf would <hi>riſe again the third

               <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 43.</note> And
what did all this work upon them? If they
did not look upon it as a <hi>Dream,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
at moſt but as men awakened out of
a deep ſleep; for St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays in expreſs

their Underſtandings from this ſtupidity, and
<hi>engage</hi> their <hi>Wills</hi> to labor heartily for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
The <hi>remedy</hi> was, (and bleſſed be his

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55647:11"/>

<hi>Glory</hi> to his Body, which hitherto he had kept

remained ſo, the <hi>Water</hi> alſo remained as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
But as ſoon as the Sun breake forth out of
the <hi>Cloud, accenſus eſt ignis magnus, ita ut omnes
mirarentur;</hi> a great Fire was preſently kindl'd,
to the wonder &amp; aſtoniſhment of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
it. And will it not be a matter of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Wonder</hi> and <hi>Aſtoniſhment,</hi> if now that the
<hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> after having ſo long remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under a <hi>Cloud,</hi> has diſplay'd the <hi>Beams</hi> of
his <hi>Glory,</hi> both in his <hi>Face</hi> and <hi>Garments,</hi> our
hearts ſhall ſtill remain like <hi>thick Water,</hi> that
is, cold and earthy, and not be converted
into Fire? The conſideration of this made
Holy <hi>David</hi> cry out, <hi>Filii hominem uſquequo
gravi corde?</hi> Ye Sons of men, how long will
you ſuffer your hearts to lie groveling upon
the Earth? And why will you ſpend your
days in hunting after the <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>tranſitory,</hi>
and therefore <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>lying</hi> Goods of this
Life, without aſpiring to thoſe <hi>Eternal,</hi> and
therefore only <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Goods,
which are prepared for you in <hi>Heaven?</hi> If a
<hi>Prize</hi> be propos'd to be run for of any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55647:13"/>
Value, how do thoſe who are to
<hi>run</hi> for it pluck up their Spirits, and <hi>abſtain</hi>
from all things, however otherwiſe pleaſing
and dear to them, that may hinder them in
the <hi>Race?</hi> And if they do this to obtain a
<hi>corruptible</hi> Reward, how much more, as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> preſſes the Argument,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 25. 2 Tim. 2. 5.</note> ought we to
<hi>abſtain</hi> from all thoſe things that are <hi>hurtful,</hi>
and may hinder us in our <hi>Courſe</hi> to <hi>Heaven;</hi>
ſince what we contend for, is no leſs than a
<hi>Crown</hi> of never-fading Glory? They, when
they have done their <hi>beſt,</hi> may <hi>miſs</hi> of what
they <hi>run</hi> for, becauſe <hi>many</hi> run, but only <hi>one</hi>
can get the Prize: But for the <hi>Prize</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
every one (to uſe the Apoſtle's expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
that <hi>runs lawfully,</hi> that is, keeping the
Commandments of God, (tho' not with equal
Swiftneſs and Perfection, for our Savior tells
us, that <hi>in his Father's Houſe there be many Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions)</hi>
is ſure to obtain it.</p>
            <p>Alas, Dear Chriſtians! had it been our
hard Lot to have been born in ſome <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nation,</hi> where there had been <hi>no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
Knowledg of the true <hi>Reward</hi> of <hi>Vertue;</hi>
or to have been brought up among the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
of whom St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> reporteth,
that they had above two hundred different
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55647:13"/>
Opinions concerning the <hi>laſt end</hi> or <hi>Happineſs</hi>
of man, not knowing which to <hi>fix</hi> upon, or
to <hi>prefix</hi> to themſelves, as the <hi>Prize</hi> they
were to <hi>run</hi> for, or the <hi>Mark</hi> to which they
were to direct the <hi>courſe</hi> of their Lives and
Actions: ſome <hi>ſhadow</hi> of <hi>excuſe</hi> might have
been pretended by us, why we pour'd forth
our ſelves upon the things of this World, and
plac'd our ſatisfaction in the enjoyment of
them. But now that we both know the
<hi>Prize</hi> that we are to <hi>run</hi> for, and that if we
run <hi>lawfully,</hi> that is, obſerving the preſcribed
Rule of <hi>God's Law,</hi> we ſhall <hi>certainly</hi> obtain
it; what can we pretend to ſave our ſelves
from falling under the Sentence of <hi>that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
who becauſe he <hi>knew the will of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and did not do it,</hi> was deem'd worthy not
only to be deprived of the <hi>Reward,</hi> but to be
<hi>beaten with many ſtripes?</hi> Let us not deceive our
ſelves, One way or other we muſt be finally
like to <hi>Angels.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 26.</note> What our <hi>Savior</hi> ſaid of the

(and who, ſays St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> would have
believ'd it, if He had not ſaid it?) is as true
of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> that they ſhall be like to the
<hi>Apoſtate Angels</hi> in Hell. No <hi>medium</hi> to be

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:55647:14"/>
or Eternal <hi>Miſery</hi> our <hi>Doom.</hi> This may
ſeem a <hi>hard</hi> condition to the inordinate <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
of this <hi>World,</hi> and perhaps to ſome <hi>faint-hearted
Chriſtians,</hi> who could wiſh to be in
<hi>Heaven,</hi> ſo it might coſt them nothing: But
who ever thought the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
were <hi>hardly</hi> dealt with, becauſe <hi>God,</hi> after he
had led them on dry ground through the
middle of <hi>Jordan,</hi> let the Waters flow in their
ordinary Channel, and hinder their retiring
back, ſo that they were reduc'd to a <hi>neceſſity</hi>
of being either <hi>Conquerors</hi> or <hi>Slaves?</hi> This
<hi>happy neceſſity</hi> whetted their <hi>Courage</hi> to that
degree, that in a ſhort time they became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the <hi>Earthly Canaan,</hi> which was a <hi>Type</hi>
and Figure of the <hi>Heavenly One.</hi> And God
ſeems to make uſe of the ſame <hi>Stratagem</hi> to
encourage us to fight for the Glory of <hi>Heaven,</hi>
when having led us through the Waters of
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> he puts us upon a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our ſelves eternally <hi>happy,</hi> if we will not
be eternally <hi>miſerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then if ſome <hi>difficulties</hi> occur in <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating</hi>
the inordinate deſires of our <hi>corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> What if it coſt ſome
pain and <hi>labor</hi> to mortifie and <hi>repreſs</hi> the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
and extravagant <hi>ſuggeſtions</hi> of our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55647:14"/>
               <hi>appetites?</hi> Is there any thing of <hi>ſatisfaction</hi>
even in this World, (how ſhort and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
ſoever) but coſts pain and trouble to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it? Does not the <hi>Merchant</hi> undertake long
Voyages at Sea, and expoſe his <hi>Riches</hi> to the
<hi>danger</hi> of being loſt, to <hi>augment</hi> them? Does
not the <hi>Soldier</hi> undergo the greateſt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
and enter the <hi>Combat</hi> with manifeſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of his <hi>Life,</hi> to gain the empty Honor of
a <hi>Triumph?</hi> Does not the <hi>ſick</hi> perſon abſtain
from all things which the Phyſician com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
him, and ſwallow many a <hi>bitter</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to recover his <hi>Health,</hi> which may be
<hi>loſt</hi> again, as ſoon as re-eſtabliſhed? And if
the <hi>tranſitory things</hi> of this World are not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
without much toil and labor (which
when they are gotten are upon the brink of
being loſt) can we expect that <hi>Heaven</hi> alone
ſhould be caſt upon us without any pains or
labor on our part to obtain it? Surely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more <hi>unjuſt,</hi> nor more unworthy
a Creature endued with <hi>Reaſon,</hi> than this <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal</hi>
Proceeding. Nor can I imagin any
other cauſe of it, but the want of true Faith,
or a ſupine neglect to render it <hi>lively</hi> by fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a <hi>right Judgment</hi> of the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the
Glory of the <hi>next Life</hi> in compariſon of <hi>this?</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55647:15"/>
Did we do this, it were impoſſible we ſhould
not ardently deſire, and heartily labor for it;
and inſtead of repining at the pains we are to
take for it, wonder, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did, that ſo
<hi>great</hi> a <hi>Reward</hi> ſhould be expos'd for ſo <hi>little</hi>
Labor.<note place="margin">In Pſ. 36.</note> 
               <hi>Miraberis tantum dari pro tantillo labore:</hi>
It were but juſt, ſays he, that <hi>Eternal Labor</hi>
ſhould be exacted of us for the obtaining of
<hi>Eternal Reſt; Pro aeterna requie, aeternus labor
ſubeundus erat.</hi> But becauſe then the <hi>Reward</hi>
could never be obtain'd, becauſe the <hi>Labor</hi>
would never be at an <hi>end,</hi> God has been ſo
gracious as to order, that it ſhall not only be
<hi>temporal,</hi> but <hi>ſhort. Non ſolum temporalem vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit
laborem tuum Deus, ſed brevem.</hi> And I
may add, not only <hi>ſhort,</hi> but <hi>momentary:</hi> For
if this <hi>Globe</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi> on which we live, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with the vaſt <hi>Extenſion</hi> of the <hi>Heavens,</hi>
bears no greater a proportion than that of a

days</hi> we have to live upon this <hi>Point,</hi> be, in
compariſon of <hi>Eternity,</hi> but a <hi>Moment?</hi> And
yet how much of this <hi>Moment</hi> do we daily
pare off, and ſquander away upon the <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of the <hi>World,</hi> as if a <hi>whole Moment</hi> of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi>
were too much for an <hi>Eternity</hi> of <hi>Glory?</hi>
Whatever our Conduct hath been hitherto,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55647:15"/>
let us not henceforward be ſo <hi>ungrateful</hi> to
the <hi>Riches</hi> of God's Goodneſs, and ſo <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous</hi>
to our own <hi>true</hi> Intereſt, as not to
employ the <hi>remainder</hi> of it at leaſt in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a Pious and Holy Life, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
of ſo Great and <hi>Glorious</hi> a <hi>Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, and ſum up in brief what I
have diſcourſed in this Part, that, like good
Seed laid up in your hearts, it may bring forth
Fruit with Patience: God has allotted to
man <hi>two Lives,</hi> the <hi>One</hi> in <hi>this World,</hi> ſhort,
and ſubject to many <hi>miſeries;</hi> the <hi>Other Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>
in the <hi>next,</hi> and to thoſe who <hi>live well</hi>
free from all Miſery, and repleniſhed with
<hi>all</hi> kind of <hi>Goods.</hi> This ſuppoſed, nothing
can be more evident, than that the <hi>latter</hi> is
infinitly and without compariſon to be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred</hi>
before the <hi>former.</hi> What then can we
conclude from theſe <hi>premiſſes,</hi> unleſs we will
renounce our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as well as our <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
but a ſtrong Reſolution to ſet our ſelves
<hi>ſeriouſly</hi> to work, and not ſuffer any day, or
hour, or moment of our Life to <hi>ſlide</hi> away,
without making an advance towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of ſo <hi>great a Good?</hi> What was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
on Mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> tho' Great and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
as you have heard in the Firſt Part,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55647:16"/>
was but a <hi>Glimpſe</hi> or Reflection of that <hi>Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Glory,</hi> which the <hi>Bleſſed</hi> ſhall enjoy in
<hi>Heaven.</hi> If then the <hi>Labor</hi> of acquiring it
deters us, let the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of the <hi>Reward</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
us; ſo <hi>Great,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Neither
eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard, nor hath it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the heart of man to conceive the good things
which God hath prepared for thoſe that love him.</hi>
May his Infinit Mercy bring us to that <hi>happy</hi>
Station, where we may behold him, <hi>as he is,
face to face,</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> what here we
cannot <hi>comprehend.</hi> In the mean time, let us
ſay from our hearts with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.
