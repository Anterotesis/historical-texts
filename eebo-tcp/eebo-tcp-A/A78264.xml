         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE Of the <hi>OWNERS</hi> of more than Sixty Thouſand Acres of Rich and Valuable <hi>LANDS,</hi> Bordering upon the <hi>FENNS,</hi> called, BEDFORD-LEVEL:</head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THAT the Lands of the ſeveral Petitioners, and their Anceſtors in all times paſt, have been defended by Sufficient Banks, and the Waters deſcending upon the ſame, have been carried off by Large and ample <hi>DRAINS</hi> and <hi>OUTFALLS</hi> into the River of <hi>GREAT-OWZE,</hi> and can have no other way for Paſſage of thoſe Waters to Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT</hi> by means of a <hi>DAM</hi> and <hi>SL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ICE,</hi> ſet upon the ſaid <hi>River</hi> of <hi>OWZE,</hi> by the Corporation of Adventurers, on Pretence of Draining the South part of the ſaid <hi>LEVEL.</hi> The antient Flow and Courſe of the Waters, in the ſaid River, being Stopped and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. The bottom of the ſaid River <hi>OWZE,</hi> is become ſo Raiſed and Silted up, that all the ſaid Drains and Outfalls, are intirely Choaked and ſtopped up, and can never be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered without Reducing the ſaid River to its former Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT</hi> beſides the Loſs of thoſe Drains by the Occaſion aforeſaid, the Waters of the ſaid <hi>FENNS</hi> by other Works of the ſaid Adventurers are let in, and ſuffered to run through many of the Petitioner's Lands, under Pretence of being conveyed by thoſe Works, to Newer <hi>OUTFALLS</hi> made by them into the ſaid River <hi>OWZE;</hi> which <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TFALLS</hi> of the ſaid Adventurers are in like manner Choaked and Stopped up, ſo as the Waters intended to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, as aforeſaid by overflowing or ſoaking through the Adventurer's Bank and Works, have for divers years paſt overflown and drowned many thouſands of Acres of the ſaid Lands, which are become Receptacles for the ſaid <hi>FENN</hi> Waters, and of no uſe to the Petitioners, to their ineſtimable Damage, and the utter Ruin of many Families, Widows, and Orphans.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT</hi> the Lands already, and which for divers years paſt have been thus Drowned and Annoyed, are as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Town hips of <hi>Downeham Stow-Bardolf</hi> and parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning on the Eaſt-ſide of the ſaid River <hi>OWZE</hi> 1800 Acres.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Townſhips on the Weſt-ſide the ſaid River <hi>OWZE</hi> 6000 Acres.</p>
            <p>In the Hundred of <hi>Marſhland,</hi> and Towns of <hi>Wiggen-Hall,</hi> and parts adjoyning 20000 Acres, beſides the loſs of their Roads and Highways, which are become Impaſſable; and the Miſchiefs and Damages ſtill daily Increaſing: And beſide, the imminent Danger they at preſent lie under, of a total and general Drowning and Deſtruction by the ſaid <hi>FENN Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT the Lands pretended to be Drained by the ſaid <hi>Dam</hi> and <hi>Sluice</hi> are but a Part of the ſaid <hi>LEVEL,</hi> and generally the worſt Lands, the Inheritance of divers thouſands of Acres thereof, being yearly ſold for leſs than 4 <hi>d. per</hi> Acre, and other Parts for like inconſiderable Rates.</p>
            <p>THE Petitioner's ſaid Lands were before theſe Miſchiefs, generally VVorth, to be Lett, one with another, from 10 to 20 <hi>s. per</hi> Acre <hi>per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT notwithſtanding many Complaints and Applications to the Corporation of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, who are by the late Statute of 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. made ſole Commiſſioners of <hi>SEWERS</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſaid <hi>LEVEL,</hi> and ſo far as their VVorks extend, and all other Commiſſioners excluded, there being no Appeal, but to themſelves againſt their own Acts, Defaults, and Injuries, the Petitioners could never obtain any Relief.</p>
            <p>THEY therefore humbly Pray, That the ſaid <hi>DAM</hi> and <hi>SL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ICE</hi> may be removed; the ſaid <hi>FENN Waters</hi> reſtrained, and their Lands for the future preſerved according to the ſeveral Complaints and Caſes in their reſpective Petitions appearing.</p>
