            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. The Occasion and Subject of this Treatise.</head>
            <p>IF the Disciplinarians in <hi>Scotland</hi> could rest contented to dote <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> upon their own inventions, and magnifie at home that <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> which themselves have canonized, I should leave them to the best School-Mistris, that is Experience, to feel where their shoe wrings them, and to purchase Repentance. What have I to do with the regulation of forreign Churches to burn mine own fingers with snuffing other mens Candles? Let them stand or fall to their own Master: It is charity to judge well of others, and piety to look well to our selves.</p>
            <p>But to see those very men who plead to vehemently against all kinds of tyranny, attempt to obtrude their own dreames not only upon their fellow-Subjects, but upon their Sovereigne himself, contrary to the dictates of his own conscience, contrary to all Laws of God and Man, yea to compell forreigne Churches to dance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ope). This put us upon the defensive part, They must not think
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45970:4"/>
that other men are so cowed or grown so tame, as to stand still blowing of their noses, whilst they bridle them and ride them at their pleasure. It is time to let the world see that this Discipline which they so much adore, is the very quintessence of refined Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or a greater Tyranny than ever <hi>Rome</hi> brought forth, inconsistent with all forms of civil Governement, destructive to all sorts of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, a ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k to the conscience, the heaviest pressure that can fall upon a people, and so much more dangerous, because by the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence of Divine Institution, it takes away the sight, but not the burden of slavery. Have patience Reader, and I shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto thee more pride and arrogancy through the holes of a thred-bare coat, then was ever found under a Cardinals Cap or a tripple-Crown. All this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I undertake to demonstrate, not by some extraordinary practices justified only by the pretence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible necessity, (a weak patrociny for generall Doctrine,) not by the single opinions of some Capricious fellows, but by their books of Discipline, by the acts of their generall and provinciall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, but the concurrent votes and writings of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.</p>
            <p>I foresee that they will suggest that through their sides I seek to wound forreigne Churches. No, there is nothing which I shall convict them of here, but I hope will be disavowed, though not by all Protestant auctours, yet by all the Protestant Churches in the world. But I must take leave to demand of our Disciplinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">Syn. Gen. 1647. Declar. Parl. 1648. &amp;c.</note> who it is they brand with the odious name of Erastians, in the Acts of their Parliaments and Assemblies, and in the Writings of their Commissioners, and reckon them with Papists, Anabaptists, and Independents; Is it those Churches, who disarme their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries of the Sword of Excommunication, which they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to weeld? so did <hi>Erastus</hi>; or is it those who attribute a much greater power to the Christian Magistrate, in the managery of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall affairs than themselves? So did <hi>Erastus,</hi> and so do all Protestant Churches. The Disciplinarians will sooner endure a Bishop or a Superintendent to govern them, than the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. And when the Magistrate shall be rightly informed, what a dangerous edg'd tool their Discipline is, he will ten times sooner admit of a moderate Episcopacy, then fall into the hands of such hucksters.</p>
            <p>If it were not for this Disciplinarian humour, which will admit
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45970:4"/>
so latitude in Religion, but makes each nicity a fundamental, and every private opinion an Article of faith, which prefers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar errours before generall truths. I doubt not but all reformed Churches might easily be reconciled. Before these unhappy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in <hi>England,</hi> all Protestants both Lutherans and Calvinists did give unto the English Church the right hand of fellowship; the <hi>Disciplinarians</hi> themselves, though they preferred their own Church as more pure, (else they were hard-hearted) yet they did not, they durst not condemne the Church of <hi>England,</hi> either as defective in any necessary point of Christian Piety, or redundant in any thing that might virtually or by consequence overthrow the foundation.</p>

They themselves were then far from a party, or from making the calling of Bishops to be Antichristian.</p>
            <p>But to leave these velitations and come home to the point. I will shew first how this Discipline entrencheth most extreamly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right of the civill Magistrate, secondly that it is as grievous and intollerable to the Subject.</p>

            <p>You see sufficiently in point of practice how the Disciplinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have trampled upon the Laws, and justled the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate out of his Supremacy in Ecclesiasticall Affaires.

            <p>First, They teach that no persons, Magistrates nor others, have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> power <hi>to Vote in their Synods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Book disc. Chap. 7.</note>

And if any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate do arrogate so much to himself, the Church shall have cause to complain and exclaime, that the Pope is changed, but the Papacy remains.</hi> So if Kings and Magistrates stand in their way, they are Political Popes, as well as Bishops are Ecclesiasticall.

            <p>Now we have seen the pernicious practices of their Synods, with the Doctrines from which they flow; it remains to dispel umbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wherewith they seek to hide the ugliness of their proceedings and principles from the eyes of the world. We (say they) do give the Christian Magistrate a politicall Power to convocate Synods, to preside in Synods, to ratifie the Acts of Synods, to reform the Church. We make him the keeper of both Tables. Take nothing and hold it fast, here are good words, but they signifie nothing. Trust me whatsoever the Disciplinarians do give to the Magistrate, it is alwayes with a saving of their own stakes, not giving for his advantage, but their own. For they teach that this power of the Christian Magistrate is not private and destructive to the power of the Church but cumulative,<note place="margin">Theor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </note> and onely auxiliary or assisting.</p>
            <p>Besides the power which they call abusively authoritative, but is indeed ministeriall, of executing their decrees, and contributing to their settlement, they ascribe to the Magistrate concerning the Acts of Synods that which every private man hath, a judgement of <hi>

               </gap> influence of his politicall power, where they would have him exercise it, they will either teach him another point of Popery, that is an implicite faith, or he may perchance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

great Grandmother did all to their cost.</p>
            <p>Then in plain English, what is this politicall Power to call Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods to preside in Synods, and to ratifie Synods, which these good men give to the Magistrate, and magnifie so much? I shall tell the truth.
<q>It is a duty which the Magistrate ows to the Kirk, when they think necessary to have a Synod convocated, to strengthen their summons by a civill Sanction,<note place="margin">Theor. 50, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>1.</note> to secure them in coming to the Synod, and returning from the Synod, to provide them good accommodation, to protect them from dangers, to defend their Rights and Priviledges. To compel obstinate persons by civill Laws and punishments, to submit to their censures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</q> What gets the Magistrate by all this to himself? He may put it all in his eye,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and see never a whit the worse.
<q>For they declare expresly, that neither all the power, nor any part of the power, which Synods have to deliberate of, or to define Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall things, (though it be in relation to their own Subjects) doth flow from the Magistrate, but because in those things which belong to the outward man, (mark the reason) the Church stands in need of the help of the Magistrate.</q> Fair fall a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ingenuous confession, they attribute nothing to the Magistrate, but only what may render him able to serve their own turns, and supply their needs. I wish these men would think a little more of the distinction, between <hi>habituall</hi> and <hi>actuall</hi> Jurisdiction. After a School-master hath his License to teach, yet his actuall Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth proceed from the Parents of his Scholars. And though he enjoy a kind of Supremacy among them, he must not think that this extinguisheth, either his own filiall duty, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> theirs.</p>
            <p>Like this power of presiding politically in Synods is the other power which they give him of reforming the Church, that is when the State of the Church is corrupted, but not when it is pure, as they take it for granted, that it is, when the Jurisdiction is in their own hands.

When Sovereigns are made but accessaries, and inferiours do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come principals, when stronger obligations are devised, than those of a Subject to his Sovereign, it is time for the Magistrate to look to himself, these are prognosticks of insuing storms, the avant curriers of seditious tumults.

Neither stayed they here, but pursued the Magistrates with the censures of the Church, for not observing the Fast by them proclaimed; and with much difficulty were wrought to abstaine from Excommunicating of them; which censure, how heavy it falls in <hi>Scotland,</hi> you shall see by and by. To come yet neerer, the late Parliament in <hi>Scotland</hi> injoyned men to take up Armes for delivery of their King out of prison; The Commissioners for the Assembly disallowed it; and at this present how many are chased out of their Country? How many are put to publike repentance in sackcloth? how many are excommunicated, for being obedient to the Supreme Judicatory of the Kingdom, that is, King and Parliament? Miserable is the condition of that people where there is such clashing and interfereing of Supreme Judicatories and Authorities. If they shall pretend that this was no free Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament: First, they affirm that which is not true; either that Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament was free, or what will become of the rest?

            <p>FRom the Essentiall body of the Kingdom we are to proceed to the representative body, which is the Parliament. We have already seen, how it attributes a power to Nationall Synods to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain Parliaments, and to abrogate their Acts, if they shall judge them prejudiciall to the Church. We need no other instance, to shew what small account Presbyteries do make of Parliaments, then the late Parliament in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Not withstanding that the Parliament had declared their resolution <hi>to levy forces vigorously, and that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For by their power over the Church-men, and by their influence upon the people, and by threatening all those who engaged in that action with the censures of the Church, they retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Levies, they deterred all preachers from accompanying the Army to do divine offices. And when Saint <hi>Peters</hi> keyes would not serve the turn, they made use of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> sword, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the countrey together in arms at <hi>Machleene-Moore</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the expedition.</p>
            <p>So if the high court of Parliament will set up <hi>Persbytery,</hi> they must resolve to introduce an higher court then themselves, which will overtop them for eminency of authority, for extent of power, and greatnesse of priviledges, that is, a Nationall Synod.</p>
            <p>First for authority, the one being acknowledged to be but an humain convention, the other affirmed confidently to be a divine institution. The one sitting by vertue of the Kings writ, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by vertue of Gods writ. The one as Councellers of the Prince, the other as Ambassadours and Vicars of the Sonne of God. The one as Burgesses of Corporations, the other as Commissioners of Jesus Christ. The one judging by the law of the land, the other by the holy Scriptures. The one taking care for this temporall life, the other for eternall life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:45970:18"/>Secondly for power, as <hi>Curtius</hi> saith, <hi>ubi multitudo vana religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one capta <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pardon us O Magistrate, thou threatenst us with prison, they threaten us with hell fire. Thy sentence deprives us of civill protection, and the benefit of the law, so doth theirs indirectly, and withall makes us strangers to the common-wealth of Israel. Thou canst out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law us, or horn us, and confiscate our estates, their keyes do the same also by consequence, and moreover deprive us of the prayers of the Church, and the comfortable use of the blessed Sacrament. Thou canst deliver us to a Pursevant, or commit us to the Black Rod, they can deliver us over to Sathan, and commit us to the prince of darknesse.</p>
            <p>Thirdly for priviledges, the priviledges of Parliament extend not to treason, felony, or breach of peace, but they may talke treaso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They may not onely break the peace, but convocate the Subjects in armes, yea give warrant to a particular person, to conveen them by his letters missives, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his discretion, <hi>in order to religion.</hi> Of all which we have seen instances in this discourse. The priviledges of Parliaments are the Graces and Concessions of man, and may be taken away by humane Authority, but the priviledges of Synods they say are from God, and cannot without Sacriledge be taken away by mortall man.

            <p>Secondly this discipline is oppressive in greater faults.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45970:20"/>
Law hath been, that a Judge was rarely permitted to ride a circuit in his owne countrey, least private interest or respects might make him partiall. Yet a Country is much larger than a Parish, and a grave learned Judge is presumed to have more temper than such homebred fellowes. Thus we see what a <hi>Pandoras</hi> box this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended holy Discipline is, full of manifold mischiefes, and to all orders of men most pernicious.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="13" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XIII. That the Covenant to introduce this Discipline is void and wicked, with a short Conclusion.</head>
            <p>BUt yet the conscience of an Oath sticks deep. Some will plead, that they have made a Covenant with God, for the introduction of this Disciplne. Oaths and Vowes ought to be made with great judgement and broken with greater. My next task therefore must be to demonstrate this clearly, that this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is not binding, but meerly void, and not onely void but wicked; so as it is necessary to break it, and impious to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it.</p>
            <p>The first thing that cracks the credit of this new Covenant is, that it was devised by strangers, to the dishonour of our Nation, imposed by Subjects, who wanted requisite power upon their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varaign and fellow-subjects, extorted by just feare of unjust suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. So as I may truly say of many who took this Covenant, that they sinned in pronouncing the words with their lips, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver consented with their hearts to make any vow to God.</p>
            <p>Again, errour and deceite make those things voluntary to which they are incident, espcially when the errour is not meerly negative by way of conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lement of truth, when a man knowes not what he doth, but positive, when he beleeves he doth one thing, and doth the clean contray, and that not about some inconsiderable accidents, but about the substantiall conditions. As if a Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, either out of ignorance or malice, should give his Patient a deadly poyson under the name of a cordiall, and bind him by a solemn oath to take it, the Oath is void, necessary to be broken, unlawfull to be k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pt; if the patient had known the truth, that it was no cordiall, that it was poyson, he would not have sworn to take it: Such an errour there is in the Covenant with a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45970:21"/>
witnesse, to gull men with a strange, unknown, lately devised platforme of Discipline, most pernicious to the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as if it were the very institution of Christ, of high advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the King and Kingdome, to gull them with that Covenant which King <hi>Iames</hi> did sometimes take, as if that and this were all one, whereas that Covenant issued out by the Kings Authority, this Covenant without his Authority, against his Authority; that Covenant was for the Lawes of the Realm, this is against the Lawes of the Realm; that was to maintain the Religion esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, this to overthrow the Religion established: But because I will not ground my Discourse upon any thing that is disputable, either in matter of <hi>Right,</hi> or <hi>Fact</hi>; And in truth, because I have no need of them, I forgive them these advantages, onely with this gentle <hi>memento,</hi> That when other forraign Churches, and the Church of <hi>Soctland</hi> it selfe (as appeares by their publike Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy used in those dayes) did sue for aid and assistance from the Crown and Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> they did not go about to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude their owne Discipline upon them, but left them free to choose for themselves.</p>
            <p>The grounds which follow are demonstrative; First, no man can dispose that by vow, or otherwise, either to God or man, which is the right of a third person without his consent: Neither can the inferiour oblige himself to the prejudice of his Superiour, contrary to his duty, without his Superiours allowance: God accepts no such pretences, to seem obsequious to him, out of the undoubted right of another person. Now the power of Armes, and the defence of the Lawes, and portecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Subjects by those Armes, is by the Law of <hi>England</hi> clearly invested in the Crowne. And where the King is bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to protect, the Subject is bound in conscience to assist. Therefore every English Subject owes his Armes and his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his King, and cannot dispose them as a free gift of his owne; nor by any act of his whatsoever diminish his Soveraignes right over him, but in those things wherein by Law he owes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his Prince, he remaineth still obliged, notwithstanding any Vow or Covenant to the contrary; especially when the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and scope of the Covenant is against the konwn Lawes of the Realm. So as without all manner of doubt, no Divine or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45970:21"/>
Learned Casuist in the world dissenting: This Covenant is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther void in it self, or at least voided by his Majesties Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, prohibiting the taking of it, and nullifying its obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is confessed by all men that, that an Oath ought not to be the bound of iniquity, nor doth oblige a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressour. The golden rule is, <hi>in malis pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>missis rescinde fidem, in turpi voto muta decretum,</hi> To observe a wicked engagement doubles the sinne: Nothing can be the matter of a Vow or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which is evidently unlawfull. But it is evidently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for a Subject or Subjects to alter the Lawes established by force, without the concurrence, and against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Supreme Legislator, for the introduction of a forraign Discipline. This is the very matter and subject of the Covenant. Subjects vow to God, and swear one to another to change the Lawes of the Realm, to abolish the Discipline of the Church, and the Liturgy lawfully established, by the Sword, (which was never committed to their hands by God or man,) without the King, against the King, which no man can deny in earnest to be plain rebel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion. And it is yet the worse, that it is to the main prejudice of a third order of the Kingdom, the taking away whose rights without their consents, without making them satisfaction, cannot be justified in point of conscience, (Yea though it were for the greater convenience of the Kingdom, as is most falsely pretended,) And is harder measure than the Abbots and Friers received from <hi>Hanry</hi> the eight, or than either Christians or Turkes do offer to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered enemies.</p>
            <p>Lastly a supervenient oath or covenant either with God or man, cannot take away the obligation of a just oath precedent. But such is the Covenant, a subsequent oath, inconsistent with, and destuructive to a precedent oath, that is the oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, which all the Church-men throughout the Kingdome, all the Parliament men at their admission to the house, all persons of quality throughout <hi>England</hi> have taken. The former oath acknowledgeth the King to be the <hi>onely supreame</hi> head, (that is civill head to see that every man do his duty in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,) and Governour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45970:22"/>
aoth or covenant, to set up the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Gouernment as it is in <hi>Scotland,</hi> denieth all this virtually, maks it a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall papacy, acknowledgeth no governors but onely the <hi>Presbyters.</hi> The former oath gives the King the supream power over all persons, in all causes, The second oath gives him a power over all persons, (as they are subjects,) but none at all in Ecclesiasticall causes, This they make to be sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>By all which it is most apparent, that this Covenant was neither free nor deliberate, nor valide. nor lawfull, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with our former oathes, but inforced, deceitfull, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid, impious, rebellious, and contradictory to our former ingagements, and consequently obligeth no man to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, but all men to repentance. For the greater certainty whereof I appeale, upon this stating of the case, to all the learned Casuists and Divines in <hi>Europe,</hi> touching the point of common right; And that this is the true state of the case, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to our adversaries themselves. No man that hath any spark of ingenuity will denie it. No English-man who hath any tolerable degree of judgement, or knowledge in the laws of his countrey, can denie it, but at the same instant his conscience must give him the lie.</p>
            <p>They who plead for this rebellion, dare not put it to a triall at law, they doe not ground their defence upon the lawes, but either upon their own groundlesse jealosie and fears, of the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to introduce Popery, to subvert the lawes, and to ensla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the people. This is to run into a certain crime, for fear of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
            <p>They who intend to pick quarrels, know how to feign suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions. Or they ground it upon the succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sse of their arms, or upon the Soveraigne right of the people, over all lawes and Magistrates, whose Representatives they create themselves, whilest the poor people sigh in corners, and dare not say their soul is their own, lamenting their former folly, to have contributed so much to their own undoing.</p>
            <p>Or lastly upon Religion, the cause of God, the worst plea of all the rest, to make God accessary to their treasons, murthers, covetousnesse, ambition. Christ did never authorise Subjects to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45970:22"/>
plant Christian Religion, much lesse their own fancticall dreames, or fantasticall devises, in the blood of their Soveraigne, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low subjects.</p>
            <p>Speak out, is it lawfull for Subjects to take up arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Prince meerly for Religion? or is it not lawfull? If ye say it is not lawfull, ye condemn your selves, for your Covenant testifieth to the world, that ye have taken up armes, meerly to alter Religion, and that ye bear no Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to your King, but onely in order to Religion, that is in plain terms, to to your own humours and conceits. If ye say it is lawfull, ye justifie the Independents in <hi>England,</hi> for supplanting your selves, ye justifie the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> and his cure. Ye break down the banks of Order, and make way for an inundation of bloud and confusion in all Countreys. Ye render your selves justly odious to all Christian Magistrates, when they see, that they owe their safety not to your good wills, but to your weaknesse, that ye want sufficient strength to cut their throats. This is fine doctrine for <hi>Europe,</hi> wherein there is scarce that King or State, which hath not Subjects of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinions and communions in Religion. Or lastly if ye say, it is lawfull for you to plant that which ye apprehend to be true Religion, by force of arms, but it is not lawfull for others to plant that which they apprehend to be true Religion by force, because yours is the Gospel, theirs is not. <hi>Ye beg the question,</hi> and make your selves ridiculously partiall by your overweening opinion, worse than that of the men of <hi>China,</hi> as if yee onely had two eyes, and all the rest of the world were stark blind. There is more hope of a fool, then of him that is wise in his own eyes.</p>
            <p>I would to God we might be so happy as to see a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell of Christians, at least a Generall Synod of all Protestants, and that the first Act might be to denounce an <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> against all brochers and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of seditious principles, to take away the scandall which lyes upon Christian Religion, and to shew that in the search of piety, we have not lost the principles of humanity.
