            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY deſign in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe is to Treat of the Hereditary Tranſmiſſion of Lands from Anceſtor to Heir, and the certainty thereof, and what growth this Doctrine has had in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58630:5"/>Succeſſion of time, till it arrived to the State and Prefection which now it hath.</p>
            <p>And touching Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Tranſmiſſion, or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion commonly with us called Deſcents, I ſhall hold this Order in my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt,</hi> To give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count touching the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Laws, both <hi>Jewiſh, Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> concerning this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> To obſerve ſome things, wherein it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, how the particular Cuſtoms, or Municipal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58630:5"/>Laws of other Countries, varied from thoſe other Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> To give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Rules and Laws of Deſcents, or Hereditary Tranſmiſſions as they ſtood, and at this day ſtand in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with the ſucceſſive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, that proceſs of time, and the wiſdom of our Anceſtors, and Cuſtoms grown up, tacitely, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually and ſucceſſively, have made therein.</p>
            <p>And firſt touching the Succeſſion or Deſcent of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, as alſo of Goods, among the <hi>Jews,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58630:6"/>in his Book <hi>De Succeſſionibus apud Hebraeos,</hi> hath given us an excellent account, as well out of the holy Text, as out of the <hi>Comments</hi> of <hi>Rabbins,</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh Lawyers,</hi> which I briefly compriſe, in the 5, 6, 7, 12 and 13 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that Book, the ſum whereof, for ſo much as concerns my purpoſe, is this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in the deſcending Line, the Deſcent or Succeſſion, was unto all the Sons, only the eldeſt had a double Portion, (<hi>viz.</hi>) If there were three Sons, the eldeſt had two fourths,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58630:6"/>and each other Son one fourth part.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Nephew, or Son of the Son, dying in the Fathers Life, and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the partition of his Father, as if his Father had been in Poſſeſſion of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Daughter did not ſucceed in the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Father, as long as there was Sons, or Deſcendants from the. But if one Son had died in the life of his Father, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Daughters and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58630:7"/>without Sons, his Daughters ſucceeded in his part, as if he had been Poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In caſe there were no Sons but Daughters, the Daughters equally ſucceeded their Father without any <hi>prelation</hi> of the eldeſt, to two parts, or a double Portion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But if the Son had an Inheritance, and died without Iſſue, having a Father, and Brothers, the Inheritance of the Son deſcended, not to his Brothers unleſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58630:7"/>in caſe of the next Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taking to Wife the deceaſed's Wife, to raiſe Children for the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceaſed, but in ſuch caſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inherited his Son entirely.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But if the Father were dead, it came to the Brothers, as it were as Heirs to the Father, in the ſame manner, as if the Inheritance had been actually poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by him; and therefore, the Fathers other Sons, and their Deſcendants <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> ſucceeded, but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58630:8"/>yet equally, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any double Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the eldeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (though in truth the Brothers ſucceeded as it were in Right of Repreſentation from the Father; yet) the Father dying before his Son, the Deſcent was <hi>de facto,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Brother, where the Law gave not a double Portion; and in caſe the Father had no Sons, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants from them, then it deſcended to all the Siſters.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:58630:8"/>
            <p n="7">7. If the Son died without Iſſue, and his Father or any Deſcendants from him were extant, it went not to the Grandfather, or his other Deſcendants. But if the Father were dead without Iſſue, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and if he were dead, then to his Sons and their Deſcendants, and for want of them, then to his Daughters or their Deſcendants, as if the Grandfather him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been actually poſſeſſed, and had died. And ſo, <hi>mutatis mutan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:58630:9"/>to the <hi>Proavus, Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus, Atavus, &amp;c.</hi> But the Inheritance of the Son, never retorted to the Mother, or to any of her Anceſtors, but ſhe and they were totally excluded.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The double Portion that was therefore <hi>jus pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenituroe</hi> never took place, but in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that was the <hi>Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitus</hi> of him, from whom the Inheritance immediately deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or in him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented him. If <hi>A.</hi> had two Sons, <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> the eldeſt, had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58630:9"/>two Sons, <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> and died, <hi>B.</hi> ſhould have had a double Portion, (<hi>viz.</hi>) two thirds and <hi>C.</hi> only one third. And if <hi>B.</hi> had died in the life time of <hi>A.</hi> and then <hi>A.</hi> died, <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> ſhould have had the two thirds, or double Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which had belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>B.</hi> if he had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived his Father, and this double Portion ſhould have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> thus, <hi>viz. D.</hi> ſhould have had two thirds of the two thirds that came to them, and <hi>E.</hi> the other third part thereof.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:58630:10"/>
            <p>Among the <hi>Graecians,</hi> the Laws of Deſcents, in ſome ſort, reſembled thoſe of the <hi>Jews.</hi> In ſome things they differed <hi>Vide Petyts Leges Atticae, Tit. 6. De Teſtamentis &amp; Haereditario Jure,</hi> where the Text of their Law runs thus, <hi>Omnes Legitimi Filii Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditatem Paternam ex aequo inter ſe Haeriſcunto. Siquis inteſtatus moritur, relictis fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abus, qui eas in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xores du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Haeredes ſunto.

Superſtite legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima Filia, Nothus hoeredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Patris ne adito.</hi> This Law is very obſcure, but the Sence ſeems to be briefly this, That all the Sons equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inherit the Father; but if he have no Sons, then
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58630:11"/>the Husbands of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; if he have no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then his Brothers, and his Brothers Children; and if none, then his next Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the part of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, preferring the Males before the Females; and if none of the Fathers Line, <hi>ad ſobrinorum uſque Filios,</hi> then to deſcend to the Mothers Line. <hi>Vide Petyt's Gloſſ. in hanc Legem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Romans</hi> it appears, that the Laws of Succeſſion did ſucceſſively vary, for the Laws of the Twelve Tables excluded the Females from Inheriting,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58630:11"/>and had many other ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which were ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively remedied by <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and after him by <hi>Hadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, in Senatus-conſulto Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulliano,</hi> and after him by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> in the third Book of his Inſtitutes, <hi>De Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatibus quoe ab inteſtato de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feruntur,</hi> and the two enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Titles.

            <p>The Deſcents, or Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from any Perſon, are of three Kinds, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Deſcending.</item>
                  <item>2. Aſcending.</item>
                  <item>3. Collateral, <hi>viz. In Agnatos à Parte Patris, in Cognatos à Parte Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58630:12"/>
            <p>1<hi>ſt,</hi> In the deſcending Line, theſe Rules are directed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The deſcending Line, whether Male or Female, whether immediately or remote, takes place, and prevents the Deſcent or Succeſſion Aſcending, or Collateral, <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The remote Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of the Deſcending Line, ſucceed <hi>in Stirpem,</hi> That is, to ſucceed into that right, which his Parents ſhould have had.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this Deſcent or Succeſſion is equal in all the Deſcendants, without
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58630:13"/>preference of the Male be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Female. So that, if the Common Anceſtor had three Sons and three Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, each had a ſixth part, and if one died in the life of the Father, having three Sons and three <hi>Daughters,</hi> that ſixth part, that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Perſon dead, ſhould have been equally divided, between his or her ſix Children, and ſo <hi>in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,</hi> in the Deſcending Line.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> In the Aſcending Line, there are theſe Rules.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:58630:13"/>
            <p n="1">1. If the Son die without Iſſue, or any Deſcending from him, leaving a Father and Mother, both of them ſhall equally ſucceed to the Son, and prevent all others of the Collateral Line, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Brothers and Siſters, as ſhall be ſaid, or if only a Father, or only a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he or ſhe alone ſhall ſucceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> But if the deceaſed had a Father, Mother, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Siſter, <hi>ex utriuſque parentibus conjuncti;</hi> they ſhall all equally ſucceed the Son, by equal parts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preference of the Male.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:58630:14"/>
            <p n="3">3. In the Collateral Line.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Deſcendant die without Father, Mother, Son or Daughter, or any Deſcending from them in the right Deſcending Line, the Brothers and Siſters <hi>ex utriuſque Parentibus conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti,</hi> and the immediate Children of them, ſhall ſucceed equally, without<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of either Sex, and the Children from them, ſhall ſucceed <hi>in Stirpes.</hi> As if there be a Brother and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and the Siſter dies in the Life of the Deſcendant, leaving one or more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. All ſuch Children ſhall ſucceed in the moiety,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58630:14"/>that ſhould have come to their deceaſed Mother, had ſhe ſurvived.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if there be no Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Siſters, <hi>ex utriuſque Parentibus conjuncti;</hi> nor any of their immediate Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then the Brothers and Siſters of the Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood, and their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Children, ſucceed <hi>in Stirpes,</hi> to the deceaſed, without any Prerogative to the Male.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But if there be no Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Siſters of the whole, or half-blood, nor any of their immediate Children, (for their Grand-Children
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58630:15"/>are not provided for by Law) then the next Kindred are called to the Inheritance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But if the next be in equal degree, whether on the part of the Father, as <hi>Agnati;</hi> or on the part of the Mother, as <hi>Cognati,</hi> then they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually called to the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and equally ſucceed <hi>in Capita,</hi> and not <hi>in Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far of theſe ſettled Laws of the <hi>Jews, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> But the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or Municipal Laws, and Cuſtoms of almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Country, derogate from theſe Laws, and direct
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58630:15"/>Succeſſions in a much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent way.</p>
            <p>For inſtance, By the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of <hi>Lombardy</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which, the Rule of the Feuds, both in their Deſcents, and other things, are much directed) their Deſcents are in a much different manner. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Feud. Tit.</hi> 1. If a Feud be granted to one Brother, who dies without Iſſue, it Deſcends not to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther', unleſs eſpecially ſo provided in the firſt Infeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. —If the Donee dies, having Iſſue Sons and Daughters, it deſcends only to the Sons. Whereas, by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, it deſcends
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58630:16"/>both to the Sons and Daughters. The Brother al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſucceeds not, to the Brother, unleſs ſpecially ſo provided, <hi>ibid. Tit.</hi> 50. The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendants ſucceed not, but only the Deſcendants, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth a Daughter ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, <hi>niſi ex parte, vel niſi ſit Feudum foemininum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we come nearer home, to the <hi>Normandy</hi> Laws, there are two kind of Lands par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or not partable; the Lands that are partable, are all <hi>Vavaſories, Burgages,</hi> and ſuch like, which are much of the nature of our <hi>Soccage Lands.</hi> Theſe deſcend to all the <hi>Sons,</hi> or to all the Brothers. Lands not part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58630:16"/>are Fiefs and Dignities; theſe deſcend to the eldeſt Son, and not to all the Sons, and if there be no Sons, then to all the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters partable. For want of Sons and Nephews, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to the Daughters, if no Sons or Daughters; or Deſcendants from them, it deſcends to the Brothers; and for want of Brothers, to the Siſters, obſerving, as before, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Lands partable and not partable, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Deſcent runs to the poſterity of the Brothers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſeventh Degree. And if there be no Brothers or Siſters, or any Deſcendants
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58630:17"/>from them, within the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Degree, it deſcends to the Father; and if the Father be dead, to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Aunts, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> to Brothers and Siſters; and if there be none, then to the Grand-father. So that, according to their Law, the Father is poſtpon'd to the Brother and Siſter, and their Iſſues, but is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the Uncle; tho' by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, the Father be preferred before the Brother; by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law ſucceeds together with the Brother; and by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Law, takes not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by deſcent, but the Fathers Brother.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:58630:17"/>
            <p n="2">If Lands deſcend from the part of the Father, they never Reſort by Deſcent, to the Line of the Mother; but in caſes of Purchaſes by the Son, who dies without Iſſue; for want of Heirs of the part of the Father, it deſcends to the Heir of the part of the Mother, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">The Son of the eldeſt Son, dying in the life of the Father, is preferred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the younger Son ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the Father, as the Law ſtands here now, but it hath ſome interruption.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:58630:18"/>
            <p n="4">4. In an equality of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, in Collateral Deſcents, the Male Line is preferred, before the Female.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Although by the Civil Law, <hi>Fratres utriuſque Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis conjuncti, praeſeruntur fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribus conſanguineis tantum, vel uterinis;</hi> yet it ſhould ſeem, by the Cuſtom of <hi>Normandy,</hi> That <hi>Fratres con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinei, viz. ex eodem patre, ſed diverſa matre,</hi> ſhall take by Deſcent, together with the Brothers, <hi>ex utroque conjuncti,</hi> upon the death of any of ſuch Brothers. But this ſeems to be a miſtake, for it ſeems the Half-blood,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58630:18"/>hinders the Deſcent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Brothers or Siſters.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Leproſie was among them, an Impediment of Succeſſion, but then it ſeems, it muſt be ſolemnly adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be a Leproſie, by the Sentence of the Church. Upon this and much more that might be obſerved, upon the Cuſtoms of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Countries, the Rules of Succeſſion, or Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Tranſmiſſion, have been various in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, according to various Laws, Cuſtoms and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuages.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:58630:19"/>
            <p>And now, after this brief Survey of the Laws and Cuſtoms of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, I come to the Laws and Uſuages of <hi>England</hi> in relation to Deſcents, and the growth that thoſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms have ſucceſſively had, and whereunto they are now arrived.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Touching the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Succeſſion, it ſeems, that according to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Laws; their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Sons inherited their Earldoms, and Baronies, for they had great Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Juriſdictions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them, and were in nature of Principalities.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58630:19"/>But their ordinary Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds deſcended to all the Sons; and this Cuſtom they carried with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Wales,</hi> whither they were driven. This appears by the Statute <hi>Walliae</hi> 12 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>Aliter uſitatum eſt in Wallia quam in Anglia quoad Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſionem Haereditatis, eò quòd Haereditas partibilis eſt inter Haeredes Maſculos, &amp; à tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore cujus non extiterit Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moria partibilis extitit. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Rex non vult quòd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudo illa abrogetur, ſed quòd Haereditates remaneant parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles inter Conſimiles Haeredes, ſicut eſſe conſueverunt, &amp; fiat Partitio illius ſicut fieri conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit; hoc excepto, quòd Baſtardi
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58630:20"/>non habeant de caetero Haeredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, &amp; etiam quòd non habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Purpartes cum Legitimis, nec ſine legitimis.</hi> Upon which three things are obſervable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That at this time, the Hereditary Succeſſion of the eldeſt Son, was then known to be the Common, and uſual Law in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> That the Succeſſion of all the Sons, was the Ancient Cuſtomary Law among the <hi>Britiſh</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> which is here continued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> That before this time, Baſtards were admitted to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58630:20"/>Inherit in <hi>Wales,</hi> as well as the Legitimate, which U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage is here abrogated. And although we have but few Evidences, touching the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Laws, before their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion into <hi>Wales,</hi> yet this uſage ſeems ſufficiently to Evidence, That this was the antient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> As to the times of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> their Laws collected by <hi>Brampton,</hi> and by Mr. <hi>Lambard,</hi> ſpeak not much concerning the Courſe of Deſcents. Yet it ſeems, that commonly the Deſcents of their ordinary Lands, (at leaſt except Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies and Royal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances)
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58630:21"/>deſcended alſo to all the Sons. Among the Laws of <hi>Canutus,</hi> there is this Law, <hi>Lambard</hi> fol. 122, <hi>Tit. de Inteſtato Mortuis. Sive quis incuria, ſive morte repentina fuerit inteſtato Mortuus, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus tamen nullam rerum ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum partem (praeter eam quae jure debetur Hereoti nomine) ſibi aſſumito. Verùm eas Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio ſuo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xori, Liberis, &amp; cognatione proximis, juſtè (pro ſuo cuique jure) diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buito.</hi> Upon which we may obſerve theſe things.</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt,</hi> That the Wiſe had a ſhare, as well of Lands for her Dower, as Goods.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:58630:21"/>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> That in reference to Hereditary Succeſſion, there then ſeemed to be little difference, between Lands and Feuds, for here is no diſtinction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> That there was a kind of ſettled right of Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with reference to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximity and remoteneſs, <hi>pro ſuo cuique jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> That in reference to Children, they ſeemed all to ſucceed alike, without any diſtinction between the Males and Females.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:58630:22"/>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly,</hi> That yet the Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor might diſpoſe by his Will, as well of Lands as Goods, which uſage ſeems to have obtained, unto the time of <hi>H.</hi> 2. as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears hereafter by <hi>Glanvil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It ſeems, That until the Conqueſt, the Deſcent of Lands was, at leaſt to all the Sons alike, and, for ought appears alſo, to all the Daughters, and that there was no difference in the Hereditary Tranſmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Lands and Goods at leaſt, in reference to the Children. This appears, by thoſe Laws of King <hi>Edward,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:58630:22"/>confirmed by the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and recited in <hi>Lambard fol.</hi> 167. and alſo by Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> upon <hi>Eadmerus, Lege 36. Tit. De Inteſtatorum bonis</hi> 184. <hi>Siquis inteſtatus obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit, Liberi ejus Haereditatem equaliter dividant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this equal diviſion of Inheritances among the Children, was found to be very inconvenient.</p>
            <p>For Firſt, It weakned the Strength of the Kingdom, for by frequent parcelling, and ſubdividing of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances in proceſs of time, Inheritances were ſo crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that there were few perſons of able Eſtates, left
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58630:23"/>to undergo publick Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Offices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> It did by degrees, bring the Inhabitants to a low kind of Country Living, and Families were broken, and the younger Sons, which had they not had theſe little parcells of Land to apply themſelves to, would have betaken themſelves either to Trades, or Military, or Civil, or Eccleſiaſtical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, neglected thoſe opportunities, and applied themſelves to their ſmall dividends of Land, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they neglected oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58630:23"/>and the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror (having by his acceſſion to the Crown, gotten the Poſſeſſions and Demeans of the Crown; and alſo, very many and great poſſeſſions of them that oppoſed him, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to <hi>Harold</hi>); diſpoſeth of theſe Lands, or great part of them to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, and others that adhered to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained certain <hi>Honorary Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures,</hi> either by Baronage, or in Knights Service, or by Grand Serjeantry, for the Defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And poſſibly alſo, as the deſire of many Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58630:24"/>changed their Tenures into Knights Service. Which Introduction of new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, was not nevertheleſs without conſent of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as appears by the additional Laws before mentioned, That King <hi>William</hi> by the advice of Parliament made mention of by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admerus</hi> pag. 191, among which this was one, <hi>(viz.) Statuimus etiam &amp; firmiter praecipimus ut omnes. Comites, Barones, Milites. &amp; Servien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, &amp; univerſi Liberi homines totius Regni noſtri, habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, &amp; teneant ſe ſemper in armis, &amp; in equis, ut decet &amp; oportet. Et quod ſint ſemper prompti, &amp; bene pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58630:24"/>ad ſervicium ſuum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrum nobis explendendum, &amp; peragendum, cum ſemper opus affuerit, ſecundum quod nobis de Feodis debent, &amp; Tenementis ſuis de jure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. Et ſicut illis ſtatuimus, per commune conſilium totius Regni noſtri &amp; illis dedimus &amp; conceſſimus in Feodo jure Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditario.</hi> Whereby it appears, that there were two kinds of Military Proviſions, one that was ſet upon all Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, by common conſent of Parliament, which was uſually called <hi>Aſſiza Armorum,</hi> and another that was <hi>Conventional,</hi> and by Tenure upon the Infeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Tenant, which was called Knights Service,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58630:25"/>and ſometimes Royal, and ſometimes Foreign Service, and ſometimes <hi>Servicium Loricae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence it came to paſs, that (not only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Cuſtom of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> but alſo according to the Cuſtom of other Countries.) Theſe <hi>Honorary Fees,</hi> or <hi>Infeudations</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came deſcendable to the eldeſt, and not to all the Males. And hence it is, That in <hi>Kent,</hi> where the Cuſtom of Deſcent to all the Males, generally prevails; They pretend, a conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all their Cuſtoms by the Conqueror, to obtain their Submiſſion to his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58630:25"/>Government, according to the Romantick Story of their moving Wood. Yet, even in <hi>Kent</hi> it ſelf, theſe ancient <hi>Tenures</hi> or <hi>Fees,</hi> that are anciently held by Knights Service, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendable to the eldeſt Son, as Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to my hand, in pag. 553. out of the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>H.3. Fitz Tit. Preſcription 63, 26 H. 8.5.</hi> and the Statute of <hi>31 H. 8. cap. 3.</hi> But yet, even in <hi>Kent</hi> it ſelf, If Gavel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Land, Eſcheat, or come to the Crown by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder, or Diſſolution of Monaſteries, and be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be held in Knights Service, or <hi>per Baroniam,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:58630:26"/>the Cuſtomary Deſcent is not changed, neither can be, but by Act of Parliament, for it is a Cuſtom fixed to the Land.</p>
            <p>But thoſe <hi>Honorary</hi> Fees, made in ancient times, ſo ſhortly after the Conqueſt, did ſilently, and ſuddainly aſſume the Rule of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent to the eldeſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly held it; and ſo, (although poſſibly there were no Act of Parliament of thoſe elder times, that altered the ancient courſe of Deſcents, from all the Sons to the eldeſt, or at leaſt none that we know of; yet,) the uſe of the Neighbour Country, might
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58630:26"/>introduce the ſame Uſage here, as to theſe <hi>Honorary</hi> Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>And becauſe theſe <hi>Honorary</hi> Inſeudations were many, and ſcattered almoſt through all the Kingdom in a little time, they introduced a a parity in the Succeſſion of Lands of other Tenures, as <hi>Soccage</hi> or <hi>Vavaſories.</hi> So that without queſtion, by little and little almoſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in all Counties of <hi>England</hi> (except <hi>Kent,</hi> who were moſt Tenacious of their own Cuſtoms, in which they gloried, and ſome particular Fees, and Places where a contrary Uſage prevailed) the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58630:27"/>of Deſcents or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions by little and little, as well of <hi>Soccage</hi> Lands, as of Knights Service, went to the eldeſt Son, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Declaration of King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, in the Statute of <hi>Wales</hi> abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as will more fully appear by what follows.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>H. 1. Lambard</hi> fol. 203. we find in his <hi>70th</hi> Law, that it ſhould ſeem, that the whole Land did not yet deſcend to the eldeſt Son, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a little to look that way. <hi>Primum patris Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum primogenitus filius habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at.</hi> As to Collateral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents, the Law determined
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58630:27"/>thus, <hi>Lambard ut ſupra. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis ſine liberis deceſſerit, Pater out mater ejus in Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditatem ſuccedat; vel fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vel ſoror ſi pater &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſint; ſi nec hos hàbeat, ſoror Patris vel Matris, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inceps in quintum genicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum; qui cum propinquio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in parentela, fiunt, Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditario jure ſuccedant; &amp; dum virilis Sexus extiterit, &amp; Haereditas abinde fit, foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minina non Haereditetur.</hi> By this it ſeems.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The eldeſt Son (though he had <hi>Jus Primogeniturae,</hi> the principal Fee of his Father, yet) he carried not all the Land.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:58630:28"/>
            <p n="2">2. That for want of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the Father or Mother, inherited, before the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Siſter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That for want of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Father, Mother, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Siſters, the Lands decended to the Uncles and Aunts, to the Fifth Degree.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That in Succeſſion Collateral <hi>Proximity</hi> of Kindred was preferred.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Male was preferred before the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; That is, the Father's Line was preferred before
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58630:28"/>the Mothers, unleſs the Land deſcended from the Mother, and then the Mothers Line was to be preferred.</p>
            <p>How this Law was obſerved in the Intervals, between <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, we can give no account. But the next pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod that we come to, is <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d. Glanvil</hi> in his ſeventh Book, gives us ſome account how the Law ſtood in his time, wherein, notwithſtanding it will appear, there was ſome incertainty in the buſineſs of Deſcents, or Hereditary Succeſſions, though it was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58630:29"/>much better polited than formerly.</p>
            <p>The Rules then of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion were either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Goods or Lands. As to Goods, one third part went to the Wife, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther third part to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the other third part to the Teſtator's diſpoſal; But if he had no Wife, a Moiety went to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the other Moiety to his diſpoſal, <hi>Glan. lib. 7. c. 5.</hi> But as to the Succeſſion of Lands, the Rules were theſe:
1<hi>ſt,</hi> If the Lands were Knights Service, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally went to the eldeſt Son; and in caſe of no Son,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58630:29"/>to all the Daughters; and in caſe of no Children, to the eldeſt Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> If the Lands were <hi>Socage,</hi> it deſcended to all the Sons, <hi>Si fuerit Socagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um &amp; id antiquitus diviſum,</hi> only the chief Houſe was to be allotted to the Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party of the eldeſt, and a Compenſation made to the reſt in lieu thereof. <hi>Si vero non fuerit antiquitus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſum, tunc Primogenitus, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quorundam conſuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem totam Haereditatem obtinebit, ſecundum autem quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundam conſuetudinem poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus ſilius Haeres eſt, Glanvil lib. 7. cap. 3.</hi> So that although
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58630:30"/>Cuſtom directed variouſly the Deſcent, either to the eldeſt, youngeſt, or all the Sons; Yet, it ſeems at this time <hi>Jus commune,</hi> or Common right ſpoke for the eldeſt Son to be Heir, no Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom intervening.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> As the Son, or Daughter, ſo their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>in infinitum</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in the Deſcent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Collateral Line, or Uncles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> But if a Man have two Sons, and the eldeſt dies in the life time of the Father, having a Son or Daughter, and then the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58630:30"/>Father dies; it was then controverted, whether the Son, or the Nephew ſhould ſucceed the Father, though the better Opinion ſeemed to be for the Nephew, <hi>Ibid. cap. 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly,</hi> A Baſtard could not Inherit, <hi>ibid. cap.</hi> 13 And although by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Civil Law, If <hi>A.</hi> hath a Son born of <hi>B.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Marriage, and after <hi>A.</hi> Marries <hi>B.</hi> this Son be Legitimate and Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Yet according to the Law of <hi>England</hi> then uſed, as well as after, he was not Hereditable, <hi>Glan. lib. 7. cap. 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:58630:31"/>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly,</hi> In caſe the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer die without Iſſue, the Lands deſcended to the Brother, and for want of Brothers to the Siſters, and for want of them to the Children of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Siſters, and for want of them to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and ſo onwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Deſcents at this day; and the Father and Mother were not immediately to Inherit the Son, but the Brothers or Uncles, and their Children, <hi>Glan. lib. 7. cap. 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:58630:31"/>
            <p>And it ſeems, that in all things elſe the Rule of Deſcent, in reference to the Collateral Line, held much the ſame as now: As namely, If Land de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of the part of the Father, it ſhould not reſort to the part of the Mother, &amp; <hi>è converſo;</hi> But in caſe of Purchaſe, for want of Heirs of the part of the Father, it reſorted to the Line of the Mother, and the nearer and worthier Blood was preferred, ſo that if there were any of the part of the Father, though never ſo far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, it hindered the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent to the Line of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58630:32"/>Mother, though much near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>There were in thoſe times as it ſeems two Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments of Deſcent, or Hereditary Succeſſion which now do not at all obtain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Leproſie, if ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by the Sentence of the Church, this indeed I find not in <hi>Glanvil,</hi> but I find it pleaded, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the time of King <hi>Jolin,</hi> and the Land ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to the Siſter, <hi>P.</hi> 4. <hi>Johannis.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:58630:32"/>
            <p n="2">2. There was another curioſity, and it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to ſee how much, and how long it prevailed, for we find it in uſe in <hi>Glanvil,</hi> that wrote in King <hi>Hen. 2d's</hi> time; in <hi>Bracton,</hi> that wrote in <hi>Hen. 3d's</hi> time; in <hi>Fleta,</hi> that wrote in the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and in the broken year <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. Fitz. Avowry 235. <hi>Nemo poteſt eſſe Tenens &amp; Dominus &amp; Homagium repellit perquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> And therefore, if the eldeſt Brother had enfeof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed the ſecond reſerving Homage, and had received Homage, and then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond had died without Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58630:33"/>it ſhould have deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the youngeſt, and not to the eldeſt Brother; <hi>quia Homagium epellit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitum,</hi> tee for this that I may mention it once for all, <hi>Glan. lib. 7. cap. 1. Bra. lib. 2. cap. 30. Fleta lib. 6. cap. 1.</hi> And ſo it has been for ought I can find ever ſince <hi>3 Ed. 1.</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is antiquated rather than altered, and the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon which it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hath appeared trivial; for if the eldeſt Brother enfeoff the ſecond reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Homage, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond dying without Iſſue, it will Deſcend to the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt as Heir, and the Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioury
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58630:33"/>is extinct. Indeed it might have been ſome Reaſon to have examined, whether he might not have waved the Deſcent, in caſe his Services had been more beneficial than the Land; but there could be little Reaſon for this to exclude him from Succeſſion. I ſhall mention no more of this nor the former Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Leproſie, for they are both vaniſhed, and antiquated long ſince, and neither the one nor the other is at this day any impediment of Deſcent.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:58630:34"/>
            <p>And now paſſing over the time of King <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, becauſe I find nothing of moment in that time relating to the Title in queſtion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the uſurpation of King <hi>John</hi> upon his eldeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Son, which he would fain have juſtified, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing a Law of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the younger Son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Nephew, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the eldeſt Brother: But this pretention could no ways juſtifie his Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, as hath been ſhewn in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:58630:34"/>
            <p>We have the Tractate of <hi>Bracton lib. 2. cap.</hi> 30, 31. and <hi>lib.</hi> 5. The truth is, there is ſo little variance as to the Points of Deſcents, between the Law as it was taken when <hi>Bracton</hi> wrote, and the Law as it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards taken in <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt's time, when <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi> wrote, that there is very little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them as may eaſily appear, eſpecially by comparing of <hi>Bract.ubi ſupra</hi> and <hi>Fleta Lib. 5. Chapter</hi> the <hi>9th, Liber</hi> the <hi>6th, Chapters</hi> the 1<hi>ſt</hi> and <hi>2d,</hi> that the latter ſeems to be in effect an Abſtract of the former, therefore I ſhall ſet down
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58630:35"/>what in ſubſtance both ſay, and thereby it will appear, that the Rules of Deſcents in the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the 1<hi>ſt,</hi> were very much one.</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt,</hi> The Law ſeems ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled now unqueſtionably, that the eldeſt Son was in Common right Heir, not only in caſes of Knights Service Land, but alſo of <hi>Soccage Lands,</hi> unleſs there was a Special Cuſtom to the contrary, as in <hi>Kent</hi> and ſome other places, and ſo that Point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law is fully ſettled.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58630:35"/>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> That all the Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants <hi>in infinitum,</hi> from any Perſon that had been Heir (if he had been living) were Inheritable: As the Deſcendants of the Son, of the Brother, of the Uncle, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> That the eldeſt Son dying in the life time of the Father, his Son or Iſſue was to have the preference as Heir to the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the younger Brother, and ſo the doubt in <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's</hi> time was ſettled, <hi>Glan. lib. 7. cap. 3. Cum quis au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem moriatur habens filium poſtnatum &amp; ex Primogenito
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58630:36"/>filio praemorturo Nepotem, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na quidem Juris dubitatio ſolet eſſe, uter illorum praeferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus ſit alij in illa Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one; ſcilicet utrum Filius an nepos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> The Father, or Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father could not by Law Inherit immediately his Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly,</hi> Leproſie, though it were an exception to the Plaintiff, becauſe he ought not to converſe in the Courts of Law, yet we no where find, that it was an Impediment of Deſcent.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:58630:36"/>
            <p>So that upon the whole matter for any thing I can obſerve in them, the Rules of Deſcent then ſtood ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in all Points as they are at this day, except thoſe few matters which yet in proceſs of time ſoon ſettled as they now ſtand, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Impediments of the hinderance of Deſcent, from him that did Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, to him that received it, ſeems to have yet been in uſe, at leaſt till the 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and in <hi>Fleta's</hi> time, for he puts the caſe and admits it.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:58630:37"/>
            <p n="2">Whereas they both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that Half-blood to him who is the Purchaſer, is an Impediment of the Deſcent; yet in caſe of a Deſcent from a Common Anceſtor, Half-blood is no Impediment. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; <hi>A.</hi> hath Iſſue <hi>B.</hi> a Son, and <hi>C.</hi> a Daughter by one venter, and <hi>D.</hi> a Son by another venter, if <hi>B.</hi> Purchaſe in Fee, and die without Iſſue, it ſhall deſcend to the Siſter, and not to the Brother of the Half-blood: <hi>But</hi> if the Land had deſcended from <hi>A.</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> and he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and died without iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58630:37"/>it was a doubt in the time of <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Britton,</hi> whether it ſhould go to the younger Son, or the Daughter, but though it were then a doubt, yet the Law hath ſince that time been ſettled, that in both caſes it deſcends to the Daughter, <hi>Seſeina ſacit Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pem &amp; primum gradum, &amp; poſſeſſio fratris de feodo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plici facit ſororem eſſe haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter it ſeems, that abating theſe ſmall inconſiderable vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, the States and Rules of Deſcents as they ſtood, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, or at leaſt of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:58630:38"/>the firſt, were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to their full Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Perfection, and vary nothing conſiderably, from what they are at this day, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ever ſince that time.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore ſet down the State, and Rules of Deſcents in Fee-ſimple as they ſtand at this day, without medling with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Limitations and Entails, which vary the courſe of Deſcents in ſome caſes from the Common Rules of Deſcents in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Succeſſion, and herein we ſhall ſee what the Law hath been, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58630:38"/>continued touching the ſame ever ſince <hi>Bracton,</hi> who wrote in <hi>Henry</hi> the third's time, now above Four hundred years ſince, and by that we ſhall ſee what alterations ſucceſſion of time hath made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>And now to give a ſhort Scheme of the Rules of Deſcents, or Hereditary Succeſſions of the Lands of Subjects, as the Law ſtands at this day, and hath ſtood ſettled here for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Four hundred years.</p>
            <p>All poſſible Hereditary Succeſſion may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into theſe three kinds:

               <hi>2ly,</hi> Becauſe the Son, or Daughter is nearer than the Brother, the Brother or Siſter than the Uncle, the Son or Daughter ſhall Inherit before the Brother or Siſter, and they before the Uncle.</p>

            <p>1<hi>ſt,</hi> They are in Law in the ſame Right of Proximity and Worthineſs of Blood, as their Root that might have been Heir, was in caſe he had been living: And hence it is, That the Son or Grand-child, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son or Daughter of the eldeſt Son, ſucceeds before the youngeſt Son.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> This Right transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Repreſentation, is infinite and unlimited in the Degrees of thoſe that deſcend from the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter; the <hi>Filius,</hi> the <hi>Nepos, Pronepos, Abnepos,</hi> and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> enjoy the ſame Privilege of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, as thoſe from whom they derive their Pedigree, as well in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents Lineal as Tranſverſal; and therefore the <hi>Abnepos,</hi> or <hi>Abneptis</hi> of the eldeſt Brother, whether it be Son or Daughter, ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58630:45"/>before the youngeſt <hi>Brother,</hi> becauſe, though the Female be leſs worthy than the Male; yet ſhe ſtands in right of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the eldeſt <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> who was more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy than the youngeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, That if a Man hath two Daughters, and the eldeſt die in the Life of the Father, leaving ſix Daughters, and then the Father dies, the youngeſt Daughter ſhall have an equal ſhare to all the reſt, becauſe they ſtand in Repreſentation of their

               <hi>4th Rule,</hi> That by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> without a Special Cuſtom to the contrary, the eldeſt Son or Brother, or Uncle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the younger, and the Males in an equal Degree do not all Inherit: But the Daughters whether by the ſame, or divers ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do Inherit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Father and all the Siſters do Inherit, the Brother by the ſame ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <hi>5th Rule,</hi> That the laſt actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Seizin in any Anceſtor, makes him as it were the Root of the Deſcent equal to many Intents, as if he had been a Purchaſer; and therefore, he that cannot according to the Rules of Deſcent derive his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him, who was laſt actually ſeized, though he might have derived his Succeſſion to ſome prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Anceſtor ſhall not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit. And hence it is, That where Lands deſcend to the eldeſt Son from the Father, and the Son enters and dies without Iſſue, his Siſter of the whole Blood
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58630:47"/>ſhall Inherit as Heir to the Brother, and not the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Son of the half Blood, becauſe he cannot be Heir to the Brother of the half Blood. But if the eldeſt Son had ſurvived the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and died before En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the youngeſt Son ſhould Inherit as Heir to the Father and not the Siſter, becauſe he is Heir to Father, that was laſt actually ſeized. And hence it is, that though the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is preferred before the Father in Deſcent to the Son; yet if the Uncle enter after the Death of the Son, and die without Iſſue, the Father ſhall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58630:47"/>the Uncle, <hi>Quia Seiſina ſacit Stirpem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>6th Rule,</hi> That whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver derives a Title to any Land, muſt be of the Blood of him that firſt purchaſed it. And this is the Reaſon why, if the Son purchaſe Lands and dies without Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, it ſhall deſcend to the Heirs of the part of his Father, and if he hath none, then to the Heirs of the part of his Mother, becauſe tho' the <hi>Son</hi> hath both the Blood of the Father and of the Mother in him, yet he is of the Blood of the Mother, and the <hi>Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinei</hi> of the Mother are
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58630:48"/>
               <hi>Conſanguinei cognati</hi> of the Son. And of the other ſide, if the Father had purchaſed the Land, and it had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the Son, and the Son had died without Iſſue, without any Heir of the part of his Father, it ſhould never have deſcended in the Line of his Mother, but eſcheated, for though the <hi>Conſanguinei</hi> of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were <hi>Conſanguinei</hi> to the Son, yet they were not of <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer. But if there had been none of the Blood of the Grandfather, yet it might have reſorted to the Line of the Grandmother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58630:48"/>her <hi>Conſanguinei</hi> were as well of the Blood of the Father as the Mothers <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity</hi> is of the Blood of the Son. And conſequently alſo, if the Grandfather had purchaſed Lands, and it had deſcended from him to the Father, and from him to the Son, if the Son had entered and died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, his Fathers Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Siſters, or their Deſcendants, or for want of them, his Grandfathers Brothers or Siſters, or their Deſcendants, or for want of them, his great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers Brothers or Siſters, or their Deſcendants, or for want of them his great
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58630:49"/>Grandmothers, Brothers or Siſters, or their Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants might have inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for the <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> of the great Grandmother, was of the <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> of the Grandfather, but none of the Line of the Mother or Grandmother, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Grandfathers Wife ſhould have inherited, for that they were not of the Blood of the firſt Purchaſer. And the ſame Rule <hi>è converſo</hi> holds in Purchaſes in the Line of the Mother or Grandmother, they ſhall always keep in the ſame Line, wherein the firſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer ſettled them. But it is not neceſſary, that he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58630:49"/>that inherits be always Heir to the Purchaſer, but it ſufficeth if he be of his Blood, and Heir to him who was laſt ſeiſed. The Father purchaſeth Lands, and it Deſcends to his Son who dies without Iſſue, it ſhall never deſcend to the Heir of the part of the Sons Mother; But if the Sons Grandmother hath a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Sons great Grandmother hath a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and there is no other Kindred, it ſhall deſcend to the Grandmothers Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet, if the Father had died without Iſſue, his Grandmothers Brother ſhould have been prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58630:50"/>before his Mothers Brother, becauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was Heir of the part of his Father, though by a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and the latter was Heir of the part of his Mother. But where the Son is once ſeiſed, and dies without Iſſue, his Grandmothers Brother is to him Heir of the part of his Father, and being nearer than his great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers Brother, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in Deſcent. But this is always intended, ſo long as the Line of the Deſcent is not broken, for if the Son alien thoſe Lands, and then repurchaſe them again in Fee; Now the Rules of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58630:50"/>Deſcent hold as if he had been the original Purchaſer, and that it had never been in the Line of the Father or Mother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7th Rule,</hi> In Succeſſion, as well in the Line De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, Tranſverſal or Aſcending, the Line that is firſt derived from a Male Root, hath always the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. <hi>A.</hi> hath Iſſue two Sons, <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>C. B.</hi> hath Iſſue a Son and a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>E. D.</hi> the Son hath Iſſue a Daughter, <hi>F.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> the Daughter hath Iſſue a Son, <hi>G. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> nor any of his Deſcendants ſhall not inherit ſo long as there
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58630:51"/>are any Deſcendants from <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> the Daughter, nor none of her Deſcendants ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit, ſo long as there are Deſcendants from <hi>D.</hi> the Son, whether they be Male or Female.</p>
            <p>In Deſcents, Collateral as Brothers and Siſters, the ſame Inſtance applied evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceth the concluſion. But in Succeſſions in the Line Aſcending, there muſt be a fuller explanation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is darker and more obſcure; I ſhall therefore ſet forth the whole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Tranſverſal, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, Deſcents in theſe enſuing Rules.</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:58630:51"/>
            <p>1<hi>ſt Rule,</hi> If the Son pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth Lands in Fee-ſimple, and dies without Iſſue, thoſe of the Male Line Aſcending <hi>uſque in infinitum</hi> ſhall be preferred in the Deſcent according to their <hi>Proximity</hi> of Degree to the Son. Therefore the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Brothers or Siſters, or their Deſcendants ſhall be preferred before the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Grandfather and their Deſcendants. And again, if the Father had no Brothers nor Siſters, the Grandfathers Brothers and their Deſcendants, and for want of Brothers, the Grandfathers Siſters, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58630:52"/>their Deſcendants ſhould be preferred before the Brothers of the great Grandfather. For although by the Law of <hi>England</hi> the Father nor Grandfather cannot immediately inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Son, yet the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Deſcent to the Collateral Line aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is as much as if the Father or Grandfather had been by Law inheritable, and therefore as in caſe the Father had been inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, he ſhould have inherited the Son before the Grandfather, and the Grandfather before the great Grandfather, and conſequently if the Father
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58630:52"/>had inherited and died without Iſſue, his eldeſt Brother and his Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants ſhould have inherited before the younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Deſcendants, and if he had no Brothers but Siſters, his Siſters and their Deſcendants ſhould inherit before his Uncles, or the Grandfathers Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and their Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, ſo though the Law of <hi>England</hi> exclude the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from inheriting, it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, and directs the Deſcent as it ſhould have been, if the Father had inherited, <hi>viz.</hi> Lets in thoſe firſt that are in the next Degree to him.</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:58630:53"/>
            <p>
               <hi>2d Rule</hi> is this, That the Line of the part of the Mother ſhall never inherit, as long as there are any though never ſo remote of the Line of the part of the Father; and therefore, though the Mother hath a Brother, yet if the <hi>Atavus</hi> or <hi>Atavia</hi> of the Father hath a Brother or Siſter, He and She ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and exclude the Mothers Brother though he is much nearer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3d Rule,</hi> But yet farther. The Male Line of the part of the Father deſcending, ſhall <hi>in oeternum</hi> exclude the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58630:53"/>Female Line of the part of the Father aſcending, and therefore in the caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the Son purchaſing Lands and dying without Iſſue, the Siſter of the Father, Grandfather or great Grandfather, and ſo <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum</hi> ſhall be preferred before the Fathers Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Brother, though the Fathers Mothers Brother be a Male, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Grandfathers Siſter be a Female, and more remote, becauſe it is in the Male Line, which is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy than the Female Line, though even the Female Line be of the Blood of the Father.</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:58630:54"/>
            <p>
               <hi>4th Rule,</hi> But as in the Male Line aſcending, the more near is preferred in the Deſcent, before the remote; ſo in the Female Line deſcending, ſo it be of the Blood of the Father, the more near is preferred before the remote. The Son therefore purchaſeth Lands and dies without Iſſue, the Father, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and ſo upward, all the Male Line are dead without Brother or Siſter, or any deſcending from them, but the Fathers Mother hath a Siſter or Brother, and alſo the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58630:54"/>Grandmother hath a Brother, and likewiſe the Fathers great Grand-mother hath a Brother; it is true, all theſe are of the Blood of the Father, and the very remoteſt of theſe ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Sons Mothers Brother; and it is likewiſe true, that the great Grand-mothers Blood hath paſſed through more Males of the Fathers Blood, than the Blood of the Grand-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Mother of the Father, but in this caſe the Fathers Mothers Siſter ſhall be preferred before the Fathers Grand-mothers Brother, or great Grand-mothers
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58630:55"/>Brother, becauſe they are all in the Female Line, <hi>viz. Cognati,</hi> and the Fathers Mothers Siſter is the neareſt, and therefore ſhall have the preference, as well as in the Male Line aſcending the Fathers Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Siſter, ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Grand-Fathers Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5th Rule,</hi> And yet in the laſt caſe, where the Son purchaſeth Lands and dies without Iſſue, and without Heir of the part of his Grand-father, the Land ſhould beſcend to his Grand-mothers Brother or Siſter,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58630:55"/>as Heir of the part of the Father; yet, if the Father had purchaſed this Land and died, and it deſcended to his Son who died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, the Lands ſhould not have deſcended to his Fathers Mothers Brother or Siſter, for the Reaſon given in the eighth Rule, but for want of Brothers or Siſters of the Grand-father, great Grand-father, and ſo upward in the Male aſcending Line, it ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the Fathers Grand-mothers Brother or Siſter, which is Heir of the part of the Father, who ſhould be preferred before the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58630:56"/>Fathers Mothers Brother, which was in truth the Heir of the part of the Mother of the purchaſer, though the next Heir of the part of the Father of him that laſt died ſeized. And therefore, as if the Father who was the 02 purchaſer had died without Iſſue, the Heirs of the part of his Father, whether of the Male or Female Line, ſhould have been preferred before the Heir of the part of the Mother; ſo the Son that ſtands now in the place of his Father, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herits to him primarily in his Fathers Line dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, the ſame Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58630:56"/>and Hereditary Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, ſhould have been as if his Father had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately died without Iſſue, which ſhould have been to his Grandmothers Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Heir of the part of the Father, though by the Female Line, and not to his Mothers Brother, which was only Heir of the part of his Mother, and not to take till his Fathers Fine, as well Female as Male was ſpent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6th Rule,</hi> If the Son pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Lands and dies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, and it deſcends to any Heir of the part of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58630:57"/>the Father, and then the Line of the Father (after Entry and Poſſeſſion) fail, it ſhall never reſort to the Line of the Mother, tho' in the firſt Inſtance, or firſt Deſcent from the Son, it might have deſcended to the Heir of the part of the Mother: For now by this Deſcent and Seiſin, it is lodged in the Fathers Line, to whom the Heir of the part of the Mother can never derive a Title as Heir, but it ſhall rather Eſcheat. But if the Heir of the part of the Father had not entered, but then that Line had failed, it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58630:57"/>might have deſcended to the Heir of the part of the Mother, as Heir to the Son, to whom immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for want of Heirs of the part of the Father it might have deſcended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7th Rule,</hi> And upon the ſame Reaſon, if it had once deſcended to the Heir of the part of the Father of the Grand-fathers Line, and that Heir had entered, it ſhould never deſcend to the Heir of the part of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Grand-mothers Line, becauſe the Line of the Grand-mother was not of Blood or <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> to the Line of the Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide.</p>
            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:58630:58"/>
            <p>
               <hi>8th Rule,</hi> If for default of Heirs of the purchaſer of the part of the Father, the Lands Deſcend to the Line of the Mother, the Heirs of the Mother on the part of her Fathers Side, ſhall be preferred in Succeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Heirs of the part of her Mothers ſide, becauſe they are the more worthy. A great part of theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are eaſily to be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of the Reſolutions in the caſe of <hi>Clare verſus Brooke, alias Cobham.</hi> And thus the Law ſtands in point of Deſcents, or Hereditary Succeſſion in <hi>England</hi> at this Day, and for above Four hundred years paſt.</p>
