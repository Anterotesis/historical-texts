            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>The quarrell is wel knowne between the Pope, and the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> for their iudiciall proceſſe purſued to the execution, and death of a fowle malefactor of their Cleargie, and the Pope (if he had been ſtrong enough to reuenge ſuch a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell) would haue made it knowne much better.

                        <p>Saint <hi>Bernard epiſt.</hi> 42. to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Senona</hi> vrgeth that place of Saint <hi>Paul, omnis ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Let euery ſoule be ſubiect:</hi> thus, <hi>Si omnis, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra, quis vos excipit ab vniuerſitate?

                           <p>Our Church in our Engliſh Liturgie, hath appoynted a ſpeciall exhortation, to be vſed, and read publiquely, when the Miniſter doth finde the people negligent, in the receiuing of the holy Sacrament, in which two things are ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reproued.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27564:21"/>
themſelues, this is there called <hi>Deciſion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of theſe holie myſteries.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Come,</hi> but <hi>eate</hi> alſo. Some do come for feare of the law, and <hi>eate</hi> alſo, to ſaue charges, but it is againſt ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, for they loue not the meate.</p>
                           <p>Others come, and they like the meate well, but they are loth to eate, in regard of the ſauce which they like not the taſte of, that is the Ceremonies of our Church, vſed in the adminiſtration of the Sacrament. Yet hath our Church proteſted ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, that the Sacrament is entire, and pure without them, and there is no cauſe to require, and exact the reuerent vſe of them, but for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward decencie; of which it is more fitte, that a Church ſhould iudge, then euerie particular perſon to haue liberty to vſe his owne forme and faſhion.</p>
                           <p>Others keepe ſtate, they are willing ſometimes to <hi>eate,</hi> but they are loath to take the paines to <hi>Come, and eate:</hi> They looke to haue it brought home to their owne houſes.

                     </p>
                     <p>In which wee are taught theſe things:</p>
                     <p>1 That God hath long before, not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined of vs, but of all our courſes of life, and vocations, and meanes of liuing: for <hi>Moſes</hi> did reade this future eſtate of this Tribe, in the Book of Gods prouidence, opened and reuealed vnto him, by the mighty God of <hi>Iaacob.</hi> Therefore, let vs make this double vſe hereof.</p>
                     <p>1 That no man aſcribe it to fortune, or chance, that one man is a Scholler, another a Souldier, a third a Sea-man, a fourth Mechanicall; and that ſome by one, others by other meanes raiſe, and aduance their eſtates. For this is the direction and ordination of diuine Prouidence.</p>
                     <p>2 That no man repine at his lot, in what grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſoeuer it hath fallen, but let him with all thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God, indeuour himſelfe diligently in the calling, whereunto God hath called him, to purſue both his owne particular good, and the good of the ſtate, in which he liueth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we are taught, that this is a lawfull, &amp; honeſt vocation, to trauell vpon the great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to practiſe and exerciſe Nauigation: for otherwiſe, this man of God <hi>Moſes,</hi> would not haue wiſhed them good proſperitie in it. Yet it falleth out, that euen this courſe of liuing alſo (as all other the moſt honeſt vocations that are in vſe on the earth) is often abuſed; yea it is thought
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:27564:30"/>
ſomewhat more then the reſt. The auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe obſerue, that our Sauiour Chriſt did expreſſe himſelfe to this Sea-tribe, more then to any of the reſt: For he was conceiued at <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> a city in the Portion of <hi>Zebulun,</hi> and in this city he was brought vp: hee beganne to preach firſt heere: and Mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> vppon which hee was transfigured, was in the Tribe of <hi>Zebulun</hi> alſo. The reaſon which they giue, is this, becauſe hee thought, that Tribe did moſt neede this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie direction of his doctrine, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of any of the reſt. Indeede thoſe places that doe confine vpon the Sea, and are Hauens for ſhippes, partly, in reſpect of the continuall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that they doe behold, and the grecuous loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of men and goods, which happen in ſight and heare-ſay, haue their hearts more hardened then others: partly, in reſpect of the ready paſſage to conuey away ſuch as haue deſerued euill, and are purſued by the Sword of Iuſtice, and ſo by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity are encouraged to offend, partly by the entertainement of ſuch as come thither with the ſpoile of their Piracies, and Sea-robberies, which commonly are as waſtefully rioted at Sea-towns, as they are deſperately, and with hazard gotten vpon the Seas, and partly by the importation of ſtrange and corrupt manners brought out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries, which Apiſh imitation can ſcarce forbeare to entertain and affect: ſurely, by ſome, or all theſe meanes, ſuch places are ſo corrupt, that they needed all this mercie of the Sonne of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:27564:30"/>
God. Therefore theſe abuſes in your calling, you that are graue experienced men, and that haue eminent place of charge, and authority in theſe affaires, may doe God good ſeruice, to make a conſcience of admoniſhing thoſe, that are vnder your commaund, of all theſe things: and heere in let Almighty God giue you both to <hi>will and to performe</hi> that, by which his bleſſed name may be glorified, both aboord, and aſhoare.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, wee are taught by the holy, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable example of <hi>Moſes the man of God,</hi> to wiſh <hi>Zebulun</hi> good ſpeede in his Voyages, and ſurely the prayers and well-wiſhings of Gods ſeruants, and the breath of charitable benediction, is an happy gale for all that goe to Sea. In vs it is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for they are our Brother-tribe, bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh. The Church, and the Common-wealth doe both beare a great Aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in euery veſſel, that goeth to Sea, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church doth teach vs to pray <hi>For all that trauell by land, or by water.</hi> The rather let vs wiſh them all good, becauſe Sea-loſſes are loſſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recouery commonly, that malice it ſelfe (me thinkes) ſhould not be ſo malicious, to wiſh that to periſh, by whoſe loſſe no aduantage commeth to him that ſuruiueth. Againe, theſe Aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers deſerue our charity, more then others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeeke their owne poore meanes of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their petty eſtates, in the general aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſtate, in which they are ſubiected: for what is the particular mans gaine, in compariſon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:27564:31"/>
of that good, which the Common-wealth recel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by the ſeruice &amp; employment of theſe men? Therefore it ſhall be very worthie of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charitie, to ſay to <hi>Zebulun, Reioyce O Zebulun in thy goings out.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to <hi>Zebulun,</hi> that is, to the Sea-men themſelues; it is moſt neceſſarie, that they haue the holie and deuout prayers of the Seruants of God; the paines, the vnreſt, the wants, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that they endure, are infinite, ſo that of all men that liue, none are more often, or more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly admoniſhed to prepare themſelues for death, then theſe men. I doe not ſpeake this, as though all were ſo well with vs aſhoare, that here were no danger at all. For many doe thinke, that it is little better then a deſperate aduenturing of ones ſelfe to goe to Sea: they feare the cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Cabbins, the infectious ayre of the ſhippe, the danger of drowning, they ſee no neceſſitie to enforce this hazard. To ſuch I ſay, and I ſpeake with griefe of heart, to ſee the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God vpon our Land, euen in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of a few yeares. For, did not our laſt great plague teach vs, that the open ayre of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, breathed no more health in her Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, then the cloſe Cabbins in a ſhippe, or the thicke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſet houſes in our greateſt Cittie? Did not the great floudes in diuerſe partes of our Land ſhew them, that dare not goe to Sea, for feare of drowning, how God can bring home the Sea to our houſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and drowne vs in our beds? Did
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:27564:31"/>
not the great Froſt, which paued our waters, as the ſtreetes of our great Cittie, teach vs, that God can as well puniſh vs with too little water, as too much. And did not the great dearth ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, in which wee felt the hardneſſe of mens hearts, not yet thawed, but keeping in prouiſion of corne, till the poore bring foorth their curſes vpon them, which God in Heauen heareth and ratifieth? Doth not this teach vs, that our Land, as plentifull as it is, and though it ſeeme ſurchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſtore, that it ſendeth much away, yet it may neede the helpe of other Countries, to ſupply her wants, and to put bread in the mouths of her children. To this purpoſe, let <hi>Zebulun</hi> weigh Anchore, and ſet-Saile; and God giue him ioy in his going out, and his returne.</p>
                     <q>Reioyce, O Zebulun, in thy goings out.</q>
                     <p>It is a lamentable thing, that any ſhould bee found in a Chriſtian Common-wealth voyde of this charitable well-wiſhing to Trauailers, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſiring that they might periſh in their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and neuer returne in peace to their owne places of habitation. To diſcourage any ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable hart, let me giue you an example, euen a fearefull preſident of Gods diſpleaſure expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on two men, two Chriſtians, two Diuines, two Preachers, two Biſhops, they were in their times,<note place="margin">Socr. eccl. diſt. 6. 13.</note> great, cleare and worthy Lights in the Church of God: the one was <hi>Epiphanius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtance</hi>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:27564:32"/>
the Metropolitane city of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> The other was <hi>Iohn Chryſoſtome</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who being at great ods, by reaſon of ſome difference in opinion; <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did ſaile from <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to ſpeake with <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and no accord being made there betweene them, rather their emulation and wrath mutually encreaſing, they parted, with this vncharitable exchange of moſt vnchriſtian imprecation. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iohn Chryſoſtome, I hope thou ſhalt not die a Biſhop: Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaid to <hi>Epiphanius; I hope thou ſhalt not returne aliue into thine owne countrey.</hi> The Lord that dwelleth in heauen brought theſe two iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon them both; for <hi>Epiphanius</hi> dyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord the ſhippe home-ward bound: and <hi>Iohn Chryſoſtome</hi> was depriued of his Biſhopricke, and died in exile.</p>
                     <p>Farre be this vncharitableneſſe, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of it from the children of God, from all profeſſed Chriſtians, and in ſtead heereof, let <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God teach vs, to wiſh <hi>Zebulun</hi> good paſſage, good ſucceſſe, good returne in his voyages. And now the rather, becauſe I haue<note place="margin">Anno 1609</note> not heard of any time, in our memorie, which hath ſhewed to vs more heauy and ſorrowful loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then haue happened of late. The Lord bleſſe <hi>Zebulun</hi> in his voyages, the Lord bleſſe his going out, and his returne, the Lord heare him in the day of his trouble, and the God of <hi>Iaacob</hi> mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defend him.</p>
                     <p>2 The Propheticall part of my Text, firſt doth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:27564:32"/>
fore-tell what ſeruice this Tribe ſhall performe to God: and that hath two parts of holy duety.</p>
                     <p>1 Concerning themſelues in their owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular duety to God: for they ſhall be religious, and ſhall <hi>goe to the mountaine:</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> and the holy Temple to worſhip there, though they doe dwell a good diſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from it.</p>
                     <p>2 Concerning others, <hi>They ſhall call the people to the Mountaine,</hi> and draw others, not onelie of their owne brethren, but of ſtrangers alſo, to the ſame ſeruice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their owne affection in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion. There muſt be a ground of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and a loue of religion, and a practiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in themſelues, before they can winne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and the often threatning of their life, hath a notable force, and ſtrength this way. For there is nothing doth more abette ſinne, then hope of long life. Nothing makth a man more truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, then expectation of death; and therfore men of wiſe and ſetled iudgement, doe vſe before they goe to Sea, to ſet their houſes in order, to diſpoſe of their eſtate, by their VVill and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make euen with God and the world, not becauſe they muſt, but becauſe they may die, they may die all together, and not one remaine, as in the loſſes, and land-wrecks of bleſſed <hi>Iob,</hi> to bring word, and to tell the heauy tidings of their loſſe: and who can tell how Death found them? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prouided for it, or aſleep? or drinking drunk? or ſwearing and curſing, and blaſpheming the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:27564:33"/>
name of God? or any otherwiſe offending: ſo carrying them preſently away to their iudgement and anſwer for all theſe things.</p>
                     <p>O happy is their preparation then, to whom no death can bee ſodaine, whenſoeuer it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. And to this purpoſe it is moſt requiſite, that <hi>Zebulun</hi> bee well grounded in his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe when hee is at the Sea, hee is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided from the Mountaine of the Lord, from the holie Temple, and the Congregation, and the aſſemblie of them which meete together, to heare the holie word of Almighty God: they that are thus remoued from the miniſterie of the word of God, had neede to conſider, how they are now left to the exerciſe and practiſe of that, which they haue learned already, and vnto the continuall reading, and meditation of the holie word of God.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe it is a godlie, and religious vſe that you haue aboord, to pray to God mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euening, with an vnited heart, and to ſing holie Pſalmes, to praiſe the GOD of your help and truſt, with a lowd and cheerefull voyce, and priuately, to beſtow houres of leaſure vpon the reading of ſuch good Bookes, as may ſtirre vp your zealous and religious hearts to a ſerious worſhip and ſeruice of your God. And bleſſed be the God which teacheth vs, wee haue helpes in this kinde for our vnderſtanding, and for our comfort in ſo great plentie, that wee cannot bee without great and iuſt blame, if we leaue this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:27564:33"/>
to God vndone. But it ſufficeth not, that <hi>Zebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lun</hi> be zealous himſelfe, he muſt do good with his zeale, and by all good meanes indeuour to win o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the knowledge, &amp; loue, and obedient ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his God. That doth <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo foretell.</p>
                     <q>They ſhall call the people to the Mountaine.</q>
                     <p>That is, they ſhall call ſheepe to the fold, or to the greene Paſtures, and ſweete riuers of waters: and this fruitfull pietie in them, ſhall ſhew ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the way to the houſe of the Lord, and ſhall tell them what things hee hath done for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that hee hath choſen to bee his inheritance.</p>
                     <p>This were an happy benefite to our Church, and a great honour to our Tribe of <hi>Zebulun,</hi> if our Maiſters and Mariners were ſo expert in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of the holy word of God, that they could winne others of forraine Countries to the loue of our Religion, and the forſaking of their owne ſuperſtition. This would bee ioy to both the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalems,</hi> the Church of God on earth, and the Congregation of Angells and Saints aboue. But it is much to be lamented, that our Sea-voiages, and the trauells of our Proteſtant gentlemen and others to forren parts, doth rather looſe vs many, to the two great agents for Sathans kingdome of darknes, the <hi>Turke,</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> then gaine vs any from them; &amp; that our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could but return home with the ſame Religion that they carry out with them, and that they would not buy the profites,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27564:34"/>
and pleaſures of forraine Countries, with the loſſe of their Religion, and the pollution of their conſciences, and the ſhipwrecke of their faith.</p>
                     <p>VVhen <hi>Epiphanius</hi> Biſhop of Conſtance was to part from Coſtantinople, where he miſliked many things, and that ſome of the City brought him to his ſhippe, he tooke his leaue of them in theſe words, <hi>Relinquo vobis hanc vrbem, hanc re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giam, hanc hypocriſin: Ego autem me hinc maturè expedio, valete.</hi> I leaue you this your Citty, this your Court, and this your hypocriſie, and I make all the haſte I can to be gone away from you, fare you well. So let all true Engliſh chriſtian and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious hearts, take leaue eſpecially of our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh aduerſaries: wee leaue you your great City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſeate of Antichriſt your holy Father, the vſurper of Gods right, your ignorant deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, your blinde guides, your idle and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious ceremonies, your diſſembling with God, and your deceiuing of men, and wee haſten from you with all ſpeede we can make: Fare you well.</p>
                     <p>This would become our proteſtation of faith well, and there is neede of all the caution that we can deuiſe, to arme our trauellers againſt the entiſing and bewitching perſwaſions, and tiring importunities of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for looke vpon the ſhew, and Religion looketh more like deuotion amongſt them then amongſt vs, anie man that commeth into their Townes, ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſee a face of Religion, and ſhall finde that the lawes of their Church, doe not creepe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:27564:34"/>
the lawes of their Church, doe not creepe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vpon the ground, amongeſt the common people onely, but they are bridles for Princes, and the greateſt States. They ſhall ſee that their grandes ſcorne not to forſake their horſes, and their coaches, to kneele downe in the ſtreetes and high-wayes, in all weathers, to worſhip their ſacrament, as it is Theatrically carried vppe and downe, whileſt all the many that are within the ſight of it, are vpon their knees, beating their breaſts, and caſting vp their eyes to Heauen, muttering of ſome of their blinde deuotions in a tongue that they vnderſtand not. Hee ſhall ſee them faſting in good earneſt, euen to the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their bodies, their hands ful of almes, and their ſeuere diſcipline drawing out of their owne backes, with moſt cruell ſelfe-whippings, and many vndertaking long Pilgrimages, in which they ſuſtaine exceeding great paines, and many wants. And they want not learned, and eloquent faire-ſpoken Ieſuites, and Friars, that can ſet foorth all this, to the vttermoſt, to perſwade ſtrangers to come vnto them. But amongeſt vs, it is too much contrary, it is hard for a ſtranger to finde out, whether wee haue anie religion, or not: for it is not eaſily diſcerned by our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. For, doe wee not liue, as if <hi>Bacchus</hi> were our God, in drunkenneſſe and ſenſuall ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Doe wee not ſweare and blaſpheme, as if there were no God to be angry with it; or as if the God whom we ſerue did delight in it, as a daily
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:27564:35"/>
ſacrifice? doe we tremble at any ſinne? or, do we labour to win any to righteouſnes? how hath the prince of darkenes benighted vs, that wee can ſee lewd and vngodly men, take vpon them the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſpeeches, and behauiours of honeſtie, and religion, and conſcience to ſerue a turne; and we feare to appeare like our ſelues indeed, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and religious in ſhew, as our heart is true to God. Perchance, becauſe men ſee Puritans ſo ſhaken vp, and their teachers depriued, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to make any ſhew of religion, for feare of being taken for Puritanes. No (beloued) let vs neuer be aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt, though powers and principalities oppoſe it: that euer will be, <hi>The power of God to ſaluation to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take heed of appearing what you are not, and take heed of concealing what you are. <hi>Si bonum</hi>
                        <note place="margin">If it be good to ſeem good, it is better to be ſo.</note>

                     <p>I beſeech you that are the heads of our tribe of <hi>Zebulun,</hi> that you would be careful of theſe things for your ſelues, and for your companies, of which you do take charge; that whereſoeuer you come, you may be knowne to be Chriſtians, and to bee Proteſtants, that it may be heard in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> which you ſing, that it may be ſeene in the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that you vſe, that it may be teſtified by all

your carriage in bargainings, in your eating, and drinking, and vniuerſally in your whole conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that you may ſhunne the diuell, and thoſe falſe Ieſuites and Prieſts which haue belyed our Land to the Aduerſary to be without Churches, our people without a God, or any forme of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And if any could returne home ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſucceſſefull in the cauſe of God, as to bring home but one of them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſuperſtition, to the ſincere worſhip of our God, that one ſoule won from the ſeruitude of Popiſh bondage, and reconciled to the Church of God, were the beſt, and worthieſt fraight that euer your veſſell tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; and the Church of God ſhould haue very great cauſe to reioyce, and clap their hands, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Truth is great and it preuaileth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe let vs bleſſe <hi>Zebulun</hi> with the bleſſing of <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God, and ſay, <hi>Reioyce O Zebulun, in thy going out, God of Heauen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper thy voyage,</hi> that in it <hi>thou mayeſt call the people of other Nations to the Mountayne of the Lord thy God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what ſhall <hi>Zebulun,</hi> and what ſhall the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that hee bringeth along with him doe at the Temple and Mount of God? Surely they ſhall not come empty-handed: For <hi>they ſhall offer the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of righteouſneſſe to the Lord their God there.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is that which <hi>Dauid</hi> requireth in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Offer to God the ſacrifice of righteouſneſſe, and call vpon the name of the Lord.</hi> Religion in theſe times of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was very full of ceremony, and ſo it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

long at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> by direction from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, as may appeare in the holie hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Exodus, Leuiticus,</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomie, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Sacrifices are called <hi>Sacrificia iuſtitiae,</hi> becauſe they were <hi>Sacrificia iuſta,</hi> that is, due Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. For, ſeeing God required them, they that offered them, merited nothing by them at the bands of God; they did but giue God his due, it was but the payment of a debt to him: or, they were called <hi>Sacrificia iuſtitiae,</hi> Sacrifices of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, in reſpect of Gods eye vpon them, which was not vpon the Sacrifices ſo much, as vpon the righteouſneſſe of the offerer of them to him. For God doth not reſpect <hi>quantum,</hi> but, <hi>ex quanto,</hi> not how much is in the hand, but how much is in the heart; not what is giuen, but with what zeale of Gods glorie, with what holy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: or they are called <hi>Sacrifices of Righteouſnes,</hi> becauſe all Sacrifices were types and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that true, and abſolute propitiatorie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which was once offered for all, euen IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST our righteouſneſſe.

                     <p>But now to ſort this Doctrine, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade this duetie to thoſe times, in which olde things are paſſed away, and all things are become new, let vs learne our duetie heerein of the holie Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. where hee ſaith, <hi>Yee are made an holie Prieſthoode, to offer vp ſpirituall Sacrifices acceptable to God by Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> And of all the Sacrifices that in the old Law were offred
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:27564:36"/>
to God, let the Holocauſt, or Burnt-offering be our example, for that reſembleth our holie and true mortification: for therein all was conſumed to aſhes, and nothing thereof was left. So ſaith Saint <hi>Gregorie Sunt quidam qui nihil ſibi reſeruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, totum Deo immolant.</hi> Againe, <hi>Omne quod ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, omne quod viuunt, omne quod ſapiunt, Deo offerunt.</hi> There bee ſome that offer all to God without reſeruation, all that they haue, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, is in their life, or in their knowledge. Of ſuch a man hee ſaith, <hi>Ipſe qui ſacrificat immolatur.</hi> He that ſacrificeth, is the Sacrifice. This kinde of immolation pleaſeth Almightie God beſt, this reſembleth the Sacrifice of IESVS CHRIST, who was <hi>Sacerdos &amp; victima,</hi> for he offered vp to the Father, himſelf, the price of our redemption.

                     </p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe is this your holie meeting in the houſe of God once by the yeare, that you may recount the manifolde, and gracious mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God vouchſafed to you in your voyages, in the protection of your perſons, and of your goods, in deliuerance of you from perills of the Sea, from perills of the Windes, from perills of Rockes, and Sands, from perills of profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and of falſe brethren. And for that hee hath bleſſed you with the bleſſings of the earth, both natiue and forraine, with the bleſſings of the Sea, and of the great Deepes. Aud that you may

for this offer vnto God ſacrifices of righteouſnes and pay your vowes to the moſt High, euen your ſacrifices of praiſe and thankeſ-giuing. I will conclude this point with the holie benediction of the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> which I pray God to giue to the whole Tribe of our Engliſh <hi>Zebulun,</hi> both at home and abroad.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lord heare you in the day of your trouble, the name of the God of Iaacob defend you.</hi>

                     <p>It is noted in the Sonne of this God, liuing on earth, that in the miracles which he wrought, he did worke more abundantly in the quantitie, and in qualitie made all things very good.

                        <p>Let the good ſeruants of God take comfort of this; that God is ſo rich in his mercies, and hath ſo enabled all creatures to the ſeruice of man, that the barren ſands of the ſea ſhall bee their ſtore-houſes, of rich treaſures, to retaine their wants.</p>

                     <p>Almighty God that gaue a being to the ſonnes of men, and wrote in the hearts of men, a Law of Nature, did not ſuffer his reaſonable part to be ſo much decayed in the ruines of our firſt Parents, but that men, ſo ſoone as they grew vp to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of themſelues, beganne to bethinke themſelues of, and ſhortly to apply themſelues to meanes of promiſing likeliehoode to giue them maintenance.</p>
                     <p>God gaue this light firſt, who turned <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, to till the earth, and ſolde the ſonnes of men, the fruits of the earth for the ſweat of their browes.</p>
                     <p>This made <hi>Adams</hi> ſonnes, and childrens chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fall to worke, <hi>Iubal</hi> in Tents, <hi>Iubal</hi> in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, <hi>Tubalcain</hi> in Braſſe and Iron.</p>
                     <p>Thus was the world kept in breath, thus were wants ſupplyed, and thus were many excellent things deuiſed daily.</p>
                     <p>All theſe be the <hi>wayes of man,</hi> the ſeuerall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in this life: <hi>Iſſachar</hi> for Burthens, <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulun</hi> an Hauen for Shippes: ſome trauailing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Land, ſome vpon the great Waters. In all theſe we behold;</p>
                     <p>1. That God who maketh vs, leaueth vs not ſo, but being created, hee taketh care to diſpoſe of vs alſo in the world: wee doe not come vnder the tree of <hi>Fortune,</hi> (as it pleaſeth the Painter to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:27564:46"/>
ſet it foorth) to take ſuch choice as befalleth vs, but God propoundeth vnto vs our courſe of life, and frameth our likings to it, ſo that wee giue it the name of <hi>Vocation,</hi> becauſe God calleth vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                     <p>This is giuen vs in precept; <hi>Let euery man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in that calling wherein hee was called.: Cor.</hi> 7. 20. And there is a gracious promiſe; <hi>Hee ſhall giue his Angells charge ouer thee, to keepe thee [in all thy wayes.</hi>] This the Diuell skipt in the quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Scripture, when he tempted our Lord, that it might giue vs hope, euen when we are out of our wayes, and doe things without the warrant of a lawfull calling. If you be in any euill way, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelues, that you are out of your way; <hi>for yee are not called by God to vncleaneneſſe, but to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 4. 7. Therefore, whoſoeuer liue heere by vnlawfull meanes, vniuſtifiable by the word of God, are all out of their way; and the faſter they goe, the further they flee from grace and glorie.</p>
                     <p>2. Wee may inferre properly, that if God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe men in all lawfull callings, he doth enable ſo many as he doth diſpoſe with vnderſtanding, iudgement, and diſcretion in ſome ſuitable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to the buſineſſe of that calling. For waies do imply walking: So he filleth <hi>Bezaleel,</hi> and <hi>Ahali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> with his Spirit to carue in wood, and braſſe, and for all curious needle-worke.</p>
                     <p>So that a naturall indiſpoſition to ſuch a courſe of life, or a naturall vnfitnes in vs, for it, is a great
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:27564:47"/>
argument to diſcouer our vndertaking ſuch a trade or profeſſion; for it is <hi>via:</hi> but not <hi>via tua:</hi> it is a good profeſsion, but not thy profeſsion.</p>
                     <p>Surely, the Lord faileth not them that do go aright: hee maketh <hi>their feete like vnto Hindes feete.</hi> Hee prepareth their way, and enableth them in their expedition, and facilitateth their iourney.</p>
                     <p>3. This painefull varietie of induſtrious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsions in the life of man, ſerueth to ſhew vs the reward of ſinne, for ſinne did put vs to all this paines, and neede found out Sciences, and Artes: this differs much from the pleaſing exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of <hi>Adam,</hi> in the ſtate of Innocencie, which was, to walke the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and to dreſſe that.</p>
                     <p>For hee could haue found himſelfe worke in that Garden, in the experience of many naturall Concluſions, whereof hee had the theorie and contemplation, in the perfection of his Image, but now by ſinne expulſed thence, hee was put into a courſer and homelier ſeruice. Thank ſinne for the trauell of your whole life: and when you groane vnder wearie burdens, and feele the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous length of painefull iournies, cry <hi>peccavi:</hi> for that hath brought vpon thee all this.</p>
                     <p>4 Let vs thanke our God, who hath by theſe our callings, ſet vs into a courſe: firſt, of thrift, both to relieue our neceſsities, &amp; to gather ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for poſteritie: ſecondly, of charitie to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the wants of our needy brethren, whom God

hath caſt vpon our charity, &amp; for whom we muſt labour: thirdly, of policie, to ſupport the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, in which we liue: For the Plough helpeth to ſupport the Crowne, and all lawfull vocations haue as a particular &amp; priuate gaine to the induſtrious agents themſelues, ſo alſo a moſt profitable reſultance to the Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>In which kinde the Merchant and the Mariner haue their ſpeciall right done them, to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men working <hi>bono publico,</hi> for the common good.

                     <p>An excellent example hereof Saint <hi>Luke</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in <hi>Paules</hi> voyage, where the danger was great, the ſhip laden, and the ſoules aboue 276, they had ſo ſore a tempeſt, that with their owne hands they caſt forth the very Tackling of the ſhip, <hi>Neither Sunne, nor Starre, for many daies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and no ſmall tempeſt lay on them, all hope that they ſhould bee ſaued was taken away,</hi> then God, by his Angell, promiſed to <hi>Paul</hi> by night, <hi>that hee would giue him all that ſayled with him:</hi> yet the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> did require, that they that could ſwimme ſhould caſt themſelues into the ſea, and eſeape ſo: others, ſhould lay hold on boords and broken peeces of the ſhip; ſo truſting vpon the promiſe of God that they did neglect no meanes of ſafety.</p>
                     <p>That wee may boldly truſt to him in times of danger, it is required that wee ſeeke him in faire weather, leaſt hee know vs not in a ſtorme: they that make no conſcience to offend God in their
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:27564:50"/>
mirth, doe loppe the tree which ſhould ſhade them from the Sunne-beames, and ſhelter them from a ſhower: they that prouoke God to anger, cut the bough they ſtand vpon, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues fall. It is holy policie, to maintaine friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe and loue with our God, that in the moſt growne Sea of tribulation, wee may <hi>Commit our way to the Lord, and truſt in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thinketh it the moſt <hi>reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, for vs to giue vp our bodies to him a liuing ſacrifice,</hi> to make a Preſent of our felues to God, and we cannot looſe by it.</p>
                     <p>It is recorded of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that whereas he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued great rewards of his Schollers, for his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them, <hi>Aeſchines</hi> a poore Auditor of his hauing nothing to giue him, ſaid; <hi>Quod vnum ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo, meipſum tibi dono, qui plus dederunt, tibi reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querunt plus.</hi> Hauing nothing elſe to giue thee in reward, I beſtow my ſelfe vpon thee; they that haue giuen thee more, haue left the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues more: and he did this to his owne great aduantage: for <hi>Socrates</hi> tooke it ſo kindly, that he anſwered him: <hi>Habebo curam, vt te tibi reddam meliorem quam accepi.</hi> I wil haue a care to reſtore thee to thy ſelfe better then I receiued thee. Our God requireth, ſaying, <hi>My ſonne, glue me thy heart.</hi> And <hi>Danid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt make me to vnderſtand wiſedome in the ſecret in my heart:</hi> ſo gaining by the giuing of himſelfe away to God.</p>
                     <p>But this is no ſufficient trial of our truſt in God, if wee onely truſt to him in reſpect of the good
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:27564:51"/>
which wee receiue from him. Sathan will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme againſt vs, that if Almightie God ſhall once puniſh vs, <hi>Then we will curſe God to his face.</hi> Therefore the triall of our Faith and Truſt, is in affliction and want, when wee are vnder the rod of God, when hee ſmiteth, and yet we praiſe his name, euen when we ſmart, and when our feare commeth.</p>
                     <p>This will be a good euidence for vs, that it is not becauſe wee are idle, that wee doe depend ſo confidently vpon God. It was the falſe chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> That they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to goe and ſerue their God, becauſe they were idle; and therefore hee put more worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Certainly, the Elect truſt in the Lord, ſo as they neglect no duety by him enioyned, but doe mingle Obedience with their Faith: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be many things which wee poſſeſſe in this world, which doe ſerue for good vſe; for helpe, for delight, for neceſſity, all of them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for our good; yet wee finde none of all theſe worthy to be truſted; <hi>Truſt not in Princes, nor in any ſonne of man: Ceaſe from man, whoſe breath is in his noſthrils; for wherein is he to be eſteemed?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truſt not in riches; <hi>If riches encreaſe, ſet not thine heart vpon them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truſt in God onely, hee can adde to thy ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hee is thy auncient acquaintance, he knew thee in thy firſt ſhapeleſſe infirmity, he faſhioned thee in the wombe, hee hath giuen thee breath and life to thy bodie, hee hath taken accompt of

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus did <hi>Dauid</hi> recomfort his diſconſolate Soule, <hi>why art thou ſo diſquieted within me? truſt in God:</hi> and ſuch a truſt it muſt be, as in this Pſalme is followed with good life: For <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing firſt perſwaded to <hi>truſt in the Lord, ver.</hi> 3.

                        <note place="margin">1 The work</note>Concerning the worke done, <hi>the Sea,</hi> it is a worke of that nature, that it hath in it, <hi>opera,</hi> and <hi>mirabilia,</hi> both Workes and Wonders: for here is.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>Miraculum in modo:</hi> a miracle in the maner of the operation. For as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith: <hi>eodem modo producitur balaena, quo rana, non laborat Deus in maximis, non faſtidit in minimis:</hi> he makes the whale as eaſily as the frog, he doth not trauell in the production of greateſt creatures, nor ſcorne the production, and creation of the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Miraculum in modo:</hi> a wondet in the knitting together of theſe two elements of water, &amp; earth in one ſphaericall and round body.</p>
                     <p>There bee foure things which make the worke of this creation of the Sea moſt admirable.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>Situs.</hi> The ſituation of the Sea, which God hath ſo wonderfully diuided from the earth, that wee may haue a drie land to dwell vpon, and yet ſo ioyned it to the earth, that it is one Globe with it.</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Motus.</hi> The ebbing and flowing of the Sea, which is the naturall Motion, and the violent Agitation of the great waters by the force of the windes: the firſt is rather diſputed then reſolued in the Schooles of natural learning, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is of all confeſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:27564:53"/>
                        <hi>Faetus.</hi> The breed of the Sea is yeelded to bee full of wonder, ſo many ſundry ſorts of fiſhes, &amp; they multiplying ſo innumerably, that the Sea is thought more rich in the varietie of creatures, then the earth, &amp; in the number more populous, and many of our creatures on earth daily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to reſemble thoſe on the ſhoare.</p>
                     <p>4 <hi>Vſus</hi> The vſe of the Sea is another wonder, for it is diuers, I wil limit my ſelfe; it is foure-fold: 1 Naturall, 2 Artificiall, 3 Morall, 4 Diuine.</p>
                     <p>In the naturali vſe of the Sea S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> noteth:<note place="margin">1 Naturall.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>1 It is <hi>Hoſpitium fluuiorum,</hi> the receptacle of all riuers: for as all riuers come from the Sea tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the ſecret paſſages of the earth, whereby the inward parts of the earth are humected, and the ſecret mines of the earth, which are hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, are hereby maintained: ſo do all riuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe to the Sea, and here they exonerate themſelues, whoſe ouerflow would elſe oppreſſe the earth, that they ſeem rather <hi>ad ſitim,</hi> to que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch the thirſt of the dry Land, then <hi>ad ebrietatem,</hi> to drowne it: Thus the earth is dreined, and the Sea is that common Sewer to carry away all the waſte thereof.</p>
                     <p>2 It is <hi>Fons imbrium;</hi> For from hence doth the Sunne exhale thoſe vapours which being bound vp in clouds, by the almighty hand of God, are by the ſame hand let loſe againe, to water the earth, and to refreſh the ſurface thereof, with the earely and latter raine, whereby the inheritance of God is cheered and repaired.</p>

                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:27564:54"/>
                        <note place="margin">2 Artificial</note>Secondly, the Art of man hath made the ſea vſefull, as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> obſerueth further, for ſundry purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is <hi>inuectio Commeatuum,</hi> it yeeldeth vs for food ſundry ſorts of fiſhes, both wholeſome, and delicate prouiſions, that the ſea contendeth with the earth both for plenty, variety, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is <hi>Copula diſtantium:</hi> For nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath by exportation and importation, made ſuch exchange of commodities of ſeuerall Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as hereby Marchandize, one of the ſtrong ſinewes of Common-wealthes, the riches and peace of ciuill States is maintained, and diſtant Nations heereby confederate.</p>
                     <p>The third is <hi>Compendium it ineris:</hi> For ſhipping doth make great burthens light, and long waies ſhort: And Art hath ſcatce brought forth two more admirable inuentions for common good, then the building of good ſhippes, and the naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in them.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is partly naturall, and partly artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, and it is <hi>Furoris impedimentum;</hi> for nature hauing digged this ditch betweene diuerſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, they are ſo much the more out of one anothers danger, ſeeing the preparation for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation, and ſea-fight, aske time, and giue the bloud leaue to coole, that paſſion cannot make ſudden incurſion, and the windes are at no mans command; and Art hath deuiſed both defenſes at Sea fit for the propulſation of an enemy in equall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:27564:54"/>
correſpondence, and fortifications aſhoare in fit landing places, to keepe off the enemie; all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to ſtoppe fury in the greateſt and moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent preſſure.</p>
                     <p>3 The morall vſe of the Sea in Nauigation, is alſo foure fold.</p>
                     <p>1 As Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, it is <hi>Secretum tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiae;</hi> the ſecret of Temperance: for there doe men liue priuately, content with ſmall cabbins, garments rather for neceſſary vſe, then vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſhew; foode no more then ſufficient: <hi>vtun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur mundo:</hi> men there doe but vſe the world to ſerue their turnes, and a little ſerueth them.</p>
                     <p>2 It is <hi>Exercitium continentiae:</hi> the exerciſe of Continence: for aſhoare the eye doth euill offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the heart, and it is the window of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence: one of the beſt conſeruators of holines in the heart, is <hi>priuatio obiecti,</hi> the want of that obiect which is full of temptation. <hi>Iob</hi> made a couenant with his eye againſt tempting obiects: at Sea men are remoued from this danger, and depriued of the meanes to offend, ſo the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is diſabled, &amp; the tempter vnweaponed: the things of this world turne often into <hi>facultates male agendi,</hi> inſtruments and abilities to offend, but the poore that want theſe, receiue the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: faire ſights, full meals, ſoft lodgings, and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, be Satans arms againſt the ſonnes of men.</p>
                     <p>3 It is <hi>Domus laboris,</hi> the houſe of Labour; men at Sea reſt by turnes, there is no ſhutting vp of doores, and all to bed: this labour doth make
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:27564:55"/>
their reſt ſweete, and their dyet wholeſome, and nouriſhing: ſurely worke is no where done with more ſpeed, and with leſſe feare of wind and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then at Sea; and the labours of the body bee armours of thr ſoule againſt temptations. Here is <hi>labor neceſsitatis,</hi> Neceſſity maketh euery man put hand to worke: and <hi>labor charitatis:</hi> charity maketh ſome to ſpell others, that ſome do watch, whileſt others ſleepe, and ſome labour whileſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſt.</p>
                     <p>Some haue compared a ſhippes company to a Common-wealth; I would our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth were comparable to a ſhippes company, euen for this, that we would be content to watch and labour one for another, all for the ſafety of the whole body: if in a ſhippe no mans ſafety is in ſingle care for himſelfe, but in the common good of the company; ſo is it in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth alſo: therefore no politike body can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, or make a good voyage, where priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects make prize of publique proiects, where the little finger will weare a Diamond, though the ſtomacke which feedeth all, doe want meate to ſuſtaine the whole body. This S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſwadeth, that he calleth the mutuall loue of Chriſtians, <hi>the bond of loue</hi> tying vs together.</p>
                     <p>4 It is <hi>Schola diſciplinae,;</hi> the ſchoole of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, for in a ſhip all men know their places, and ſeruice: and there be two waies in which men go; <hi>faciendo bonum,</hi> euery man doing his duety: or, <hi>patiendo malum,</hi> the offenders ſuffering worthie
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:27564:55"/>
puniſhment. Diſcreete Maiſters and Captaines haue ſuch encouragements for ſuch as deſerue well, and bilbowes, and the yard arme, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puniſhments for foule offenders; they haue ſpurres for the idle, and reſty, &amp; reſtraints for ſtay of the raſh and ouer-hardy. They find order to be one of the well-fares of their voyages, and ſome ſtormes within-boorde, as neceſſary to rouze vp their men, as fowle-weather without.</p>
                     <p>Many haue compared the Church of God to a ſhippe, both of our Proteſtant, and of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary-writers, but we do not both acknowledge one maiſter thereof. Our maſter is a maſter of the <hi>Trinitie-houſe,</hi> the ſecond Perſon in the holy <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi> God the ſonne, who hath called his Apoſtles &amp; Euangeliſts, and Diſciples, &amp; their ſucceſſors, the now miniſters of the word of God, to be Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters-mates in this ſpirituall Nauigation.

There is no difference of hands, but as all are made of the ſame ſtuffe, ſo they goe all to the ſame vſe; for in times of danger, euery man put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his whole ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wit to it to ſaue the whole, and in want of victualls, euery mans ſhare is alike: the force of weather beats vpon all alike: Nature euer carrieth an equall hand to all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> it fauours none more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the world is a flatterer, and putteth diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>

                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:27564:62"/>3 Vigilancy is taught here, for the charge of ſo much worth as the veſſel that houſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the goods that fill it, and the lines of thoſe perſons that menage and rule it is ſo great, that they ſhare and diuide the night, and time of reſt, amongſt them, to keepe continuall and carefull watch to preuent ſuch dangers as may encounter careleſſe and ſleepy negligence: O that in our Spirituall Nauigation, vpon the ſeas of this troubleſome world, our ſoules did keepe ſo true, and vnſleepy watch, to auoid all temptations that either, of our three dangerous enemies, the fleſh, the world, and the deuill, by the helpe of our owne corrupt concupiſence ſhall at any time ſuggeſt, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw vs from the obedience which wee owe to our God.</p>
                  <p>4 Expedition and diſpatch of preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is notably taught aboard your ſhippes, that which you do is directed and performed at once, and without delay: the counſell of the Maiſter is ſeene in the hand of the company, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on goeth the neereſt way from the head to the hand: preſent perill, requires preſent aduiſe, and execution: Make it your ſoules caſe with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and delay not your repentance, for the guſts and ſtormes of wrath and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, menace this veſſell of frailty with foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and ouerſetting.</p>
                  <p>5 Your ſhippes are the ſchooles of hardneſſe and patient endurance, high winds, rough ſeas, raging waues, cold nights, wet skinnes, parching
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:27564:62"/>
heats, thinne diet, hard lodging, watchings, and vntimely breakings of the houres of reſt; theſe be the familiar and ordinary gueſts, which Sea-men doe entertaine. And theſe they beare out with ſuch eaſie ſufferance, that they are fit for action and employment abroad, &amp; their ſeruice is made by this meanes profitable to the common-wealth in which they liue: And if you endure thus much abroad, to ſeeke your temporall goodes, let it not grieue you, nor any true Chriſtian, to put vp more ſorrowes for an eternall weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, graciouſly prouided for all them that ſerue the Lord in feare, and reioyce before him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence.</p>
                  <p>One thing more I remember as a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the furtheſt diſtance from home, and from any land, conſider how farre God hath remoued you from thoſe many and dangerous temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which aſhoare doe entertaine your eies and eares, and thoughts, with varietie of falſe delight and pleaſure, to divert and ſwarue your thoughts from grace and goodueſſe; and the better to giue way to this happy weaning of you from vanitie, it ſhall teſtifie well of your holie deſires that way, to make good choice of your companie that goe with you, that there be none of notorious euill condition: and for that, the example of king <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> in his houſe-gouernement is verie notable, make it your owne by imitation of it, and ſay; <hi>Mine eie ſhall be vnto the faithfull of the Land, that</hi>

                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:27564:63"/>
                     <hi>way he ſhall ſerue mee. There ſhall no deciptfull perſon lye aboord my ſhippe, hee that telleth lies ſhall not abide in my ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A maſter thus accompanied, a companie thus gouerned, a ſhippe thus managed, giue and take comforts by mutuall exchange. To ſuch a ſhippe is the vertuous Woman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by <hi>Salomon: She bringeth her Merchandiſe from farre away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſcond part of my Text ſheweth the riches of the mercie and loue of God, which in this compariſon appeareth moſt gracious: for you take all this paines for the meate that periſheth, and for the cloathes that weare out, and come to nothing; but there is yet a farre more worthie and noble diet then this. For, <hi>Man ſhall not liue by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> This <hi>Word of God</hi> is to be had and enioyed at home, without our trauelling to forraigne and remote parts. Thus Iſraell had it: thus wee haue it: By the <hi>Word of God</hi> is meant in this place, <hi>the Law of God,</hi> and ſo by conſequent the Goſpell: for <hi>the Law is our Schole-maſter to</hi> CHRIST. Theſe two bee the <hi>Rodde</hi> and the <hi>Staffe of the great Shepheard of our ſoules,</hi> IESVS CHRIST, with which he doth correct and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his flocke. This commoditie muſt not, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, bee valued by the deſire that men haue to it: For Merchants employ their ſtocke in thoſe things that may yeeld them the beſt market, and their tranſmarine wares are valued, according
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:27564:63"/>
to the want of them heere with vs: but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the <hi>Word</hi> of Almightie God is ſuch, as the greateſt part of the VVorld doe neglect and eſteeme no better of then <hi>Fooliſhneſſe:</hi> onely ſome few that haue made proofe thereof, haue found it to be ſuch an harueſt, that like vnto the couetous rich man in the Parable in the Goſpel: they haue not ſpared to pull downe the olde and narrow Barnes, and haue built new in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; euen new hearts, to receiue in the VVord of GOD, with an holie couetouſneſſe, ſtriuing to engroſſe, and to ſtirre vppe the commoditie thereof.</p>
                  <p>And this thriftie couetize, is an infallible marke of the Childe of God, as CHRIST our Lord and Sauiour hath expreſſed it, ſaying; <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods word: you doe not heare becauſe you are not of God, Iohn chapter</hi> 8. <hi>Dauid</hi> the Prophet had a perfect taſte of this ſweetneſſe, and well vnderſtoode how to value and eſteeme it, as the whole hundred and nineteenth Pſalme doth teſtifie for him; in which Pſalme hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth it to the honnie and the honnie-combe in ſweeteneſſe; aboue Golde, and that refined Golde in puritie: and aboue precious and rich ſtones in worth and price: And wee, if wee will prize it according vnto the neceſſitie wee haue of it, muſt needes giue the firſt place to this holy word of God. For there is no way to the Father, but that which it teacheth: there is no paſſage to life, but by obedience, that is taught in the word
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:27564:64"/>
of the Law. No obedience openeth heauen, and ſatisfieth Gods iuſtice, and reconcileth man to God, but the obedience of IESVS CHRIST: that is the argument and ſumme of the word of the Goſpel. Therefore aske CHRIST, <hi>What may I doe that I may haue eternall life?</hi> and hee wil preſently ſend mee to the word; <hi>Keepe my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, Doe this and thou ſhalt liue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If then we value commodities by the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vſe of them, the word of God chalengeth the firſt place, for there is no paſſage to the Father, but by IESVS CHRIST, and he is that word which was made fleſh for vs.</p>
                  <p>If wee value commodities by the profit, which they bring in to vs, the word of God doth carrie it away from all things elſe, ſeeing it is that which ſheweth to vs the way of euerlaſting life. When the Angell of God had looſed the Apoſtles out of priſon, their charge was this: <hi>Goe your way and ſtand in the Temple, and ſpeake to the people all the words of this life,</hi> that is, of life euerlaſting, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> being ſent for to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> the man of the houſe tolde him, that hee had ſeene an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell which bade him ſend for him, ſaying: <hi>Hee</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Actes 11. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall tell thee wordes whereby thou and all thy whole houſe ſhall be ſaued.</hi> And what commodity like the word then, ſeeing it were no purchaſe, to gaine this world, and all the riches of it, and to for feit our ſoules to iudgement and death.</p>
                  <p>If pleaſure ſet price vpon our commodities,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:27564:64"/>
what delight like to that which the word of GOD bringeth with it? <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth it the very <hi>ioy of his heart:</hi> and at ſuch time as his heart had moſt neede of ioy. For <hi>Except thy Lawe had beene my delight, I had euen periſhed in mine affliction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore when God threatned the ſinnes of his people, to bring vpon them the rodde of his wrath. Hee threatned not <hi>a famine of bread,</hi> nor a famine of water, but of the <hi>word of God,</hi> meaning to depriue them of all ſpirituall comforts, and to expoſe them to temptations, taking from them the ſword of the Spirit, the word of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ſhould bee armed to offend their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>We may therefore bleſſe the God of mercies, who hath opened to vs theſe rich treaſures of grace, that wee haue both the word of God it ſelfe in plentie, and no Nation vpon the earth hath more helpes to aduaunce Religion and pure Deuotion then wee haue: ſo that wee neede not ſend beyond the Sea for the word of God.</p>
                  <p>Indeede we are all afraid of that word of God, which is brought into our Land from beyond the Sea: for that is falſely ſo called, it is the word which commeth thence, that breedeth treaſons and inſurrections, which pioneth in the earth, and vnder the Parliament houſe, which buyeth, and congeſteth great quantities of gunne-poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which toucheth the Lords Annoynted Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and doth his Prophets harme, which tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Religion into Policie, Veritie into Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:27564:65"/>
and lies, charity into robbery, this word is written in the bloud of Princes.</p>
                  <p>And in this particular you are men that may do good ſeruice to God and his Church, to our Soueraigne and this State, if you eſtabliſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious orders in your ſhippes, if you confirme your company in the true ſeruice of God, that they may take no infection abroad by the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of contrary doctrine, if you keepe your company aboard, ſo much as may bee, in places of danger to our Religion, and keepe watch vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in your neceſſary employments of them a ſhore, that the flye of <hi>Aegypt</hi> blow them not, that the Romiſh ſpider, which ſpreadeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene nets, entangle them not, to inſpire them with the naturall vnnaturall poiſon of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</p>
                  <p>And further, if you haue eſpeciall care that there bee no importation of any dangerous bookes, or inſtruments of ſuperſtition, which being ſpread abroad in our Land, may infect the ignorant.</p>
                  <p>And moſt of all, if you keepe good watch vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch perſons, as ſhall deſire paſſage hither from beyond the ſeas; for an honeſt eye hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of a diſſembling preſence, and the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of a ſerpent, will ſoone detect the malice of a ſerpent: Take heart to you to doe theſe things, for God and your Country may haue moſt happy vſe of your good ſeruice herein: And your buſineſſe heerein is not great; for all idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:27564:65"/>
and enemies vnto the trueth of Almightie God, are Fooles, and they may be taken in the craftie wilyneſſe that they haue imagined: All this to keepe Idolatry out of our Land. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> which <hi>ſate weeping by the waters of Babel: They hung vppe their Harpes vpon the Willowes: for how ſhould they ſing the Song of the Lord in a ſtrange Land?</hi> VVee ſhall haue more cauſe of griefe, and leſſe patience to beare it, if euer thoſe ſonnes of ſtrangers ſhould come to ſing their Songs in our Land to make Muſique in our Church, and to ſet vp their <hi>Dagon,</hi> where wee haue now the Arke of Gods Couenant ſo well ſetled.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed be Almightie God for it, neuer ſince <hi>Ioſeph</hi> that buried the bodie of CHRIST IESVS our Lord in his owne graue, did firſt preach the Goſpel in this Land (as our Hiſtories doe make faith) had this Land leſſe need to ſend ouer Seas for the word of GOD: our Churches are many of them learnedly furniſhed with ſufficient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours. I dare ſay boldly and truely, neuer yet ſo well. Our Vniuerſities the Seminaries of the Church, are like fruitfull gardens, neuer more hopefully growen: our Libraries neuer ſo bookt with all kind of learning.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee haue had <hi>Manna</hi> for gathering, now many happy years of peace togither: the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is potent to aſſault, and cunning to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, and ready to ſurprize: the word of God is that double-edged weapon which hee feareth

moſt. They that haue it in a ſtrange tongue, haue it always ſheathed, it will not, it can not cut; they that haue it, and vſe it not, haue it not, becauſe they vſe it not. You ſee it is a bleſſing to haue it <hi>neare to you,</hi> there is no better light in obſcurity, or bridle in proſperitie, or ſpurre in ſtupiditie, or comfort in aduerſitie, then to haue this word <hi>neare you:</hi> let <hi>Cor</hi> be <hi>Cordus;</hi> your hart your ſtorier, <hi>os promus,</hi> your mouth the diſpenſer of this word: for <hi>with the heart man beleeueth this word to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and with the tongue man confeſſeth to ſaluation:</hi> ſo ſhalt thou be a conuert, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerter, becauſe thou beleeueſt, therefore thou wilt ſpeake, and thou being conuerted ſhalt ſtrengthen thy brethren.
