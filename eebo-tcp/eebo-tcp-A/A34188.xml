            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Bishop of London's
SEVENTH
LETTER,
OF THE
<hi>Conference with his Clergy,</hi>
Held in the YEAR 1686.</p>
            <p>UPON THE
KING's Letter, Dated 1685.
AND
Directed to the Two Arch-Bishops, with
Directions concerning PREACHERS.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LONDON:</hi>
Printed by <hi>Benj. Motte,</hi> 1690.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Good Brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am sure you must now be convinced, as I make
no question you was then, that nothing could be
more pernicious to Prince or People, than to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Duty of <hi>Submission</hi> beyond the bounds of
just Reason or due Patience; and that therefore the first
Article against <hi>Meddling with Matters of State,</hi> was a great
Inducement to me, to invite you to this Conference
upon the whole <hi>Directions concerning Preachers,</hi> which was
managed to this effect.</p>
            <p>YOU cannot but be every day more sensible than
other, how seasonable this Letter of his Majesty's was,
and how highly it concerns us to reflect upon it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there is nothing in it but what has been formerly
directed by his Royal Predecessors after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and yet the Matter is of that weighty consequence,
as not to be one jot the less necessary to be repeated at
this time.</p>
            <p>THE Reasons His Majesty urges, are from politick
Considerations, and so Reasons of State; but there are
others, which may be taken from Moral Topicks, of
that great consideration, that we may boldly say, <hi>The
King has not more Interest in them, in His Royal Capacity,
than the Ministers of the Gospel have in their Spiritual Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi>
For <hi>Disobedience</hi> is as reproachful to the religious
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106879:3"/>
as to the politick Person; <hi>Sedition</hi> as pernicious; and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>
as criminal.</p>
            <p>BUT to come to the purpose, I will pursue the Heads
we went through, as near the same order, and as much
to the same sense, as my Memory will give me leave:
We therefore considered the Directions under these two
general Heads, as
<list>
                  <item>I. Negative.</item>
                  <item>II. Affirmative.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. The <hi>Negative part</hi> is contained in the first three
Articles concerning,
<list>
                  <item>1. Matters of State.</item>
                  <item>2. Notional <hi>and</hi> School-Divinity.</item>
                  <item>3. Controversie.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, As to <hi>Matters of State,</hi> We are forbid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
limit or bound the constitutive Laws of the Realm
between Prince and People. Every Nation has its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Rights and Customs; the Decision of which belongs
ultimately to the Resolutions of Parliaments, as they do
ordinarily to the Exposition of the Judges. These
things depending upon ancient Customs, original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
and Constitutions contained generally in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Records, are quite besides our purpose; they come
not within the compass of our Studies, but are more
proper for Statesmen and Lawyers to meddle with; and
as they are of publick concern, so are they likewise of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106879:3"/>
publick Interpretation. However, should our Curiosity
lead us into an enquiry after them, their Doctrin would
by no means be a proper Subject for us to descant upon;
because our business is to teach a Christian Behaviour upon
all occasions, without entering into the Merits of any
Cause betwixt Prince and People. We have been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
above all other Countries, in having Kings, that
out of their Grace and Bounty, have made ample
Concessions for our Ease and Security, by so fixing
our Liberties and Properties, that we cannot be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in either, without the open Violation of a solemn
Oath. If therefore we would speak honestly to this
matter, we ought to do right to both Parties; and
then think but how improper and ridiculous this would
look out of a Pulpit, to be stating the secular Rights
and Privileges on both sides. But if we exalt the
Kings Prerogative above the Law, we do as good as
tell the People, that notwithstanding their Rights, the
King may ravish their Wives, spoil their Goods, and
cut their Throats at pleasure. And thus we should
pursue a Method the most contrary to the Mind of
God, that possibly could be: For it would prove a
Doctrin that might do much harm, and could never
do good; either it would alarm the People with an
apprehension that some Design were working against
their just Rights, (For which pernicious strain of Courtesie,
we may be sure a wise Prince, as ours is, would give
us small thanks, since the least Mischief we could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106879:4"/>
would be Dissatisfaction, Murmuring, Jealousie,
and a readiness to rebel.) or if it should operate as
we intend, if we intend any thing else by it, we
should hereby make a Halter for our own Necks,
by disposing Men to avow a Principle that should
invite their King to put a Yoak upon them. So that
I look upon it as a Rule, that we ought in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prudence to set our selves in this Affair; To be
as cautious of Flattering our Prince into Tyranny, as
of stirring up the People to Sedition and Tumult.
For we have scope enough without a servile Flattery,
to do our Prince right and our selves too, by preaching
up a peaceable and Christian Temper, to wait with
patience for the good effect of those ordinary Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
we have by <hi>Passive Obedience, Westminster-Hall,
Parliament,</hi> and what other Methods may be; which
if they prevail not, will produce that in God's good
time that may.</p>
            <p>Secondly, THE next thing we are cautioned against,
is <hi>Meddling with high notional Points,</hi> which rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
than edifie, and rather engender Strife and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
than procure Peace and Love. This is certain,
that whoever preaches after this manner, either wants
Discretion to make choice of more proper Subjects, or
else, vainly puft up by his fleshly Mind, prefers the
Magnifying himself before the Edification of his Hearers.
It is directly against the divine Rule, which says, <hi>The
Servant of the Lord must not strive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106879:4"/>WE are particularly warned against the Scholastical
handling of the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation,
which are Determinations appointed by the hidden
Wisdom of God's secret Methods. For indeed it is an
unpardonable Presumption in Dust and Ashes, which
cannot give a reason for the Growth or Colour of the
least Herb that grows, to handle these Points, which
have, and ever will be the Amusement of all Sects
and Religions under the Sun, as being the abstrusest
Parts of God's Workings towards the Children of Men.</p>
            <p>THERE are several other Niceties relating to the
Operation of the Spirit, and the Work of Justification;
the critical Resolutions of which, some, by too much
refining, have reduced to Air; and others, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to make too familiar, have rendered contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible.</p>
            <p>AND therefore it behoved our Superiors to give a
Check to the too bold and daring Spirits of some rash
Men, that they might be prevailed with, if possible,
to steer by a better Compass than that of their own
Brains, and rather keep out at Sea than hazard their
Skill too near the Rocks. Security and Satisfaction
attend the former course, but Censure and great Peril
the latter; the first may miscarry, but the other is next
to certain of doing so.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, THE last Negative Article seems to
discourage that sort of <hi>Controversal Preaching</hi> which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106879:5"/>
directs to the distinguishing Tenents of the several
Sects of Religion, as <hi>Popery, Presbyterianism,
Independency,</hi> &amp;c. in the managing of which, there
is such a Prudence and Discretion requisite, as is not
every Man's Talent. It is therefore very justly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised,
not to be hasty in entering upon such Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
but rather avoid the Invitations our own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
will be but too apt to draw us into. It is
the ready way to draw Attention, and gain a sort of
Applause, if we do but say sharp things and Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical:
For the more slightly the Controversie is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the better it takes, provided the Argument be
heightened with earnest Expressions or foolish Jesting.
But however this Style may be pleasing at the first
Accost, it can make no solid Impression to Edification,
which ought to be the End of all Preaching. It will
always be despised by wise Men, and do Fools no real
good. And yet there is another sort of Treating our
Adversaries, which is still worse, that is, <hi>foul and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling
Language;</hi> such Behaviour will either prejudice
our Cause, or at least render us contemptible, that
serve it in so dirtily.</p>
            <p>THE way to avoid this in a great measure is, not
to affect and force controversal Points upon a Text;
but rather forbear, till we are constrained to it by the
drift of the Subject we treat upon, or from the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Time and Place. All things are likeliest then
to proceed in the most reasonable manner, when they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106879:5"/>
flow most easily and naturally from the subject of our
Discourse. For then we are most apt to do wisely, and
speak like rational Creatures. We shall then be better
composed for the putting on of a Christian Spirit, in
Expressions of Compassion, Good Will, Gentleness, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
and whatever other Virtues may best soften
and steal into Mens Hearts. To tell a Man at the
first salute, that he is a Heretick, and is damned, is
to provoke Choler rather than Attention, and utterly
to frustrate our own Endeavours by frighting away
those that we would be thought to invite to us.</p>
            <p>BUT as we ought to be very cautious how we enter
into Controversie, and very careful in the handling of
it: so must we by no means be discouraged from it,
when there is occasion. It may so fall out, as to be
indispensibly necessary. <hi>If the Plague be begun in your
Congregation, you must make hast with your Censers.</hi> If you
see it approaching or hanging over, you must prepare
your People with the best Antidotes you can think of.
For Truth, tho it never fails in it self; yet is it very fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if you are not industrious to keep it with you. It
is the noblest Virtue in the World, and will be treated
accordingly.</p>
            <p>II. THE other General Denomination of these Articles
is <hi>Affirmative:</hi> where you are told what to do in order
to the more successful discharging your Ministry. And
this contains four Heads,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106879:6"/>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Catechising.</item>
                  <item>2. Acquainting the People with the Doctrine and
Discipline of the Church.</item>
                  <item>3. The Bishops being careful not hastily to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
Preachers.</item>
                  <item>4. To use all Persuasion and Authority to stop the
Licentious Practice of Profaning the Lords
Day.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. THE First is a Direction to the teaching of such
sort of Divinity, as may be most edifying: And this
is most justly presumed to be <hi>Catechetical,</hi> so that there
lies not only a Duty upon you to instruct Children in
the <hi>Catechism;</hi> but likewise to pursue the same Method
in your Sermons to them of riper years. By which
means you will best improve the first Principles laid
down, during the time of Childhood; in making your
Superstructure more sutable and of a piece with your
Foundation. It is indeed that course which most tends
to edifying: And that chiefly for these three Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. BECAUSE it admits of the plainest and easiest
Style. For it is not perplexed with Doubts or the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of refined Notions and learned Enquiries,
as all other Methods are; but goes directly to the
Point, in a plain familiar way sutable to the meanest
Understanding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106879:6"/>2. IT contains the fullest and most compleat Body
of Divinity. It has all that is necessary and nothing su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.
Other ways of proposing Religion, however
they may be more elaborate, and make a greater boast
to the World, through the contrivance of Humane
Wit; yet you will find their Original mean at least, and
sometimes base and degenerate. For either it smells of
the Schools, or else proceeds from Arrogance, Vain
Glory, or some such like foolish Passion: I do not say
this in reference to those necessary Attendants of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,
History, or the like, but to the plain Doctrinal
Point.</p>
            <p>3. IT has this Advantage, that it is more edifying,
and settles Men better in the most essential Principles.
For if you should preach to grown Men in another Style
than that by which you had instructed them in their
Youth, you would make them apt to despise the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-Work
of their Religion, and conceit themselves
entered upon another Ordinance. They would be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
to think the common Duties of Christianity only
incumbent upon Boys: And so whilst they become spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
Christians, to follow their own Lusts. What
swarms of Sects such Methods have visited the Church
of Christ with, Ecclesiastical History will tell, and the
sad Experience of our present Age afford too many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Instances.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore pressed with great Justice, that ye should
recommend to the People the most important Virtues of
a true Christian Behaviour, and urge them by your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106879:7"/>
as well as Doctrin, that their Practicableness, as
well as Excellency, may the more evidently appear. Ye
are likewise enjoyned to warn your Flock against those
Sins which are most prevalent in the present Age. For
the end of all Religion is to eschew evil and do good,
that we may glorifie God in our Souls and in our Bodies,
which are the Lords.</p>
            <p>IT is recommended to you, to take occasion now and
then in your Sermons, to explain the several Offices in
the Liturgy, that the People may the better pray with
their understanding. For they are composed with that
Gravity and true Devotion, that they could never have
fallen into that Contempt, they did in the late times, but
that Men generally were not so well possessed of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and reason of them, as they ought to have been. And
therefore there is another thing needful to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and that is carefully and distinctly to read Divine
Service. For it is a Paraphrase upon the Text, to read
it sensibly, and with a due Emphasis.</p>
            <p>II. THE next is the reading the 39 Articles and the
Canons, yearly at least, to the People, which is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
as early as the Canons and Articles themselves.
And good reason there was for it.</p>
            <p>THAT which distinguishes Christians from other
Sects is the Articles of our Religion, the which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
professes to believe, is a Member of Christ's visible
Church. So that it is necessary for every Christian to be
well informed of them. Not that every Article in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106879:7"/>
39 obliges to an explicit belief: It is enough for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, that they are not opposed. However they
are so instructive all of them, that they do in short give
the People Marks, by which they may judge more
easily, whether or no they that preach, deliver Sound
Doctrine: And they that preach may the better be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
how to speak in the Style of the Church,
thereby to preserve that Harmony and Consent, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the Apostle in <hi>speaking the same things,</hi> 1 Cor.
1. 10. And thus giving the same sound, People may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Distraction know how to perform their Duty.</p>
            <p>THE outward Adornment of this Doctrine, is to
have all things done decently and in order; the World is
constituted and governed by Order, and God is the God
of it. This is the Discipline contained in our Canons,
which adds Strength to our Faith, and Life to our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
For where we find Peace and Concord, we are
inclin'd to believe, that God is there, and our brotherly
Love is encouraged by such Agreement. It directs every
one to his proper Post, and places all in that Harmony
and Consent, and unites and knits them together in such
close Order, that they stand like a Wall against their
Enemy in the Day of Tryal. Ye cannot study these
Rules too much, since they are those by which ye ought
to walk in all your outward Behaviour towards your
Flocks. They are the Directions for the Peoples Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
that they may avoid the mutual Offence which
Disorder and Licentiousness would cause among them.
And therefore it is highly necessary they should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106879:8"/>
with them; that they may not think the Church-Discipline
to be a Device of their immediate Pastor, nor
excuse their Irregularity upon pretence of Ignorance.</p>
            <p>III. ANOTHER Injunction is concerning <hi>Licences</hi> to
<hi>Preach:</hi> That care should be taken who are Licensed,
and that it be only during pleasure. It is thought requisite
likewise, that none for the future but the Arch-Bishop or
Bishop of the Diocess do License, as being the most proper
Judges. But this is a matter so highly concerns your Ministry,
that it requires a very serious and distinct Observation, to
weigh in what Latitude these Words are to be allowed.</p>
            <p>THE Preaching of the Gospel is expressed severally;
but there are but two Expressions that have any consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
difference: The first is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifies the
plain denouncing of the Gospel, be it what it will: The
other is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which includes the Merits of what is
preached, by giving it the Style of Good Tidings.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, that Consideration which must give you
your Measures, is carefully to distinguish the difference
betwixt the Preaching of the Apostles, and that of their
Successors. The Apostles laid the Foundation. <hi>Built
upon the foundation of the Apostle and Prophets,</hi> Eph. 2. 20.
It is very true, they built on, as occasion served: But
their great Work was to discover the glad Tidings of the
Gospel to all Mankind. <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the
Gospel to every creature.</hi> Mar. 16. 15. And therefore it is
that S. <hi>Paul</hi> assumes to himself, as an Apostle, a share in
the Foundation-work. <hi>I have laid the foundation, and another
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106879:8"/>
buildeth thereon.</hi> I Cor. 3. 10. It must be acknowledged at
the same time, that the Apostles did upon occasion exercise
the ordinary ministerial Functions, but with this Caution,
<hi>I baptized also the houshold of</hi> Stephanus: <hi>Besides I know not
whether I baptized any other. For Christ sent me not to baptize,
but to preach the Gospel.</hi> I Cor. 1. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER it is certain, whether the Apostles had
exercised it or no, that whoever had the supreme and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Power, had likewise that which was ordinary
and common to other Ministers of the Gospel. For most
certainly whatever Power remains to you, ye have it as the
Apostles Successors. And therefore ye ought to distinguish
between that Authority which ended with the Apostles,
and that which is derived down to the Ministers of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Generations.</p>
            <p>1. THE universal Jurisdiction they had, was peculiar
to them. For tho every Bishop is a Bishop of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church; yet he is not an Universal Bishop. He is a
Bishop every where; but has ordinary Power to act on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
within his Diocese.</p>
            <p>2. THE Power of working Miracles and miraclous
Gifts of Tongues, Prophecies, &amp;c. were complete only
in the Apostles. In the Infancy of the Church others had
these Gifts; but it was in part, one after this manner and
another after that, till in process of time all ceased.</p>
            <p>3. THEIR Dictates were infallible; so as whatever
they said or writ was certainly true, because they were
inspired of God. This, none after them ever pretended
to, except Impostors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:106879:9"/>THEREFORE we have nothing to do with these
three Qualifications; which God hath judged to be more
proper for Foundation-work than Superstructure, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
the Church than to continue it so established. So
that to us is left only the Power of executing what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
settled, and the improving what we have before us
to the best advantage.</p>
            <p>1. OUR Call is of the same nature of that with the
Apostles. Christ sent them, they ordain'd others, from
whom has been derived a Succession to this Day. It is
true, their inward Mission was much more glorious than
ours, the Call more clear and powerful, adorn'd with
divers Gifts; but ours comes from the same Fountain.
For if we enter in by the Door, and are true Pastors, we
were inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon
us the Ministry of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>2. WE have a Power to Ordain others to succeed us, as
the Apostles had.</p>
            <p>3. WE have a power to preach the Gospel, tho but
at second hand: For we preach but what they delivered
down to us, and what we add by way of Explanation,
or what may be agreeable to that, which has been left
with us. And this not as secure from all mistake, but
according to our best Skill with the ordinary help of God's
Grace and our own Sincerity.</p>
            <p>4. THE Administration of the Sacraments, and the
performance of other religious Rites are incumbent upon
us, as well as they were upon the Apostles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106879:9"/>5. AND the Power of the Keys is delivered to us down
from their hands; whereby the Discipline of the Church
is committed to us, for the Correction of those that do ill,
by Excommunication; and the Comfort of those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
by receiving them into Communion.</p>
            <p>THIS being the Case; we must allow the Apostles
an uncontrolable Authority. For it was necessary from
the consideration of what state the World was in. The
World was in darkness, and under the shadow of Death:
When Christ, who is the Fountain of Light sent his
Lights into the World to direct into the way of Life. He
gave them Power accordingly to command the Elements,
and do Miracles at will; that the grossest Opposers might
by silenc'd, if not convinc'd. Ye may see the Conflict
they had with the World by what S. <hi>Paul</hi> says to the
<hi>Ephesians. We wrestle against principalities, against powers,
against the Rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
wickedness in high places,</hi> Ch. 6. v. 12. And the bold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of it. <hi>Our weapons are mighty through God to the
pulling down of strong holds: casting down imaginations, and
every high thing that exalts it self against the knowledge of God,
and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
and having in a readiness to avenge all disobedience.</hi> 2 Cor. 10.
4, 5, 6. This was the Work and this the success of it.</p>
            <p>BUT our Authority is not attended with such a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
and unerring Power. We may be deceived, and may
deceive. Therefore are we under a coercive Power, may be
restrained from the exercise of our Functions, and ought
for Peace and Orders sake to submit to it. We have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106879:10"/>
but it is subordinate; we have Power, but it is
controlable. Therefore is it to be no surprize to you, if
ye are not left absolute Judges of the executive extent of
your Power: But that where ye have no reason to look
upon your selves as in a state of Persecution, ye are bound
to submit to the restraints of your Superiours. I say then,</p>
            <p>1. WHERE I am forbid upon an account, which I
think to be to the intolerable prejudice of Religion in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or Discipline, and that no Appeal can be had by
reason of a general defection: There I put my self, but
at the dreadful peril of being in the right, into a state of
Persecution, and know Canonical Obedience no longer.</p>
            <p>2. IF the wrong go no farther than your own Persons,
ye ought to bear it patiently, and seek no farther, than by
Appeal, if it may be had.</p>
            <p>3. IT makes a great difference in this consideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ye are only under the general Obligation of your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
or have the Incumbency of a Cure of Souls: Since ye
may upon easier Terms be tyed up under the first Capacity,
than under the second.</p>
            <p>BUT I say not this to quarrel with the Article, which
I look upon to be of great use: For it would be an Affront
to God's Word, to let some have the handling of it. And
if it be asked, Why then have ye such scandalous Priests?
I answer with another Question, Why then have ye such
scandalous Maintainance in many places? Besides there
may happen such times, that the State may be concerned
to put Restraints upon Preaching, to hinder Trumpets of
Rebellion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:106879:10"/>IV. THE last Article is that which at all times ye
ought to be concerned for: To see that the Solemn Day
of our Religious Worship be observed, as becomes sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Professors. But most especially at this time it lies
upon us to apply double Diligence. For this Indulgence
which the King has granted, upon the notion of having
a Dispensing Power in himself, has been so little consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in reference to the abuse wicked and profane Men will
make of it: That it has laid the Lord's Day open to
all Contempt imaginable. We have already the sad
experience of it. Worldly People stay at home on that
Day and attend their secular Affairs: The Loose and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
lye at the Alehouse; and every one that fears not
God, takes occasion to be an Offence to those that do.
As to what Remedies we should use to prevent these Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
as much as may be: I think we fully considered
in our last Conference before this, whither I refer you.</p>
            <p>ALL therefore that I shall add, is to remind you,
of what ye were at the time of our Conference so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:
That greater Care could not be taken, than
what every Circumstance of the present time stands in
need of: We have a Prince of another Religion, who
for that reason cannot choose but be most influenced by
our Adversaries: And what the Mercies of that Religion
are, when exercised to the height, ye all very well know.
What if we have His Royal Word never so solemnly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
There is no reason we should expect it farther to be
made good, than we on our parts suitably behave our
selves. If we be a lessening, hindrance or discredit to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106879:11"/>
our own Religion by disorderly Walking, supine Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
or any other Fault: to be sure he will then think
it just to abandon us, as a lost sort of People that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
no pity, but have forfeited all claim to his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
In which case to be sure he will set himself to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
that, which his affection must necessarily most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
him to. The least we can expect from one so wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to that Religion, is that he should promote it all he
could. And therefore should we make any default, it is
but reasonable for us to expect, that he should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to rid ours out of the way. Nay, should we be any
ways careless or foolish at this time, it would be to play
the Game into our Enemies Hands; who would not fail
to make use of that Advantage to lead or drive away our
Flocks, and leave us useless Shepherds. And what a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Reproach would this be to us in this World, and what
a dreadful Sentence would it draw upon us in the next!
Therefore my daily Prayer shall be, and I hope yours
will be so too, that we may be couragious in this day
of Tryal, and behave our selves like Men.</p>
