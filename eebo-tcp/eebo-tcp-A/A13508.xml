            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>A Pamphlet (Reader,) from the presse is hurld,</l>
               <l>That hath not many fellowes in the world:</l>
               <l>The maner's co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon, though the matter's shallow,</l>
               <l>And 'tis all true, which makes it want a fellow.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And because I would not haue you either guld of your mony, or deceiued in expectation, I pray you take notice of my plaine dealing; for I haue not giuen my booke aswelling bumbasted title, of a promising inside of newes; therefore if you looke for any such matter from hence, take this warning, hold fast your mony, and lay the booke downe: yet if you do buy it (I dare presume) you shall find somewhat in it worth part of your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; the troth is that I did chiefely write it, because I am of much acquaintance, and cannot passe the streets, but I am continually stayed by one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to know what newes, so that sometimes I am foure houres before I can go the length of too paire of butts, where such non-sence or sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb facs="tcp:18885:3"/>
questions are propounded to me, that calles many seeming wise mens wisedoms in question, drawing aside the curtaines of their vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iug, and laying their ignorance wide open. First <hi>Iohn Easie</hi> takes me, and holds mee fast by the fist halfe an houre, and will needes torture some newes out of me from <hi>Spinola,</hi> whom I was neuer neere by 500 miles; for hee is in the <hi>Pallatinate</hi> country, and I was in <hi>Bohemia.</hi> I am no sooner eased of him, but <hi>Gregory Gandergoose,</hi> an Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Gotham</hi> catches me by the goll, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if <hi>Bohemia</hi> bee a great towne, and whether there be any meare in it, and whether the last fleet of shipps be ariued there: his mouth being stop'd, a third examines mee boldly, what newes from <hi>Vienna,</hi> where the Emperours army is, what the Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> doth, what is become of Count <hi>Buquoy,</hi> how fares all the Englishmen; Where lies the King of <hi>Bohemiaes</hi> forces, what <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> doth, what tydings of <hi>Dampeier,</hi> and such a tempest of inquisition, that it almost shakes my patience in pieces. To ease my selfe of all which, I was inforced to set pen to paper, &amp; let this poore pamphlet (my harrald or nuntius) trauell &amp; talke,
<pb facs="tcp:18885:3"/>
whilst I take my ease with silence. Thus much I dare affirme, that whosoeuer hee or they bee, that do scatter any scandalous speeches against the plenty in <hi>Bohemia</hi> of all manner of needfull things for the sustenance of man and beasts, (of the which there is more aboundance then euer I saw in any place else) or whatsoeuer they bee that report any ill successe on the Kings party, this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle booke, and I the Author doth proclaime and proue them false lyers, and they are to be suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for coyning such falshoods, as no well-willers to the <hi>Bohemian</hi> prosperity. One thing I must entreate the Readers patience in reading one hundred lines; wherein, I haue kept a filthy stirre about a beastly fellow, who was (at my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>England,</hi> a piece of a <hi>Graues-end</hi> Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) at which time hee did mee such wrong, as might haue drawne my life in question; for hee falsly sayd that I would haue fired their Towne. I did promise him a ierke or two of my penne at my returne; which now I haue performed, (not out of any mallice, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would bee as good as my word with him.) Thus crauing you to reade if you

like, and like as you list. I leaue you a booke much like a pratling Gossip, full of many words to small purpose.</p>

               <l>Their steeple, (like an instrument vnstrung,)</l>
               <l>Seem'd (as I wish all scolds) without a tong,</l>
               <l>Their bonfires colder then the greatest frost,</l>
               <l>Or chiller then their charities (almost)</l>
               <l>Which I perceiuing, sayd I much did muse,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Graues-end</hi> did forget the thankfull vse,</l>
               <l>Which all the townes in <hi>England</hi> did obserue;</l>
               <l>And cause I did the King of <hi>Brittaine</hi> serue,</l>
               <l>I and my fellow, for our Maisters sake,</l>
               <l>Would (neere the waters side) a bonfire make;</l>
               <l>With that a Scotch man, <hi>Tompson</hi> by his name,</l>
               <l>Bestowed foure faggots to increase the flame,</l>
               <l>At which (to kindle all) a <hi>Graues-end</hi> Baker,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18885:6"/>Bestowed his bauine, and was our partaker:</l>
               <l>We <hi>18</hi> foote from any house retir'd,</l>
               <l>Where we a iury of good faggots fir'd;</l>
               <l>But ere the flame, or scarce the smoake began,</l>
               <l>There came the fearefull shaddow of a man,</l>
               <l>The Ghost or Image of a Constable,</l>
               <l>Whose frantick actions (downeright dunce-stable,)</l>
               <l>Arm'd out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> with <hi>Bacchus</hi> bounty:</l>
               <l>(Of which ther's plenty in the <hi>Kentish</hi> county,)</l>
               <l>His adle coxcomb with tobaco puff'd`</l>
               <l>His guts with ale full bumbasted and stuff'd,</l>
               <l>And though halfe blind, yet in a looking glasse,</l>
               <l>He could perceiue the figure of an asse;</l>
               <l>And as his slauering chapps non-sense did stutter,</l>
               <l>His breath (like to a iakes) a sent did vtter,</l>
               <l>His leggs indenting scarcely could beare vp,</l>
               <l>His drunken trunk (o're charg'd with many a cup.)</l>
               <l>This riff raff rubbish, that could scarcely stand,</l>
               <l>(Hauing a staffe of office in his hand,)</l>
               <l>Came to vs as our fire began to smother,</l>
               <l>Throwing some faggots one way, some another,</l>
               <l>And in the Kings name did first breake the peace,</l>
               <l>Commanding that our bonfire should succease.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Sotchman</hi> angry at this rudnes done,</l>
               <l>The scattered faggots, he againe layd on:</l>
               <l>Which made the demy Constable go to him,</l>
               <l>And punch him on the brest, and outrage do him;</l>
               <l>At which a cuffe or twaine were giuen, or lent,</l>
               <l>About the eares, (which neither did content.)</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18885:6"/>But then to heare how fearefull the asse braid,</l>
               <l>With what a hideous noyse he houl'd for aid,</l>
               <l>That all the ale in <hi>Graues-end,</hi> in one houre,</l>
               <l>Turn'd either good, bad, strong, small, sweete, or soure:</l>
               <l>And then a kennell of incarnate currs,</l>
               <l>Hang'd one poore <hi>Thomson,</hi> like so many burrs;</l>
               <l>Haling him vp the dirty streetes, all foule,</l>
               <l>(Like diuells pulling a condemned soule.)</l>
               <l>The Iaylor (like the grand deu'll) gladly sees,</l>
               <l>And with an itching hope of fines and fees,</l>
               <l>Thinking the Constable, and his sweete selfe,</l>
               <l>Might drinke and quaffe with that ill gotten pelfe;</l>
               <l>For why such hounds as these, may if they will,</l>

               <l>And with authority the peace first breake,</l>
               <l>VVith Lordly domineering or'e the weake,</l>
               <l>Committing (oft) they care not whom or why,</l>
               <l>So they may exercise themselues thereby,</l>
               <l>And with the iaylor share both fee and fine,</l>
               <l>Drowning their damned gaine in smoake and wine:</l>
               <l>Thus hirelings Constables, and iaylors may,</l>

               <l>I say they may, I say not they do so,</l>
               <l>And they know best if they do so or no.</l>
               <l>They hal'd poore <hi>Thomson</hi> all along the streete,</l>
               <l>Tearing him that the ground scarce touch'd his feete,</l>
               <l>Which he perceiuing, did request them cease</l>
               <l>Their rudenes, vowing he would go in peace,</l>
               <l>He would with quietnesse go where they would,</l>
               <l>And prayed them from his throate to loose their hold.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18885:7"/>Some of the townesmen did entreat them there,</l>
               <l>That they their barbarous basenes would forbeare,</l>
               <l>But all entreaty was like oyle to fire,</l>
               <l>Not quenc'd; but more enflam'd the scuruy squire.</l>
               <l>Then they afresh began to hale and teare,</l>
               <l>(Like mungrell mastifes, on a little Beare,)</l>
               <l>Leauing kind <hi>Tompsom</hi> neither foote or fist,</l>

               <l>Who being thus opprest with ods and might,</l>
               <l>Most valiant with his teeth, began to bite,</l>
               <l>Some by the fingers, others by the thumbs,</l>
               <l>He fang'd within the circuit of his gummes;</l>
               <l>Great pitty'twas his chapps did neuer close,</l>
               <l>On the halfe Constables, cheekes, eares, or nose;</l>
               <l>His seruice had deseru'd reward to haue,</l>

               <l>Yet all that labour had away bin throwne,</l>
               <l>Through towne and country he's already knowne;</l>
               <l>His prisoner, he did beate, and spurn'd and kick'd,</l>
               <l>He search'd his pockets (I'le not say he pick'd)</l>
               <l>And finding (as he sayd) no mony there,</l>
               <l>To heare how then the bellwether did sweare,</l>
               <l>And almost tearing <hi>Tompson</hi> into quarters,</l>
               <l>Bound both his hands behind him with his garters,</l>
               <l>And after in their rude robustious rage,</l>
               <l>Tide both his feete, and cast him in the cage,</l>
               <l>There all night he remained in lowsie litter,</l>

               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18885:7"/>But for a bonfire in fit time and place,</l>
               <l>To be abus'd and vs'd thus beastty base.</l>

               <l>Ran like a towne bull, roring vp and downe,</l>
               <l>Saying that we had meant to fire the towne;</l>
               <l>And thus the diuell his maister did deuise,</l>

               <l>Saying that I to fire their towne was cheife.</l>
               <l>I bore the wrongs as patient as I might,</l>
               <l>Vowing my pen should ease me when I write;</l>
               <l>Like to a grumbling cur, that sleepes on hay,</l>

            <p>Sunday the 26 of <hi>August</hi> we set sayle from <hi>Graues-end,</hi> and with various windes, some large and some scarce, we happily past the seas, and sayled vp the riuer of <hi>Maze,</hi> by the <hi>Brill,</hi> and on the wednesday following I ariued at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> at which time the worthy regiment of the right honorable Colonell Sir <hi>Horace Veare,</hi> and the two noble Earles, of <hi>Essex,</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> departed from thence in Martiall Equipage toward the Pallatinate Country, whose Heroick and Magnanimous endeauors, I beseech the Lord of hosts, and God of battells to direct and blesse.</p>
            <p>The same day, I went to the <hi>Hage,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Leyden,</hi> where I lodged all night, and the morrow being thurseday the 30 of <hi>August,</hi> I sayled from <hi>Leyden,</hi> to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> where I saw many things worthy the noting, but because they are so neere and frequent to many of our Nation, I omit to relate them, to auoid teadiousnes: but on the friday at night I got passage from thence towards <hi>Hambrogh,</hi> in a small hoy, in the which wee were weather-beaten at sea three dayes and nights before wee ariued there.</p>
            <p>Saterday the eight of <hi>September</hi> I left <hi>Hambrogh,</hi> and being carried day and night in waggons, on the mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night following I came to an ancient towne called
<pb facs="tcp:18885:8"/>
               <hi>Heldesheim,</hi> it standeth in <hi>Brunswick</hi> land, and yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Bishop of <hi>Collin,</hi> where I did obserue in their <hi>Doome Kirke,</hi> or Cathedrall Church, a crowne of siluer 80 foote in compasse, hanged vp in the body of the Church, in the circuit of which crowne were placed 160 wax candles, the which on festiuall dayes, or at the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of some high ceremonies are lighted to lighten their darknesse, or their ignorance, chuse yee whether.</p>
            <p>Moreouer there I saw a siluer bell in their steeple, of six hundred and 30 l. weight, and the Leades of their steeple, shining and sparkling with the Sun beames, they did affirme to mee to bee gold, the truth of which I am doubtfull of.</p>
            <p>In this towne I stayed foure dayes, and on friday the 14 of <hi>September,</hi> I went six dutch miles to the strong towne of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> where by reason of my short stay, which was but two houres, I obserued nothing worthy of memory, but their triple walls, and double ditches, their artillery and fortifications, which they thinke to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable; besides, there I saw an old house of the Duke of <hi>Brunswicke,</hi> with the statue of a golden lyon, of a great bignesse, standing aloft vpon a piller, with the broken walls, and houses, which the Dukes Cannon hath left there six yeares since, as tokens and badges of his fury, and their rebellion.</p>
            <p>From thence on the morrow I went one dutch mile further, to an ancient towne called <hi>Wolfunbuttle,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Brunswick</hi> keepes his Court, in the which I and my fellow could get no further admittance, then ouer a bridge into his outtermost, or base court; for his souldiers, seeing vs with swords and pistolls, were feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb facs="tcp:18885:9"/>
belike, that wee would haue taken the fortresse from them, and therefore though wee were but two English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet they durst not let vs enter; which made men call to remembrance the frequent, and dayly Egresse and Regresse, that all people and nations haue to his Maiesty royal Court of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> where none that are of any good fashion or aspect are debar'd entrance: when those inferiour Princes houses are garded with hungry Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdiers, and reuerend rufty bil-men, with a brace or two of hot shots, so that their pallaces are more like prisons, then the free &amp; noble courts of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>manding potentates.</p>
            <p>After two dayes entertainment at <hi>Wolfunbuttle,</hi> with an English Merchant residing there, of good fame and credit, named Maister <hi>Thomas Sackuille,</hi> I wish my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my fellow <hi>Tilbery,</hi> and another man in my company departed from thence on foote, onward on our iourny towards <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in which trauell, what occurrences hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and what things of note I saw, were as followeth.</p>
            <p>Passing with many weary steps, through the townes of <hi>Rosondink, Remling, Soolem, Hessen Darsam,</hi> and <hi>Haluerstade,</hi> (which is all in <hi>Brunswick</hi> land,) But this towne of <hi>Haluer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stade</hi> belongs to a Bishop so stiled, who is Duke <hi>Christian</hi> brother to the now Duke of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> a long dutch mile (or almost six English) is a small towne or a Bleck called <hi>Groning</hi> belonging to the Duke, in the which place I obserued two things worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>
            <p>First a most stately Pallace built with a beautiful Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, so adorned with the images and formes of Angells, and Cherubins, with such exquisitenes of arts best indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of caruing, grauing, guilding, painting, glasing, and
<pb facs="tcp:18885:9"/>
pauing, with such superexcellent workmanship of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes, pulpit and font, that for curiosity and admirable rarenesse, all the buildings, and fabricks that euer I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, must giue it preheminence. I confesse that <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenths Chappell at <hi>Westminster,</hi> Kings Colledge Chappell in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Christs Church in <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> are beyond it in height and workmanship of stone: for indeed this Chappell is most of wood gipps, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of <hi>Parris</hi>; but it is so guilded as if it had bin made in the golden age, when gold was esteemed as drosse, so that a man had need to weare a vaile ouer his dazeling eyes, or else he can hardly looke vpon it.</p>
            <p>The caruing and painting seeme to outgo the arts of <hi>Pigmalion, Apelles,</hi> or <hi>Praxiteles</hi>; the pauing of chequered blacke and white marble, and the windowes glassed with Christall: but all this great cost and shew is very little to the honor of God, or the propagation of the Ghospel, the edification of the ignorant. For in this Chappell of ease, there is no Seruice. If the painted pulpit could preach, the dumbe images might (perhaps) haue a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon now and then; for scarce at any time there comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body into the Chappell, but a fellow that shewes the beauty of it for two pence or three pence a piece.</p>
            <p>In the same house, in a place or celler built of purpose, is a great tonne or vessell of wood, that was 7 yeares in making, and hath vsed to be filled with Rhenish wine: it is sayd to bee twice as bigge as the vessell at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> and the hoopes of it are twelue inches thick, and the staues or bordes of it being as much: I went vp to the top of it, with a ladder of 18 stepps, hee that keepes it saith it will hold 160 tonnes. My fellow <hi>Tilbery</hi> did creepe in at
<pb facs="tcp:18885:10"/>
the tap hole; it is in length 32 foote, and in breadth acrosse 19, and verily I thinke that bable cost more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the making, then would haue built a good ship, or founded an almes house for 6 poore people.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>From <hi>Groning</hi> wee trauelled to a towne called <hi>Ashers Leauen,</hi> to <hi>Ashleauen,</hi> to <hi>Kinderne,</hi> to <hi>Hall,</hi> and so to <hi>Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zig,</hi> which is one of the chiefest townes in <hi>Saxony,</hi> being famous for a yearely Mart that is yearely held there, whereto Merchants and other people from the most part
<pb facs="tcp:18885:10"/>
of Christendom haue annual concourse: in this towne we stayd two dayes, and taking our leaue then of some Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Merchants, who vsed vs kindly, we there would haue hired a coach or waggon to <hi>Prague</hi>; but all the <hi>Saxon</hi> coach-men and carters were afraid to looke vpon any part of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> because their Duke is a profest enemy in armes against the King of <hi>Beame,</hi> so that we were forced to hire a fellow with a wheelebarrow two dayes to carry our cloakes, swords, guns, pistolls, and other apparell and luggage which were our necessaries, to a towne called <hi>Boorne,</hi> to <hi>Froburge,</hi> and so to another towne called <hi>Penigh,</hi> where wee cashierd our one-wheel'd coach, and hired a cart with two, which carried both vs and our baggage to <hi>Chemnizt</hi> another towne in <hi>Saxony,</hi> from whence to a place called <hi>Shop,</hi> wee were faine to bee our owne sumpter horses, walking on foote to the last towne in <hi>Saxony,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Marienberg.</hi> From thence passing vp and downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessable mountaines, we came to a wood, which parts <hi>Bohemia</hi> from <hi>Saxony</hi> on the west, which wood is called by the people of those parts the <hi>Beamer Wolts</hi> or <hi>Wolt,</hi> and is in breadth to English miles, and in length further then I know how to describe truely: but this much of it I dare affirme, that it is a naturall impregnable wall to the kingdome of <hi>Bohem,</hi> which kingdome is all incompast round with woods and mountaines, so that there is no passage on that side of it, for any army to enter into it with munition and artillery, all the wayes being vneuen, and the mountaine tops all boggs, mosses, and quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires, that great ordnance or any heauy cariage either of horse, cart or waggon, will sinke and be lost. Besides, there are numbers past numbring of Firre trees, many
<pb facs="tcp:18885:11"/>
standing, and such store fallen of themselues, that any passage might easily be stopped by laying them crosse the way. And of all my iourny, the trauell through that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall wood was the most heauy vnto mee, for the trees grew so thicke, and so high, that the sunne was obscured, and the day seemed night; in some places, the way paued with swimming trees 2 miles together on the tops of hills, which now and then I slipping besides, sunke to the middle in a quagmire.</p>
            <p>When wee had thus footed it, and trauelled past the hills and woods, (being at the least 4 houres toyle) and that wee might looke downe the mountaines into the fruitfull land of <hi>Bohem,</hi> neuer did sight more reioyce vs, the lower hills being all full of Vineyards, and the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, corne and pasture; not an English mile distance, but a village euery way; and twenty, thirty, or forty reekes or stacks of corne which their barnes cannot hold, in the space of euery houres iourny: in a word, euery thing that belonged to the vse and commodity of man was and is there, and al the delightfull obiects to satisfie euery sence is there abundantly, so that nature seemed to make that Country her storehouse or granary, for there is nothing wanting except mens gratitude to God for such blessings.</p>
            <p>The first night we lodged there at a pretty towne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Comoda,</hi> which towne by negligence and occasion of fire had fifty houses burnt two dayes before our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, it being eleuen dutch miles from <hi>Prague.</hi> There we hired a wagon 7 dutch miles to a towne called <hi>Slowne,</hi> from whence we walked on foote a long 16 Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish miles to <hi>Prague,</hi> which long looked for the Citty wee could not see vntill we came within an houres trauell of
<pb facs="tcp:18885:11"/>
it: within halfe a dutch mile is a fearefull place, being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented with inhumaine and barbarous murderers, that assault trauellers, first shooting and murdring them, and after searching their pockets, where if they haue mony or not, all is one, it is but so many slaine: for these villaines haue a wood, and a deepe valley to shelter themselues in, that they are hardly taken afterwards; but if they chance at any time to be but apprehended, they are racked and tortured to make them confesse, and afterwards their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions are very terrible. But (I thanke God) wee past that place, and many other as dangerous as that, where some were robbed and murdered (as report told vs) both before vs, behind vs, and on each side: and we saw in our iourny aboue seauen score gallowses and wheeles, where thieues were hanged some fresh, and some halfe rotten, and the carkases of murtherers, broken limb after limb on the wheeles; and yet it was our happines onely to see the dead villaines, and escape the liuing.</p>
            <p>I came into <hi>Prague</hi> on thurseday the seauenth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> whither if I had come but the friday before, I had seene a most fearefull execution of two notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offenders; the manner how, with their faults, as it was truely related to me by English Gentlemen that saw it, I thinke it not much impertinent to relate.</p>
            <p>The one of them being taken, apprehended and rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, for ripping vp aliue a woman with child, and for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the infant out of her body, did sowe a liuing pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py into her belly; all which hee confessed hee did to make properties for wichcraft: and beeing further tortured, hee confessed when and where hee had committed 35. mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more: the other in respect of him was but a petty
<pb facs="tcp:18885:12"/>
offender, for he in all his life time had murthered but 14. For the which execrable facts, their deserued executions were as followeth: First, they were brought out of the Iayle naked from the girdle vpward; and so being bound fast on high in a cart, that the spectators might see them; then the Hangman hauing a panne of coales neere him, with red hot pincers nip'd off the nipple of one brest; then he tooke a knife and giues him a slash or cut downe the backe on one side, from the shoulder to the waste; and presently gaue him such another slash, three inches from the first; then on the top he cut the slashes into one;, and presently taking pincers, tooke hold of the crosse cut, and tore him downe like a Girse below the middle, letting it hang downe behind him like a belt: after which he tooke his burning pincers, and pluck'd off the tops of his fingers of one hand: then passing to another place of the Towne, his other nipple was plucked off, the other side of his back so cut and mangled, (which they call by the name of rimming, (if it had beene riming, I would neuer haue written but in prose) his other fingers nip'd off; then passing further, all his toes were nip'd off with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pincers: after which he was enforced to come out of the cart, and goe on foote vp a steepe hill to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, where he was broken with a wheele, aliue, one bone after another, beginning at his legs and ending with his neck, and last of all quartered and layd on the wheele, on a high post, till Crowes, Rauens, or consuming time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume him.</p>
            <p>This was the manner of both their executions, but I speake but of the greatest murtherer particularly, because it is reported, that all these torments neuer made him
<pb facs="tcp:18885:12"/>
once to change countenance, or to make any signe or action of griefe, to call to God for mercy, or to entreate the people to pray for him; but as if he had beene a sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse stocke or stone, he did most scornefully, and as it were in disdaine abide it: whilst the other villaine did crye, rore, and make lamentation, calling vpon God often; the difference was not much in their liues, and manner of their deaths, but I am perswaded the odds was great in their dying.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Prague</hi> is almost circular or round, being diuided in the middle by the riuer of <hi>Moldoue,</hi> ouer which is a faire stone Bridge, of 600. paces ouer, and at each end a strong gate of stone: there is said to be in it of Churches and Chappels, 150. for there are great numbers of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, who haue many Chappels dedicated to sundry Saints, and I was there at foure seueral sorts of diuine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises; viz. at good sermons with the Protestants, at Masse with the Papists, at a Lutherans preaching, and at the Iewes Synagog; three of which I saw and heard for curiosity, and the other for edification.</p>
            <p>The Iewes in <hi>Prague</hi> are in such great numbers, that they are thought to be of men, women and children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt 50. or 60000. who doe all liue by brocage and vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vpon the Christians, and are very rich in money and Iewels, so that a man may see tenne or twelue togither of them, that are accounted worth 20. 30. or 40000. l. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece; and yet the slaues goe so miserably attired, that 15. of them are not worth the hanging for their whole ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes.</p>
            <p>The Castle where the King and Queene doe keepe their Court, is magnificent and sumptuous in building,
<pb facs="tcp:18885:13"/>
strongly situated and fortified by nature and art, being founded on a high hill, so that at pleasure it keepes the towne in command, and it is much more spacious in roomes for receipt in gardens and orchards, then the Towre of <hi>London.</hi> I was in it dayly the space of 20 dayes, and saw it royally graced with the presence of a gracious King &amp; Queen, who were honorably atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ded by a gallant courtly traine of Lords and Ladies, and Gentles, of the high <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and where was free &amp; bountiful entertainment to strangers in abundance: I must euer humbly and thankfully acknowledge the Queenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties goodnesse towards mee, whose vndeserued fauours were helpful vnto me both there, and in my tedious ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny home-ward. Moreouer there I saw (and had in mine armes) the King and Queenes yongest son, Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> who was borne there on the 16 of <hi>December</hi> last: a goodly child as euer I saw of that age, whom with the rest I pray God to blesse; to his glory and his Parents ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>There (for a token) I did thinke it meete,</l>
               <l>To take the shoes from off this Prince his feete:</l>
               <l>I doe not say I stole, but I did take,</l>
               <l>And whilst I liue I'le keepe them for his sake:</l>
               <l>Long may his Grace liue to be stylde a man,</l>
               <l>And then I'le steale his bootes too, if I can.</l>
               <l>The shoes were vpright shoes, and so was he</l>
               <l>That wore them, from all harme vpright and free:</l>
               <l>He vsde them for their vse, and not for pride,</l>
               <l>He neuer wrong'd them, or ne're trod a side.</l>
               <l>Lambskin they were, as white as Innocence,</l>
               <l>(True patternes for the footsteps of a Prince,)</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18885:13"/>And time will come (as I do hope in God)</l>
               <l>He that in childhood with these shooes was shod,</l>
               <l>Shall with his manly feete once trample downe,</l>

            <p>The citty of <hi>Prague,</hi> hath in it (by reason of the wars) thrice the number of it's owne inhabitants, and yet for all that, victuals is in such great plenty, that 6 men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eate three halfe penny worth of bread, and I did buy in the market a fat goose well roast for the vallew of nine pence English, and I and my brother haue dined there at a Cookes with good roasted meate, bread and beere, so that we haue bin satisfied and left, for the vallew of fiue pence: a good turky there may bee bought for two shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and for fresh fish I neuer saw such store, for in one market day I haue knowne in <hi>Prague</hi> 2000 carps, besides other fishes, which carps in <hi>London</hi> are fiue shillings a piece, and there they were for eight pence, or ten pence at the most, so that one of their fresh fish markets heere were worth at the least 5 or 600 pounds, and as for all other manner of wild foule, they are there in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety, besides their fruites are in such abundance that I boght a basket of grapes of the quantity of halfe a pecke for a penny &amp; farthing, &amp; a hat-ful of faire peaches for as much, pickled cowcumbers I haue bought a pecke for three pence, and muskmellons, there hath bin cast fiue or six carts load of them in one day to their hoggs.</p>
            <p>As concerning the dyet that is in the Kings armies, I could neuer yet heare any man complaine of want, but that it is more plentifull then in the citty, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test scarcity hath bin to some sicke souldiers, who being not able to march with the leaguers (by reason of their weakenes) they haue bin left amongst the Boores, or hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
<pb facs="tcp:18885:14"/>
in the next villages, where their languages not vnderstood, their succour hath bin but small, but for all this in the campe hath euer bin a continuall cheapnes of all things, the King most duely paying his souldiers at the end of euery month, hauing in his great leguer, vnder the conduct of the Princes of <hi>Hollock</hi> and <hi>Anhalt,</hi> of foote and horse 43000, and at the least of carts and waggons to carry prouision, and baggage for the army, to the number of 18000. In his little leaguer vnder the leading of Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> there are of foote and horse 7000, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides carrs and waggons for carriage, and yet for these great numbers of men and beastes, there is food in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.</p>
            <p>In the campe with <hi>Graue Mansfelt</hi> is the <hi>Brittane</hi> regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnder their Colonel Sir <hi>Andrew Gray</hi> Knight, and in <hi>Prague</hi> I met with many worthy Gentlemen and soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which were there sicke, as the worthy Captaine <hi>Bushell,</hi> Lieutenaut <hi>Grimes,</hi> Lieuetenant <hi>Langworth,</hi> Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Galbreath,</hi> Ancient <hi>Vandenbrooke,</hi> Maister <hi>Whitney,</hi> Maister <hi>Blundell</hi> and others, all which did most courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously entertaine me, vnto whom I must euer rest thankful, and they do affirme that now it hath pleased God to grant their souldiers recouery, that they do hope euery <hi>Brittaine</hi> souldier doth retaine more good spirit, then 3 enemies of what nation soeuer.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing shewed part of the best things in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Court and Citty of <hi>Prague,</hi> it shall not be amisse if I relate a little merily, of some things there tolerable, some intollerable, some naught and some worse then naught; for as euery rose hath a prickle, and euery Bee a sting, so no earthly kingdome hath such persection of goodnesse, but it may be iustly taxed with imperfections.</p>

            <p>Thus hauing stayd in <hi>Prague</hi> almost 3. weekes, I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from thence homeward, on tuesday, the 26. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, hauing in my company three Gentlemen, a wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow (and foure small children) whose husband and being an English man, and the Kings Brewer for Beere, deceased, and was buried there in <hi>Prague</hi> whilst I was there: the good desolate woman hauing receiued reward after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares seruice there and at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> being desirous to retire to her countrey (England) came with vs, with my brother, and my fellow <hi>Tilbery.</hi> We tooke two Coaches at the Castle of <hi>Prague,</hi> &amp; in a day and halfe, we were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried seuen Duch miles, to a Towne in <hi>Bohemia</hi> (standing on the riuer of <hi>Elue</hi>) called <hi>Leutmeritz,</hi> at which Towne we all layd our moneyes together, and bought a boate of 48. foote in length, and not 3. foote in bredth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we did not know the riuer, wee hired a <hi>Bohemian</hi> waterman to guide vs 15. dutch miles, to the Towne of
<pb facs="tcp:18885:15"/>
               <hi>Dreason</hi> in <hi>Saxony.</hi> But 4. miles short of that Town, which was the first Towne in the Saxon Countrey, called <hi>Pirne,</hi> where we were stayed 5. houres without the gates, til such time as the Burgamaster wold be pleased to examin vs: in the meane space our waterman (not daring to abide the terrible triall of examination, because the Duke of <hi>Saxon</hi> was in Armes against the King of <hi>Beame</hi>) hee ran away, and left vs to bring the boate downe the riuer, 600. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish miles our selues to <hi>Hamburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now to close vp all, I will relate what rare dyet, excellent cookery, and sweete lodging we had in ouriour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in <hi>Germany</hi>: first for our comfort, after very hard get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of houseroome, our lodgings was euery night in straw, where lying together well littered, we honestly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes left our sheetes behind vs: then at our suppers at a table square, and so broad, that two men can hardly shake hands ouer it, we being some twelue about it. Our first dish being a raw cabbadge, of the quantity of halfe a pecke, cut and chopped small, with the fat of resty bacon powred vpon it in stead of oyle; which dish must be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied before we could get any more: Our second dish per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, a peck of boylde Apples and honey, the Apples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boyled skins, stalkes, cores, and all: Thirdly, 100. Gudgeons, newly taken perhaps, yet as salt as if they had beene three yeares pickled, or twice at the East Indies, boyled with scales, guts an all, and buried in Ginger like sawdust: a fresh pike as salt as brine, boyled in flat milke, with a pound of Garlick. This was the manner of the most part of our dyet; and if we did aske them why they did salt their meate so vnreasonably, their answere was, that their beer could not be consumed, except their meat were salted extraordinarily.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18885:16"/>If a man doe finde fault or seeme distasted with their beastly dyet, he is in danger to be thrust out of dores, and take vp his lodging in the streetes: and in the conclusion when dinner or supper is ended, then comes mine Host, or his leather lip'd Froe, with a sawcy reckoning of what they please, which sounds in our eares like a harsh Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, after a bad playe; for what they say wee must pay, their words are irreuocable (like the ancient Kings of <hi>Persia</hi>) and we must not question or aske how and how it can bee so much, but pay them their demand without grumbling to halfe a farthing.</p>
            <p>Which made me call to minde sixe seuerall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals, that doe belong to a traueller, as patience, silence, warinesse, watchfulnesse, a good stomacke, and a purse wel moneyed; for if he want any one of these, (perhaps) the other fiue will neuer bring him to his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies end. A mans patience must be such, that (though he be a Barron) he must beare all abuses, either in words, lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, dyet, or almost any thing, though offered from or by a sowter, a tinker, or a Merchant of tripes &amp; turneps; his silence must be, that though he heare &amp; vnderstand him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe wronged, yet he must be as dumbe as a Gudgeon or a Whiting mop: and though his mouth be shut, his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse must be such, that his eares must be euer open, to listen and ouer-heare all dangers that may bee complot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against him: his watchfulnesse must be so, that he must seldome sleep with both his eyes at once, lest his throat be cut before he wake againe. But for his stomacke, hee must eate grasse with a horse, aud draffe with the hogges, for hee that cannot eate pickl'd herring broth, and dirty puddings, shall many times fast by authority, and goe to bed withont his supper: and last of all, he must haue <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18885:16"/>
or a Prince his purse, that must bee (like a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards dagger) euer drawne, to pay bountifully for such wash and graines, as his valiant stomack hrth ouercome, conquered and deuoured: but of this a little in verse:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Sixe things vnto a Traueller belongs,</l>
               <l>An Asses backe, t'abide and beare all wrongs:</l>
               <l>A fishes tougue (mute) grudging speech forbearing,</l>
               <l>A Harts quick eare, all dangers, ouerhearing.</l>
               <l>A dogs eyes, that must wake as they doe sleepe,</l>
               <l>And by such watch his corpes from perill keepe.</l>
               <l>A swines sweete homely taste, that must digest</l>
               <l>Al Fish, Flesh, Rootes, Fowle, foule and beastly drest;</l>
               <l>And last, he must haue euer at his call</l>
               <l>A purse well lynde with coyne to pay for all.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>With this kinde of lodging and dyet, and with te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious labour sometimes night and day, wee came in 14. dayes 607. miles from <hi>Prague</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to <hi>Hambrogh</hi> on the hither skirts of <hi>Germany,</hi> the riuer hauing aboue 1000. shelues and sands, and 800. Ilands, so that a man cannot see on which side of them to goe, there being 240. mills chained in boates on the first streame, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber numberlesse of Oakes and other trees sunke with the violence of the Riuer, and sometimes fogs and mists that we could not see a boates length from vs: besides great Rocks, and stones that were fallen into the water, that any or many of these impediments do often ouerthrow boats, and drowne passengers; yet I, and my fellow <hi>Tilbery</hi> (wee being both his Maiesties watermen) did by Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance safely escape them all, and brought our selues, as is afore-sayd, to <hi>Hamborogh,</hi> where being winde bound 10. dayes, I thanke the English Merchants, I was well welco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, vntill at last it pleased God, the winde came faire, I
<pb facs="tcp:18885:17"/>
tooke ship, and after 9. dayes and nights of various wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (I giue prayse to the Almighty) I safely came home to my house in <hi>London,</hi> on saterday the 28. of September. 1620.</p>

               <l>You that haue bought this, grieue not at the cost,</l>
               <l>Ther's something worth your noting, al's not lost,</l>
               <l>First halfe a Constable is well bumbasted,</l>
               <l>If there were nothing else, your coynes not wasted,</l>
               <l>Then I relate of hills, and dales, and downes,</l>
               <l>Of Churches, Chappels, Pallaces and Townes,</l>
               <l>And then to make amends (although but small)</l>
               <l>I tell a tale of a great Tub withall,</l>
               <l>With many a gallowse, Iibbit, and a wheele,</l>
               <l>Where murdrers bones are broke, from head to heele;</l>
               <l>How rich <hi>Bohemia</hi> is in wealth and food,</l>
               <l>Of all things which for man or beast is good.</l>
               <l>How in the Court at <hi>Prague</hi> (a princely place)</l>
               <l>A gracious Queene vouchsafed me to grace,</l>
               <l>How on the sixteenth day of <hi>August</hi> last,</l>
               <l>King <hi>Frederick</hi> to his royall army past,</l>
               <l>How fifty thousand were in armes araid,</l>
               <l>Of the Kings force, be side th' <hi>Hungarian</hi> ayde,</l>
               <l>And how <hi>Bohemia</hi> strongly can oppose,</l>
               <l>And cuffe and curry all their daring foes.</l>
               <l>Then though no newes of state, may heere be had,</l>
               <l>I know heer's something will make good men glad,</l>
