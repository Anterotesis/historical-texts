            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Professe that I never thought my self master of my own Trade, and therefore never forward either to cast such a mite as this into your Publique Treasury, or to be in Print with the rest of my brethren: But since it was your pleasure to make choice of me to bring in a Narrative of Gods bountie, as being an eye-witnesse to many of his glorious works; I have obeyed, in this, and that. I knew not what better to pitch upon then Gods doing, and your dutie. He
<pb facs="tcp:63793:3"/>
that will not confesse God hath done much, (I fear) means to wave the duty; and who so shall slight this duty, must look for that sad Curse of <hi>Anathema Maranatha:</hi> And therefore I again commend it to you. They that have <hi>much given,</hi> and <hi>much forgiven,</hi> will <hi>love much.</hi> The woman <hi>spent all that shee had upon Physitians,</hi> for the cure of her Bloudy Issue, and nothing would heal, till shee <hi>toucht the hem of his garment,</hi> who was the way contrived in Heaven, to bring over Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to man: I doe believe it hath been thus far your Cure to this Bloudy Disease; and to enjoy a thorow Cure, I beseech you stoop againe, and touch the hem again: you cannot honour the Lord more then in loving his Sonne and believing in him.</p>
            <p>Bear with my rudenesse; if I say you must be very hard put to it in your Counsels, should you not live comfortably upon your experiences, and cheerfully looke all changes in the face for time to come? You have a greater stock by you, then the greatest and richest Nation in the world could get and lay up for themselves. The same God give you skill to improve it to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and the good of this poor Kingdome, that begins to breathe againe (through his blessing
<pb facs="tcp:63793:3"/>
upon your unexampled care and travell.) Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I see the Ages to come marking your doors and dwellings as the habitations of their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers. I wish that never a soule of you may die at <hi>Nebo,</hi> but come to their injoyments of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naans</hi> milk and honey. You seem to have before you two or three great mountaines to go over: and though I can contribute little to your encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, yet I will beg your wonted patience for a few words.</p>
            <p>First, since you are still buzz'd in the ear with a desperate encrease of Errour, give me leave to offer this Expedient by way of Quaere. The wound seems to be in the Understanding, and the Cure must lie there: (Vnder favour) what if some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place or places in the <hi>City</hi> were set apart two or three times weekly, where godly learned men appointed by your selves, and the Leaders or Heads of those Errours (as they are termed) might have leave to come, and there in a brotherly way take and give satisfction? for as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claves have alwayes been dangerous, so these poor erring men cannot have the benefit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with boldnesse; and reasonable souls may sooner certainly be taught with Reason and Scripture, then with cudgels and blowes. <hi>Tyrannus</hi> had a School;
<pb facs="tcp:63793:4"/>

            <p>Secondly, for the present Government, in order to any man or men, if you keep to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, the Lord himselfe will make a blessed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for further <hi>Hostility;</hi> the Lord hath own'd you and your Army, and made you formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable beyond what we conceive at home; my onely fear hath been diseases in our bowels; which gave me that boldnesse to urge a neer union betwixt your selves and the Citie, which hath since a double knot upon it by your late full and satisfying Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and your ordering the dissenters about Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters to bring in their severall thoughts backt by the Word, that so you may keep to that Clause in the Covenant which concerns <hi>England.

            <p>And for my self, I acknowledge here before God, Angels and men, the Characters of your favour; protesting that your work hath been so good and so sweet, that I have found my wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges wrapt up in my work, and a great additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by your acceptance. I could even say as he did:</p>

If my life may be profitable, command what you please: if my death, even kill me; whatever you shall determine of mee, this will I alwayes confesse and professe, this injury your humanity hath done me, that I shall live and dye ungratefull.</p>
            <p>I blesse God heartily for a Parliament, yea, for this Parliament: and the blessing of him that was in the bush, and kept it in the fire, be upon you and yours for ever: And let all that love the God of <hi>Heaven,</hi> who is the God of <hi>England,</hi> say</p>

               </gap> pure Scripture to posterity, then in scratching others with their sharpned Pens, and making Cockpits of Pulpits.</p>
            <p>I make all haste to the work of the day; and the Verse before the Text will be like a going down into a deep Well, where we may discover Stars at noon. Mercies are best observed from depths of Misery: and set them off like Foyles the Diamonds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:</hi> or <hi>I said in my hastening,</hi> 1 Sam. 23. <hi>David</hi> was in a running posture.</p>
            <p>The Greek translates it <hi>in a trance,</hi> or <hi>extasie;</hi> and truly this is worth our thoughts this very day: we have had our hasty times and trances, when we thought we had been all cut off, who are now left living monuments of rich mercy. Many of us here, were even upon the wing, imbanking our Money, and hastning after it. And if you shal enquire after the rise of this temper or distemper of Spirit, how <hi>David</hi> and other Saints prove so succumbent and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>attered: I answer, It hath three springs.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:63793:8"/>
1. From the Lord afflicting, who puts more weight into the Scale then we minde, and often makes a small affliction heavie: yea, they that could goe over a mountain, at other times stick at a mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill: as <hi>Jacob</hi> will not be comforted about a son; as if he had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Gen. 37. 35.</note> a childe left, nor a God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the party afflicted, and that in three cases.</p>
            <p>First, from a natural sense of pain, more then of comfort: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Esth. 3.</note> is more pinched with one crosse in <hi>Mordecay,</hi> then pleased with all the contents in Court, though (you know) few favourites fared better for a time: and it is but a short time the best of that generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have; poor Sun-dyals that are never minded in foggie and clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dayes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the over-weening some contents, which causeth faintings to us in the losing them. <hi>My son Absalon, O my son, my son,</hi> cries <hi>David,</hi> as if heaven and earth hed been wrapt up in his weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. 4.</note> locks.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, through inconsideratenesse, and not searching the end <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 9.</note> of things: for the Church came down wonderfully.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the pressures and afflictions themselves, and that,</p>
            <p>First, from the multitude of them: what one will not, cannot do, <note place="margin">Psal. 38.</note> many may. This Prophet at one time was the scorn of drunkards, suspected by the godly, abused by his own son, betrayed by his friend.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the greatnesse of them, and that especially when they either fall upon an unsound part, when <hi>Job</hi> was remembred of the sin of his youth not quite healed; or upon a noble part, the soul and conscience: we know the brain, heart, and liver being toucht, will soon complain.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, from the continuance of them. The Church complains, <hi>I was afflicted from my youth up.</hi> To lie so long at <hi>Bethesda,</hi> and to be bowed down eighteen yeers, as the poor woman in the Gospel was, will put the soul upon hastening, as <hi>Davids:</hi> but all these gusts are over-blown, and the Lord shines in upon him, as you see in the close of the Verse before the Text; upon which smiles of Gods face, he cries out as you here see, <hi>O love the Lord all yee his Saints,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which words there are many divine Conclusions: but in these narrow limits of time, I shall confine my self to One main Truth, which I conceive will be the principal Work of this day: and that will take up both Arguments used here by the Prophet to enforce
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63793:9"/>
the duty: and in the end I shall make bold to take up the duty to enforce my designe.</p>
            <p>And therefore to lay much in a little room, this is that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God commends unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The faithfull have God for their preserver, whilst the proud doer by the same hand receives wages proportionable to his work.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Doct.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A witnesse or two will cast the cause. <hi>Salvation belongeth to the</hi>

               <hi>Lord, and thy blessing is upon thy people, Selab.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O thou hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 14. 8. Psal. 98. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O sing unto the Lora a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which <hi>Isaiah</hi> addes, <hi>Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for thou</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isa 26. 12.</note> 
               <hi>also hast wrought all our works in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Genesis</hi> to the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> the Scripture gives in a general testimony to this Truth: to which we may let in some more light, by opening these three Casements.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Quere,</hi> When the Lord doth thus appear preserving the faithful.</item>
               <item>2. How he doth it.</item>
               <item>3. Why he doth it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>To the first I answer, His preservation looks cut and discovers it self specially in five cases.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When he intends to advance his own wisedom, he then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fools all the counsels of the sons of men; and his Saints shall onely be engaged to him for counsel: and thus the poor man shall save the City, and thus <hi>Paphnutius</hi> shall save the Councel at <hi>Ephesus</hi> by the counsel of God, whose singer writ <hi>folly</hi> upon that learned Age.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When he intends to exalt his own power, he comes in more immediately for the Saints preserving, and proclaims to the world its own feeblenesse and weaknesse: and then <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>el</hi> shall do more against <hi>Sisera</hi> then an Army of men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When he glorifies his mercy; he leaves the Saints to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to reach an opportunity, to lift up that attribute: and thus he leads them from <hi>Bacha</hi> to <hi>Sion,</hi> throw a Country of Gyants and harrennesse, where their souls even melt through thirst, and brought them to a mountain of sweete.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the Lord doth purpose to awaken those gifts and graces in their cryings, in their bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>evings, in their patient wakings upon Jesus Christ, he will com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> delivering: he will be sought unto by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63793:9"/>
the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and loves to heare the lispings of his little ones. <note place="margin">Psal. 107. 6. 19.</note> You have known some Fathers in the Country that leave their Children the other side the Stile, and help them over when they cry; and seeming to leave them sometimes in a throng, and then reach them the hand again upon their complaints. The Lord loves to see Faith in its adhering and assuring acts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Lord appears when deliverance may be sweetest and dearest, and that in an exigent when one glance of his eye may be worth a whole world. <hi>Who remembred us in our low estate, for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 136. 23.</note> 
               <hi>endureth for ever:</hi> And thus sicknesse commends health, poverty wealth, the storme a haven, and a sinfull wretched world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends heaven: Oh how sweet will it be when all tears shall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away, all Temptations out-wrestled, Devils, and Sin, and World, and Selfe, all conquered, and we shall be with the Lord for ever!</p>
            <p>To the Second, which is, <hi>How the Lord preserves:</hi> I answer, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes; but shall onely fix upon two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Order to means, 2. To Men.</p>
            <p>For the former, his greatest and most eminent preservations are by his own spirit, and therefore the two <hi>Olive Trees</hi> shall supply the Pipes and the Lamps growing on each side the Golden bowle Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, <note place="margin">Zach. 4. 6.</note> without any Artifice of mans: and that appears thus;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Means can do nothing without him; the Streames are drie, unlesse the spring be full: <hi>Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isa. 40. 30, 31.</note> 
               <hi>the young men shall utterly fall: But they that waite upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings at Eagles: they shall run, and not beweary; and they shall walke and not be faint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Though meanes gaine strength, yet they can act no further then he quickens them: It was he that withered <hi>Jerobo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> hand, and knockt off <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> wheeles, and laid six hundred Iron Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots <note place="margin">Psal. 136. 15.</note> under the Cataracts of his displeasure: <hi>He overthrew Pharaoh and his hoast in the Red sea, son his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Meanes though quickned, yet they succeed not, nor reach their purposed ends without him: The <hi>Madianits</hi> shall sheath their <note place="margin">Isa. 95. 6.</note> swords in their own bowels; their Webbs shall not become Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; neither shall they cover themselves with their works.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Spirit of the Lord can doe what it will without meanes; he creates a shadow; for thou hast been a strength to the poore, a <note place="margin">Isa. 25. 4.</note> strength to the needy in his distresse, a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fuge from the storme, a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63793:10"/>
shadow from the heate when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storme against the wall; and that appeares thus;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes against all meanes; the waters shall be a wall to <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and they shall passe through the great deep with dry feet, and <note place="margin">Jonah 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Jonab</hi> shall be kept from drowning in the sea by being thrown into the Sea.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes beyond all Meanes: else how should one chase a thousand, and a fancy put many thousands to flight? else how should the shaking of a few leaves and the blowing of Rams-horns do such terrible executions?</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is the Lord that doth all that is done by meanes: walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">Psal. 48. 12, 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Sion,</hi> and go round about Her: tell the Towers thereof: mark yee well her Bulwarks: consider her Palaces, that ye may tell it to the generation following: for this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death. If you say that money answers all things, yet you must heare the Lord say, the gold is mine, your silver is mine: It is not the drug, nor the bread that doth the work, but the spirit of them both.</p>
            <p>And for the second, which is his manner of preserving in order to men, yea, destroying men, his working shews it selfe usually in these four particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. God oftentimes over-awes and overbears them, that <hi>Laban</hi> shall have little to say to <hi>Jacob</hi> when he overtakes him: <hi>Balaam</hi> had an opportunity and spleen enough against <hi>Israel,</hi> but durst not vent <note place="margin">Numb. 25. 23.</note> it, intreats <hi>Balacks</hi> Messengers to stay all night, would faine be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king money; but there was no Incantation against <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation against <hi>Israel:</hi> for the Lord was with them, and the shout of a King was amongst them. <hi>Esau</hi> shall rather kisse then kill: for <hi>Jacob</hi> was a Prince, and had prevailed with God and with man; <hi>sc.</hi> had wrestled through all his fears that his brother must be his Servant, the Lord putting a bit into his mouth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord often takes away the occasion, that the Sons of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial</hi> cannot attempt what they intend: If they in the <hi>Acts,</hi> which swore <hi>Pauls</hi> death, had kept their oaths, they had never kept their <note place="margin">Acts 25. 12.</note> lives: but he never came within their reach. <hi>Ahab</hi> sends to all places under Heaven to take <hi>Elias;</hi> but the Lord sends him away <note place="margin">Kings 1. 19.</note> before they came. <hi>He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</hi>

3. Oftentimes the Lord stops them in their practises. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> will needs be striking the Prophet, The Lord strikes him, who is very sensible of the least touch of his anointed ones, or any harme that befalls his Prophets.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Lastly, The Lord works by diversion. When <hi>Saul</hi> thought he <note place="margin">1 Sam. 23. 27.</note> had made sure of <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Philistims</hi> brake in upon his Countrey, and probably had spoyled him in the reare. And that I take to be the meaning of the cloud, <hi>Isaiah 25. 5. Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a drie place, even the heat with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a cloud; the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</hi> The shadow of a cloud intervening betwixt the scorching Sun and the weary Traveller in a hot Countrey, how doth it refresh! God finds his enemies work abroad, that his Saints may not be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at home: and since the whole world and all the Princes of it are but the servants of a few Saints, he can put all into severall postures for his preserving ends.</p>
            <p>To the third Quere, <hi>Why God thus preserves the Saints,</hi> I answer in these three particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because of his righteousnesse and holinesse in the very dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of his judgements, which occasioned this large offer to the <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 32.</note> men of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and caused him to descend so low as ten righteous persons, yea, though they were but as righteous as <hi>Lot,</hi> who was not without strong corruptions: Who can say his hands are clean? Yet such are called righteous and faithfull: They are called in my Text, even such as have candor upon their spirits; such as take up and own right principles; such as are contented in the main and in the Cause they have in hand, to have glasse-windows made to their hearts; even such as Heathens named <hi>Homines simplices &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertos:</hi> To such he sends his Angels to shew his tender affection, which is better then his protection. To be faithfull doth intitle us to preservation in the deluge of the greatest judgements, that our work will be onely to look to duty which is ours, and leave events to God which are his.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God doth it for the glory of his mercy, and therefore sends <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 6.</note> his Angels to draw forth Lingerers; and such is his tendernesse, that the righteousnesse of one <hi>Lot</hi> binds his hands that he can do nothing till the faithfull be preserved. <hi>Come my people enter, thou</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isa. 26. 20.</note>

To be <hi>mediis tranquillus in undis;</hi> to say, the Lord doth well what ever he doth: <hi>I will love thee, though thou kill me,</hi> and <hi>trust in the</hi> (cries <hi>Joh.)</hi> This looke like love, otherwise your mistakes will be many, about the creature, and the Creator. You are now come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a new triall, the Lord outwrastles the temptation for you: You may think now the danger little, I pray remember <hi>Sisera,</hi> he took a nap after his lordly dish, and a womans hand nailed his head to the ground. <hi>David</hi> thought it no danger to take a nap in an afternoon, but there he split his soule, and hardly made up againe. You may think it looks now like the afternoon of the day to you, and as if your work were towards an end: mistake not, I believe you have seen most of the miracles, but are not yet over the red sea; or if you were over, yet love the Lord in this dispensation, lest you be brought to tack about two and forty times in the wildernesse.</p>
               <p>It argues much feeblenesse of spirit, to change our affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on changes of Providence, he never loved well, nay hardly at all, that can love no better: yea, this you shall finde most true, that all backslidings from God, spring from the change of our opinions concerning God, and these we do often from the varieties of his dealings with us, as if he were a better God one year than the other, and this is often our folly, who can easilier look upon the barks and outsides of things, than their insides: Because he was a Carpenters son, therefore a stumbling block to the Jews, they could see no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The glitter and glory of a painted world hath made blind the eyes of many: Nor is it a small mistake among men, when they keep their thoughts upon present things, with neglect of future, hence the Psalmist concludes the 107. Psalme, <hi>Who so is wise, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi>

It concerns you therefore to look to your love in storm, and calm, in war, in peace; to love the Lord then, is to love him in all changes.</p>

That humble loving <hi>John Baptist, I must decrease, but he must increase,</hi> and willing he was Christ should have all; and that love discovers it self much when you are ready to live in his will, not your own, that he may have not onely meat drest, but as he pleaseth; such Worship as he likes, such Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments as he takes pleasure in; yea, when you will be reaching your duty through the fire, even to become fooles, that you may be wise in his account: If the Lord be gainer, what if all the world be losers?

He is now preaching. <hi>All flesh is grasse;</hi> you are certainly upon the edge of the fulfilling very great and glorious Prophecies: You see the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vaine thing: <hi>The Kings of the Earth are in Councell, Be wise therefore O yee Judges, kisse the Son lest be be angry, and you perish in the midway.</hi> The Lords desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

When <hi>Constantine</hi> had been bountifull to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> and after was as noble to that of <hi>Bizantium</hi> (now <hi>Constantinople)</hi> a quarrel grew among the two Pastors of these Churches, who should be called <hi>Papa,</hi> which introduced the Proverb, Religion begot wealth, and the mother devoured the daughter.

To be weary of a Parliament now, were to conquer our selves into a new slavery, it were to proclaim to the world we are mercy-sick, victory-sick, and liberty-fick, the Lord prevent that portentous mischiefe. <hi>Yet Goa is good to Israel,</hi> Let me hope he will not be worse then he hath been.</p>
               <p>Nobles and Gentlemen, look upon the Citie, these are they that strengthened you with the finews of your war, you have not come unto them for any thing, and returned empty, You may remember the 100000. li. the 50000. li. the greater, the lesser fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

The Lord of Hosts requite it to them that offered so willingly. I adde, you have not only had these helps, but their servants, yea their children out of their bosomes, who now are found the Officers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in this Army But I might call in much of this again, and say the Parliament have had their labour for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63793:25"/>
and gives reasons from cold, or fals: but addes, a threefold cord is not easily broken, of which I conceive thus: If two be well agreed, Jesus Christ will make a third, and then tell me who shall breake that cord? it will be stronger then all the Covenants the sons of men can make, either nationall, or otherwise. I am herein the bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, because the cursed world neerer hand, and further off are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting a breach here, and some men within this City wals are rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den up and down by Jesuites to perfect this work, and feel not their burden. Would you go again to Egypt? shall we give away our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to Papists, and our libertles to Locusts and Caterpillars? Shall we deliver up the towns we have taken to them that are subtle to destroy? Have we not heard of murthers and rapines enough? Mind what <hi>Abner</hi> said to <hi>Joab,</hi> Hath not the sword devoured e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough? will not the end be bitternesse? Let us have but love at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> and we shall crown the day, and derive some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from this day to the childe unborne, to give it matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</p>
               <p>If you shall object, the work is not done, we are now upon a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis. I answer, Your temptation is new, this was the time of the year when Princes were wont to goe forth to war, but now it proves a time wherein they sue for peace: Blessed change! and the truth is, the Sun may sooner get off your Cloke now, then the Storm could before; the fawning world may do that, the frowning never could. I shall commend unto you two or three Scriptures: The first, the words after my Text, <hi>Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second shall be, <hi>Eccles. 10. 4. If the spirit of the Ruler rise up against thee, keep thy place.</hi> Learn for ever to make good your expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, and let it blow high or low, keep your places. I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you (noble Speakers of both Houses) keep your places, as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you have done: Be not ashamed of that seasonable and wise Answer once made at that exigent, You have neither eyes to see, nor tongues to speak, but by order from the house in such cases. I desire my Lord Major and his brethren to keep their places, and not to be dub'd out of them, nor courted from your comforts and safety, remember what we all fought for, prayed for, adventured all for, let not all be lost in the kisse of a Royall hand, nor suffer your eyes to be put out with Court-glitter and glory: And I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63793:26"/>
your Lordships, not to lead us the way to that mischiefe, for us Ministers, truly we may be apt to catch at the old bait, the Lord help us to keep our places also: It would grieve your soules to be Court-scoffed after all. Let me leave with you what <hi>Tacitus</hi> sayes of <hi>Caesar.</hi>

               <p>Therefore every man keep his place, and in so doing another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is answered: But our old laws and priviledges may again be struck at; read the 8. <hi>v.</hi> of <hi>Eccles. 10. Who so breaketh a hedge, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent shall bite him,</hi> an old hedge, are old good laws, and those that will break them, shall finde a Serpent, you can apply, He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth stones, shall be hurt therewith. And though it should be that <hi>Shimei</hi> might escape for a time with his confinement, yet in the next generation he will break his Covenant, his neck, and all, and thus I thinke of many that have railed against heaven and earth, who will be found out by divine Justice, when your hand cannot reach them. To close up my thoughts in this, you have hitherto liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon daily provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as you do upon your daily bread, &amp; by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence I believe you are brought beyond your own first imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and I know the wisest man here cannot tell what will be next, though in order of causes he may say this or that should be, for who can tell what is in the womb of a day, or what it will bring forth unto us? This is certain, when there's darknesse in Counsels, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, the Lord is pleased to dissipate clouds, and disperse mists by providence; you shall not need to feare relying upon that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hand which hath left you with so many glorious experiences. Onely these cautions I must commend to your wisdomes. 1. That providence be not slighted and bestow that upon Fortune and Chance, which is handed to you by Providence.
<q>
                     <l>—Sed nos</l>
                     <l>Te facimus (Fortuna) Deam coelo<expan>

                           </am>

                        </expan> locamus.</l>
                  </q>
2. That you withstand not providence, but accept and improve the offers of mercy. 3. That you out-run not providence, but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to want what the Lord is not willing to give, not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hasten your deliverance, for it can never come seasonably, being wrought by friend or foe, unlesse the God of your mercies have a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63793:26"/>
hand in it, and truly he that cannot freely trust God in his way up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what you have received already, is not fit to receive more: How good it is to live in his bosome, and upon his hand, who knows how to take measure of your wants, and supply your needs, and that out of an inexhaust fulnesse? Lastly, since feasts are seldome without beggars, give me leave to be the first: and if we had not been over-bold in detaining you already, I should have been large, even from my soule to beg help from this most Honourable Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in foure particulars.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. And for the first, I present you here the teares and cries of many thousands, in the countries we have conquered, who poor souls cry like prisoners at the Grate, Bread, bread, for the Lords sake bread; all you that passe by take Pitty, pitty of us, we have lived upon husks time out of minde. Men, brethren, and fathers, whilest we are disputing here, they are perishing there, and going to hell by droves. If I know any thing, what you have gotten by the sword, must be maintained by the Word, I say the Word by which English Christians are made; In other countries discipline makes them so, drive them into a Church together, and then dub them Christians; you will find too much of this abroad, and hence it comes to passe, that most of their Religion lies in Polemicks, which is the trade we are likely to drive, if God prevent not. I need not tell this Assembly, that every where the greater party is the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall, and the lesser the Hereticks; so once the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rians</hi> afflicted the sound Christians, and they increasing, requited it again to the <hi>Arrians.</hi> It was once my lot to be a Member of that famous, ancient, glorious work of buying in Impropriations, by which work 40 or 50 preachers were maintained in the dark parts of this Kingdom: Divers Knights and Gentlemen in the Country contributed to this work, and I hope they have not lost that spirit: I wish exceeding well to preaching above many things in this world, and wish my brethren were not under these Tithing-temptations, but that the

State had it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>neran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> preachers in all parts of the Kingdom, by which you may reach most of the good ends for this State designed by you: Let poore People first know there is a God, and then teach them the way of Worship. The Prophet sayes, When the husbandman hath plowed, harrowed, and broken the clods, then sow your timely seed, when the face of the earth is made plain. Indeed I think <note place="margin">Isa. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> our work lies much among clods, I wish the face of the earth were cavened. I fear, whilest we are striving for an Eldership clothed with authority, we shall want five thousand Ministers to preach; that if you get an Eldership in <hi>London,</hi> and think you have done much, you have neither Minister nor Elder to be had in half the Kingdom, and so you do nothing, a true Eldership is easier wished for than gotten. I know not why the Parliament may not try and examine men, and send them out to preach, and take cognizance of the successe; I wish that Committee for plundered Ministers to cast in their help. I once read a story of a Chairman, setting forth a Century of base Priests. I wonder what is become of the second, third, and fourth Century: I wish (under the abuse of the Covenant) they be not crept into their old dens for mischief. If you shall preserve the Gospel, the Gospel will preserve you. It would not be amisse even in this City and other places, to turn two or three Meetings to one, and so there might be room in publick for those that are forced into corners, and so suffer under the name of Schismaticks. If this great work were attended abroad, we should not need to be quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at home. I am not so fully acquainted with the use this great Councell hath for my Brethrens advice: but surely I know, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are desperately ignorant and prophane abroad: and from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Priests and ignorant people, you know the other party have fomented this war, and may begin it again, if the Word prevent not the Sword.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I have something to beg for the bodies of men: you have had strong cries from widowes and fatherlesse children, whose husbands and fathers have spent their heart-bloud in this service; you have many mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed men, which puts me in minde of an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for them, if improved: I mean that famous royall Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Charter-House,</hi> or <hi>Suttons</hi> Hospital, they say worth 5 <note place="margin">☞</note> or 6000 l. <hi>per annum.</hi> I humbly beseech your Lordships not to be offended, if I put you in minde of the intentions of the Donor.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63793:27"/>
It is pitie that so gallant a work should prove a nest of unclean Birds; methinks it was built for this time, and God may be much honoured, by turning the givers intentions into the right chanell, many faithfull souls will blesse your care and tendernesse.</p>
               <p>The streets also are swarming with poor, which I refer to the Senators of this Citie, that is glorious many wayes, why should it be so beggarly in the matter of beggars? I leave to your wisdome <hi>de m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>do.</hi> Yet let not my request dye. I have lived in a Countrey, where in seven years I never saw beggar, nor heard an oath, nor lookt upon a drunkard: why should there be beggars in your <hi>Israel</hi> where there is so much work to do? and if this designe were well minded and managed in the City, there would be little place left for such Excentrick motions.</p>
               <p>The third boon I beg is for mens estates, Justice exalteth a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but sinne is a shame to any people. I would beseech all sorts whom it concernes to speed justice; it were better for a man to dye once then often: You reverend Fathers of the Law put in some help here; can there not yet be found a shorter way to further justice? must that badge of conquest still lye upon us, the Lawes I mean, in French? Can there not an expedient be found out in plain English, whereby every one may soon come to his own? Must such mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the most Heroick spirits be spending their brave heats and heights in <hi>Westminster-Hall?</hi> was it not a project to in-gown our gentile English, for feare they might be looking abroad to see how their interests lye? may there not be two or three friend-makers set up in every Parish, without whose labour and leave none should implead another? I crave pardon. There is one evill I have seen under the Sun, a poor man kept in prison for debt, whereby his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is debaucht, and he utterly disabled to pay: It is not so abroad. Let those that lent you freely in this war, and suffer now, be first thought on. I know many have adventured more then all for you, your promise made good for the sale of Delinquents lands will doe it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and lastly, I beg something for mens names; and though I know no publique person but ought to carry a spare Handkerchief to wipe off dirt, yet certainly blasting mens names in print, is not the way to cleare a cause in dispute. Yet I have learnt this of my noble Generall. Let us look to our duty, and the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63793:28"/>
Lord will care for our reproaches; but I leave it to your wisdomes. I need not to tell you, you have Heralds of Armes to keep up mens names that have done worthily, though that spirit breath not in this Army. But I shall shut up all with these Scriptures.</p>
