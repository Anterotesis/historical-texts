         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The Royal Society.</head>
            <p>THE Design of the ensuing Treatise being the Promotion
of a Part of Physico-Mathematical Knowledge in the
<hi>English</hi> Nation; I know not to whom I can more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
present it, than to that noble Body of <hi>English</hi>
Philosophers, whose Foundation by the Royal Charter of King
<hi>Charles II.</hi> is to this very purpose. How far, and how success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
you have hitherto prosecuted the end of this excellent Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
'tis needless for me to declare: since the literate World is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
so abundantly stored with your learned Labours, and useful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoveries;
whereof I could here recount a List of many Hundreds
published by several Members of the Society. But I design not a
Panegyrick, but an humble Address for your Favour and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to my present Endeavours: And this I hope for, with the
more Assurance, having already seen your favourable Acceptance
of many Offerings of this kind, and your ready Incouragement of
all such Philosophical Inquiries, as tend to the use of Life, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Arts and Sciences.</p>
            <p>And on this Occasion I cannot omit expressing my Sence of that
excellent Method of Experimental Philosophy, which now, by your
Example and Incouragement, does so universally prevail, and is so
highly advanced all over <hi>Europe,</hi> and other Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>'Tis wonderful to consider, how the Schools were formerly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
with a sensless kind of Iargon, which they call'd <hi>Philosophy;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96102:3"/>
and which men studied with the greatest Labour and Assiduity, that
they might attain the name of <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Learned.</hi> This certainly
was the greatest Cheat was ever imposed on the mind of Man:
But why say I, <hi>imposed?</hi> Men drew it on themselves, and run
their own Heads into the Noose: and when they had intangled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a thousand ridiculous Disputes about empty Questions, they
vainly thought they had attained the Perfection of Philosophers;
whilst they had no Ideas in their Minds answerable to those Noises
they made with their Tongues; but took more pains to deceive both
themselves and others, than is requisite for the Propagation of <hi>true</hi>
Knowledge. And indeed we may well imagine, that, had the former
Ages of the World been at half that Labour and Study for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of <hi>real</hi> Knowledg, which they spent in promoting ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bose
Stuff; Manking by this time might have been by many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<hi>more wise,</hi> and consequently <hi>more happy</hi> even in this Life;
for <hi>Wisdom</hi> only makes men so.</p>
            <p>But in this last Age the generous Undertakings of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
Societies of <hi>Europe</hi> (to whom your Institution has shewn the
way, and been an illustrious Example) have dissipated these dark
Mists, and have abdicated this kind of empty Stuff; which had
crept into even Natural Disquisitions; and like a Leprosie had quite
over-run the whole Body of Philosophy, deforming its Beauty, and
ruining its Strength. Men are not satisfied now with <hi>noisy Words,</hi>
and nothing else; but require more solid Foundations of Knowledge,
and believe no farther than they can find good Proofs.</p>
            <p>This great Change, which Philosophy or the Prosecution of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
in general has received of late years, is manifest in all its Parts;
but in none more than in <hi>natural Enquiries.</hi> To these you have
given a clearly new Turn, wholly different from the Methods, by
which they were formerly prosecuted in the Schools. And how
advantageously the Change has been made, will be evident to any
that considers the one and t'other Method.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96102:3"/>
The Commentators on <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (who was certainly himself a most
diligent and profound Investigator of Nature) have rendred <hi>Physicks</hi>
on heap of froathy Disputes, managing the whole Knowledge of Body
and Motion,<note place="margin">Consult <hi>Magirus, Eustathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Zanar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Col. Complu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis Com. &amp;c.</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy Books read in our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</note> of Animals, Plants, and Minerals; of Celestial, Aerial and
Terrestrial Bodies; by Hypothetical Conjectures, confirm'd by plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Arguments of Wit and Rhetorick, ordered in a Syllogistical form;
and answering Objections in like manner: But never studied to prove
their Opinions by Experiments. By which Method they were as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Properties and Affections of Natural Bodies, as if they
were not at all the Subject of their Disquisitions. And yet these
were the great Dictators of Physicks for many Ages in our Colleges
and Schooles; and no one was accounted worthy the Name of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
that would not on their Authority <hi>Jurare in verba.</hi> He
that could <hi>Dispute</hi> and <hi>distinguish,</hi> about Sympathy, Antipathy, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Qualities, Antiperistesis, and a Thousand such other fantastick
Terms, was reputed a great Proficient, and deeply vers'd in Natures
Secrets: tho all the while perhaps he knew not any one of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Phaenomena of the Magnet, or was not at all versed in the
History of any one Branch in Nature. They'd rumble out indeed
the Definition and Divisions of <hi>Comets;</hi> but knew nothing of the
Laws of their Motions, or other Affections. They'd tell you the
Tides depend on the <hi>Influence</hi> of the Moon; and when you proceed
farther, and ask, what is this Influence? They'll yet give you a <hi>Word</hi>
for it, and say, 'tis an <hi>occult Quality:</hi> If you inquire, what an <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Quality</hi> is? They'r at a Stand, and having no farther <hi>hard
Word</hi> here to fly to, are forced to confess 'tis a Quality they know
nothing of. Had they not better at first have plainly confest, they
know not the Cause of the Tides? no surely; For tho this had been
more becoming modest Philosphers, it would not so well captivate the
Vulgar, and gain to themselves the Repute of deep Knowledge.</p>
            <p>Yet this verbose Philosophy is that, which for many Generations
prevail'd in the World: This it is, which is injoyn'd to be read and
studied in our Colleges and Academies, by the Statutes and Charters
<pb facs="tcp:96102:4"/>
thereof: which in this Particular, to the apparent Hindrance of the
Advancement of real and useful Knowledge, do yet remain unaltered
in our Universities: wherein the first years of young Students may be
imploy'd with much more Advantage by prosecuting other Methods.
And, My thinks, it were now full time (after so happy a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of our Errors in Religion, and purging our Seminaries of
Learning from the Fopperies and Superstition of a false Worship) to
begin a Reformation of our Human Literature, by establishing more
useful Methods of Education, especially for the Employment of our
more tender years.</p>
            <p>But tho this weighty Undertaking has hitherto been deferr'd in
them (the Reason whereof I leave to the Consideration of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and reverend Heads of our Universities) yet the strong Wits of
many in this last Age have broken all these Fetters; And have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
advanced the true Method of prosecuting Knowledge upon solid
Foundations.</p>
            <p>This is manifest in every Branch of Learning. <hi>Logick</hi> has put
on a Countenance clearly different from what it appeared in formerly:
How unlike is its shape in the <hi>Ars Cogitandi, Recherches de la
Verite,</hi> &amp;c. from what it appears in <hi>Smigletius,</hi> and the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
on <hi>Aristotle?</hi> But to none do we owe for a greater Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this Part of Philosophy, than to the incomparable Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi>
Who, in his <hi>Essay concerning Humane Understanding,</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
more received Mistakes, and delivered more profound Truths,
established on Experience and Observation, for the Direction of Man's
mind in the Prosecution of Knowledge, (which I think may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
term'd <hi>Logick</hi>) than are to be met with in all the Volumes
of the Antients. He has clearly overthrown all those Metaphysical
Whymsies, which infected mens Brains with a Spice of Madness,
whereby they <hi>feign'd a Knowledge where they had none, by
making a noise with Sounds, without clear and distinct Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96102:4"/>
               <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> is now prosecuted by Observation, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and History thereof. And indeed if we consider it rightly,
there is really no other sort of Natural Philosophy, but this only.
For by <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> or <hi>Physicks,</hi> do we mean any thing
else, but the Knowledge of the Properties and Affections of Natural
Bodies? And is this to be obtain'd any otherwise, than by Experiment
and Observation? Can any Man Dispute me into the Knowledge of
the <hi>Magnet's</hi> Attraction, Direction and Variation; or of the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
of the Mercurial Baroscope without Tryal and Experiment?
Can any Arguments prove that a little Sulphur, Nitre, and Charcole
should produce such a quick and strong Blast as Gunpowder, before
they be actually put together and tryed? Men might have disputed
to all Eternity, before their Gibberish could discover the Use of that
ordinary despicable Substance, <hi>Iron-Ore:</hi> To which, for ought I see,
(as a most ingenious Author has observ'd) we are beholding for all
the Politure and Plenty; all the Learning, State, and Magnificence
of the World, beyond the Rudeness, Wants, and Ignorance of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
savage <hi>Americans:</hi> Whose Natural Endowments and Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
equal those of the most flourishing and polite Nations; But they
wanted the Advantagious Uses of this contemptible Mineral. So that
he, who first discovered the Use of that one poor Mine; or <hi>Tubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cain,</hi>
that first taught the way of working in Iron, may be deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
celebrated as the Father of Arts, and Author of most of the
Conveniences of Human Life.</p>
            <p>I know some will say, that by <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> is meant not
only the Knowledge of the Properties and Uses of Natural Bodies;
but also the Assgning the true Reasons or Causes of these Properties.
But in this Particular we are to proceed with great Caution. I
know the Mind of man is of that inquisitive, prying Nature; that
upon any Appearance offer'd to the Senses, it immediately falls to the
search after the Cause producing this Effect. But indeed in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Disquisitions, 'tis generally (I may say almost alwayes) to no
purpose. We may make plausible Conjectures, and some sort of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Guesses; but others perhaps may make others, and these also
<pb facs="tcp:96102:5"/>
equally probable. But these deserve not the Name of <hi>Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy;</hi>
they serve only for Chat and Diversion. For the <hi>omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Contriver</hi> of the Universe has order'd Natures Operations to
be performed by such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine Springs, secret Motions, and inexplicable
Ways; that Man in this Life may well despair of attaining the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Knowledge thereof; and must therefore content himself with the
Contemplation of plain matter of Fact, in which he cannot be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
But yet, that we may not wholly suppress this inquisitive Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
but may only keep it within just Bounds: It will be granted,
That whatever immediate Cause can be assigned to an Effect; and it
can be proved so to be by some convincing Experiments; and these
be often repeated, and diligently examn'd, and found to agree and
conspire together; we may be allow'd to found thereon an <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
or <hi>Supposal</hi> of this Cause, but no more. We must not positively
establish it as the undoubted, adequate Cause; for this we may miss
after our most diligent Inquiry. However the Experiments we use
and demonstrate to sense, for the establishing our Hypothesis, shall be
allowed as unquestionable Verities; and shall be embraced as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Steps of Advancement in the Knowledge of Nature.</p>
            <p>But of the Uncertainty of Assigning Natural Causes I shall give
but one Instance, and that perhaps as strong as any we shall meet
with in Philosophy. We are apt to think, that the Cause of the Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
of the Mercury in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Gravitation</hi> of the <hi>Air:</hi> And we prove it by a most convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Experiment; for putting the Baroscope into the Pneumatick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
exhaust the Air, and the Mercury immediately subsides. But
when we consider it a little farther, we shall find, That hereby we
have obtaind little more certain Knowledge, than plainly the matter
of Fact of this latter Experiment, and not the adequate Cause of the
first Experiment enquired after. For we can only conclude from hence,
that the Equipoise of Liquors is the Cause of the Mercury's Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
But what is the Cause of this Equipoise of Liquors, or the
Cause of the Gravitation of any Liquors, or any Bodies? That is,
What is the Cause of Gravity in general is clearly unknown to us;
<pb facs="tcp:96102:5"/>
and consequently the ultimate Cause of the Mercury's Suspension is
not hereby discovered. 'Tis true indeed, by this Experiment we have
most probably arriv'd at the Knowledge of <hi>one Link more</hi> in the
<hi>Chain</hi> of Natural Causes; but this is not conclusive; this puts not an
end to the Enquiry: For so if one looking at a Pendulum Clock should
enquire, Why the Pendulum does not cease by degrees from vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?
And he were answered, That it is kept in motion by the next
immediate Wheel that beats on the Pallats: And this were offer'd to
be proved by Experiment; for stop the motion of this Wheel, and the
Pendulum soon ceases: Would he not presently be satisfied, and go
away secure, that he had discovered the Cause of the Continuation of
the Pendulum's Motion? And yet certainly he has mistaken <hi>one single
Link</hi> for the <hi>whole Chain.</hi> For if he proceeded farther; and had
enquired, What moved this Wheel? He would find, the next Wheel,
and so onwards to the Weight or Spring. But here he's at a Loss;
for what moves <hi>them,</hi> is absolutely unknown.</p>
            <p>As to most other Reasons in <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> that usually pass
as satisfactory, and are received as Accounts of Nature's Proceedings:
We shall generally find them little more, than farther Illustrations of
the Matter enquired after in some <hi>different Words.</hi> Thus if it be
asked, What is the Reason the Sun casts a shadow from some Bodies,
<hi>viz.</hi> those we call opaque, and none from others, <hi>viz.</hi> Transparent
Bodies? 'Tis answer'd, Because by the opaque Body the Rays of
the Sun are stopt in their Progress, and hindred from enlighting
that Part of the Ground or Floor that is behind the Body: In the
Transparent Body the Rays pass freely. This would be taken by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
as deep Reasoning; and yet is really no more than Tautology;
as if we should say, the Sun casts a Shadow, Because he casts a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
But it gives no Account of the Opacity of one Body, and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency
of another, which truly the Question requires. If we ask,
How Fire burns? 'Tis answered, by exciting a violent Motion in the
Parts of the Combustible Matter: Which indeed is no more than the
same thing in different Words. But how Motion is excited or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
by one Body to another, is absolutely inexplicable. Yet these
<pb facs="tcp:96102:6"/>
Kind of <hi>Verbal</hi> Reasons do generally pass in Talk, and serve to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse
as well as the best.</p>
            <p>Since therefore we cannot expect to arrive at the intimate Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Natures Operations: Let us apply our selves to know as much
of Her, as we may be certain of. And this only is in Matters of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
and Tryal; wherein by the infallible Guidance of our Sences,
we cannot be deceived. For tho, <hi>Experimentum periculosum,</hi>
be an ancient Aphorism; yet we must consider of what Experiments
it was pronounced, <hi>viz.</hi> of those in Medicine and Disease. It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
not to all, when diligently enquired into, and often repeated.
But when we meet with any Experiment that is thus fallacious, we
are not to rely on it; yet of this we may be sure, and lay it down
as a discover'd Certainty, that <hi>sometimes it hits, sometimes it
misses;</hi> and in this Truth we cannot be deceived, seeing we have so
often found it.</p>
            <p>But I have lanch'd out thus far, before I was aware: I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
my self, and beg Pardon both for this Digression, and for telling
you Things which you very well know already, at the same time when
I offer you a Petition. But my Desire of propagating this useful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod

me the more to your Favour, who are the great Patrons thereof,
and in Account whereof your Name is deservedly celebrated all over

            <p>Permit me therefore to lay this Offering at your Feet, it being the
Explication of one of the most noble Instruments of Experimental Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.
Not that I think thereby to add any think considerable to the

            <head>ADMONITION
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>BEFORE the Reader proceed to the following Sheets, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
he may take notice;</p>
            <p>First, That he is not to expect <hi>Geometrical Strictness</hi> in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Particulars of this Doctrine. I say, in <hi>several</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;
For many there are, which will bear the most <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
Exactness: Kepler, Cavallerius, Herigon, Dechales, Honoratus Faber,
Gregorius, Barrow,</hi> and other Authors have taken this Liberty; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more desirous of shewing in gross the Properties of Glasses and
their Effects in Telescopes, than of affecting a <hi>Nicety,</hi> which would
be of little Use in Practice. Thus we shall find in what follows, that
many Lines are supposed <hi>equal,</hi> which strictly taken are really not
so; but yet are so very little different, that for all use, and ease of
Demonstration, they may be taken as <hi>equal.</hi> Thus also we suppose
very small <hi>Angles</hi> and their <hi>Sines</hi> to be <hi>proportional;</hi> which <hi>precisely</hi>
is not so, but is so to the smallest and most insensible Difference.
Thus likewise, we sometimes consider not the <hi>Glasses Thickness,</hi> but
suppose it of the <hi>least Thickness imaginable,</hi> or of no Thickness at all;
which yet is false, but does hardly prejudice any Demonstration. For
<hi>Dioptricks</hi> being a part of <hi>mixt Mathematicks,</hi> conversant about <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Lines</hi> (or Rays of Light) and the refractive Power of a <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi>
Glass, cannot be delivered with that <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Reader will find some <hi>Corollaries</hi> and <hi>Scholiums</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
delivered, which of themselves more properly might have consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Propositions. But these did not occur so readily in the course
of the Work, And therefore I chose rather to add them as <hi>Corollaries</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96102:7"/>
than change the number of Propositions and Citations. Of this kind
are <hi>Corol. ad Prop. 8. Corol. ad Prop.</hi> 15. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I have presumed to intitle this Work <hi>Dioptrica Nova,</hi> as
being indeed almost <hi>wholly new.</hi> Very little being borrowed from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but what is requisite to shew the former Methods of Authors
in demonstrating their Propositions, and to keep up the Consecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Series of the Propositions of this Book. Besides, I can say,
that the <hi>Geometrical Method</hi> of calculating a Rays Progress, which
in many particulars is so amply delivered hereafter, is <hi>wholly new,</hi>
and never before publish'd. And for the first Intimation thereof, I
must acknowledg my self obliged to my worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed.
Astron. Reg.</hi> who had it from some unpublished Papers of
Mr. <hi>Gascoignes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, I declare, That if in any thing hereafter delivered, I have
made any Mistakes, or not so clearly expressed my self upon Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, I shall be most ready to <hi>retract.</hi> And therefore if in any
thing I have <hi>slip'd,</hi> or made a <hi>false Step,</hi> I desire the ingenious and
candid Reader either to inform me thereof, and upon Conviction, I
shall <hi>submit;</hi> or else that he would freely pardon the Error; <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho I had begun, and made some Progress in this Work in <hi>Latin;</hi>
yet I thought it convenient (at least for the present) to alter my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
There being nothing in <hi>this Part of Mathematicks</hi> ever yet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
in <hi>English.</hi> And I am sure there are many ingenious Heads,
great Geometers, and Masters in Mathematicks, who are not so well
skill'd in <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Forreigners may think this Work deserves their Perusal; in time
perhaps I may satisfie them.</p>
            <p>And because I have studied to be as plain as possibly I could, I
have chosen rather to be <hi>prolix</hi> in many Particulars, than leave any
Ambiguity to the most ordinary Mathematician. And therefore in
demonstrating, I often repeat several Steps tho the least altered; that
all things may lye as plain as possible. And on this Account I
hope, the curious and profound Geometers will pardon me; I know
they are used to what is <hi>concise</hi> and <hi>closely</hi> put together, much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in a little: But this Method suits not every Reader: And
I have chosen to accommodate mine to the plainest Capacities.</p>
            <p>Lastly, in this practical kind of Mathematicks, I desire the Reader
to have frequent recourse to Experiments, for these illustrate the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
and make many things clear, which otherwise will pass obscurely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96102:7"/>
I use the common Notes of Algebra, with two or three new ones
introduced by <hi>Branker</hi> or Dr. <hi>Pell,</hi> such as</p>

            <p>In the Demonstrations the larger and lesser Margins or Columns
are of the same use as is expressed in Dr. <hi>Pell</hi>'s <hi>Algebra.</hi> To which

                  <p>I. GF is a Ray of Light falling inclined on the Glass ABCD;
this Ray coming out of a <hi>Rare Medium,</hi> as Air, into a <hi>Dense
Medium,</hi> as Glass, does not proceed on its direct Course in
a streight Line towards I; but at the Point of Incidence F
'tis bent or refracted <hi>towards</hi> the Perpendicular F M, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the refracted Ray FH.</p>
                  <p>II. At H is its Point of <hi>Incidence</hi> again, from Glass a <hi>Dense
Medium</hi> to Air a <hi>Rare,</hi> and in this Passage, 'tis refracted <hi>from</hi>
the Perpendicular H Z; so that instead of proceeding directly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96102:10"/>
strait in F H L, 'tis refracted from the Perpendicular H Z, and
becomes H K: So that if the Surface A B be parallel to the
Surface D C, the Ray becomes again as if it had not been
refracted; for now HK runs parallel to G F. The natural
Reason of this Refraction is variously assigned by divers, and
is properly of a Physical consideration; and what is offered
therein, is little more than Hypothetical Conjecture. I shall
not therefore mix Guesses with Demonstration: The Matter
of Fact is manifest from Ten Thousand repeated Experiments,
and this is sufficient to my purpose. But yet there is such an
ingenious Hypothesis concerning this Matter, published in the

cannot be <hi>parallel,</hi> for they always <hi>diverge:</hi> Yet when an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is at such a great distance, and that parcel of Rays which
is considered, is so small, that their Divergence is little or

to be parallel Rays.</p>

                  <p>These Propositions in the 4th. and 5th. Experiments we
shall retain in the following Demonstrations, for the Ease and
Plainness thereof. But in Calculation we shall observe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
that follows in the 6th. Experiment.</p>
                  <p>VI. But the most Learned and Ingenious Mr. <hi>Isaac Newton</hi> of
<hi>Cambridge</hi> discovered by most accurate Experiments, that these
Proportions of <hi>Kepler</hi> were not sufficiently exact: For <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
first found, that Refractions were not to be measured by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Angles, but by the Proportion of Sines. See his Diop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks
<hi>Cap. 2. Sec. 7.</hi> And therefore Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> apply'd himself to
discover the Proportion of the Sines, and found, <hi>That from Air
to Glass, the Sine</hi> A K <hi>or</hi> D F <hi>of the Angle of Incidence</hi> A B K <hi>or</hi>
D B G: <hi>is to the Sine</hi> I H <hi>or</hi> C G <hi>of the refracted Angle</hi> C B G <hi>or</hi>
I B H :: <hi>As 300 to</hi> 193. (<hi>or near, as 14. to 9.) And on the contrary,
that from Glass to Air, the Sine of the Incidence: Is to the Sine of
the refracted Angle :: as 193: to 300, or as 9 to</hi> 14. But the
same Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> in his Dissertations concerning <hi>Colours</hi> and
<hi>Light,</hi> publish'd in the <hi>Philosophical Transactions,</hi> has at large
demonstrated, that the Rays of Light are not all <hi>Homogeneous,</hi>
or of the same sort, but of different Forms and Figures, so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96102:11"/>
that some are more refracted than others, tho they have the
same or equal Inclinations on the Glass: And therefore there
can be no constant Proportion setled between the Sines of the
Incidence and of the refracted Angles. But the Proportion
that comes nearest Truth, for the middle and strong Rays of
Light, is nearly as 300 to 193, or 14 to 9.</p>
                  <p>VII. As the Sine of the Angle of any one Inclination: To
the Sine of its refracted Angle :: So is the Sine of any other
Inclination: To the Sine of its refracted Angle. Therefore
by Experiment, finding the Proportion of the Sines of any one

                  <p>Wherefore the Incidence or Inclination of a Ray being given,
'tis easie finding the refracted Angle; for the Proportion is,
as 300 : To 193 :: (or as 14 to 9) So the Sine of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence:
To the Sine of the refracted Angle, from Air to
Glass.</p>
                  <p>Or Mechanically thus, A B K being the given Angle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence,
by a Sector make the Sine there of K A or D F 300
parts (or 14) and take 193 (or 9) of the same parts, and
make therewith C G or H I the Sine of the refracted Angle;
then draw B C, this is the progress of the Ray A B after it
enters the Glass.</p>

That is, <hi>Tab. 1. Fig.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Ta. 1. Fi. 1</note> Suppose the luminous Point
G in Air, to send from it the Ray G F upon the Glass A D;
this Ray by the Glass is refracted into F H within the Glass.
Let us now imagin the Point H within the Glass, to be a
luminous Point, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ending out from it self the Ray H F: This
Ray upon its Emersion from Glass into Air, instead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96102:12"/>
directly to N, is refracted into F G. And so likewise
supposing the Luminous Point G, to send its Ray G F, which
after a double Refraction on each Surface of the Glass proceeds
first in F H, and afterwards in H K; if we conceive K a Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Point, sending its Ray K H on the Glass; this Ray af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a double Refraction on the two Surfaces of the Glass shall
be refracted first into H F and then into F G; taking the same
reciprocal Progress in both Cases.</p>
                  <p>And this is not so properly proved from Experiment (tho
that also does abundantly and most exactly confirm this Truth)
but 'tis manifest and self-evident from the very Nature of the
thing. For whatever physical Reason there is, which causes
the Ray G F proceeding from Air into the Glass A D to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted
from its direct Course F I into F H; the same reason
there must needs be to cause the Ray H F, proceeding from the
Glass A D into the open Air, to be refracted from its direct
Course F N into F G. For doubtless the Refraction proceeds from
the Disparity of the Mediums (but how or in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
tis needless to enquire in this place). Now the difference of
the Mediums on their two determining Surfaces, or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the
Point of Incidence F, continues the same, let the Ray proceed
from which of them soever. For there is as great a reciprocal
Difference between Glass and Air, as between Air and Glass;
and consequently the Refraction must needs be reciprocal.

XIV. Suppose the Glass GK exposed in the Hole of a Shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in a dark Room, and that thereby the Object ABC were
represented on a white Paper in FED (how this is done we
shall see hereafter.) From each Point of this Object there falls
a parcel of Rays on the Surface of the whole Glass; thus
from the Point B, there falls B G, B H, B K. This parcel
of Rays is called <hi>A Cone of Rays,</hi> having its Vertex in the
Point of the Object B, and its Base on the Glass.</p>
                  <p>XV. To this Cone of Rays there is another Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
on tother side the Glass G E K, which has its Base like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
on the Glass, and its <hi>Vertex</hi> in a correspondent Point E
of the Representation.</p>

<hi>A Pencil of Rays.</hi>

                  <p>XVII. Each Pencil of Rays has one Ray amongst the rest,
which is called its <hi>Axis.</hi> The <hi>Axis</hi> of the direct Pencil B G E K
is the Ray B H E, which falls perpendicularly on the Glass,
and passes through it unrefracted. But the Axis of any of
the oblique Pencils, as A G F K is some certain Ray, as A H F,
which, tho it fall obliquely, and consequently is refracted
by the Glass, yet being refracted <hi>from</hi> the perpendicular at
its Egress from the Glass, as much as it was refracted <hi>towards</hi>
the Perpendicular, at its Ingress into the Glass; it may be taken
as not refracted at all; but that part of this Axis which is
before the Glass (<hi>viz.</hi> AH between the Object and Glass)
and that part of it which is behind the Glass (<hi>viz.</hi> HF be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Representation and the Glass) do run parallel to
each other, or rather in one Right Line; that part of it only
which is within the Glass, being bent out of its strait Course.
And that in each oblique Pencil of Rays (for of the direct
Pencil 'tis manifest) there is such a certain Ray thus affected,
shall appear more fully hereafter. And here we are to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
between the <hi>Axis of a Pencil of Rays,</hi> and the <hi>Axis of the

                     <p>In the little Tables inserted in <hi>Tab. 4.</hi> and <hi>Tab. 5.</hi> I have
given Examples at large of the Calculation of the Progress of

perhaps any Errors do intervene, they are easily corrected.</p>
                     <p>By these Tables we may perceive, that the Point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<hi>z</hi> is distant from the Pole of the Glass <hi>f</hi> about a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the Convexity, but not fully so much.</p>
                     <p>'Tis also to be noted in <hi>Tab. 4. Fig. 1</hi> That the Point of

it can be no more below it than a Diameter and half. By the

AB is a Ray of Light falling on the Glass GL parallel to the
Axis C D. C is the Centre of the Convexity G P L. Joyn C B;
the Angle of Incidence or Inclination is BCD, the Angle of
Refraction is E B D or B D C.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore in the Triangle B C D, the Angle B C D being
double the Angle BDC (For by <hi>Kepler</hi>'s Experiments, which
are follow'd by most Authors, from Glass to Air, the Angle
of Incidence : is to the Angle of Refraction :: as 2 : to 1.)
the Side B D shall be double the Side B C; the Angles and
Sides or Sines under 15 Degrees being proportional; but D P
is almost equal to B D (for the Thickness and Breadth of the
Glass, in Optick Glasses especially in Glasses of Long <hi>Foci,</hi>

the Exactness of the Demonstration; for the Glass is to be

to the Axis E G. This Ray, (after it has suffered a Double
Refraction, one at its Ingress from Air into Glass at H towards
the Perpendicular H F, by which it becomes the Refracted Ray
H M, and another Refraction at its Egress from Glass to Air
at M from the Perpendicular P M, by which, instead of going
forward towards R, it becomes the Refracted Ray M G) at
G crosses the Axis, so that G E is the Diameter of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity

For the Incidence or Inclination of the Ray K H is L H F, of
which Angle there is taken off ⅓ L H M, for the Angle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction
from Air to Glass is ⅓ of the Incidence (by <hi>Exper.</hi> 4.)
If therefore the Ray had proceeded onwards in Glass towards R,
it had crossed the Axis at a Diameter' and half (by the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Proposition), but at its egress into Air at M, it is again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted
from the Perpendicular P M by the Angle R M G = ½
P M R. The Angle of Refraction R M G from Glass to Air,
being ½ the Incidence P M R (by <hi>Exper.</hi> 5.) But P M R is
equal to L H M. Wherefore the first Angle of Incidence LHF
by this Double Refraction, has lost first ⅓ of it self LHM,
and again ½ of this Third RMG: But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

respect to its Thickness, or to the Refraction the Ray suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers

let us imagin, that by the first Refraction, the Ray were
brought nigher the Perpendicular H F by half the Angle of
Incidence L H F, and we shall find, that then the Ray shall
cross the Axis at G; so that GE shall be the Diameter of the
Convexity. For LHG or G H F is equal to ½ LHF or HFE
the Incidence, but H F E is equal to G H F + H G F (32. 1.

                  <p>If by this Method we calculate the Progress of a Ray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>through
a Double Convex-Glass of equal Convexities; and the Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Glass be little or nothing in comparison of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius
of the Convexity; and the Distance of the Point of Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from the Axis be but small, we shall find the Point of
Concourse to be distant from the Glass about the Radius of the
Convexity nearly.</p>
                  <p>This our Third Proposition in most Dioptrick Writers is
usually thus expressed.</p>
                  <p>Parallel Rays falling on a Double Convex-Glass of equal Convexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
on both sides, are united with the Axis, about the Distance of the
Radius of the Convexity from the Pole of the Glass, if the Segment
be but 30 Degrees.</p>
                  <p>But their Demonstrations of this Proposition are usually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
enough, by reason of the smallness and multiplicity of
Angles, which are expressed in their Figures, as also by the
Thickness of the Glass, which they are forced to represent, and
yet is to be neglected in their Demonstrations. I shall give as
short a Demonstration as I can, after their Method, as follows.</p>

               <p>Hitherto I have consider'd only the <hi>Direct</hi> Rays. I come
now to the Consideration of <hi>Oblique</hi> Rays: And for this we
must have Recourse to our foregoing <hi>13th.</hi> and <hi>17th.</hi> Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
as also to the first and second Experiments: By the
13th Definition, we know what <hi>Oblique</hi> Rays are: And by
the 17th Definition, we learn that in every Parcel of <hi>Oblique</hi>
Rays, flowing from the same Point of an Object upon a
Glass; there is one certain Ray, which may be called the
<hi>Axis,</hi> and that this <hi>Axis</hi> is as it were not at all refracted. But
for a farther Declaration hereof, <hi>Tab. 9. Fig.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Ta. 9. Fi. 1.</note> Let <hi>a b c</hi> be
a Plano-Convex Glass, with the Convex Side towards the
Object, <hi>d b</hi> the Axis of the <hi>Direct</hi> Cone of Rays, <hi>e b</hi> a Ray
of the <hi>Oblique</hi> Cone, falling on the Vertex of the Glass at <hi>b,</hi>
I say, this is the Axis of an <hi>Oblique</hi> Cone, and after its Double
Refraction; first at its Ingress at <hi>b,</hi> and then at its Egress at <hi>f,</hi>
it becomes <hi>f g</hi> Parallel to <hi>e b.</hi> This is Evident, if we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the Ray <hi>e b</hi> to fall on the Plane Glass <hi>amnc,</hi> for 'tis
refracted the same way in one Case as in t other. Wherefore
the Ray <hi>e b f g,</hi> is as it were st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96102:30"/>
likewise we may imagine the Plane Side of this same Glass <hi>a c</hi>
turn'd towards the Object, then <hi>p b d</hi> is the Axis of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi>
Cone, and <hi>g f</hi> the Axis of an <hi>Oblique</hi> Cone. We see
therefore that a Plano-Convex Glass, being exposed with its
<hi>Convex Side</hi> to the Object, the Rays that fall from the several
Points of the Object, whose <hi>Ingress</hi> is at the Glasses <hi>vertex b,</hi>
are the <hi>Axes</hi> of the respective Cones. But the <hi>Plane</hi> Side be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards the Object, the Rays from the several Points,
which have their <hi>Egress</hi> at the Glasses <hi>vertex b,</hi> are the Axes
of the respective Cones. And that amongst the Infinite Rays
that proceed from a <hi>Collateral</hi> Point of an Object, and form
an <hi>Oblique</hi> Cone, falling on the Plano-Convex Glass; there is
some one certain Ray, that falls on the Vertex, and has its
<hi>Ingress</hi> at <hi>b;</hi> Or (if the Plane Side be towards the Object)
has its Emersion at <hi>b,</hi> is manifest from this Reason only, that
the Rays compounding such a Cone, are spread over the <hi>Whole</hi>
surface of the Glass, and are as it were <hi>Infinite</hi> or <hi>Indefinite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner, <hi>Tab. 9. Fig. 2. a b c k</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ta. 9. Fi. 2.</note> is a Double Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex

again to <hi>e h,</hi> as if it had not been at all refracted, but
had passed directly forward, or through a Plane Glass. This
also will be manifest, if at the Point of Incidence <hi>h,</hi> and at
the Point of Emersion <hi>f,</hi> we draw the Tangents <hi>mn, or;</hi> for
these Tangents are Parallel when <hi>h b</hi> and <hi>f k</hi> are equal Arches;
and the Ray <hi>e h</hi> is no otherwise refracted by the Convex Glass,
than if it had fallen on the Plane Glass <hi>mnor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that amongst the Infinite Rays that proceed from a
Collateral Point of an Object, and form an <hi>Oblique</hi> Cone, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on the Double Convex <hi>abck;</hi> there is some one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Ray, that has its Incidence so, that after its Refraction at
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96102:30"/>
its Ingress, it may proceed so in the Glass, as to cut off equal
Arches <hi>b h, k f,</hi> may be easily conceived; because the whole
surface of the Glass is occupy'd by each Cone from each Point;
so that the Point <hi>h</hi> (for instance) cannot miss of having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest its Ray, which must necessarily be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted.</p>
               <p>What has been said concerning a Double Convex of Equal
Convexities <hi>Tab. 9. Fig. 2.</hi> may be accommodated to a Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Convex of unequal Convexities <hi>Tab. 9. Fig. 3.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ta. 9. Fi. 3.</note> For as in
<hi>Fig. 2.</hi> the Arches <hi>b h, k f,</hi> are to be equal (the Convexities

that is to say, <hi>bh</hi> is to be as many degrees of its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,

4 Inches; these Radii being to each other as 2 to 1, <hi>k f</hi>
must be to <hi>b h</hi> as 2 to 1, for then they shall be of equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
each in its own respective Circumference, for here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in this third <hi>Fig.</hi> the Tangents at <hi>h</hi> and <hi>f,</hi> run Parallel

               <p>The Axes of all the Radious Cones, falling on a Plano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Convex

               <p>The Axes of all the Radious Cones, falling on a Double

               <p>The Axes of all the Radious Cones, falling on a Double
Convex of unequal Convexities, Cross each other in a Point
within the Glass in its Axis, which divides the said Axis in
the Proportion, that the Radius of one Convexity has to the
Radius of t'other. <hi>Tab. 9. Fig. 3.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ta. 9. Fi. 3.</note> Let the Radius of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity
<hi>a k c</hi> be to the Radius of the Convexity <hi>a b c,</hi> as 2 to

               <p>The same may be understood of Concave Glasses.</p>
               <p>And this is sufficient for explaining what I mean by the

                  <p>I shall propose one Case more in this Doctrine of <hi>Oblique

trace a Ray in this Case by Calculation, and find out a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

thus, <hi>q f = q h</hi> the Radius of the Convexity is given 20000,
<hi>f g</hi> the thickness of the Glass is given 5858; And <hi>q f−g f=

Infinite Rays, which falling on the Glass, and being refracted

we are now to consider as very remote, so that tho the Figure,
for want of Room in the Paper, expresses the Rays flowing

B H being supposed vastly great, in Comparison to the Glasses
Breadth G K (But after the 5th. Proposition following, this
Advertisement of the great distance of the Object will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
as therein shall appear) G H K is a Plano-Convex-Glass,
receiving on its Surface a Cone of Rays from each single Point
of the Object, but here for avoiding Confusion in the Scheme,
we have only expressed the Cones flowing from the uppermost,
middle, and lower Point of the Object, that is, from A, C,
and B; and in each of these Cones neither have we expressed
any more Rays than the Axis of the Cone (as for instance) A H,
and the two extreme Rays of the same Cone A G and A K.</p>
                     <p>First therefore for the Rays that flow from the Point A.
By what forgoes we know that the Axis of this Cone A H,
after it has passed the Glass proceeds directly towards F, as if
it were not at all refracted; and that the Rays A G, A K, are
united with this Axis in a Point (suppose at F) distant from
the Glass about the Diameter of its Convexity (the Glass
being a Plano-Convex) and what is said of the Rays A G.
A K, being united with their Axis, must be conceived of all the
Rays that make up the whole Cone flowing from this single
Point A: and they are all united likewise with the Axis in the
Point F, forming another correspondent Cone G F K, having its
Base on the Glass, and its Vertex in the Point F, making the
Pencil of Rays F G A K F.</p>
                     <p>And so likewise, what is declared of the Point A, and the
Rays that flow from it, and of their being united together in
F, may be easily conceived of the Rays flowing from the
middly Point B, and their being united in E; and may
be also understood of the Rays flowing from C, and their
union in D; and so of the Rays proceeding from any other
Point in the Object A B C, and their being united in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent
Point in F E D. And this F E D we call the
<hi>Distinct Base, Focus, or Burning Point.</hi> 'Tis called the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96102:41"/>
Base,</hi> because therein is a <hi>Distinct</hi> Representation of the
Object. And supposing the Glass G K in the Hole of a dark
Room, so that the Representation F E D may be disturbed by
no other luminous rays from outward Objects, and a Paper
were placed at D E F, there to receive the Image, we should
thereon see the Object most livelily painted in its exact Shape
and Colours. 'Tis called the <hi>Focus,</hi> or <hi>Burning Point,</hi> because
the Glass being exposed to the Sun, it there collects the Rays
from each Point of the Sun's Body, and paints its Image
there most vividly, exciting a violent Heat, even to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming
of combustible Bodies.</p>
                     <p>But whereas in a <hi>Scholium</hi> after the Third <hi>Proposition,</hi> it is
observed, that the Rays falling nigh the Axis are not united
thereto so near the Glass, as the Rays that fall farther from the
Axis. And consequently that all the Rays from one Point in
the Object, do not united a correspondent Point in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Base,</hi> but that (as we have noted before) the Focus has
some Depth, and consists not in an Indivisible Point. Yet
this hinders not the Representation in the <hi>Distinct Base</hi> to be very
lively and exact. For tho all the Rays from each Point are
not united in an answerable Point in the Image, yet there are
a sufficient quantity of them to render the Representation very
perfect. And tho some Rays from other adjacent Points may
a little intermix with those from its neighbouring Parts, yet
these are so few, that they make no great disturbance.</p>
                     <p>Moreover in a <hi>Scholium</hi> following the Fourth <hi>Proposition,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">N. B.</note>
'tis observed, that when the Incidence of the oblique Rays is
very oblique, that then their Concourse with their Axis is not
so very regular. From, hence it proceeds, that the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the <hi>Distinct Base</hi> is not so clear and exact towards
the Extremes, as towards the Middle.</p>
                     <p>As for the reason of this surprizing Appearance in a dark
Chamber, wherein there is a small Hole armed with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96102:41"/>
Glass; it will be manifest, if we consider, that from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Point in the inverted Representation on the Paper, the Rays
proceed to the Eye that looks at it, exactly in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as from the Object it self. For let us imagin the Point
A to be <hi>Blue,</hi> B to be <hi>Yellow,</hi> and C <hi>Red.</hi> Because all the
Rays flowing from A are separated by themselves, and fall
in the Image on the Point F, where no other Rays intermix
with them no disturb them, they must needs there represent <hi>Blue.</hi>
For passing through the Glass, it being a Diaphanous Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Medium, does not at all alter them (notwithstanding the
Appearance of the <hi>Prisme,</hi>) and the Point F in the Paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        </gap>lightened only with Rays of <hi>Blue</hi> Light, and of it self
being <hi>White,</hi> indifferent to all Colours, or rather indeed of no
Colour, must needs represent <hi>Blue;</hi> and so E <hi>Yellow,</hi> and D
<hi>Red.</hi> As to the <hi>Shape</hi> of the Object, it must needs be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
exact likewise; for every Physical Point in the Object
sending out a Cone of Rays falling on the Glass, and these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
formed into another Correspondent Cone on the other side
the Glass, determining their Vertices in Correspondent Points
of the Image; the Eye must necessarily perceive on the Paper
the lively Image of the Object, being it is affected in the same
way by <hi>This,</hi> as by the Object it self. for from the Object it
self the Eye receives only a Cone of Rays from each of its
Points, and so it receives a Cone of Rays form each Point
in the Image on the Paper; each Point in the Image on the
Paper being enlightened by the Rays it receives through the
Glass; and consequently the Paper, being an Impolite Surface,
reflects these Rays into the whole circumjacent Medium.

                     </p>
                     <p>And now that I am on the Consideration of this Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
it may not be improper to consider the Effect of a Plain
small Hole without a Glass in a dark Room. <hi>Tab. 14. Fig. 2.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tab. 14. Fig. 2.</note>
represents a dark Chamber, in whose side there is a small Hole
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96102:42"/>
                        <hi>g k,</hi> ½ an Inch wide; <hi>a b c</hi> is a distant Object. Now because
there is no Glass in the Hole <hi>g k,</hi> the Rays from each Point of
the Object pass through the Hole directly strait, and represent
on the Wall within, at <hi>dedfef,</hi> a faint and confused Image of
the Object: Because here by the narrowness of the Hole, the
Rays from some Points are hindred from intermixing with the
Rays from some other Points; as here the Rays from the Point
<hi>a</hi> do not intermix on the Wall with the Rays from the Point
<hi>c;</hi> for we see <hi>d d</hi> do not intermix with <hi>f f.</hi> But then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
is confused; for tho some Rays are hereby hindred
from intermixing with some other Rays, yet other Rays from
nigh adjoyning Points do intermix with their neighbouring
Rays, as here the Rays from <hi>a,</hi> and those from <hi>b</hi> are blended
together in <hi>f e,</hi> and so those from <hi>c</hi> and <hi>b</hi> in <hi>d e.</hi> And if the
Hole be made so narrow as to hinder this communication of
Rays in a great measure (for 'tis absolutely impossible to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it altogether) then the opening ad mits so few Rays from
each Point, that the Image is obscure and imperceivable.</p>
                     <p>There is another Particular relating to this Appearance in a

Optick Writers which I have consulted. Particularly <hi>Zahn</hi> in

Account thereof. The Matter is thus; in <hi>Tab. 14. F. 1.</hi>

if the Image D E F in the dark Chamber be received on a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi>
or Looking Glass instead of a White Paper, the Eye
perceives a most dilute and faint Image on the <hi>Speculum:</hi> But if
the <hi>Speculum</hi> be placed any where between G K and D E F, and
a Paper placed as far distant from the <hi>Speculum</hi> before it, as the
distinct Base D E F is behind the <hi>Speculum;</hi> then the <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>
shall reflect on the Paper the distinct Image of the Object.</p>
                     <p>The dilute and very faint Image, which the Eye perceives
on the <hi>Speculum</hi> in the first Case, proceeds from the Imperfect
Politure of the <hi>Speculum;</hi> For if it were a most exquisitely
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96102:42"/>
smooth Surface, even that faint Image it self would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
But as 'tis impossible by the Industrly of Man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
such, and all Miroirs partake in some measure of a little
Roughness, therefore it is that we have that dilute Image. And
the reason we have no such vivid Representation from a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum
(considered as a perfectly polish'd Surface) as from a
Paper, as also the reason of the appearance in the second fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
posture of the Speculum, does so depend on the
Doctrine of Reflection or Catoptricks, that I shall pass it over
in this place, it being manifest to any one meanly versed in
that Doctrine. <hi>Vid. Schol. Prop. 52. Gregorii Optic. Promot.</hi>

                     <p>We have hitherto considered the Radiating Points of <hi>Distant</hi>
Objects both <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>Oblique,</hi> the Rays from each single
Point whereof do proceed as it were Parallel. I come now
to the Consideration of <hi>Nigh</hi> Objects or <hi>Diverging</hi> Rays, and
for these let us look back on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and
9th Definitions.</p>
                     <p>When the Rays from each Point of an Object run as it
were <hi>Parallel,</hi> we may imagin that they may be <hi>sooner</hi> or <hi>easier</hi>
brought together, than when they <hi>Diverge</hi> considerably, by
coming from a <hi>nigh</hi> Object. And that therefore a Convex Glass
unites the <hi>Parallel</hi> Rays <hi>nigher</hi> to it self, than <hi>Diverging</hi> Rays.

                        <note place="margin">T. 14. Fi. 3.</note> are Parallel Rays flowing from one
Point of a distant Object, these are united in the Point <hi>k,</hi> farther
from the Glass than the Point <hi>f.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For we may conceive (to omit the farther Proof of this
by Geometrical Calculation), that the Parallel Rays have not
so great a Reluctancy to be brought together, as the Diverg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96102:43"/>
Rays; and therefore the Refractive Power of the Glass has
not so much to do to bring <hi>those</hi> together, as to bring <hi>these.</hi>
And consequently it performs the <hi>First sooner</hi> than the <hi>Latter,</hi>
or in a <hi>shorter space,</hi> after the Ray's Emerge from behind the
Glass. And this the <hi>more,</hi> according as the Object <hi>g</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
<hi>nigher</hi> and <hi>nigher</hi> to the Glass, till at last it be so
nigh, that the Rays, after they have passed the Glass, become

Rule for solving this 8th Proposition: But therein he is the
most egregiously mistaken as ever Man was, that pretended to
Demonstration, and commits the most notorious Error that
can be imagined. And yet herein he wants not his Followers,
for <hi>Zahn</hi> in his <hi>Telescopium Fundam. 2. Syntag. 1. Cap. 4. Prop. 13</hi>
transcribes <hi>Dechales,</hi> and copies out even his <hi>Errata Typographica,</hi>
besides the chief and great Error of the whole Solution. Which
shews that <hi>Zahn</hi> was either very careless, or else that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
nothing of the Matter, as indeed he seems to do very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
for he is a mere blind Transcriber from others.</p>

                        <hi>Dechales</hi> Rule in his fore-cited Proposition is this. <hi>As the Sum
of the Distance of the Object from the Glass, and half the Glass's
Focus: Is to the Glass's Focus :: so the Distance of the Object from
the Glass: to the Distance of the Imaginary Focus beyond the Distance of

For Example, Let the Radius of one Convexity be 20, and
of t'other 8. Then 28 : 8 :: 40 : 11, 4286. Or, 28 : 20 :: 16 : 11, 4286 = Focus. Let us then conceive this double Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex-Glass

                     <p>To the Distance of the Distinct Base from the inward Glass.</p>
                     <p>Or thus,</p>

deduced from the 8th Proposition hereof.</p>
                     <p>This Problem is of considerable Use in Dioptricks, being
the Foundation of an excellent sort of Telescope much used

has solved it. <hi>Honoratus Faber</hi> has clearly omitted it. And
<hi>Dechales,</hi> though he offers at our foresaid VIII. Proposition, on
which our Solution of this Problem is founded; yet missing
so enormously as he has done in that, he could not pretend
to the Solution of this. And had he rightly solved our VIII.
Propsition, I question whether he would have pushed it on so
far as to solve thereby this Problem; for in the two next suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Problems, he has rightly the Propositions on which their
Solutions depend, but leaves the Problems themselves untouch'd.</p>

18. F.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">T. 18. F. 3.</note> The Convex-Glass <hi>x</hi> is placed so before the Concave-Glass

gives <hi>d x</hi> the Focal Distance of the Convex, and <hi>i e</hi> the Focus

the Point <hi>d,</hi> to which the Ray converges. And we have <hi>i d

                        <hi>The First Problem is this,</hi> A Convex Glass being given, with
a Concave of a larger Sphere; the Concave being placed at any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance less than the Focal Length of the Convex from it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter
from the Object; To find the Place of the Focus or Distinct

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Second Problem is,</hi> From the same Data; the Concave being placed nigher the Object; To find the Distinct Base.</p>
                     <p>For the First Problem, <hi>Tab. 19. Fig.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">T. 19. F. 1.</note> B is a Convex-Glass,
P its Focus, <hi>m k</hi> a Ray of Light falling upon it parallel to its
Axis, which will therefore converge into its Focus at P. G is
a Concave-Glass of a larger Sphere, placed upon the Focus
of the Convex; CP the Radius of the Sphere whereon the
Concave is formed. And we are always to conceive the
Thickness of both these Glasses where the Rays of Light
pierce them as small as possible.</p>
                     <p>Draw the Line <hi>k</hi> P, this shews the way of the Ray <hi>m k</hi>

the Ray. <hi>k</hi> P falling on the Concave G placed at <hi>q, q;</hi>
and also when it touches the Convex B. Let these then be
consider'd as so many parallel Rays, proceeding from the same
distant Point. Wherever they shall intersect the Axis after they
have passed the Concave, there shall be the true Focus for both
Glasses, which I shall call the <hi>Compound Focus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> To find which
we are to remember;</p>
                     <p>That, as the Parallel Rays of Light falling on a Convex-Glass,
are all collected very nearly in the same Point of the distinct
Base; so also the Rays of Light falling Parallel to each other
on a Concave, after they emerge from it, diverge and separate,
as if they had all proceeded from the same Point, which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
call the <hi>Point of Divergency (This, in my foregoing Propositions,
I term with most Optick Writers, the</hi> Virtual Focus) Which Point in
a Concave-Glass is just as far distant from it, as the Point of
<hi>Convergency,</hi> or Focus of a Convex of the same Sphere or Spheres
is distant from it. We know the Focal Point is some little nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the Glass in the Parallel Rays that fall <hi>widest</hi> from the Axis,
than in those that fall near it; so is the Point of <hi>Divergency</hi> for
Concaves. But the difference is so small in Glasses of a large
Sphere (such as in these Problems we suppose) that for all Rays
falling on the Glass Parallel to each other, it may be taken as
a <hi>simple Point.</hi> Such therefore we are to conceive it; and then to
find this Point of Divergency, The Rule is (<hi>Corol. Prop.</hi> XI.)
300 − 193 = 107 : 193 :: So CP the Radius of the Plano-Concave-Glass:
To P <hi>h</hi> : Which in Glasses of a large Sphere,
and where the Inclination of P <hi>h</hi> is small, will be insensibly
different from P <hi>g; h g</hi> being perpendicular to the Axis. Or we
may determine this Point of Divergence Geometrically thus,
On the Centre P with any Radius P <hi>t,</hi> on the void side of
the Figure, strike the Arch <hi>a t;</hi> then make it 300: 193 :: <hi>ts: au.</hi>
Draw P <hi>a,</hi> and from C the Centre of the Concave draw C<hi>h</hi>
Parallel to <hi>a</hi> P. The Point <hi>h,</hi> wherein it cuts the Line <hi>P k</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96102:66"/>
upwards, shall be the Point of Divergency sought.</p>
                     <p>Lay a Ruler over the Point <hi>h,</hi> and the Points <hi>b, b, b;</hi> this,
where it cuts the Axis <hi>g p</hi> produced, as in <hi>f, f,</hi> shall give all the
possible Compound Foci</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>h g</hi> being perpendicular to the Axis, produce the Lines
<hi>b o,</hi> till they cut it in <hi>d, d.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the Triangles <hi>h</hi> P <hi>g, o</hi> P <hi>q</hi> are similar: likewise the

these more fully in the following Propositions;<note place="margin">Observ.</note> This <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
being premised, That the Focus of a <hi>Meniscus,</hi> the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter

easily determined by <hi>Prop.</hi> XVII preceding. For in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
two Glasses are given, one a Convex, and t'other a
Concave, and the Focal Length of the Convex is shorter than
that of the Concave. And whereas in that <hi>Prop.</hi> there is given
a distance between the Glasses, let us conceive this Distance to be
<hi>nothing,</hi> that is, let us imagine these Glasses to <hi>touch;</hi> and their
Results a <hi>Meniscus</hi> whose Focus is determined by the same Rule
in that <hi>Prop.</hi> Which is this,</p>
               <p>As the Focal Length of the Concave-the Focal Length of

               <p>Now if we have given the Semidiameters of the Convexity

of the Plano-Convex and Plano-Concave of which this <hi>Meniscus</hi>
is compounded. For these Focal Lengths may be assumed the

their Correspondent subtending Sides are as 8 to 1. But <hi>h i f</hi>
is equal to <hi>p i n (Ang. ad Vert.)</hi> And because at the Rays Egress

                  <p>In whatever Meniscus wherein the Semidiameters of the Convexity
and Concavity are unequal; The General Rule that assigns the
Focus either Real or Virtual is this,</p>
                  <p>As the difference of the Semidiameters:</p>
                  <p>To either of the Semidiameters, whether of the Convexity or

                  <p>So is the Diameter, of the other Surface:</p>

                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:96102:71"/>
(<hi>Case 1.</hi>) I shall demonstrate this <hi>Proposition</hi> in Three several
Cases, and the First shall be, Where the Semidiameter of the
Concave is greater than the Semidiameter of the Convex, but
less than triple the Semidiameter of the Convex.</p>
                  <p>(<hi>Case 2.</hi>) Wherein the Semidiameter of the Concave is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than triple the Semidiameter of the Convex.</p>
                  <p>And in these Two Cases the Glass has a <hi>Real Focus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(<hi>Case 3.</hi>) Wherein the Semidiameter of the Concave is less
than the Semidiameter of the Convex, and then the Glass has only a <hi>Virtual Focus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis here supposed, that the Breadth of the Glass is so little,
and the Angles so small, that Sines and Angles and Sides may
be proportional. For an Angle, we often assume its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
to 180°, as having the same Sine.</p>
                  <p>'Tis supposed likewise that the Thickness of the Glass is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable,
and therefore 'tis wholly neglected.</p>
                  <p>First therefore for the First Case. <hi>Tab. 20. Fig. 5.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">T. 20. F. 5.</note> Let <hi>d e</hi> be
a Ray parallel to the Axis <hi>c k, f c</hi> is the Semidiameter of the

at <hi>e,</hi> 'tis directed towards <hi>h</hi> (by <hi>Prop.</hi> I.). Wherefore the

Let the Angle of Refraction <hi>h o k</hi> be made half <hi>g o h.</hi> Then
<hi>k</hi> is the Focus, and it being so made, I say, the difference of

the Eye, furnish'd with all its Coats and Humors; But in this
Figure we have only expressed the Crystalline Humour <hi>g o h,</hi>
as being Principally concern'd in Forming the Image on the
Fund of the Eye.</p>
                  <p>(1) From each Point in the Object we may Conceive Rays
flowing on the Pupil of the Eye <hi>i k;</hi> as here from the middle
Point <hi>b,</hi> there proceed the Rays <hi>b g, b o, b h;</hi> These by
means of the Coats and Humours of the Eye, and especially
by the Chrystalline Humour <hi>g h,</hi> are refracted and brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
on the <hi>Ratina</hi> or Fund of the Eye in the Point <hi>e,</hi> and
there the Point <hi>b</hi> is represented. For we may conceive the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline
Humour <hi>g h</hi> as it were a Convex-glass, in the Hole
a Dark Chamber <hi>i l m k,</hi> and that <hi>d e f</hi> is the Distinct Base
of this Glass. What is here said of the Point <hi>b,</hi> and its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
at <hi>e,</hi> may be understood of all the other Points
in the Object, as of <hi>a</hi> and <hi>c</hi> and their Representations at <hi>f</hi>
and <hi>d.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2) And as in a dark Chamber, that has a Hole furnish'd
with a Convex-glass, if the Paper, that is to receive the Image
in the Distinct Base, be either nigher to, or farther from the
Glass, than its due distance, the Representation thereon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused;
For then the Radious Pencils do not exactly determine
with their Apices on the Paper; But those from one Point are
mixt and confused with those from the Adjacent Points: so in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96102:85"/>
the Case of Plain Vision, 'tis requisite that the Pencils should
exactly determine their Apices at <hi>d, e, f,</hi> on the Retina, or else
Vision is not Distinct.</p>
                  <p>'Tis therefore contrived by the <hi>Most Wise and Omnipotent Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of the Eye,</hi> That it should have a Power of adapting it
self in some Measure to <hi>Nigh</hi> and <hi>Distant</hi> Objects. For they
require different Conformations of the Eye; Because the Rays
proceeding from the Luminous Points of <hi>Nigh</hi> Objects do more
Diverge, than those from more Remote Objects.</p>
                  <p>But whether this variety of Conformation consist in the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stallines

leave to the scrutiny of others, and particularly of the curious
Anatomist. This only I can say, that either of these Methods
will serve to explain the various Phaenomena of the Eye; And
I am apt to believe, that both these may attend each other, <hi>viz.</hi>
a Less Convex Crystalline requires an Elongation of the Eye,
and a more Convex Crystalline requires a shortning thereof;
As a more<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Longer Tube, and one more Protuberant, bulging or
of a smaller Sphere requires a shorter Tube.</p>
                  <p>(3) By the foremention'd Scheme we perceive, the Rays
from each Point of the Object are all confused together on the
Pupil in <hi>g h,</hi> so that the Eye is placed in the Point of the
Greatest Confusion: But by means of the Humors and Coats
thereof each Cone of Rays is separated, and brought by it
self to determine in its proper Point on the <hi>Retina,</hi> there
Painting distinctly the Vivid Representation of the Object;
Which Representation is there perceived by the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi>
(whatever it be) the manner of whose Actions and Passions,
He only knows who Created and Preserves it, <hi>Whose Ways are
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96102:85"/>
Past finding out, and by us unsearchable.</hi> But of this Moral <hi>truth</hi>
we may be assured, <hi>That He that made the Eye shall see.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(4) We are likewise to observe, that the Representation of
the Object <hi>a b c</hi> on the Fund of the Eye <hi>f e d</hi> is <hi>Inverted.</hi> For
so likewise it is on the Paper in a dark Room; there being
no other way for the Radious Cones to enter the Eye or the
dark Chamber, but by their Axes <hi>a o, b o, c o,</hi> crossing in
the Pole <hi>o</hi> of the Crystalline or Glass. And here it may be
enquired; How then comes it to pass that the Eye sees the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>Erect?</hi> But this Quaery seems to encroach too nigh the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the manner of the Visive Faculties <hi>Perception;</hi> For
'tis not properly the Eye that <hi>sees,</hi> it is only the Organ or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
'tis the <hi>Soul</hi> that <hi>sees</hi> by means of the Eye. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
then, how it comes to pass, that the Soul perceives the
Object <hi>Erect</hi> by means of an <hi>Inverted</hi> Image, is to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Souls Faculties; which is not the proper subject of this
Discourse. But yet that in this Matter we may offer at som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
I say, <hi>Erect</hi> and <hi>Inverted</hi> are only Terms of <hi>Relation</hi> to
<hi>Up</hi> and <hi>Down,</hi> or <hi>Farther from</hi> and <hi>Nigher to</hi> the Centre of
the Earth, in parts of the same thing: And that that is an
<hi>Erect</hi> Object, makes an <hi>Inverted</hi> Image in the Eye, and an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi>
Object makes an <hi>Erect</hi> Image; That is, that part of
the Object which is <hi>farthest from</hi> the Centre of the Earth is
Painted on a Part of the Eye <hi>Nigher</hi> the Centre of the Earth,
than the other parts of the Image. But the Eye or Visive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
takes no Notice of the Internal Posture of its own Parts,
but uses them as an Instrument only, contrived by Nature for
the Exercise of such a Faculty.</p>
                  <p>But to come yet a little nigher this difficulty; This enquiry
results briefly to no more than this, How comes it to pass, that
the Eye receiving the Representation of a Part of an Object on
that part of its Fund which is <hi>Lowermost</hi> or nighest the Centre
of the Earth, perceives that part of the Object as <hi>Upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:96102:86"/>
or farthest from the Centre of the Earth? And in
answer to this, let us imagine, that the Eye in the Point <hi>f</hi>
receives an Impulse or Stroke by the Protrusion forwards
of the Luminous Axis <hi>a o f,</hi> from the Point of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>a;</hi> Must not the Visive Faculty be necessarily directed
hereby to consider this stroke, as coming from the Top <hi>a,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than from the bottom <hi>c,</hi> and consequently should be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to conclude <hi>f</hi> the Representation of the Top?</p>
                  <p>Hereof we may be satisfy'd by supposing a Man standing on
his Head: For here, tho the Upper Parts of Objects are painted
on the Upper Parts of the Eye, yet the Objects are judged to
be <hi>Erect.</hi> And from this Posture of a Man, the Reason ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
why we have used the Words <hi>Farthest from,</hi> and <hi>Nighest
to the Centre of the Earth,</hi> rather than <hi>Upper</hi> and <hi>Lower.</hi> For in
this Posture, because the <hi>Upper</hi> Parts of the Object are painted
on that part of the Eye nighest the Earth, (though really the
upper Part of the Eye) they are judged to be farthest removed
from the Earth.</p>
                  <p>What is said of <hi>Erect</hi> and <hi>Reverse</hi> may be understood of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi>
and <hi>Dexter:</hi> But of these Physical Conjectures enough.</p>
                  <p>(5) The Image of an <hi>Erect</hi> Object being Represented on
the Fund of the Eye <hi>Inverted,</hi> and yet the sensitive Faculty
judging the Object <hi>Erect;</hi> it follows that when the Image of
an <hi>Erect</hi> Object is Painted on the Fund of the Eye <hi>Erect,</hi> the
sense Judges that Object to be <hi>Inverted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a necessary Conclusion, and is of consequence for
explaining some Particulars that follow.</p>
                  <p>(6) The <hi>Magnitude</hi> of an Object is Estimated by the Angle
the Object subtends before the Eye: Thus in the same fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

From hence, &amp; from <hi>Prop.</hi> XXVI, XXVII. it follows, that if the
Eye were placed instead of the Glass at <hi>d (T. 22. F.</hi> 1.)<note place="margin">T. 22. F. 1</note> and <hi>a b c</hi> or
<hi>e f g</hi> were Objects, the Eye would perceive them of Equal Bigness.</p>
                  <p>I know very well the Point <hi>o,</hi> which is the Vertex of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Angle, is variously assigned by various Authors; some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it in the Centre of the Eye; Others in the Vertex of the
Crystalline; Others in the Vertex of the outward Coat or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea
of the Eye: But 'tis a Matter of no great consequence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we place it; for according to the Bigness of this Angle <hi>a o c,</hi>
the Image on the Fund of the Eye is Bigger or Less. <hi>Vid. Tacquet
Optica. Lib. 1. Def.</hi> 4. and <hi>Prop.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>I know likewise, that by a curious Experiment in Opticks
discover'd by an Ingenious <hi>French-Man</hi> Monsieur <hi>Mariotte,</hi> 'tis
controverted, whether the <hi>Retina</hi> or <hi>Choroide</hi> be the Seat of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or the Place on which the Pictures of outward Objects
are expressed (<hi>vid. Philosoph. Transact.</hi> Num. 35. and 59.) But
to our business it matters not which of them we pitch on;
and therefore I chuse to speak as commonly 'tis presumed; and
mention the <hi>Retina,</hi> or rather the <hi>Fund of the Eye,</hi> as the Place
that receives this Picture.</p>
                  <p>(7) In the same (<hi>Tab. 25. Fig. 1.</hi>)<note place="margin">T. 25. F. 1.</note> We perceive the Rays
that flow from the Point <hi>b</hi> do proceed to the Eye <hi>Diverging,</hi>
as <hi>b g, b o, b h;</hi> And if the Object <hi>a c</hi> were infinitely diitant
from the Eye, or so distant from the Eye, that the Breadth of
the Pupil <hi>i k</hi> were insensible in Comparison to this Distance,
then the Rays <hi>b g, b o, b h,</hi> would proceed as it were Parallel,
and so fall on the Eye: In both which Cases, by means of the
Refractions in the Eye, they are brought together, and paint the
Image of the Point <hi>b</hi> on the Fund of the Eye at <hi>e. Vid. Gregorii

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> If the Diverging Rays <hi>b v, b x,</hi> that
flow from the Point <hi>b,</hi> meet the Convex Glass <hi>v x,</hi> and are
thereby made to converge as <hi>v i, x k,</hi> and so fall on the Eye,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96102:87"/>
and there passing through the Crystalline <hi>g h,</hi> are made to
Converge yet more as <hi>i e, k e;</hi> Here they cross in the Point <hi>e,</hi>
before they reach the <hi>Retina r t,</hi> and consequently do paint
thereon the Image of the Point <hi>b</hi> confusedly, for 'tis Painted
on the space <hi>r t;</hi> whereas to cause distinct Vision, it should
only be painted on a correspondent <hi>Point</hi> on the <hi>Retina.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is the Fault of their Eyes, who are called <hi>Myopes,
Purblind,</hi> or <hi>Short-sighted.</hi> For in them the Crystalline is too
Convex (as in this <hi>Tab. 25. Fig.</hi> 2. both the Convex Glass
and Crystalline joyn'd together make too great a Convexity)
uniting the Rays before they arrive at the <hi>Retina.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are helped by Concave-glasses, which take off from
the too great Convexity of their Crystalline some part of its
Refractive Power: Or rather these Concaves make the Rays
<hi>Diverge</hi> so, that their Crystalline shall be sufficient only to
bring them again together, so that they be not united, till
they arrive at the Fund of the Eye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Myopes</hi> are also helped by holding the Object very near; for
then the Rays that fall on their Eye from any single Point do
more Diverge, than when the Eye is farther from the Point,
and consequently their too Convex Crystalline does but suffice
to bring them together on the <hi>Retina.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(8) On the contrary, the Eyes of Old Men have their Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline
too Flat (as <hi>Tab. 25. Fig. 3.</hi>)<note place="margin">T. 25. F. 3.</note> and cannot correct the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergence
of the Rays <hi>b i, b k,</hi> to make them meet on the <hi>Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
rt,</hi> but beyond the Eye at <hi>e.</hi> Wherefore for their Help 'tis
requisite they add the Adventitious Convexity of a Glass; that
both it and the Crystalline together, may be sufficient to unite
the Rays just at the <hi>Retina:</hi> And from hence it appears, that
Spectacles help Old Men, not by magnifying an Object, but
by making its Appearance Distinct; for Old Men cannot
read the largest Print without Spectacles, and yet with Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles,
they read the smallest, though these with Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96102:87"/>
do not appear so large, as those without Spectacles.</p>
                  <p>(9) What is said of the <hi>Confused</hi> or <hi>Distinct</hi> Representation
of a <hi>Point</hi> in the Object, may be understood of the <hi>Confused</hi> or
<hi>Distinct</hi> Representation of the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ole Object; at least for those
Parts that lye pretty nigh adjacent to that Point that is looked
at. For here we do not take a <hi>Point</hi> in the strict sense of the
Mathematicians, but in a Physical Sense, for the smallest Part
imaginable; or as we have assumed it in the first supposition.
And the whole Object consisting of such Points, what is shewn
of one Point may be understood of every Point in the Object,
that is, of the whole Object.</p>
                  <p>(10) 'Tis Requisite also (before I proceed farther) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
what I mean by <hi>Clear</hi> Vision, and <hi>Faint</hi> Vision; <hi>Distinct</hi>
Vision, and <hi>Confused</hi> Vision.</p>
                  <p>By what foregoes, I suppose these two latter Terms are pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
well understood, <hi>viz. Distinct</hi> Vision is then caused, when
the Pencils of Rays from each Point of an Object do accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
determine in Correspondent Points of the Image on the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina:
Confused</hi> Vision on the contrary, when these Pencils do
intermix one with another.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Clear</hi> Vision is only caused by a Great Quantity of Rays
in the same Pencil, illuminating the Correspondent Points of
the Image <hi>strongly</hi> and <hi>vigorously.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faint</hi> Vision is then when a Few Rays make up one Pencil;
And tho this may be <hi>Distinct,</hi> yet 'tis <hi>Dark</hi> and <hi>Obscure,</hi> at least
not so <hi>Bright</hi> and <hi>Strong,</hi> as if more Rays concurr'd.</p>

But first 'tis to be Noted, that when we speak of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi>

explain my self concerning some one single Point in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;

of an Object: Or of the <hi>Magnify'd</hi> or <hi>Diminish'd</hi> Appearance
of an Object; 'tis requisite we consider the whole Object. For

                     <p>So that we perceive <hi>Distinct</hi> or <hi>Confused</hi> Vision to depend on

that the <hi>Apparent Place</hi> of an Object is changed by

But I shall shew that the Optic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or <hi>k h b,</hi> which is certainly greater than <hi>a h b,</hi> which is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Optick Angle. Wherefore the Eye at <hi>h</hi> through the
Glass sees the Object <hi>a b,</hi> under a greater Angle than it would
do without the Glass, and consequently the Object is magnify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But that which deceived FABER is, that because the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<hi>a g b</hi> is equal to the Angle <hi>k h b,</hi> therefore (says he) the
Optick Angle <hi>with</hi> and <hi>without</hi> the Glass are the same; or (as
he has it) the Eye at <hi>g</hi> without the Glass would see the Object
<hi>a b</hi> under the Angle <hi>a g b,</hi> and through the Glass the Object
is seen under the Angle <hi>k h b</hi> equal to <hi>a g b:</hi> Which is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him. But this does only prove, that the naked Eye at <hi>g,</hi> and
the Eye through the Glass at <hi>h,</hi> sees the Object under the same
Angle. Whereas he should have proved (if it were possible)
that the naked Eye at <hi>h,</hi> and the Eye through the Glass at <hi>h,</hi>
sees the Objects under the same Angle; And then indeed he
had rightly proved what he proposed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Optick
Angle is not magnify'd by the Interposition of the Glass: For
'tis not Mathematical, first to place the Eye at <hi>g without</hi> the
Glass, and then at <hi>h with</hi> the Glass, and proving the Optick
Angles the same, to conclude that therefore the Plain Glass
does not magnifie. For at that rate one may shew that even
a Convex Glass does not magnifie; For at <hi>one</hi> Station an Object
shall appear under as great an Angle <hi>without</hi> it, as at <hi>another</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>The Reason, why the Common Window Glass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> through

                  <p>Concerning the Apparent Place of Objects seen through Convex-glasses.</p>
                  <p>(1) In Plain Vision the Estimate we make of the <hi>Distance.</hi>
of Objects (especially when so far removed, that the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
between our two Eyes, bears no sensible Proportion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
or when look'd upon with one Eye only) is rather the
Act of our <hi>Iudgment,</hi> than of <hi>Sense;</hi> and acquired by <hi>Exercise</hi>
and a Faculty of <hi>comparing,</hi> rather than <hi>Natural.</hi> For <hi>Distance</hi>
of it self, is not to be perceived; for 'tis a Line (or a Length)
presented to our Eye with its End towards us, which must
therefore be only a <hi>Point,</hi> and that is <hi>Invisible.</hi> Wherefore
Distance is <hi>chiefly</hi> perceived by means of Interjacent Bodies, as
by the Earth, Mountains, Hills, Fields, Trees, Houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Or by the <hi>Estimate</hi> we make of the <hi>Comparative Magnitude</hi> of
Bodies, or of their <hi>Faint Colours, &amp;c.</hi> These I say are the <hi>Chief</hi>
Means of apprehending the Distance of Objects, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably
<hi>Remote.</hi> But as to <hi>nigh</hi> Objects, to whose Distance
the Interval of the Eyes bears a sensible Proportion, their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is perceived by the turn of the Eyes, or by the Angle
of the Optick Axes. (<hi>Gregorii Opt. Promot. Prop.</hi> XXVIII.) This
was the Opinion of the Antients, <hi>Alhazen, Vitellio,</hi> &amp;c. And
tho the Ingenious Jesuit <hi>Tacquet (Opt. Lib.</hi> I. <hi>Prop.</hi> II.) disapprove
thereof, and Objects against it a New Notion of <hi>Gassendus</hi>
(of a Man's seeing only with one Eye at a Time one and the
same Object) yet this Notion of <hi>Gassendus</hi> being absolutely
False (as I could Demonstrate, were it not beside my Present
Purpose, but I refer to the 7th Chap. of the 2d Part.) it makes
nothing against this Opinion.</p>
                  <p>(2) Wherefore Distance being only a <hi>Line,</hi> and not of it
self perceivable; if an Object were convey'd to the Eye by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96102:91"/>
one single Ray only, there were no other means of judging of
its Distance, but by some of those hinted before. Therefore
when we estimate the Distance of <hi>nigh</hi> Objects, either we take
the help of both Eyes, or else we consider the Pupil of one
Eye as having <hi>Breadth,</hi> and receiving a <hi>Parcel</hi> of Rays from
each Radiating Point. And according to the various Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Rays from one Point, on the various Parts of the
Pupil, we make our Estimate of the Distance of the Object:
And therefore (as is said before) by one single Eye we can
only Judge of the Distance of such Objects, to whose Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
the Breadth of the Pupil has a sensible Proportion. To
illustrate all this by <hi>Tab. 26. Fig.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">T. 26. F. 3.</note> Let <hi>a</hi> be a Radiating
Point, sending forth the <hi>Rays a d, a e, a f, a g, a h,</hi> with all the
intermediate Rays. Let <hi>p u</hi> be the Breadth of the Pupil, and
first placed at <hi>c,</hi> there receiving only <hi>a e, a f, a g:</hi> Let <hi>p u</hi> be
translated to <hi>b,</hi> where it receives all the Rays; and 'tis manifest
that the Rays from <hi>a</hi> are differently inclined on the Pupil in
one and t'other Posture, for the Rays, which fall on the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil
when placed at <hi>b,</hi> diverge very much more than those that
fall upon it, when placed at <hi>c:</hi> And therefore the Eye, or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Faculty will apprehend the Distance of <hi>a</hi> from <hi>b</hi> and <hi>c</hi> to
be <hi>Different.</hi> For it is observed before (<hi>Prop. 29. Sect. 2.</hi> see
also, <hi>Gregorii Opt. Promot. Prop.</hi> XXIX.) that for viewing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<hi>Remote</hi> and <hi>Nigh,</hi> there are Requisite Various Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Eye: The Rays from <hi>Nigh</hi> Objects, that fall on
the Eye, Diverging more than those from more <hi>Remote</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>(4) If therefore by Refraction through Glasses, that parcel
of Rays which falls on the Pupil from each Point in <hi>Nigh</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
be made to flow as close together as those from <hi>Distant</hi>
Objects; or the Rays from <hi>Distant</hi> Objects be made to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verge,</hi>
as much as if they flow'd from <hi>Nigh</hi> Objects, the Eye
through such Glasses shall perceive the <hi>Place of the Object chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi>

of Mony, or any other remarkable Object, so that the Eye
at <hi>o</hi> may just perceive the Mony over the Edge <hi>c</hi> of the Vessel.
The Mony now appears to the Eye <hi>o</hi> by the direct Line
<hi>a c o.</hi> Let now the Vessel be fill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>d,</hi> emerging from Water, a dense Medium to Air, deflects
from the perpendicular <hi>p f;</hi> and becomes (suppose) <hi>f o.</hi>
Wherefore the Eye <hi>o,</hi> now the Vessel has Water in it, sees the
Silver, not by the direct Ray <hi>a c o</hi> (for that is bent from it,
and escapes it) but by the refracted Ray <hi>a f o.</hi> Produce <hi>o f</hi>
directly to <hi>b,</hi> the Mony shall appear as if it were at <hi>b.</hi> For the
Eye is not sensible of the bending of the Ray, but is affected
by it, as if it were directly strait.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I say moreover, that by a plain Glass, the place of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

(7) To determine the <hi>Locus Apparens</hi> of an Object placed nigher
a Convex-glass than its Focus.</p>
                  <p>To perform this, we are to have, the Power of the Glass,
the Distance of the Object from the Glass, and the Length of
the Object given. <hi>Tab. 27. Fig.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">T. 27. F. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>a b c</hi> is an Object, whose
Distance from the Glass <hi>b z</hi> is given. Let us suppose the
Glass of the least thickness imaginable, that we may not be
at the trouble of considering the Optick Angle, both at the
Immersion and Emersion. Let the middle Point <hi>b</hi> Radiate
upon the Glass, and after the Rays have passed the Glass, let
them be so Refracted, as if they came directly from the Point
<hi>e.</hi> From the foremention'd <hi>Data,</hi> this Point <hi>e,</hi> being the
<hi>Imaginary Focus,</hi> is easily determin'd by <hi>Prop.</hi> VIII. hereof:
Through <hi>e</hi> draw the Infinite Right Line <hi>d e f</hi> Parallel to
<hi>a b c.</hi> Wherefore as the <hi>Locus Apparens</hi> of the Point <hi>b</hi> is at <hi>e,</hi>
so the <hi>Loci</hi> of the Collateral Points <hi>a, c,</hi> shall be somewhere
in the Line <hi>d e f</hi> (unless perhaps Convexes on very small
Spheres, will Represent the Object Crooked or Bowed, but
of this we shall take no notice) to determine which, from
the Vertex of the Glass <hi>z</hi> draw the Lines <hi>z a d, z c f</hi> (or
if the Glass have any Thickness, as in <hi>Tab. 27. Fig.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">T. 27. F. 2.</note> from
the Vertex of Immersion, or outward Vertex, draw <hi>z a, z c;</hi>
And from the Vertex of Emersion or Inward Vertex, draw
<hi>z d, z f,</hi> Parallel to <hi>z a, z c,</hi> and then the Thickness of the
Glass must be one of the <hi>Data. Vid. Prop. 47. Gregorii Opt.
Promot.</hi>) the Points <hi>d</hi> and <hi>f</hi> are the <hi>Loci Apparentes</hi> of the
Points <hi>a</hi> and <hi>c.</hi> For certainly were the Eye behind the Glass
just at <hi>z,</hi> and Object <hi>a b c</hi> would appear under the Angle
<hi>a z c,</hi> and the Point <hi>b</hi> would appear as at <hi>e,</hi> and therefore
the Points <hi>a</hi> and <hi>c</hi> would appear somewhere, so as to make
the Object keep the same Angle; But that can only be by
the Points <hi>a</hi> and <hi>c</hi> appearing at <hi>d</hi> and <hi>f</hi> (supposing the Object
to appear in its own Natural strait shape) Wherefore <hi>d</hi> and <hi>f</hi>

the Object <hi>a b c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it appears, that a Convex-Glass Represents Objects
as farther off than really they are: And this is the Reason,
why Pieces of Perspective (as of Churches and Long Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes)
appear very Natural and strong through Convex-Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
duly apply'd. For these Glasses making Objects appear
further off than really they are, must consequently make the
Parts of the Perspective seem really <hi>Hollow'd</hi> or sunk in, the
<hi>French</hi> term it <hi>Renfonce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence also 'tis Manifest, why Convex-Glasses help the Eyes
of those, that see only <hi>Distant</hi> Objects, as <hi>Old Men,</hi> for these
make <hi>Nigh</hi> Objects appear as <hi>Distant. Vid. Prop.</hi> XXVIII.
<hi>Sec.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>We may perceive also that the Distance between the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and Glass continuing the same, the <hi>Locus Apparens</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
alter'd, though the Eye be removed to and from the
Glass. <hi>Gregorii Opt. Promot. Corol. Prop.</hi> XLVII. For the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

not to be explained by whatever Theories we have yet of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
For seeing that the Object which applies to the Eye by

applies to the Eye by <hi>Parallel Rays,</hi> is reputed <hi>most remote;</hi>
it should seem reasonably to follow, that what is seen by

yet Experience contradicts this, and testifies, that the Point

various Situations of the Eye between the Glass and Distinct

it appears <hi>much nigher:</hi> Or rather, by how much the

by so much the <hi>nigher</hi> does the Object appear to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,

a little farther removed from the Glass towards the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct

                     <hi>Dechales (Dioptr. Lib. II. Prop.</hi> XI.) remarks a Matter of
some moment in this Business of the <hi>Locus Objecti.</hi> The
reason (says he) that the Appearances through Glasses of the
Change of the Objects Place, do not so strongly strike the
Sense, as the Doctrine here laid down seems to intimate,
proceeds from hence; that Optick-Glasses are seldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made so large, as to be look'd through by both Eyes at
once; for if they were, he asserts, That the <hi>Locus apparens
Objecti</hi> would be much more plainly and sensibly determin'd
to the sight: In this particular certainly he is much in the
right; for we see at all times, that two Eyes make a more
exact estimate of the Position of an Object, than one single
Eye. And we have a sensible Experiment hereof in <hi>Catop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks,</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:96102:95"/>
by the large concave Miroirs, where an Hand and
Dagger presented beyond the Focus, seem to strike far with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Speculum,</hi> at him that presents it: But not so strongly
if the <hi>Speculum</hi> be but small, so that the Image can be seen
but by one Eye at once.</p>

                     <p>To this Property of the Change of the <hi>Apparent Place</hi> of
an Object, may we attribute that common Effect of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
seeming to <hi>Dance</hi> and <hi>Move,</hi> being seen through Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick-Glasses,
whether Convex or Concave, nimbly shaken
between the Eye and the Object. 'Tis a noted Experiment,
that to know, whether a Glass be Plain or Spherical (which
is not to be found by Inspection of the Glass it self, or by
Touch, if the Glasses he formed on large Spheres, and be
but small portions thereof), the common Tryal is, to shake
them something nimbly between the Eye and an Object; and
if the Object seem to move by the motion of the Glass, the
Glass is <hi>not Plain:</hi> The reason hereof is this; That toward
the <hi>Extremities</hi> of a Glass, the Glass refracts <hi>more</hi> than towards
the middle (for the very middle Ray, that is perpendicular,
is not refracted at all) and consequently the <hi>Apparent Place</hi>
of an Object is more changed by the Refraction in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme</hi>
parts of the Glass, than in the <hi>middle</hi> of the Glass: So
that the Object, by the Motion of the Glass, appearing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
through the middle of the Glass, sometimes through the
extremities of the Glass; the <hi>Apparent Place</hi> thereof is <hi>varied</hi>
likewise, and the Object seems therefore to <hi>change its Place,</hi> or
to <hi>move.</hi> But in a plain Glass the Case is otherwise, for the
Refraction thereof is equally prevalent throughout the whole
Glass, and neither <hi>stronger</hi> nor <hi>weaker</hi> in the <hi>middle,</hi> than in
the <hi>extremities;</hi> so that the shaking of <hi>it</hi> between the Eye
<pb facs="tcp:96102:95"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:96102:96"/>

and Object, makes no other difference in the <hi>Apparent Place,</hi>
than if the Glass were look'd through fixt and immoveable; and
therefore the Object seems not through it to shake and move.
And tho the <hi>Locus</hi> be changed by a Spherick Glas's being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<hi>to and from</hi> the Eye, yet in Glasses of large Spheres,
the <hi>Locus</hi> is not so <hi>sensibly</hi> changed, as by being shaken <hi>before</hi>
the Eye. The same Reason holds for the apparent Dancing
of Objects seen through rising Smoaks or Vapors.</p>

(1.) From these <hi>Data</hi> by the foregoing Doctrine of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex
Glasses, 'tis easie to determine the Breadth of the Distinct
Base. For by <hi>Prop. XXVI, XXVII. As the Distance of
the Object from a Convex Glass: To the Breadth of the Object ::
So the Distance of the Image in the Distinct Base :</hi> (which is
easily obtained from the foregoing <hi>Data) To the Breadth of the
said Image.</hi> That is (in the foresaid Figure) <hi>b z : a c :: e z :
d f.</hi> And As <hi>a b : b z :: d e : e z.</hi> And consequently the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<hi>e z d</hi> is equal to the Angle <hi>a z b;</hi> the Triangles <hi>e z d</hi> and
<hi>a z b</hi> being similar. And in the Right-angled Triangle <hi>a b z,</hi>
we have <hi>a b</hi> and <hi>b z,</hi> to find the Angle <hi>a z b = e z d;</hi> which
is the Angle, under which the Object would appear to the
Eye placed just touching the Glass at <hi>z;</hi> supposing the Glass
to be there of the least Thickness imaginable.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Let us now suppose the Eye at <hi>k.</hi> I say if the Rays

                  <p>An Object being more distant from a Glass than its Focus, and the
Eye placed in the Distinct Base, the Object appears most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Prop. XXXVI.</hi> 'tis manifest, that the nigher the Eye
approaches the Distinct Base, the more <hi>confused</hi> the Object
appears; because the Rays from each particular Point, do fall
on the Eye <hi>closer Converged,</hi> and more orderly separated by the
Glass from the Rays of adjacent Points. But in the Distinct
Base, the Rays are most of all Converged, and most orderly
united in their proper Points, each with the Rays flowing
from the same Point in the Object. Wherefore the Eye is
there in the greatest Confusion.</p>
                  <p>Moreover (by <hi>Prop.</hi> XXVIII. <hi>Sec.</hi> 3.) 'tis requisite to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Vision, that the Rays from the several Points in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
fall on the Eye altogether <hi>confused</hi> thereon (as they do on
the Glass in the Hole of a dark Room), that the Coats and

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96102:103"/>
distinctly painting the Image on the <hi>Retina.</hi> But when
the Eye is in the Distinct Base, all this is frustrated.</p>

               <div n="39" type="proposition">
                  <head>PROP. XXXIX.</head>
                  <p>The Object being more Distant from the Glass than the Focus;
and the Eye further from the Glass than the Distinct Base,
begins to perceive the Object inverted; and, at a proper di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
Distinct.</p>
                  <p>(1.) This is manifest by <hi>Tab. 30. Fig.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">T. 30. F. 3.</note> wherein <hi>a b c</hi> is
an Object, <hi>g s l</hi> the Glass projecting the Distinct Base <hi>f e d, o</hi>
is the Eye. And because half the Pencils of Rays that flow
from each of the extreme Points of the Object <hi>a</hi> and <hi>c,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
forwards from the Points <hi>d</hi> and <hi>f</hi> in the Distinct Base,
after they cross in the aforesaid Points <hi>d</hi> and <hi>f,</hi> by reason of
their too great Divergence, do escape the Eye. Therefore, for
avoiding Perplexity in the Scheme, I have only expressed the
Half Cones <hi>s a l, s d l,</hi> and <hi>s c g, s f g,</hi> which incurr the Eye.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Wherefore we may observe, that the Diverging Rays
<hi>p f o</hi> and <hi>o d q,</hi> falling diverging and confused on the Crystalline
<hi>p q,</hi> are thereby collected, and made to concurr on the <hi>Retina</hi>
in the Points <hi>n</hi> and <hi>r;</hi> and there paint the <hi>upper</hi> Point <hi>a</hi> of the
Object on the upper part <hi>r</hi> of the Eyes Fund; and the <hi>lower</hi>
Point <hi>c</hi> of the Object on the lower part <hi>n</hi> of the <hi>Retina.</hi>
Therefore by <hi>Prop.</hi> XXVIII. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4, and 5. the Object appears
<hi>inverted,</hi> because the Image represented on the <hi>Retina</hi> is <hi>Erect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) Or more plainly thus, We may now conceive the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Base it self <hi>f d</hi> to be as it were an <hi>inverted</hi> Object (as
here the Cross turned with its head downwards). Therefore
the appearance thereof to the Eye, shall seem <hi>inverted.</hi> For
if the Eye perceive an <hi>erect</hi> Object, <hi>erect,</hi> it must needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Distinct Base, being an <hi>inverted</hi> Object, <hi>inverted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:96102:104"/>
And this may be laid down as a General Rule, That
where an Object, or the Image, or Representation of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which is next the Eye, is <hi>inverted,</hi> there the Object
shall appear <hi>inverted.</hi> And where the Object, or Image next
before the Eye, is <hi>erect,</hi> the Object appears <hi>erect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(4.) I say also, <hi>At a proper distance the Inverted Appearance
is Distinct.</hi> For when the Eye is so far removed from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Base, as to be able to correct the Divergence of the
Rays, that come to it from each Point in the Distinct Base,
and to form them into correspondent Cones determining their
<hi>Apices</hi> on the <hi>Retina,</hi> the Vision is Distinct, otherwise not.</p>
                  <p>Moreover there are two other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of this Posture of
Object, Glass, and Eye; which I shall here explain as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                  <p>(5.) If the Eye be moved <hi>upwards</hi> towards <hi>z,</hi> the Object shall
appear to move <hi>downwards.</hi> If the Eye be moved downwards
towards <hi>x,</hi> the Object seems to move <hi>upwards.</hi> To explain this,
let us consider the Point <hi>c;</hi> and how the appearance thereof is
brought <hi>to</hi> and formed <hi>in</hi> the Eye. And we shall find, that in
the Posture of the Scheme, the Point <hi>c</hi> is expressed in the Eye,
only by that parcel of its Rays that fall on the half Glass <hi>s g,</hi> for
these are brought together in <hi>s f g,</hi> and flowing forward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>p f o:</hi> But the other parcel of Rays, <hi>s c l,</hi> that fall on
the half Glass <hi>s l,</hi> and are brought together in <hi>s f l,</hi> proceeding
forwards, escape the Eye; for they go on in <hi>p f z.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Point <hi>c</hi> is now represented through the half Glass <hi>s g,</hi>
or seen somewhere between <hi>g</hi> and <hi>s.</hi> But the Eye moving up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
towards <hi>z,</hi> so that it miss the Rays <hi>p f o,</hi> and receive
<hi>only</hi> the Rays <hi>p f z;</hi> the Point <hi>c</hi> shall then be represented
through the half Glass <hi>s l,</hi> or seen somewhere between <hi>s</hi> and
<hi>l,</hi> and consequently shall seen to move <hi>downwards.</hi> What is
shewn of the Point <hi>c,</hi> may be conceived of the other Points
in the Object, that is, of the whole Object.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:96102:104"/>
And this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is the strongest Confirmation imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the <hi>Locus Apparens Objecti,</hi> in this Case, is in the
<hi>Distinct Base</hi> (as is said before, <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXI. <hi>Sec.</hi> 10.). For
by raising the Eye, we depress the Point <hi>f;</hi> and by depressing
the Eye, we raise the Point <hi>f.</hi> Wherefore. the appearance of
the Point <hi>c</hi> is at <hi>f.</hi> For the Point <hi>c</hi> in the Object seems to
move contrary to the motion of the Eye.</p>
                  <p>From the foregoing Explication it follows, that if the Glass
be moved <hi>upwards,</hi> the Object appears to move <hi>upwards.</hi> And
if the Glass be moved <hi>downwards,</hi> the Object appears to move
<hi>downwards;</hi> for the moving of the Glass <hi>upwards</hi> is the same as
moving the Eye <hi>downwards;</hi> but moving the Eye <hi>downwards,</hi>
makes the Object appear to move <hi>upwards;</hi> therefore the moving
of the Glass <hi>upwards</hi> makes the Objects appear to move <hi>upwards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or thus, Because moving the Glass <hi>upwards,</hi> the Distinct
Base is moved <hi>upwards</hi> (for it follows the Glass), and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Base is in this case as it were the Object. (<hi>Prop.</hi> XXXI.
<hi>Sec.</hi> 10.) Therefore by the Glasses motion <hi>upwards,</hi> the Eye
shall perceive the Object moved <hi>upwards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(6.) If with both Eye we look at the inverted Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of an Object through a Convex-Glass, we shall perceive
the Object double. Supposing the Eyes not very far remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>But if the Eyes be removed very far from the Distinct

the Natural Optick-Angle much more than the latter.

As to the Natural Optick-Angle of the Object <hi>z x,</hi> were the

                  <p>Concerning the Distinct and Confused Appearance of Objects
through Concaves; as also of their Faint or Obscure Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
                  <p>We are here to remember what before is laid down, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Virtual Focus</hi> of a Concave exposed to <hi>Parallel</hi> or to
<hi>Diverging</hi> Rays (in <hi>Prop.</hi> XI, XII, XIII. <hi>&amp; Corol. Prop.</hi> XV.).
We are likewise to take notice, that in Plain Vision, when the
Rays from any single Point in an Object do not Diverge more
that what the Refractive Power of the Coats and Humors of
the Eye can correct; so that these Rays may be brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in a Correspondent Point on the <hi>Retina;</hi> then the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of that Point is <hi>Distinct.</hi> For instance, <hi>Tab. 32, F.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">T. 32. F. 2.</note>
Let the Point <hi>a</hi> diffuse the Rays <hi>a b, a s, a r, a c.</hi> Suppose
the Breadth of the Pupil were <hi>p q,</hi> and the Eye there placed;
perhaps the Refractive Power of the eye is not sufficient to
correct the Divergence of the Rays <hi>a p b, a q c.</hi> But if the
Pupil (continuing of the same Breadth) recede to <hi>r s,</hi> then
only the Rays <hi>a s, a r,</hi> fall into it; and these perhaps may
be reduced by the Eye to determine in a Point on the
<hi>Retina;</hi> because they do not Diverge <hi>so much</hi> as the former.
If therefore we suppose the Pupil in its former station at <hi>p q,</hi>
but now only to be of the Breadth <hi>i d,</hi> so as to admit only
the Rays <hi>a d s, a i r,</hi> then the Point <hi>a</hi> may be seen as distinctly
as at <hi>r s.</hi> This manifest even by Experiment; for apply
a Minute Object so near the Eye, that it appears very <hi>confus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
then place before the Eye a very small Hole made with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96102:112"/>
a Pins end in a Paper; The Object shall now appear <hi>Distinct.</hi>
For the Hole in the Paper serves to make the Pupil more <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>
Which evidently proves what we have laid down.</p>
                  <p>The same may be shewen concerning Vision through a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave

<hi>a b, a c,</hi> fall on the Concave <hi>b c.</hi> These after passing the Glass
Diverge more than before. Let <hi>p q</hi> be the Breadth of the Pupil,
receiving the refracted Rays <hi>a p, a q,</hi> These Diverge <hi>so much,</hi>
that 'tis not in the power of the Eye to reduce them, and form
them into an inward Cone, determining its <hi>Apex</hi> on the Fund
of the Eye. But let the Pupil continue of the same Breadth,
and recede to <hi>r s,</hi> where it may only receive the Rays <hi>a d s, a i r;</hi>
and then perhaps the Eye may prevail to reduce these; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do not Diverge <hi>so much</hi> as the other Rays that fell on
the Pupil at <hi>p q.</hi> Or otherwise, let the Pupil continue at <hi>p q,</hi>
But let its Breadth be contracted to <hi>d i;</hi> so that it may receive
no more Rays in this Posture, than (continuing of its natural
Breadth) at <hi>r s.</hi> Here likewise the Appearance of the Point
<hi>a</hi> may be <hi>Distinct.</hi> Of this likewise we may make a most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Experiment: For take a Concave of a small Sphere,
and place it very near the Eye, and the Appearance of distant
Objects through it is <hi>Confus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Eye, and the Appearance shall be more <hi>Distinct.</hi> But even in
a Posture where the Appearance is <hi>Confused,</hi> contract the Pupil
by placing before it a small Hole Prick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more <hi>Lightsome. Vid. Kepleri Dioptr. Prop.</hi> C.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore if we have the Distance of a Radiating Point from
a Concave, and the virtual <hi>Focus</hi> of the Concave, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

is impossible to be known by Rule; The <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Weakness</hi>
of Mens Eyes being <hi>infinitely various.</hi> And therefore one Man
may see a Point at a certain Distance <hi>distinctly</hi> through a Glass,

                  <p>As to the <hi>Strong</hi> or <hi>Faint</hi> Appearance of Objects through

                     <p>We may here consider the <hi>different</hi> Effects of Convex and
Concave Glasses. For when a Point appears <hi>Confused</hi> through

A Convex-Glass being equally Distant from the Eye and from the
Object, renders the Appearance the most Magnified; and a Concave the
most Diminished, that That Distance of Eye and Object will allow.</p>
                  <p>For the Proof hereof I need offer no more than the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Calculations (instituted according to the Doctrine Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent)
wherein we shall find (<hi>Tab. 31. f.</hi> 3. and <hi>Tab. 32. f.</hi> 5.)<note place="margin">T. 31. <hi>F.</hi> 5. T. 32. F. 5.</note>
the Angle <hi>d o e,</hi> (which is the Angle under which the Object
appears through the Glass) in the second Case (wherein the
Glass is equally Distant from the Eye and Object) to be <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
for the <hi>Convex,</hi> and <hi>less</hi> for the <hi>Concave,</hi> than the same Angle
in either of the other Cases.</p>
                  <p>And by the same Calculations we may likewise observe in
the first and third Cases, That when the Glass is <hi>equally</hi> remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the <hi>middle</hi> towards the Eye, or towards the Object,
the Appearance is <hi>equally</hi> magnified by the Convex, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
by the Concave; for we find in the first and third Cases,
the Angles <hi>d o e</hi> equal.</p>
                  <p>I say, this may be sufficient for the Proof of the foregoing
Position. But to this I shall add also this farther Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
That by the preceding Doctrine, the magnify'd Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of Objects through Convexes, and their diminish'd Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
through Concaves, being deduced from the <hi>Loci Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parentes</hi>
of Objects through those Glasses. We may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
That supposing the Convex-Glass <hi>g l (Tab. 34. f.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">T. 34. <hi>F.</hi> 2.</note>) or
Concave <hi>g l (Tab. 34. f.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">T. 34 <hi>F.</hi> 3.</note>) to touch the Eye <hi>o,</hi> and that the
Apparent Place of the Object <hi>a b c</hi> is <hi>d e f.</hi> The Eye perceives
the Object under its own Natural Optick-Angle, neither mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd
or diminish'd by one or t other Glass.</p>
                  <p>Likewise if, in the same Figures, we conceive the Glasses
(which are still supposed of the least thickness imaginable) to
touch the Objects, the Object and <hi>Locus Apparens</hi> thereof are the
<hi>same;</hi> and consequently, the Optick-Angle in this Posture can
neither be <hi>increased</hi> or <hi>diminish'd</hi> by either of the Glasses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:96102:120"/>
Wherefore it remains, that seeing the Glasses do <hi>not at all</hi>
Exert their Effects in either of the <hi>Extremes,</hi> that is, <hi>either touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Eye,</hi> or <hi>touching the Object:</hi> And seeing they Exert their
Effects <hi>equally</hi> being <hi>equally</hi> removed from the middle <hi>z</hi> between
the Eye and the Object; It will follow, that they Exert their
Effects <hi>most powerfully</hi> being placed just in the middle <hi>z</hi> between
the Eye and Object, that is, the Convex by <hi>Magnifying,</hi> and
the Concave by <hi>Diminishing</hi> the Appearance.</p>
                  <p>And thus much shall suffice concerning <hi>single Glasses apply'd
to the Eye.</hi>

                     </hi>
are made to Converge into <hi>x e, y e, z e;</hi> And crossing at <hi>e,</hi> they
flow forward, and fall on the Eye-Glass about <hi>h</hi> Diverging.
Wherefore the Point <hi>e</hi> being now in the Focus of the Eye-Glass,
the Rays that flow from it upon the Eye-Glass, after
passing the Eye-Glass become parallel (<hi>Prop.</hi> VI.) and fall
so on the Eye at <hi>o;</hi> By whose Coats and Humors they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted
and brought together on the Point <hi>s</hi> on the <hi>Retina (Prop.</hi>
XXVIII. <hi>Sec.</hi> 7.) there painting the lively Image of the Point
<hi>B</hi> in the Object.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In like manner may we conceive the Representation
of the Collateral Points: thus the Rays <hi>a x, a y, a z,</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the upper Point A of the Object, are by the Object-Glass
<hi>x y z</hi> made to Converge towards the Distinct Base in <hi>d;</hi>
From whence flowing forward they fall Diverging on the Eye-
Glass at <hi>l;</hi> by which they are made to run parallel amongst
themselves, and are bent towards the Focus at <hi>o;</hi> where falling
on the Pupil parallel, they are by the Eye refracted and
brought together in the Point <hi>r</hi> on the <hi>Retina.</hi> There paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Representing of the Point A in the Object.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the Rays flowing <hi>Diverging</hi> from each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Point in the Distinct Base <hi>f e d</hi> are brought by the Eye-Glass
to a <hi>Parallelism</hi> amongst themselves, is manifest from
<hi>Prop.</hi> VI. And that the Rays from <hi>f,</hi> from <hi>e,</hi> and from <hi>d,</hi>
are mixt and confused by the Eye-Glass in its Focus at
<hi>o</hi> (or thereabouts) is manifest from hence, that we may
conceive one Ray in the Cone of Rays <hi>g f,</hi> or in the Cone of
Rays <hi>z f x,</hi> that runs parallel to the Axis <hi>y e h o s,</hi> or at least
that would run so parallel, if the Breadth of the Object-Glass
in respect of the Breadth of the Eye-Glass will permit. This
Ray, I say, by the known Properties of the Convex Eye-Glass,
shall be refracted into its Focus at <hi>o;</hi> and all the other
Rays of the same Cone <hi>f g,</hi> after passing the Eye-Glass, shall
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96102:124"/>
be refracted and made to proceed parallel to that single Ray,
that is bent into the Focus <hi>o,</hi> because the Point <hi>f</hi> is supposed
in t'other Focus of the Eye-Glass. Wherefore the Rays from
all the Points in the Distinct Base are confounded together about
the Focus of the Eye-Glass.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Or otherwise I shall explain this matter thus; If we
conceive <hi>y,</hi> a Radiating Point, sending forth the Rays <hi>y g,
y b, y l</hi> : And the difference between the Focal length of the
Object-Glass and Focal length of the Eye-Glass to be very great
(as suppose the Object-Glass to be twelve Foot, and the Eye-
Glass three Inches) we shall find by <hi>Prop.</hi> V. the Point <hi>o,</hi>
where the Rays <hi>g o, l o,</hi> cross the Axis or Perpendicular Ray
<hi>h o,</hi> to be very nigh the Focus of the Eye-Glass (<hi>viz.</hi> in our
Supposition <hi>h o</hi> shall be 3,063 Inches) and let the Focal lengths
of the Object-Glass and Eye-Glass bear whatever Proportion,
the Point <hi>o,</hi> where <hi>g o, l o,</hi> shall cross <hi>h o,</hi> may be determin'd by
<hi>Prop.</hi> V. But then indeed the Rays that fall on the Eye <hi>without
g o,</hi> or <hi>within</hi> it, do cross the Perpendicular Ray <hi>h o, farther</hi> from
the Eye-Glass, or <hi>nigher</hi> to the Eye-Glass than <hi>g o</hi> it self; For
they do not proceed from the same Point <hi>y;</hi> And <hi>g o</hi> is only
the Refraction of the Ray <hi>y g.</hi> And therefore, unless the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Focal lengths of the Object-Glass and Eye-
Glass be <hi>Considerable,</hi> the Eye may move considerably <hi>nigher
to</hi> the Eye-Glass, or <hi>farther from</hi> the Eye-Glass than the Point
<hi>o,</hi> and not perceive any Alteration in the Appearance of the
Object. But if the said Difference be <hi>Considerable,</hi> (as it always
is in Telescopes) the Eye can move but very little either <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from</hi> or <hi>nigher to</hi> the Eye-Glass than <hi>o,</hi> but it shall perceive
a great Alteration in the Appearance (that is, in the Visible
<hi>Area</hi>) of the Object. As shall be manifested more plainly
hereafter.</p>
                  <p>From all which it appears, That the Pupil of the Eye at <hi>o,</hi>
being in the place of the <hi>greatest Confusion,</hi> where the Rays
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96102:124"/>
from all Points in the Object are mixt together, and the Rays
from each single Point fall parallel amongst themselves; The
Appearance of the Object must needs be <hi>Distinct.</hi> By <hi>Prop.</hi>
XXVIII. <hi>Sec.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I say likewise the Object is <hi>magnified.</hi> If the naked
Eye were in the place of the Object-Glass at <hi>y (Tab. 35. f.</hi> 2.)<note place="margin">T. 35. F. 2.</note>
the Object would appear to it under the Angle <hi>a y c = f y d.</hi>
That is, the Object would appear to the Eye at <hi>y,</hi> under the
same Angle as the Distinct Base <hi>f e d,</hi> were it an Object,
would appear to the same Eye at <hi>y.</hi> Wherefore let us now
consider the Distinct Base <hi>f e d</hi> as the Object. This appears to
the Eye at <hi>o</hi> through the Eye-Glass under the same Angle <hi>g o l,</hi>
as were the naked Eye viewing it at <hi>h,</hi> by <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXIII. Make

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, I say the Object appears <hi>Inverted.</hi> This is manifest
from the very Scheme (<hi>Tab. 35. f.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">T. 35. <hi>F.</hi> 1.</note>) without farther Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.

                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:96102:127"/>I shall now mention the common Method for trying the
Truth of this Proposition by Experiment. Having the Focal
length of an Object-Glass (for Instance) 144 Inches, and
the Focal length of an Eye-Glass three Inches. A Telescope
composed of these, shall make the apparent Diamet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>al Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of an Object: To the apparent Magnitude of the same
Object viewed by the naked Eye :: As 144 : To 3 :: or
48 : To 1. Wherefore, such a Glass is said to Magnifie 48
times in the Diameter of the Object, and 2304 (= square of
48) in the Surface of the Object. The Superficies of like Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
being to each other, as the Squares of their Diameters, or
Homologous Sides.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore from a convenient Scale take one part, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
describe a Circle; And from the same Scale take 48
parts, and describe another Circle. Let these two Circles be
cut out in Paper, or other Conspicuous Material, and placed at
three or four Foot from each other, on a Wall at such a Distance
as will require the length between the Glasses in the Telescope
but just 147 (= 144 + 3) Inches, to shew these Objects
distinctly; Then with one Eye through the Telescope observe
the smaller Circle, and at the same time with t'other Eye
naked look upon the greater Circle; these two Circles shall
appear equal to both Eyes.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it may be objected, That the Comparison is not
fair between both Appearances. For the Proposition supposes
the naked Eye at the Station of the Object-Glass; But this
Experiment sets the naked Eye Distant from the Object-Glass
the whole length of the Telescope. This would be a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Objection against this Method of Tryal, were not the
Distance of the two Circles from the Eyes vastly greater than
the length of the Telescope; so that the Telescopes length may
not bear any sensible Proportion thereto. And such we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it in this Experiment, by advertising that this Distance is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96102:127"/>
to be so great, that the Distance between the Glasses may be
no longer than for viewing a Distant Object, <hi>viz.</hi> the just
Aggregate of the Focal lengths of the Glasses, that is, 144

                  </p>
                  <p>I shall now give an Example of a Calculation according to
this Proposition. Wherefore in <hi>Tab. 35. f.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">T. 35. <hi>F.</hi> 4.</note> let us take the
Moon ABC for our Distant Object; and let us suppose
its Diameter to subtend an Arch of a great Circle of Heaven of
30' Minutes. Let the Ray <hi>a y d</hi> proceed from its upper Limb,
<hi>b y e</hi> from its Centre, <hi>c y f</hi> from its lower Limb. These cross
in the Vertex <hi>y,</hi> or middle Point of the Object-Glass <hi>x y z;</hi>
making the Angle <hi>f y d = a y e,</hi> equal to 30 Minutes. Let
the Focal length of the Object-Glass <hi>e y</hi> be given twelve Feet
= 144 Inches, or 144,00 Parts: And the Focus of the Eye-Glass
<hi>h e</hi> be given three Inches, or 3,00 such Parts. Let the Distinct
Base, wherein the Image of the Moon is Projected by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-Glass
be <hi>f e d,</hi> and draw <hi>f h, d h.</hi> It is shewn before that the
Angle <hi>g o h</hi> is equal to the Angle <hi>f h e.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore in the Right-angled Triangle <hi>f e y,</hi> we have <hi>e y</hi>

                  <p>Then in the Right-angled Triangle <hi>f e h,</hi> we have <hi>h e</hi> = 3,00,
and <hi>f e</hi> = 0, 63, to find the Angle <hi>f h e</hi> = 11° 51' 40".</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Semidiameter of the Moon, which by the
naked Eye would be seen under the Angle of 15' Minutes, is
seen through this Telescope under an Angle of 11° 51' 40".</p>
                  <p>Let us now enquire, whether the Object appearing under
an Angle of 15° Minutes, and being afterwards made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
under an Angle of 11° 51' 40", doth not thereby appear
48 times bigger than naturally. (for so much, by what fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes,
does this Glass Magnifie).</p>
                  <p>And for shewing this, let us imagine <hi>f e</hi> increased 48 times its
length 0, 63; And then inquire what Angle <hi>f y e</hi> would be. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>f e</hi> is now supposed = 30, 24 = 48 times 0. 63; Then
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96102:128"/>
in the Right-angled Triangle <hi>f e y,</hi> we have <hi>f e</hi> = 30, 24, and
<hi>e y</hi> = 144,00, to find the Angle <hi>f y e</hi> = 11° 51' 40". Which
shews that the Semidiameter of the Moon, being made by the
Glass to appear under an Angle of 11° 51' 40", is seen by the
Eye as big, as if the Semidiameter of the Moon it self were
really increased 48 times, and viewed by the naked Eye.
Which is the proposed Design of this Calculation.</p>

                     <head>Corollary 2.</head>
                     <p>Supposing two Telescopes of different lengths; If the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
of the Eye-Glass of the shorter bears the same Proportion
to the Focus of its Object-Glass, as the Focus of the Eye-Glass
of the longer bears to its Object-Glass: These two Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescopes
Magnifie <hi>equally.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And hereupon perhaps it may be enquired, To what end
then is all the Pains and Trouble in forming and managing
Telescopes of 30. 40. 50. 100. 200. 300, &amp;c. Feet; When
Objects may be Magnified as much by smaller Object-Glasses,
or Object-Glasses of shorter Focal lengths, combined with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional
Eye-Glases?</p>
                     <p>I answer First, That Object-Glasses of a shorter Focus will
not bear proportionably Eye-Glasses of such short <hi>Foci,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
coloring the Object and rendring it dark, as <hi>Object-Glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> of longer <hi>Foci.</hi> For instance, let us suppose that an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Object-Glass of twelve Foot Focus will receive an Eye-Glass
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96102:128"/>
of no shorter a Focus than three Inches with Clearness and
Distinctness. I say an Object Glass of 24 Foot Focus of the
same Perfection shall receive an Eye-Glass of less than six Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
Focus with equal Clearness and Distinctness. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it may take an Eye-Glass of five or four Inches Focus. And
then an Object-Glass of twelve Foot with an Eye-Glass of three
Inches Magnifies but 48 times. But an Object-Glass of 24
Foot with an Eye-Glass of four Inches Magnifies 72 times,
<hi>viz.</hi> ⅓ more than the former, which is a great Difference, and
of vast Advantage, when it may be obtained with the same
Clearness and Distinctness. I confess the longest Telescopes
do generally render the Objects more Dark and Obscure, yet
when shorter Glasses have proportionably as short Eye-Glasses,
and as close Apertures, they are more Obscure, than the longer
Telescopes.</p>
                     <p>I answer Secondly, That the Image of the Moon or other
Object in the Distinct Base of an Object-Glass of 24 Foot is
twice as long as the Image in the Distinct Base of an Object-Glass
of twelve Foot. And consequently we shall not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the Picture in the former, should be much more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
and Perfect, than in the latter; As 'tis much more easie
to represent every Feature and Line of a Face in a large Piece,
than in a small Piece of Miniature.</p>

Eye-Glass (as suppose the Object-Glass formed on a Sphere

Glass yet greater than a ten Foot Glass.</p>
                  <p>But at what Rate or Proportion the Apertures of Glasses
alter in respect of their lengths, is not yet well setled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monsieur Auzout, (Phil. Transact. N. 4. P. 55.)</hi> Tells us,
that he finds, <hi>That the Apertures, which Glasses can bear with
Distinctness, are in (about) a Subduplicate Ratio to their lengths:</hi>
Or as the Square Roots of their lengths. Whereof he intends
to give the Reason and Demonstration in his <hi>Dioptrica</hi> (which
we yet want.) But this Ingenious Person should have told us,
when he speaks of the Apertures of Glasses, whether he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
them for Objects on the Earth or in the Heavens. And
if in this latter, whether for the <hi>Moon, Mars, Iupiter,</hi> or <hi>Venus.</hi>
For each of these Objects will require a different Aperture of
the same Glass. Because the Strength of their Light is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
For to view <hi>Venus</hi> there is requisite a much smaller
Aperture, than to view the <hi>Moon, Saturn</hi> or <hi>Iupiter.</hi>

                  <p>However till some better Rule can be found for settling the

behind this Object-Glass, so as to constitute a Telescope) such
a vigorous Light from each Radiating Point in the Object will

                  <p>We have the exact Natural Resemblance hereof in the Eye

the Light of an Object is more or less Intense.</p>
                  <p>Another Particular, wherein this Contraction or Dilatation
of a Glasses Aperture is requisite, is this : An Object may be
so nigh a Glass that the Rays from each single Point, falling
upon the whole Breadth of the Glass, may Diverge so much
that the Glass is not able to Correct the Divergence of those
Rays that fall towards its outward Borders, so as to reduce
them to Determine or Unite in the Distinct Base with those
Rays, that fall nigher the middle of the Glass (as before is
noted after <hi>Prop.</hi> III.) And then 'tis requisite to contract the
Aperture of the Glass, so as to exclude these Exorbitant Rays.
A notable Experiment of this we may make by holding a Minute
Object very nigh the Pupil of the Eye, the Object shall appear
very <hi>Confused.</hi> But by applying a Paper with a small Pin-hole
before the Pupil, it shall reduce the Appearance to much more
Distinctness than before.</p>

and Magnified Appearance of the Object shall be altered. As
will be manifest after we have explained this Glass to those that
consider it.</p>
                  <p>It is then evident that the first Eye-Glass <hi>h</hi> mixes all the Rays
from different Points in the Focus at <hi>o;</hi> from whence they flow
forward, and fall upon the second Eye-Glass <hi>k,</hi> each parcel
of Rays parallel amongst themselves: And by the Glass <hi>k</hi> are

formed into the second Distinct Base <hi>g m n.</hi> For we may
imagine the middle Ray <hi>o q</hi> to proceed directly from <hi>o,</hi> the
Focus of the Glass <hi>k;</hi> wherefore <hi>o q</hi> shall be refracted by the
Glass <hi>k,</hi> and be made to run in <hi>q g</hi> parallel to its Axis <hi>k m.</hi> And
then all the other Rays that are parallel to <hi>o q</hi> before they enter
the Glass <hi>k,</hi> after they have passed the Glass <hi>k,</hi> do unite with
<hi>q g</hi> in the Focus of the Glass <hi>k,</hi> and so the second Distinct Base
<hi>g m n</hi> is formed.</p>
                  <p>Or otherwise. We may conceive the Glass <hi>k</hi> to be the
Crystalline of the Eye, looking through the Telescope of
<hi>Prop.</hi> L. <hi>h y.</hi> And as the Crystalline in that Case does by
means of the Glass <hi>h</hi> form in its Focus on the <hi>Retina</hi> the Image
of the Distinct Base <hi>f e d;</hi> So may we imagine the Glass <hi>k</hi> to
form in its Focus <hi>g m n,</hi> by means of the Glass <hi>h,</hi> the Image
of the Distinct Base <hi>f e d.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then from the second Distinct Base <hi>g m n</hi> the Rays proceed
as is expressed in the Scheme, and fall on the third Eye Glass

projected distinctly on the <hi>Retina</hi> of the Eye <hi>r s t,</hi> in the same
manner as is shewn before in the Telescope of <hi>Prop.</hi> L.</p>

                  <p>Concerning the Magnifying Power of this Telescope; our
<hi>Prop.</hi> L. will direct us how to Calculate it. For by that
Proposition 'tis manifest, that if the several Eye-Glasses <hi>h, k, l,</hi>
be of equal <hi>Foci,</hi> and the Distance between <hi>h</hi> and <hi>k</hi> be the sum
of both their <hi>Foci,</hi> that then the apparent Diametral Magnitude
of an Object through the Glass, is to the Diametral Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
viewed by the naked Eye, as the Focus of the Object-Glass,
to the Focus of any one of the Eye-Glasses. But if the
<hi>Foci</hi> of the Eye-Glass <hi>h, k, l,</hi> be different, or the Distance
between <hi>h</hi> and <hi>k</hi> different from the sum of their <hi>Foci,</hi> then to
obtain the magnified Appearance, we must have Recourse to
Calculation. Wherein the Cases are so very various, that to
insist on them all would be very tedious, and infinitely labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
For the Focus of <hi>h</hi> may be greater, equal, or less than
of <hi>k</hi> or of <hi>l;</hi> and so of <hi>k</hi> than of <hi>l</hi> or <hi>h;</hi> and so of <hi>l</hi> than of <hi>k</hi>
or <hi>h;</hi> As likewise the Distance between <hi>k</hi> and <hi>h</hi> may be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
varied. I shall therefore pass this over; A little Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the several Varieties will make any of them plain,
and shew how they may be easily Calculated by those versed
in the foregoing Doctrine. For 'tis but considering, how the
Distinct Base <hi>g m n</hi> is Projected, whether equal to, greater or
less than the Distinct Base <hi>f e d;</hi> And how the Eye-Glass <hi>

                  <p>In like manner, by <hi>Prop.</hi> LIV. may the Angle received, or
Visible <hi>Area</hi> of an Object through this kind of double Teles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope,
be Determined, as in the single Telescope; Respect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>From the Explication of this kind of Telescope, and of
that in <hi>Prop.</hi> L. may we easily apprehend the Theories of the
various Combinations of Convex-Glasses in the Compositions
of divers Telescopes of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Glasses.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore in explaining any kind of Telescope, we are first
to obtain (by some Practical Rules to be deliver'd hereafter
<hi>Part II. Chap. 4. Sec. 3.</hi> the Focal length of each particular
Glass by it self. Then we are to consider the Distances of each
of these Glasses (as they lye in the Tube) from the Glasses
before and behind it. Afterwards we are to consider, where
the Distinct Base, or Distinct Bases are formed by these several
Glasses, and how they are Projected as to Amplification or
Diminution, which is easily found by the Doctrine before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.
And then how the Eye-Glasses affect these Distinct Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
As how they Confound them, Rectifie them, Invert or
Magnifie them.</p>
                     <p>For the Result of all is this, that the Rays from the several
Images in the several Distinct Bases, shall be Confounded on
the Pupil of the Eye, in order to be rectified by the Crystalline,
which (as has often been intimated) we may consider as a
Convex-Glass, whose Focus is on the <hi>Retina.</hi> And from a
due Consideration of the Premisses, it will appear why some
Telescopes consisting of Convex-Glasses represent the Object
<hi>Erect,</hi> others Inverted; in some <hi>one</hi> Glass is to be taken as <hi>one,</hi>
in others two Glasses perform the Effect but of <hi>one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus all the Combinations of Glasses expressed in the

                  <p>The Telescope Compased of a Concave Eye-Glass, and Convex Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-Glass
of a larger Sphere is Explain'd.</p>
                  <p>The Posture of the Glasses in this Telescope is this; The
Distance of the Glasses is to be the <hi>Difference</hi> of their <hi>Foci,</hi> that
is, the Concave Eye-Glass is to be placed so much nigher the
Object-Glass than the Focal length of this Object-Glass, as is
the virtual Focus of this Eye-Glass. And the Eye is to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
as nigh the Eye-Glass as possible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note.</hi> I shall call the <hi>virtual Focus</hi> of the Concave, simply
its <hi>Focus,</hi> it being well known that a Concave has no <hi>other Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
but a <hi>virtual Focus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall now shew, that through this Glass the Object appears
<hi>Distinct, Erect,</hi> and <hi>Magnify'd.</hi> And shall shew the <hi>Angle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
or <hi>visible Area,</hi> according to the several Postures of the
Eye.</p>
                  <p>Only premising in this Proposition (as I have done in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
former) that we suppose the Glasses of the least thickness
imaginable; and especially the <hi>Concave</hi>-Glass in its middle Point
is supposed of no thickness at all, but the two Surfaces to touch.</p>
                  <p>To explain this Glass the better, I shall express the Figure
very large, <hi>Tab. 37. f.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">T 37. <hi>F</hi> 2</note> Wherein we shall first consider the
Telescope it self separate from the Eye. Wherefore, let some
Distant Object (as suppose a <hi>Cross</hi>) send the Rays <hi>a a a</hi> from
its upper Point, <hi>b b b</hi> from its middle Point, and <hi>c c c</hi> from its
lower Point. These falling on the Object-Glass <hi>x y z</hi> are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby into the Distinct Base <hi>f e d.</hi> Let now the Concave-Glass
<hi>g h l,</hi> be placed between the Distinct Base <hi>f e d,</hi> and the
Object-Glass <hi>x y z,</hi> so far distant from the Distinct Base, as
is the Focus of this Concave; that is, let <hi>e h</hi> be the virtual Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96102:136"/>
of the Concave Eye-Glass. Then the Rays (for Instance)
from the middle Point, <hi>x i, y h, z k,</hi> falling on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
and Converging towards its Focus <hi>e,</hi> after passing the
Glass become Parallel (<hi>Corol. Prop.</hi> XIII.) and run onwards
in <hi>i m, h e, k n.</hi> The same may be conceived of the Rays
from the Collateral Points; which Converge towards the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
in <hi>f</hi> and <hi>d; viz</hi> that these also after passing the Concave
Eye-Glass, do proceed onwards Parallel amongst themselves.</p>
                  <p>But concerning these Rays from the Collateral Points, we
must not also; That, as it is shewn before in <hi>Prop.</hi> L. <hi>Sec.</hi> 3, 4.
Concerning the Convex Eye-Glass <hi>g h l (Tab. 35. f.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">T 35. <hi>F.</hi> 1.</note>) that
it brings the Rays of the Collateral Points <hi>f g, d l,</hi> Parallel
amongst themselves into its Focus at <hi>o.</hi> So the Concave Eye-Glass
<hi>g h l (Tab. 37. f.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">T. 37. <hi>F.</hi> 2.</note>) for the same Reasons expressed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in <hi>Prop.</hi> L. <hi>Sec. 3, 4. Mutatis Mutandis,</hi> makes the several
parcels of Rays from the Collateral Points, after passing it, to
<hi>Diverge,</hi> as if they proceeded directly, from the Point <hi>p; p h</hi>
and <hi>h e</hi> being equal, and each equal to the Focal length of the
Concave Eye-Glass. These things being fully considered; we
proceed in the Explication of this Telescope. And therefore
now let us apply the Eye thereto; And this also in a large Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
<hi>Tab. 37. f.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <note place="margin">T. 37. F. 3.</note>
                  <p>I say first, the Object appears through this Glass <hi>Distinct;</hi> For
by what foregoes the Rays from each single Point, do fall on
the Eye <hi>Parallel</hi> amongst themselves; And therefore each Point
(by <hi>Pr.</hi> XXVIII.) is <hi>distinctly</hi> represen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed on the Fund of the Eye.</p>
                  <p>I say secondly, the Object appears <hi>Erect.</hi> For 'tis manifest
by the Inspection only of the Scheme, that the Rays flowing
from the <hi>lower</hi> Point of the Object, are Terminated at <hi>t</hi> the
<hi>upper</hi> Part of the <hi>Retina.</hi> And the Rays from the <hi>upper</hi> Point
of the Object are Terminated at <hi>r</hi> the <hi>lower</hi> Part of the <hi>Retina.</hi>
So that the Image is painted <hi>inverted</hi> on the <hi>Retina.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by <hi>Prop.</hi> XXVIII. the Object appears <hi>Erect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:96102:137"/>I say lastly, the Object is <hi>Magnified</hi> by this Glass. For the
Proof of this we are to remember, what foregoes in <hi>Prop.</hi>
XXXVII. 'Tis there declared, that if an Object be Projected
by a Convex-Glass <hi>x y z (Tab. 37. f.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">T. 37. <hi>F.</hi> 2.</note>) in the Distinct Base
<hi>f e d;</hi> And the Eye be placed any where between the Glass and
the Distinct Base, as suppose at <hi>h,</hi> draw <hi>f h, d h,</hi> and the Object
appears under the Angle <hi>f h d,</hi> which is much greater than <hi>f y d,</hi>
the natural Optick-Angle. The same will hold, though we
interpose the Concave-Glass <hi>g l;</hi> for the Ray <hi>x g</hi> from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
lower Point, that runs Parallel to the Axis <hi>b y h e,</hi> is Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
into <hi>g t,</hi> as if it came directly from the Point <hi>p.</hi> And so
the Ray <hi>z l</hi> from the Objects upper Point, that runs Parallel
to the Axis <hi>b y h e</hi> is Refracted into <hi>l r,</hi> as if it came directly
from the same Point <hi>p.</hi> If therefore we suppose the Rays <hi>x g f,
z l d,</hi> Parallel to the Axis; then <hi>g l</hi> shall be equal to <hi>f d;</hi> And
<hi>p h</hi> being by Supposition equal to <hi>h e, p g t</hi> shall be Parallel to
<hi>h f;</hi> And <hi>p l r</hi> shall be Parallel to <hi>h d.</hi> And consequently the
Angle <hi>g p l</hi> shall be equal to the Angle <hi>f h d.</hi> Wherefore the
Object through this Glass appears under the same Angle, as we
may imagine the <hi>Apices</hi> of the Pencils <hi>f, d,</hi> would appear to the
naked Eye at <hi>h</hi> (the Concave Eye-Glass being removed) And
consequently the Object appears <hi>Magnified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Visible Area,</hi> or <hi>Angle Received</hi> by this Glass, is Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the <hi>Aperture</hi> or <hi>Breadth</hi> of the Eyes Pupil. For 'tis
manifest, from <hi>Tab. 37. f.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">T<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 37. F. 3</note> That if the Pupil <hi>d e</hi> of the Eye
were not large enough to receive the Rays from the extreme
Points of the Object, it would not perceive the <hi>whole</hi> Object
through this Glass. Wherefore by the <hi>Breadth</hi> of the Pupil
given, as also by the Focal Distances of the Object-Glass and
Eye-Glass being given, we may easily obtain the <hi>Visible Area,</hi>
or <hi>Angle Received.</hi> For let us suppose that we find from these
<hi>Data,</hi> that the whole Object Projecting the Distinct Base <hi>f e d</hi>
(<hi>Tab. 37. f.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">T 37 F 2</note>) would be Projected in the breadth of the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96102:137"/>
Pupil, at the Distance <hi>h y</hi> from the Object-Glass. Then find
the Angle <hi>f y d</hi> (as is easie from these <hi>Data,</hi> and the preceding
Doctrine) and we have the <hi>Angle Received.</hi>

                     <p>If we suppose a Convex Eye-Glass, whose Focal length is
equal to the Focal length <hi>p h</hi> or <hi>e h</hi> of this Concave Eye-Glass,
apply'd (as directed in <hi>Prop.</hi> L.) to this same Object-Glass
<hi>x y z</hi> in <hi>Tab. 37. f.</hi> 2. It would magnifie the Object equally
with this Concave: And from hence it follows, that the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Proposition LIII. concerning the Magnifying of a Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope,
may be apply'd to this sort of Telescope furnished with
a Concave Eye-Glass. But then the Advantage of the Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope
in <hi>Prop.</hi> L. beyond that of this Proposition, is most sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
in this particular, That it receives a very much greater An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
or shews to the Eye a much greater <hi>Area</hi> of the Object.
The <hi>Area</hi> in this being Determined by the breadth of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex

is proportioned to the breadth of the Pupil.</p>

it perceives not so great a space of the Object. This

just sufficient to receive the Rays from the extreme Points of the

so much Divaricated; if the Eye recede, the Pupil shall not be

which shall be about the Focus of the Eye Glass.</p>
                  <p>All things being thus combined, The Effects of this Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope
are explained in all things, as in the Telescope of <hi>Prop.</hi> L.
As to the Magnified, Inverted, and Distinct Appearance of the
Object. And therefore 'tis needless to inlarge farther thereon:
To those versed in what is already delivered, the very Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Scheme is sufficient.</p>
                  <p>Only as to the extraordinary Magnifying of these Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopes,
we may farther Remark; that whereas for viewing a
Minute Object, a well-constituted Eye does usually Approach
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96102:140"/>
thereto about the distance of eight Inches: could we approach
the Eye thereto, and view it distinctly at the distance of half an
Inch, the Optick-Angle would be wonderfully magnify'd by
<hi>Prop.</hi> LI, LII. that is to say, the apparent Magnitude of the
Object would be increased at the rate of sixteen to one. Let
us then suppose the Eye at <hi>y,</hi> viewing the Object <hi>a b,</hi> which
would then appear under the Angle <hi>a y b</hi> equal to <hi>d y f;</hi> which
is the same as were the Object increased to the bigness <hi>d f,</hi> and
viewed by the Eye at the same distance from it as <hi>y</hi> in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
is now removed from <hi>d f.</hi> Wherefore if by help of the
Eye-Glass <hi>g l,</hi> the Eye can yet approach to the Distinct Base
<hi>d f</hi> (which we may now repute the real Object) suppose ten
times nigher than <hi>y</hi> is to <hi>d f;</hi> the apparent Magnitude of <hi>d f</hi> shall
again be increased ten times more than before, by the nigh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the Eye (suppose at <hi>y</hi>): that is, the Object by all
these helps shall be magnified 160 times in length, or Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
Magnitude.</p>
                  <p>As to the Calculation of all these Angles, and apparent
Magnitudes, it cannot be difficult to those vers'd in what is
before deliver'd.</p>
                  <p>There are various Combinations of Glasses in this kind of
double Microscopes; for in some there are two Object-Glasses,
that is to say, one Object-Glass of a very deep Convexity, and
an other of a lesser Convexity, placed nigher the former than
the Projection of the Distinct Base (according to <hi>Schol. 1. Prop.</hi>
XVI.) which sometimes is called a Middle-Glass. In others
there are two Eye-Glasses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Theory of all these
depends on, and is so manifest from what has been delivered,
that 'tis needless to enlarge.</p>
                  <p>I shall conclude the First Part of this Treatise with a Piece of
<hi>Dioptricks,</hi> which though <hi>Ludicrous</hi> affords an Appearance sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising

                  <p>The Contrivance is briefly this, <hi>Tab. 38. f.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">T. 38. F. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>A B C D</hi> is
a Tin Lantern, from whose side there proceeds a square or
round Arm or Tube <hi>b n k c m l,</hi> consisting of two Parts, the
outermost whereof <hi>n k m l</hi> slides over the other, so as that the
whole Tube may be lengthened or shortened thereby. In the
end of the Arm <hi>n k m l</hi> is fixt a Convex-Glass <hi>k l:</hi> about <hi>d e</hi>
there is a Contrivance for admitting and placing an Object <hi>d e</hi>
painted in dilute and transparent Colours on a pain thin Glass;
which Object is there to be placed <hi>Inverted.</hi> This is usually
some Ludicrous or frightful Representation, the more to divert
the Spectators: <hi>b h c</hi> is a deep Convex-Glass, so placed in the
other end of the Prominent Tube, that it may strongly cast
the light of the Flame <hi>a</hi> on the Picture <hi>d e</hi> painted on the plain
thin Glass. And here 'tis to be noted, that the Glass <hi>b h c</hi> is
only designed for the strong Illumination of the Picture <hi>d e,</hi> and
has nothing to do in the Representation, and therefore in some
of these Lanterns, instead of the Glass <hi>b h c,</hi> we shall find a
<hi>Concave-Speculum</hi> so placed, that it may strongly cast the light
of the Flame <hi>a</hi> on the Picture at <hi>d e.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, Let us now consider the Picture <hi>d e</hi> as a very
lightsome Object of distinct Colours and Parts. And let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>d e</hi> more remote from the Glass <hi>k l</hi> than its Focus. 'Tis

is no more than what is already declared concerning the
Representation of outward Objects in a dark Room by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex
Glass, after <hi>Prop.</hi> IV. (<hi>vid. Tab. 14. f.</hi> 1.) And here we
may observe, that if the Tube be <hi>Contracted,</hi> and thereby
the Glass <hi>k l</hi> brought <hi>nigher</hi> the Object <hi>d e;</hi> the Representation
<hi>f g</hi> shall be Projected so much the <hi>larger;</hi> and so much the

laid down. So that the smallest Picture at <hi>d e</hi> may be Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
at <hi>f g</hi> in any greater Proportion required, within due limits.
From whence the Name of <hi>Lanterna Megalographica.</hi> And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
protracting the Tube and drawing the Glass <hi>k l</hi> more

ESQUIRE.</head>
               <p>THE Respect which I have ever had for you
since our first Acquaintance, and which on all
Occasions I have expressed in private, I have
now an Opportunity of declaring to the Publick: And
that too so very apposite, that it would be unpardonable
in me to omit it at this time; by presenting the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sheets to you, Dedicating them to your Name, and
Devoting them and their Author to your Vse and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>You may well remember the frequent Discourses we
have had on several Subjects treated of in the following
Chapters, and on account whereof I first set on this
<hi>Dioptrical</hi> Work: And particularly, I think, our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions
<pb facs="tcp:96102:144"/>
concerning the Iustness of Telescopick Sights
adapted to Astronomical Instruments, and our Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Micrometer, were the first Occasion of my
Thoughts turning this Way; And therefore the
ensuing Discourses belong to you of Right. But
if to this I add, the Advantage I have received
by your Acquaintance, and the repeated Satisfaction
I have had in your agreable Conversation; I am
bound by indispensible Tyes to make this Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.</p>
               <p>I cannot but admire your prudent Choice of a
private, retired Life; notwithstanding your great
Advantages both of Nature and Fortune, that
render you capable of the most publick and weighty
Imploy. By this Course, you have an Opportunity
of enjoying your self, and improving your Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Thoughts beyond the common pitch: You can
look on unconcern'd, and securely observe the froathy
Sea of Business, wherein Men fluctuate; and some
are shipwreckt, sink, and perish.</p>
               <p>And because you seem careless of propagating
your Name the common ways; suffer me to erect
this slight Monument to it: Though I am certain
at the same time, that, if you pleased, you may
raise a lasting <hi>Mausolaeum</hi> to your Memory;
but you seem above these Desires; yet you'll per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="tcp:96102:144"/>
your Friend to Honour it as far as he can;
and if the Materials or Workmanship do not seem
to promise a long Duration to Posterity, this only
reflects on my Abilities, (which I shall never
vindicate) but cannot lessen the sincere Intention

By the Learned and Ingenious <hi>G. G. Leibnutzius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief Hypothesis common to all these Sciences, and
by which the Progress of all Rays of Light is geometrically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
may be thus laid down. <hi>Light proceeds from the
Radiating Point, to the Point to be enlightned, that way, which
is of all the most easie; and this is first to be Determined in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to plain Surfaces, and then is accommodated to Concave or
Convex Surfaces, by considering the Planes, that are Tangents to
these Surfaces.</hi> But here I take no notice of some <hi>Irregularities,</hi>
which perhaps may conduce to the Generation of Colours, and
to some other extraordinary <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> which in practical
Opticks are not at all considered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hence,</hi> In plain or simple Opticks, <hi>Tab. 38. Fig. 3.</hi> The direct
Ray proceeds from the Radiating Point <hi>C,</hi> to the Point to be illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
<hi>E,</hi> by the shortest direct way, <hi>the same Medium conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
all along,</hi> that is, in the Right Line <hi>C E.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Catoptricks the Angle of Incidence</hi> C E A, <hi>and of Reflection</hi>
D E B <hi>are equal.</hi> Let C be a Radiating Point; D the Point
to be illustrated, and A B a <hi>Plain Speculum:</hi> 'Tis required to
find in the <hi>Speculum</hi> the Point E, that reflects the Ray to D.
I say, that it shall be such a Point, that the whole Progress,
Way or Journey of the Ray C E + E D, may be the <hi>least</hi> or
<hi>shortest,</hi> that is possible; or less than C F + F D, supposing
that we take any other Point F in the <hi>Speculum.</hi> And this
shall be obtained, if E be taken such, that the Angles C E A,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:96102:146"/>
D E B, may be equal; as is manifest from Geometry. <hi>Tab.
38. Fig.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">T. 38. F. 4.</note> Produce D E to Z, and joyn F Z.</p>
               <p>Then A Z = (D B =) A C. And F Z = F C.</p>
               <p>Therefore C E + E D (= D Z) is less than C F or F Z + F D.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and other Antients insist on this Demonstration; and
'tis extant both elsewhere,<note place="margin">T. 38 F. 3.</note> and also in <hi>Heliodorus Larissaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Dioptricks,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Here I translate according to the 2, 4. Definit. of <hi>Part I</hi> and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> 
                  <hi>The Sines</hi> E H, E L, <hi>of the Angles of Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
C E I, <hi>and Refracted Angle</hi> G E K <hi>are to each other reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally
as the Resistances of the Mediums.</hi> Let I E be Air, and
E K Water, Glass, or any other Diaphanous Medium more
Dense than Air, C a Radiating Point in the Air, G the Point
to be illustrated under the Glass: 'Tis inquired, by what
Way or Path shall C radiate to G; or 'tis required to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
in the Surface of the Glass A B, the Point E, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracting
the Ray that comes from C, sends it to G. Here
this Point E must be taken such, that the Way, which the
Ray takes, may be of all ways the <hi>easiest.</hi> But now in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Mediums, the Difficulties of the Way or Progress are
in a Ratioo compounded of the <hi>Length</hi> of the Way, and of
the <hi>Resistance</hi> of the Mediums. Let the Right Line <hi>m</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Resistance that Light finds in its passage through Air,
and <hi>n</hi> the Resistance of its Passage through Glass: The <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>
of the Way from C to E shall be as the Rectangle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
C E and <hi>m;</hi> and from E TO G as the Rectangle under
E G and <hi>n.</hi> Therefore that the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi> Way
C E G may be the <hi>least</hi> possible, the Sum of the Rectangles
C E * <hi>m</hi> + E G * <hi>n</hi> ought to be the least of all possible; or
less than C F * <hi>m</hi> + F G * <hi>n,</hi> supposing any other Point F
taken besides E. The Point E is now required. Wherefore,
seeing the Points C and G, and also the Right Line A B are
given by Position, therefore the Lines C H, G L, Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculars
to the Plain A B, and the Line H L, are given also.
Let us call C H, <hi>c,</hi> and G L, <hi>g,</hi> and H L, <hi>b;</hi> but the sought

ought to be the least of all those Quantities that can
possibly be so expressed; and 'tis required to determine <hi>y,</hi>
that so it may be. By my Method <hi>De Maximis &amp; Minimis
(Vid. Act. Lips. Ann. 1684. pag. 467. 472.</hi>) which, beyond all
that are hitherto known, does wonderfully shorten the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
it is manifest at the first sight, almost without any
Calculation, That <hi>m q y</hi> shall be equal to <hi>n p * <gap reason="math">
                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap> h − y,</hi> or that
<hi>n p. m q :: y. h − y,</hi> that is, the Rectangle of C E − <hi>n</hi> shall
be the to Rectangle of E G * <hi>m</hi> :: As E H to E L. Therefore
C E and E G being put equal, <hi>n</hi> the Resistance of Glass to
Light shall be to <hi>m</hi> the Resistance of Air to Light :: As
E H the Sine of the Angle of Incidence in Air C E I : To E L
the Sine of the Refracted Angle in Glass G E K. Or these
Sines shall be to each other reciprocally as the Resistances of
the Mediums. Which was the Assertion to be proved.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if in one Example or Experiment E L be found ⅔
of E H, the same Proportion shall hold in all other Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherever C and G be taken, that in Air, this in Glass.
If C be in Air, and G in Water, Experiment shews, that E L
shall be about ¾ of E H.</p>
               <p>Thus far this ingenious Author. The rest of his Discourse
is chiefly employed in rectifying <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> Notion of Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Des. Cart.</hi> Notion of Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction rectified.</note>
which tho founded on the same Principle here expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
yet has this peculiar, that he makes Water, or Glass, or
any other more Dense Medium, resist the Progress of Light
less than Air. But in this particular he is abundantly recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by <hi>Leibnutzius,</hi> who shews the Incongruity of that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:96102:147"/>
(3.) One thing more there is remarkable in the Learned
<hi>Leibnutzius</hi> Discourse, which I cannot here pass over, and that
is, A pious Reflection which he makes on this occasion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Final Causes.</hi>

                     </gap> Causes.</note> For 'tis manifest, that the Ray proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from C, does not consult with it self, how it may with
the greatest ease arrive at the Point E, or D, or G; neither
is it carried by it self to those Points. But the <hi>Great Creator</hi>
of all things, has so made <hi>Light,</hi> that this most beautiful, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
and admirable Event should result from its very Nature.
Wherefore they are in a great Error, who reject <hi>Final Causes</hi>
in Natural Philosophy, which, besides affording us occasion
of admiring and adoring the <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi> do often disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to us a curious Principle of finding out the Properties
of those things whose inward Nature is not <hi>so clearly</hi> known
by us, as that we can explain the immediate <hi>efficient Causes</hi>
and <hi>Instruments,</hi> which the <hi>Almighty Mover</hi> imploys in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
those <hi>Effects,</hi> and obtaining those <hi>Ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed I should think it an Attempt worth the Thought of
some profound Philosopher, to give an Account of those admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
orderly, and beautiful Appearances in Nature, whereof
we can most plainly apprehend the <hi>Designs</hi> and <hi>Final Causes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                        </gap>uses</hi> highly deserve our notice.</note> but
can hardly proceed to any farther Knowledg of them. (Thus
for instance, suppose it were asked, <hi>What is the cause of Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</hi>
Were it not much satisfactory to answer, <hi>That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Ray may proceed the easiest way possible</hi>) This surely might
be able to convince the most obstinate Opposers of <hi>Divinity:</hi>
For certainly, if we can rely upon <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ny Deduction</hi> or <hi>Consequence</hi>
drawn out by the <hi>Mind</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> we may assuredly rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in this; that so many <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> stupendous and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising
for their <hi>designed Contrivance,</hi> could not proceed but
from an <hi>Omnipotent</hi> and <hi>Designing Being.</hi> But if after all, they
will arrive to such an height of Extravagance, as to say, We
cannot rely on these Conclusions, as being <hi>all</hi> in the <hi>dark,</hi> and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96102:147"/>
                  <hi>knowing nothing;</hi> let them look to the hazard of their own
Principles, who endanger their <hi>eternal Happiness</hi> on confidence
of their own Arguments. But to resume our Subject.</p>
               <p>The Famous Mons. <hi>Fermat</hi> has written a long Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this same Principle in <hi>Dioptricks.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fermat demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates the same.</note> 'Tis publish'd amongst

1679. Pag. 158. To which I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>(4.) But after all, perhaps it may not be amiss,<note place="margin">Farther Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction from D. Barrow.</note> to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate
this Business of Refraction, by some more familiar
and sensible Instance. Wherefore <hi>Tab. 38. Fig.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">T. 38. F. 5.</note> Let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelogram
A B C D represent a Ray of Light of this breadth,
and let it fall on the plain Surface of the Glass E F; this
in some measure does stop its Course; and the Point B enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Glass, shall endeavour (but slower) to proceed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
directly to G in the Line A B produced. But all this
while the Point D, continuing yet in the Air, shall continue
its former motion in the Right Line C D H, but now 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for <hi>both</hi> the Points to obtain what both endeavour;
for each cannot perform his <hi>direct</hi> Motion, one <hi>slower,</hi> and
t'other <hi>quicker.</hi> And therefore that they may <hi>both</hi> come nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to what <hi>each</hi> endeavours, they shall <hi>both</hi> be turned about
some certain Point Z in the Right Line D B produced. So
that whilst the Point D in the <hi>thinner</hi> Medium proceeding
<hi>quicker</hi> describes the greater Arch D <hi>d;</hi> the Point B, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more slowly in the more <hi>Dense</hi> Medium, describes the
lesser Arch B <hi>b;</hi> and when they have thus run through both
these Arches, the Right Line B D shall obtain the Posture <hi>b d.</hi>
And now that the Point D also is emerged into the more Dense
Medium at <hi>d;</hi> and it also is now as much retarded as <hi>b;</hi> these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Motions shall now cease; for D is not now carried quicker
than B, and therefore describes not, as before, a greater Arch.
Wherefore forsaking, as soon as they can, their former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
they shall both proceed in <hi>d c, b a,</hi> the Tangents to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96102:148"/>
their Arches. And the whole Ray A B C D thus bent, and
brought into the Posture <hi>a b c d</hi> proceeds onwards directly in
that Course. And here 'tis to be noted, That whatever Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
A B has on E F, the Arches D <hi>d,</hi> B <hi>b,</hi> or their Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameters
Z D, Z B, have always the same Proportion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
wit, such a Proportion, as the <hi>peculiar</hi> Difference in the Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or Density of one and t'other Medium does require
(which is to be determined by Experiment): For <hi>Tab. 38.
Fig.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">T<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 38. F. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> Let us suppose the Point B thrust forwards towards Q
or N, and that the Medium below E F is perfectly <hi>Homogeneous,</hi>
that is, equally resisting in all Parts thereof; there is then no
reason, why this Point should not be carried with an equal
Celerity towards whatever Part, that is, it shall tend equally
quick towards Q in the Right Line O B Q (supposing its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
lye that way) as towards N in the Right Line A B N<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And therefore the Rays of Light A B, O B, however different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclined, shall find an <hi>equal</hi> Resistance; and the Point B,
whether it tend towards Q or N, shall be equally retarded.
And also seeing the Point D (<hi>Tab. 38. Fig. 5.</hi>)<note place="margin">T. 38. F. 5.</note> continues in the
first Medium, it shall be thrust forwards with the same Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
whatever is its Inclination. Whence 'tis manifest, that
these Motions, or Paths passed over in the same time, to wit,
the circular Arches D <hi>d,</hi> B <hi>b,</hi> shall always observe the same
Proportion, that is, the Proportion of their Semidiameters Z D,
Z B, or Z <hi>d,</hi> Z <hi>b;</hi> which Proportion therefore principally
and chiefly measures and determines the Refractions of Rays
in the same two Mediums. And this is the same Proportion,
as is between the Sines of the Angles opposite to Z <hi>d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Z B,
in the Triangle Z <hi>d</hi> B, that is, of the Angles Z B <hi>d,</hi> (or Z B E)
and Z <hi>d</hi> B. But Z B E is the Complement of the Angle A B E,
and therefore (by <hi>Def. 2. Part.</hi> I.) Z B E is the <hi>Angle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence</hi>
or <hi>Inclination</hi> of A B to E F; and the Angle Z <hi>d</hi> B is the
Complement of the Angle F <hi>d c;</hi> and therefore Z <hi>d</hi> B is the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96102:148"/>
                  <hi>Refracted Angle</hi> (by <hi>Def. 3. Part.</hi> I.). From hence is manifest
what we assert in the 7 <hi>Experiment, Part</hi> I. And here we
shall note, that according to <hi>Exper. 6. Part</hi> I. Z D shall be
to Z B :: As 300 To 193; or as 14 to 9.</p>
               <p>(5.) And thus much concerning <hi>Refraction.</hi> The Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
whereof does naturally suggest unto us, That <hi>Light is
a Body.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Light a Body.</note> For however the Antient <hi>Aristotelians</hi> defined it, <hi>Actus
perspicui quatenus perspicuum,</hi> which is perfectly unintelligible;
yet so much we may perceive hereby, that they designed to
exclude it from all <hi>Corporeal Notion.</hi> But the various Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Light, that do necessarily belong to a Body, are so
many and evident, that they leave no room for any farther
doubt in this matter. I shall mention but a few.</p>
               <p>(6.) And first, by this <hi>Affection</hi> of being <hi>refracted,</hi> 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that Light,<note place="margin">From its being resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in its passage through Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums.</note> in its passage through this and t'other Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous
Body does find a <hi>different Resistance.</hi> Now tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable,
how any thing, but Body, should suffer <hi>Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi>
but we may conceive the Resistance, that Light suffers
in its passage through different Diaphanous Bodies, to proceed
from the Medium Hindering of the <hi>Diffusion</hi> or <hi>Distribution</hi>
of Light through <hi>more</hi> of the Parts of this Medium, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
it may be said to be <hi>less illuminable.</hi> For the Nature
of Light endeavours to <hi>diffuse</hi> it self. And on the contrary,
by how much <hi>Light</hi> does more equably or uniformly affect the
Parts of the Medium, which it enlightens; or by how much
it communicates its <hi>Energy</hi> to <hi>more</hi> of the <hi>Particles</hi> of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
Space; that Medium may be said to be by so much
the <hi>more illuminable,</hi> or <hi>less to resist</hi> the Progress of Light.
Whence it is, that by how much the affected Parts of the
Medium are <hi>more solid</hi> and <hi>small,</hi> and admit between them the
<hi>less Space</hi> for any other <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> Matter, that suffers not
by <hi>Light;</hi> by so much the Medium is said to be <hi>more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened.</hi>
But leaving these <hi>Philosophical Refinements;</hi> 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96102:149"/>
that Resistance must proceed from <hi>Contact</hi> of two <hi>Bodies.</hi>
And <hi>Contact,</hi> either <hi>Active</hi> or <hi>Passive,</hi> belongs <hi>only to Body;</hi>
according to that of the Philosophick Poet,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

seems to confirm this Notion; when to prove himself <hi>a True
Body</hi>
after his Resurrection, He commands his Diffident Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<hi>To Touch Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(7.) The Second Property, that confirms <hi>Light</hi> to be a
<hi>Body,</hi> and a <hi>Body</hi> moved or thrust forward, is, That it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<hi>time</hi> to pass from one place to another,<note place="margin">Requiring time to move from place to place.</note> and does it
not in an <hi>instant,</hi> but is only of all Motions the <hi>quickest.</hi> For
the Experiment proving this, we are obliged to the Ingenious
Mons. <hi>Romer,</hi> who has demonstrated beyond all Contradiction,
from the Observations of the <hi>Immersions</hi> and <hi>Emersions</hi> of the
<hi>Satellits</hi> of <hi>Iupiter; That Light requires the Time of one Second to
move the space of 3000 Leagues, or 9000 Miles, which is near the
Earths Diameter.</hi> He that requires a farther Account hereof,
may consult the <hi>Iournal des Scavans</hi> 1676. Decemb. 7. <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soph.
Transact.</hi> Num. 136. Or Mr. <hi>Newton</hi>'s Incomparable
Piece, <hi>Philosophiae Natur. Princ. Mathem. Lib.</hi> I. <hi>Schol. Prop.</hi> 96.
Where 'tis asserted, That Light requires about ten Minutes
time to come from the Sun to the Earth. And 'tis most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
without this Allowance for the Time spent in Lights
Motion, the Appearances of the <hi>Satellits</hi> Eclipses and Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are not to be explicated by any <hi>Excentricity</hi> or other Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis.
But by this Allowance, they answer to the greatest
exactness. And this is a Part of Astronomy the most correct
and accurately determined, as well as the most useful, of all
others: For hereby Geography may be rectified, the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

For a Confirmation of all which, I appeal to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Flamsteed</hi> and Mr. <hi>Halley,</hi> to

by any Art or Contrivance whatsoever be <hi>increased</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished;</hi>
that is to say, we cannot magnifie (for instance)
the Light of the Sun or a Candle, no more than we can
magnifie a Cubick Inch of Gold, or make it <hi>more</hi> than a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick
Inch. But in this particular I desire to be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
lest I seem herein to advance a <hi>Paradox.</hi> I say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Whenever we see Light increased, 'tis by Robbing of
some other part of the Medium of its Light; or, by bringing
the Light, that naturally should have been diffused through
some other part, to the more enlightened place. Thus for
Example, In a Burning-Glass, by which the Light of the Sun
is highly encreased in its <hi>Focus,</hi> or Burning-Spot: We are first
to consider, that in this Focus the Image of the Sun is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
as being the Distinct Base of the Glass. And secondly
we may observe all round about this bright Spot of the Suns
Image, there is cast the strong Shadow of the whole breadth
of the Burning-Glass. For all the Rays from the Sun, that
would have fallen on this broad shaded space, are now brought
together and crowded close in this bright Spot, there raising
a vigorous <hi>Light</hi> and violent <hi>Heat.</hi> This is abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by an easie Experiment: For cover all the Burning-Glass,
except one small round space in its middle, just the
bigness of the bright burning Spot in its Focus; and tho there
be a shaded space round the bright Speck, as before, yet we
shall not be sensible of any <hi>Increase</hi> either of Light of Heat;
which plainly shews, that this <hi>Increase</hi> of Light (when the
Glass is all bare) proceeds from the crowding together of those
Rays that would have fallen on the rest of the Glass, and
which (were not the Glass interposed) would have fallen on
the shaded space round about the bright Speck.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:96102:150"/>There seems but one Objection against what is here laid
down; and that is, that Light is <hi>increased</hi> by Reflection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
depriving any place of the Light it would otherwise receive;
or, without bringing to the enlightned part any Light that would
otherwise escape it, or never come at it. But if we consider
the matter more attentively, we shall find it otherwise. For
let us suppose an <hi>Hole</hi> of a Foot square in the side of a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and that a Candle were placed close to, and just before
the middle of this Hole; there is but half this Candle that now
enlightens this Room, the other half of the Rays proceeding
directly out at the Hole: Let now a Looking-Glass be placed,
so as just to fill up this Hole; the Rays which before would
have gone out at the Hole, are now reflected into the Room;
so that the Hemisphere without the Chamber, which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
whilst the Hole continu'd open, is now robb'd of
its Light; and all this Light is now reflected into the Room;
whereby the <hi>averse</hi> side of the Flame is made to enlighten,
as well as the side <hi>directly</hi> exposed to the Chamber. What
is said of this Case, may be accommodated to all: For so a
Looking-Glass lying Horizontal, and reflecting the Sun-Beams
to the Ceiling of the Room, does plainly hinder the direct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of the Rays to some other part, and consequently robs
that part of its Light. This is evident, by supposing an Hole
behind the Glass; as in the former Case.</p>
               <p>(9.) From all which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tis manifest, how vainly they attempt,
who offer at <hi>increasing Light Uniformly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Light not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased uniformly.</note> that is, <hi>equally</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Sphere of a Luminous Body, or Radiating
Point. Such are the Pretences of those that would perswade
the World of Contrivances for making the small Flame of a
Lamp enlighten <hi>strongly</hi> a whole Chappel, Hall, or Court,
by being hung up in the midst thereof. For these things are
<hi>impossible</hi> to be effected in Nature, and they had as well pretend
to <hi>create Light;</hi> for there is no other way of <hi>increasing</hi> it; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96102:150"/>
by robbing another part of its Light; and then 'tis not
<hi>uniformly increased.</hi> We have a very sensible Instance of this
in the <hi>New-invented Lanthorns,</hi> now much used in <hi>London;</hi>
which by the Convex-Glasses in their sides, do strongly throw
those Rays along the Walks of the Passengers, which would
otherwise (were the Glasses away, and the round Holes left
open) be spent on parts of the Streets not frequented; whereby
the untrodden parts of the Streets are robb'd of their Light,
more strongly to supply and enlighten the Paths where Light is
requisite.</p>
               <p>I have insisted the longer on this particular, because there is
nothing more commonly pretended, than this Invention of
<hi>increasing Light uniformly,</hi> by those that do not consider how
vain the Attempt is. I must confess, could the thing be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
it would be a piece of <hi>Oeconomick Philosophy,</hi> the most
pleasant and useful imaginable, and equivalent to the <hi>perpetual
Lamp</hi> (if ever there was any such thing, as I very much doubt).
The Student in his Closet, the Merchant in his Shop, the
Housewife in her Offices, would find a great and pleasant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
therein. But above all, the <hi>dark Northern Climates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
who are many Days, Weeks, and Months deprived of the
Sun, would be infinitely obliged to the Inventor, who could
make the Flame of a Lamp, no bigger than a Barly-Corn,
supply the Presence of that <hi>glorious Body.</hi>

               <p>I was unwilling to burden the First Part with Digressions;
and therefore in <hi>Prop.</hi> LVI. thereof, I promised this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the</hi> Iournal der Scavans. <hi>For</hi> Monday 17. Septemb. 1685.
<hi>Pag.</hi> 466. Amst. Edition <hi>We find this Passage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>As Perspectives of <hi>One</hi> Convex-Glass make Objects appear
<hi>upright,</hi> which those of <hi>Two</hi> Convex-Glasses <hi>invert;</hi> and again
those of <hi>Three rectifie:</hi> So it should seem, that those of <hi>Four</hi>
ought to <hi>invert.</hi> And yet Experience shews us that Objects
appear <hi>upright</hi> through these Glasses. The singularity of this
<hi>Phaenomenon</hi> obliges all skill'd in <hi>Dioptricks,</hi> to enquire the
reason thereof; but hitherto they have found none. Mons.
<hi>Regis,</hi> who applies himself particularly to this Part of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philosophy,</hi> believes that he has hit upon the Reason, and
makes us hope that he will suddenly publish it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far the <hi>Iournal:</hi> But does not tell us whose Remark
this is: I am apt to believe, 'twas written by Mons. <hi>Regis</hi>
himself, to the Publisher of the <hi>Iournal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To me this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> appears very easily explicable from
the consideration of placing the Glasses in a Telescope. And
I wonder that any one, who pretends to Skill in <hi>Dioptricks,</hi>
should make a Difficulty of it. The posture of the Glasses
in the Tube is thus; After the Object-Glass, the first Eye-Glass
is placed so much distant (towards the Eye) from the
Focus of the Object-Glass, as is this Focus of the Eye-Glass;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96102:151"/>
then the second or middle Eye-Glass is placed so much distant
from the Focus of the first Eye-Glass, as is the Focus of this
middle Eye-Glass. Lastly, the nearest or third Eye-Glass is
placed so much distant from the Focus of the middle Eye-Glass,
as is the Focus of this nearest Eye-Glass; and the Eye, looking
through them all, is placed in the Focus of this nearest Eye-Glass.</p>
               <p>I say therefore first, that <hi>one single Convex-Glass,</hi> cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be said <hi>by it self,</hi> to shew Objects <hi>erect</hi> or <hi>reverse;</hi> but
only <hi>in respect of placing the Eye</hi> that looks through it; and <hi>in
respect of the Objects Distance from it.</hi> For if the Eye that looks
through such a single Convex-Glass, be placed nigher thereto
than the Glasses Focus or <hi>Distinct</hi> Base, distant Objects ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<hi>erect:</hi> If the Eye be placed just in the Focus or Distinct
Base, distant Objects are neither <hi>erect</hi> or <hi>reversed,</hi> but all in
<hi>Confusion between both.</hi> And if the Eye be placed <hi>farther</hi> from
the Glass than the Focus or Distinct Base, distant Objects are
<hi>reversed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being laid down, I assert, secondly, That the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-Glass
of a Telescope, consisting of a Convex Object-Glass,
and Convex Eye-Glass, <hi>reverses</hi> the Object, both to the
Eye-Glass, and to the Eye that looks through it. For the
Eye-Glass is placed <hi>farther</hi> from the Object-Glass, than is the
Focus of the Object-Glass. And the Eye-Glass does nothing
towards the <hi>rectifying</hi> or <hi>reversing.</hi> Thus we see the <hi>reversing</hi>
of Objects in a Telescope of two Convex-Glasses, proceeds
wholly from the <hi>Object-Glass,</hi> and its <hi>Position;</hi> and the Eye-Glass
has nothing to do in the Affair: For were the <hi>Eye</hi> it self
in the place of the <hi>Eye-Glass,</hi> it would see the Object <hi>inverted</hi>
through the single <hi>Object-Glass.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to consider the second Eye-Glass placed after
the first Eye-Glass. And here it is manifest, that placing this
as it ought in a Telescope; if we place our Eye nearer to this
middle Eye-Glass than its Focus the Eye sees the Object <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:96102:152"/>
and confused: Place the Eye in the Focus, it sees the
Object all in confusion, neither <hi>erect</hi> nor <hi>reversed.</hi> For here
again, there is a distinct Representation of the Object to be
received on a piece of Paper, as in the Focus of the Object-Glass;
and the Eye being placed at any time in this place,
being in the <hi>Distinct Base,</hi> sees all in confusion, (all which is
manifest from the First Part, and therefore but lightly touch'd
here). But then let the Eye be placed farther from this mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Eye-Glass than its Focus (for so is the third or immediate
Eye-Glass, it being always distant from the middle Eye-Glass,
the Aggregate of both their <hi>Foci</hi>), it perceives the Object <hi>erect</hi>
and <hi>confused.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, the third or immediate Eye-Glass does nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>erecting</hi> or <hi>reversing</hi> the <hi>Species,</hi> which it receives <hi>erect</hi>
from the middle Eye-Glass; no more than, in a Telescope of
two Convex-Glasses, the Eye-Glass does to the <hi>Species</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
from the Object-Glass; as is shewn before. All which
will be manifest from inspection only of <hi>Tab. 37. Fig.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we are to consider the Telescope consisting of a
Convex Object-Glass and three Convex Eye-Glasses, as <hi>two
Telescopes,</hi> each consisting of two Convex-Glasses. The first
consists of the Object-Glass and first Eye-Glass, and this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts</hi>
the <hi>Species;</hi> that is, the <hi>Species</hi> is <hi>inverted</hi> in the <hi>Distinct
Base</hi> of the Object Glass, and is so brought to the Eye. The
<hi>second Telescope</hi> consists of the two <hi>immediate Eye-Glasses,</hi> and
this <hi>erects</hi> what the former <hi>inverted;</hi> that is, the <hi>Species</hi> in the
Distinct Base of the middle Eye-Glass is <hi>erect,</hi> and is so brought
to the Eye, by the Eye-Glass. The Eye-Glasses themselves,
in <hi>either</hi> Case, having nothing to do with the <hi>erecting</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting,</hi>
but merely in <hi>representing</hi> in the same posture the Image
immediately before them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Problem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should not therefore have broken a
Telescope of four Convex-Glasses into <hi>four Pieces,</hi> but <hi>into
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:96102:152"/>
two;</hi> and the Case would then have been plain; whereas,
by breaking it into <hi>four</hi> Perspective-Glasses, that is attributed
to <hi>two</hi> of them, which <hi>neither</hi> of them does, <hi>viz. Inverting</hi>
and <hi>Erecting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I say lastly, That <hi>one</hi> Convex-Glass (that is the
Object-Glass) as posited in this Telescope, <hi>inverts:</hi> The <hi>second</hi>
(that is the <hi>first</hi> Eye-Glass) does nothing towards <hi>erecting</hi> or
<hi>reversing;</hi> but <hi>represents</hi> the Image as it is in the <hi>Distinct Base</hi>
of the Object-Glass before it, that is, <hi>inverted.</hi> The <hi>third</hi>
Glass <hi>erects,</hi> or rather <hi>restores</hi> what was before <hi>inverted.</hi> The
<hi>fourth</hi> represents the Image, as it receives it from the <hi>Distinct
Base</hi> of the <hi>third,</hi> that is, <hi>erect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I think a sufficient and easie Answer to what the
<hi>French</hi> Man makes a great Difficulty.</p>
               <p>As a Corollary to what has been laid down in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we may deduce this Practical Rule for combining or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
together a Telescope of <hi>Prop.</hi> LVI.</p>
               <p>Take the two first Eye-Glasses, and combine them by
Tryals, so as to make a Distinct Inverting Telescope of
<hi>Prop.</hi> L.</p>
               <p>Then take the Object-Glass and first Eye-Glass, and by
Tryals combine them likewise.</p>
               <p>Lastly, take both these Telescopes, and without altering
the Distances of their Glasses in either of them singly, by Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
combine both these Telescopes, till the Appearance be clear
and distinct.</p>
               <p>What is here done by Tryals, may be effected by actual
Mensuration, or designing out the Distances of the Glasses from
each other by knowing their Focal Lengths.</p>

thereby, inferiour to no other Benefit whatsoever, not absolutely
requisite to the support of Life. For as the <hi>Sight</hi> is the most
noble and extensive of all our Senses; as we make the most
frequent and constant use of our Eyes in all the actions and
concerns of human Life; surely that Instrument that relieves
the Eyes when decay'd, and supplies their Defects, rendring
them useful, when otherwise almost useless, must needs, of
all others, be esteemed of the greatest Advantage. In what a
miserable condition do we count those,<note place="margin">Condition of old Men deplorable without Spectacles.</note> in whom it hath pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>great Contriver of the Eyes and Sight,</hi> to shut those two

partake of the Misery of the blind. How melancholy is
the condition of him, who only enjoys the Sight of what is

in most of the Concerns of human Life? Reading is to
him troublesome, War more than ordinary dangerous, Trade
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:96102:153"/>
and Commerce toilsome and unpleasant. And so likewise,
on the other hand; How forlorn would the latter part of
most Mens Lives prove, unless <hi>Spectacles</hi> were at hand to help
our Eyes, and a little form'd piece of Glass supply'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays
of Nature? The curious Mechanick, engaged in any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute

or 60th. Year of his Age: The Scholar no longer converse
with his Books, or with an absent Friend in a Letter. All af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
would be melancholy Idleness, or he must content himself
to use an other Man's Eyes for every Line. Thus forlorn was
the state of most <hi>old Men,</hi> and many <hi>young,</hi> before this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Invention; which, on this very account, can never be
prized too highly.</p>
               <p>(2.) And because in the First Part hereof, <hi>Prop.</hi> XXVIII. and
XLV. I have but slightly touched on the proper Method for
helping <hi>defective Eyes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rules for Choosing Spectacles both for old and pur-blind.</note> I think it convenient to prosecute that
matter more fully in this place. Always supposing what fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes
in the First Part as understood.</p>
               <p>First therefore for helping the Eyes of <hi>old Men,</hi> as being
more frequently and universally requisite than the Relief of pur-blind
Eyes.</p>
               <p>In the First Part (<hi>Prop.</hi> XXVIII. <hi>Sec.</hi> 8. and <hi>Prop.</hi> XXXI.) we
learn, that a <hi>Convex-Glass</hi> is here to be used: For these seeing
<hi>distant</hi> Objects <hi>distinctly,</hi> and <hi>nigh</hi> Objects <hi>confusedly,</hi> must use
such Glasses for reading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as make <hi>nigh</hi> Objects appear <hi>as
distant;</hi> or, which bring the Rays from each single Point in a
<hi>nigh</hi> Object, as if they came from a more <hi>distant</hi> Point. Or
thus, seeing the Crystallines of <hi>old Men</hi> are <hi>too flat</hi> for <hi>nigh</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
that is, want <hi>Convexity;</hi> we are to help them by adding
to them an artificial or adventitious Convexity of a Glass.
But then our enquiry must be, What is a <hi>Proper</hi> Convexity to
this or that <hi>particular</hi> Eye? And because reading, or working
curious small Works, as being engaged upon <hi>nigh</hi> Objects, are
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96102:154"/>
the chief Imployments wherein <hi>Spectacles</hi> are requisite. I shall
suppose our Enquiry chiefly designed for this purpose. And
indeed, tho there can hardly be any Rules laid down, <hi>strictly</hi> to
determin this matter; for <hi>distinct</hi> Sight may consist within a
<hi>great Latitude:</hi> Yet if we observe the following Directions, we
shall be apt to err less, and to fit our Eyes better with <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
than if we observed no Rule at all, but chose at a venture.</p>
               <p>First, When we first find our selves begin to require <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
let us make choice of the <hi>flattest Convexities,</hi> that will
possibly help our Eyes. These are usually called <hi>Young Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
There are many ways of finding our and trying <hi>such;</hi>
but none more ready, obvious, and easie, than trying with
which one can read a small Print distinctly, with the Book
<hi>farthest</hi> from the Eyes; or try which <hi>Spectacles</hi> burn at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
distance; for these <hi>Spectacles</hi> are the most proper for those
Eyes to use, and shall prejudice the Sight less, and preserve it
longest of any.</p>
               <p>We may note likewise, that the distance of the Print, or
Object from the Eye continuing the <hi>same,</hi> a Convex-Glass may
be said to be <hi>older</hi> or <hi>younger,</hi> according at it is removed <hi>farther
from</hi> or <hi>nigher to</hi> the Eye or Object. This is manifest from the
Doctrine in the First Part, concerning the <hi>Locus Apparens</hi> of an
Object through such a Glass. To which therefore I refer.</p>
               <p>Secondly. If your naked Eyes can read a moderate Print at the
full extent of your Arms, or at the distance of about two Feet
or two and an half; and you desire a Pair of <hi>Spectacles</hi> to read
with, at the usual Distance of reading, <hi>viz.</hi> about a Foot or little
more: Procure a Pair of Glasses of such a Convexity, that an
Object being exposed before them at the Distance of about a
Foot, they may have their <hi>Imaginary Focus,</hi> or the <hi>apparent
Place</hi> of the Object, distant from them about two, or two Feet
and an half.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Barrow,</hi> Lect. Opt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. p. 103.</note> All which may be easily obtained and effected
by the Doctrine in the First Part.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:96102:154"/>In the next place, for relieving the Eyes of the <hi>short-sighted,
pur-blind,</hi> or <hi>Myopes.</hi> We must consider, that these, laboring
under the contrary Defect with <hi>old Men</hi> (for they see <hi>nigh</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<hi>distinctly,</hi> but <hi>distant</hi> Objects <hi>confusedly</hi>), must be relieved
with a Remedy of a contrary effect; and therefore they are
helped by <hi>Concave-Glasses,</hi> which bring the Rays of <hi>distant</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
into the Eye, as if they were <hi>nigh.</hi> And because we may
conceive the Crystallines of these Eyes as too <hi>protuberant</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex,</hi>
therefore we are to take off from this too great <hi>Convexity,</hi>
by adding an adventitious <hi>Concavity.</hi> But then, there is nothing
so universally complained of by those who are thus affected,
as the Difficulty they find in fitting proper Glasses to their
Eyes. For the removal whereof, the following Rules may be
observed.</p>
               <p>First, That for viewing <hi>distant</hi> Objects, according to what
is noted in the First Part, <hi>Prop.</hi> XLV. If a <hi>short-sighted</hi> Person
can read distinctly, or see Objects at the distance of a Foot from
his naked Eye; a <hi>Concave-Glass,</hi> whose <hi>Virtual</hi>-Focal-Length
is a Foot, makes such a Person see distant Objects distinctly.
And so of any otherwise disposed Eye. So that knowing the
Distance at which a pur-blind Person reads distinctly with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed</hi>
Eyes, 'tis easie, by the Doctrine in the First Part, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
him a proper Glass for his Eye to see <hi>distant</hi> Objects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For Glasses proper for <hi>Myopes</hi> to <hi>read</hi> by, or to see
Objects at the distance of about a Foot and half. Let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Eyes so affected, as not to be able to read, but at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Four Inches; and that we desire Glasses for these Eyes
to read by, at the ordinary distance of about a Foot and half:
Let us form such <hi>Concave</hi>-Glasses, which, being exposed to an
Object at the distance of a Foot and half, may have their <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
respective</hi> Focus at the distance of four Inches. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for any other Distance.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Barrow,</hi> Lect. Opt. 14. p. 102.</note> All which is easily performed by
those versed in the First Part of this Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:96102:155"/>
Thirdly, We are to note, that <hi>Myops</hi> shall require <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi>
Glasses for viewing Objects at <hi>different</hi> Distances. But
the visive Faculty not being contained within such strict and
determined Limitations; that Glass which is useful at an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
an hundred Foot distant, shall serve likewise at an Object
distant fifty Foot; but then 'tis not so helpful at one distant
five Foot. But another may be had proper even for this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and not so useful at an Object distant an hundred or
fifty Foot. All which is manifest from the Doctrine in the
First Part.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There are some Eyes so ill conformed, that no
Glasses whatever will relieve them. Of this I have often heard
a very ingenious Man and great Philosopher Sir <hi>William Petty</hi>
often complain in his own particula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. But then this proceeds
not from a <hi>too little,</hi> or <hi>too great</hi> a Convexity in the Crystalline;
but from some other Indisposition or ill Configuration, not to
be relieved by Glasses.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Persons <hi>pur-blind</hi> labour under this great Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the Glasses which relieve them in one particular, do
hinder their strong Vision of distant Objects in another parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
For as Concave-Glasses do order the Rays from any
one single Point, properly to be received by the Eye of a <hi>Myops:</hi>
So at the same time, they <hi>diminish</hi> the Appearance of the whole
Object. And from hence it is, that tho these sort of Eyes may
be well enough relieved for <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Writing</hi> at a <hi>convenient</hi>
distance, and for seeing pretty large Objects at the distance of
100, 200, or 500 Foot; yet for Objects <hi>much farther,</hi> unless
they be very <hi>large</hi> indeed, they are not so easily supply'd.</p>
               <p>(3.) And here I cannot but take notice of an ingenious inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Mr. <hi>Hooks</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. <hi>Hook's</hi> Contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for helping Myopes considered.</note> (to whom the World is certainly much
obliged for his curious Contrivances in <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> and his other
Philosophick Indeavours) published in <hi>Num.</hi> 3. of the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Collections. Lond.</hi> 1681. which he calls <hi>Myopibus Iuvamen.</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:96102:155"/>
'Tis briefly this, That some sort of <hi>short-sighted</hi> Persons, who
cannot be relieved by <hi>Concave</hi> Glasses, may perhaps find some
help in <hi>Convex</hi>-Glasses; their Eyes being removed at a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
distance farther from these Glasses than their <hi>Distinct Bases.</hi>
As for reading by these Glasses; the Book must be <hi>inverted,</hi> and
then the Image in the <hi>Distinct Base</hi> shall be <hi>erect,</hi> and the Eye
shall perceive it <hi>erect.</hi> As for Writing, the Difficulty is greater
than mentioned by the <hi>Learned Author:</hi> For the <hi>Myops</hi> must not
only learn to write <hi>inverted,</hi> but also <hi>retrograde, viz.</hi> from the
Right to the Left Hand; and, what is yet more inconvenient,
from the bottom towards the top of the Page; which is hardly
practicable on account of blotting the wet Writing. As for
viewing <hi>distant Objects</hi> with these Glasses; I acknowledg with
the ingenious Author, that much of the Disagreableness of the
<hi>inverted Prospect</hi> is taken off by use and custom, as I my self
have experienced by my frequent use of inverting Telescopes.
But yet I cannot go so far with the Author, as to assent to his
Deduction from hence; which is, that 'tis only use and custom
that makes us judge Objects <hi>erect</hi> that are perceived by an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi>
Image on the Fund of the Eye. For then a Man <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his Head,</hi> should judge the Trees and other Objects he sees
<hi>inverted;</hi> which no one in his Senses will do, but rather judge
what is right, <hi>viz.</hi> that he himself is <hi>inverted,</hi> whilst the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacent
Objects continue <hi>erect.</hi> This will be more evident
to us, by considering the case of an adult Person, who has
been blind from his Birth, and now suddenly restored to his
Sight: He is not prejudiced by custom, and yet (doubtless)
would judge as is usual. But lastly, an other great Difficulty
that will attend the use of these Spectacles for <hi>Myopes,</hi> is, that
they must be carried at such a <hi>distance</hi> from the Eyes, that it
will be very troublesom to manage them commodiously. And
if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this again we add the distance requisite for the Object,
I question whether some Mens Arms will be long enough
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:96102:156"/>
to manage a Pen for Writing, or turning the Leaves of a
Book.</p>
               <p>I have been the longer on this Proposal, because the <hi>Worthy
Author</hi> does candidly invite all, to communicate to the Publick,
what real Benefit by it, or Objections against it, they shall
find.</p>
               <p>(4.) I shall conclude this Chapter with the way of Adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Telescopes</hi> and <hi>Microscopes</hi> to <hi>defective Eyes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Adapting Telescopes and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscopes to defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Eyes.</note> Which is briesly
thus;</p>
               <p>A Telescope composed of a <hi>Convex</hi> Object-Glass and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave</hi>
Eye-Glass, being apply'd to an <hi>old</hi> Eye, the Eye-Glass
may be a little <hi>farther</hi> removed from the Object-Glass than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily:
On the contrary, in such a <hi>Telescope</hi> for the Eye of a
<hi>Myops,</hi> the Eye-Glass may be removed a little <hi>nigher</hi> to the
Object-Glass; the reason hereof is manifest from what has been
delivered in the First Part. But then, <hi>how much farther,</hi> or <hi>nigher</hi>
they are to be removed, is only to be determined by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by every ones fitting the Glass to his own Eye.</p>
               <p>And so likewise in Telescopes composed of a <hi>Convex</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-Glass,
and <hi>Convex</hi> Eye-Glass: For the Eye of an <hi>old Man,</hi>
the Eye-Glass may be removed a little <hi>farther</hi> from the Object-Glass,
or from the <hi>Distinct Base.</hi> And for the Eye of a <hi>Myops</hi>
a little <hi>nigher</hi> to the Object-Glass, than for Eyes <hi>naturally</hi> and
<hi>orderly</hi> affected.</p>
               <p>In like manner for <hi>Microscopes;</hi> First the simple or single
Convex for an <hi>old</hi> Eye, is to be removed a little <hi>farther</hi> from
the Object; and for a <hi>Myops,</hi> a little <hi>nigher</hi> the Object, than
the usual posture.</p>
               <p>And so in <hi>Double Microscopes.</hi> For an old Eye, the Eye-Glass
is to be a little <hi>farther</hi> from the Object-Glass or <hi>Distinct
Base;</hi> And for a <hi>Myops,</hi> a little <hi>nigher</hi> the Object-Glass or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Base.</hi> And because in these, the <hi>Distinct Base</hi> is brought
<hi>nigher to,</hi> or <hi>farther from</hi> the Eye-Glass (without altering the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:96102:156"/>
Distance of the Eye-Glass and Object-Glass), only by remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole Microscope <hi>nigher to</hi> or <hi>farther from</hi> the very Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
This latter Motion effects the same as the former; and
therefore may be used for <hi>old</hi> or <hi>short</hi> Sights instead of the
former.</p>

for all Optick Uses, Spherick Figures are the most commodious. If
the Object-Glasses of Telescopes were composed of two Spherick-Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
containing Water between them, perhaps the Irregularity of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractions
that are made on the Surfaces of the Glasses towards their
edges, may be accurately enough corrected by the Refractions of the
Water. And such Object-Glasses are preferable to Elleptick or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolick-Glasses;
not only because they are easier and more accurately
to be formed; but also because they refract more accurately those
Pencils of Rays that are</hi> (collateral or) <hi>out of the Glasses Axis.
But the different Refrangibility of different Rays, will for ever
hinder us from perfecting Opticks by Glasses either of Spherick, or
any other Figures whatsoever. And unless we can correct the Errors

               <p>(2.) All that I shall offer at more in this Chapter, is,<note place="margin">Trying whether a Glass be not plain.</note> to
lay down some practical Rules for finding the <hi>Foci</hi> and <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres</hi>
of Glasses; with some other <hi>Accidental Remarks,</hi> that may
be requisite to the clearer understanding and performance of
some Precepts delivered in this Treatise.</p>
               <p>The Object-Glasses of Telescopes are generally of so little
Curvity on their Superficies, that by <hi>looking on</hi> them or by <hi>feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
them, it cannot be discovered, whether they are <hi>plain</hi> or of
a <hi>Spherick</hi> Figure; or which is formed on a Sphere of a <hi>greater,</hi>
which of a <hi>lesser</hi> Radius. To find this (as I have said before,
in <hi>Schol. Prop.</hi> XXXI. <hi>Part</hi> I.) we are to shake the Glass nimbly
at our Arms length before the Eye; and if the Objects seen
through it seem to <hi>dance</hi> or <hi>move,</hi> the Glass is not plain. And
that Glass which makes the Objects seem the most to move is
formed on the <hi>less</hi> Sphere, whether <hi>Convex</hi> or <hi>Concave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(3.) When we have thus found our Glasses to be <hi>Spherick.</hi>
Then supposing them <hi>Convex,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">For find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Foci of Glasses.</note> there are several Methods for
finding their <hi>Foci.</hi> I shall lay down some of the plainest and
most certain.</p>
               <p>First, for Glasses of pretty deep Convexities (that is, of
small Spheres), apply them to the end of a Scale of Inches and
Decimal Parts, and expose them before the Sun; and upon the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96102:158"/>
Scale, we shall find the bright Intersection of the Rays exactly
measured out. Or expose them in the Hole of a dark Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and where a white Paper receives the distinct Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>distant</hi> Objects, there is the Focus of this Glass. This
is an universal and certain way for all Convexes. For a Glass
of a pretty long <hi>Focus,</hi> observe some distant Objects through it,
and recede from the Glass, till the Eye perceive all in <hi>confusion,</hi>
or till the Objects begin just to appear <hi>inverted;</hi> here the Eye is
in the Focus. If it be a Plano-Convex Glass, make it reflect
the Sun against a Wall; we shall on the Wall perceive two
sorts of Light, one more <hi>bright</hi> within an other more <hi>obscure;</hi>
withdraw the Glass from the Wall, till the <hi>bright</hi> Image is at its
smallest; the Glass is then distant from the Wall about the
fourth part of its <hi>Focal</hi> Length. If it be a double Convex,
expose each side to the Sun in like manner, and observe <hi>both</hi> the
Distances of the Glass from the Wall: The first Distance is
about half the Radius of the Convexity turned from the Sun,
and the second Distance is about half the Radius of t'other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity
likewise: Thus we have the Radii of the two Convexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
whence the Focus is determined by <hi>Prop.</hi> III. <hi>Part</hi> I. The
reason hereof depends on the Doctrine of <hi>Catoptricks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the most exact way of determining the just Focal Length
of the Object-Glass of a Telescope, is what I shall lay down
in <hi>Chap.</hi> V. <hi>Sec.</hi> 4. of this Part, which, because I must necessarily
deliver in that place, I will not here anticipate.</p>
               <p>The Foci of Concaves are obtained by <hi>Reflection;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Foci of Concaves.</note> for as a
<hi>Concave Miroir</hi> or <hi>Speculum</hi> burns at the distance of about half the
Radius of the Concavity; so a <hi>Concave-Glass</hi> being supposed a
<hi>Reflecting Speculum,</hi> shall unite the Rays of the Sun, at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of about half the Radius of the Cavity.</p>
               <p>(4) Before we proceed to the <hi>Centration</hi> of Glasses,<note place="margin">Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Centres of Glasses.</note> we are
to recollect the 18th. <hi>Definition</hi> of the First Part, wherein we
define the <hi>Axis of a Glass.</hi> I say therefore, when the <hi>Axis</hi> of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96102:159"/>
a Glass passes directly through the Centre of the Glasses Breadth,
or roundness of its Aperture, that Glass is said to be <hi>truly centred.</hi>
And this will always be so when the Glass is <hi>equally thick</hi> round
the edges of its <hi>Aperture.</hi> But this will be more intelligible by
a Scheme <hi>Tab. 40. Fig.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">T. 40. F. 1.</note> Let <hi>a g d e a</hi> be a Plano-Convex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Glass, much thicker towards the Edge <hi>d e,</hi> than towards <hi>a;</hi>
let <hi>a g</hi> be equal to <hi>g d, g</hi> is the <hi>Centre</hi> of this Glass, for 'tis the
middle Point of its Aperture or Breadth. But then this Glass is
not <hi>truly centered:</hi> For, to <hi>l</hi> the Centre of the Convexity <hi>a g d</hi>
draw <hi>g l,</hi> I say <hi>g l</hi> is not the Axis of this Glass; but if there may
an other Line <hi>l k</hi> be drawn, whose Portion within the Glass <hi>i k</hi>
is greater than <hi>h g</hi> (as in this Case it may easily be demonstrated.
For <hi>l k = l g</hi> and <hi>l h</hi> more than <hi>l i.</hi> For <hi>∠l i h =</hi> Rect. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>h g</hi> less than <hi>k i</hi>) and which being perpendicular to the plain
Surface <hi>a e,</hi> as well as to the Convex Surface <hi>a k d; l k</hi> must
consequently be the Axis of this Glass. Wherefore <hi>k</hi> is the <hi>true
Centre</hi> of this Glass. And because, to compleat this Glass,
there is wanting the Portion <hi>d f e;</hi> therefore to make the true
Centre of the Glass <hi>k,</hi> coincident with the middle Point of
its Breadth or Aperture; we are to make <hi>k b</hi> equal to <hi>k d;</hi> and
then we are to cut off, or to cover the Portion of the Glass <hi>b a c</hi>
equal to <hi>d f e;</hi> and so we obtain the <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>truly Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi>
Glass <hi>c b k d e c.</hi> The same may be understood of <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Convexes,</hi> without farther Explication.</p>
               <p>But because in Object-Glasses of even moderate Lengths,
'tis impossible by the Eye, or any Admeasurement of their
Thickness, to know whether they be <hi>truly Centered:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must have recourse to some other Methods, that may
shew this. And these are various.</p>
               <p>First, Holding the Glasses at a due distance from the Eye,
let us observe the two reflected Images of a Candle; and where
these two Images <hi>unite</hi> or <hi>coalesce,</hi> there is the <hi>true Centre</hi> of the
Glass; if this be in the <hi>middle</hi> of the Glasses <hi>Breadth,</hi> the Glass
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96102:159"/>
is <hi>truly Centred;</hi> if not, we are to rectifie it, shall be declared
hereafter.</p>
               <p>A second way is, By presenting the Glass before the Sun,
and making it reflect the Light on a Plain nighly parallel
to its Surface, at a proper distance; and we shall perceive two
sorts of Light reflected; one <hi>smaller,</hi> but much more <hi>strong</hi>
and <hi>vigorous,</hi> within another more faint and large. Then by
a due posture of the Glass (found by Tryals) both these Lights
are to be projected as round as possible; and at a proper distance
from the Wall on which they are reflected; the <hi>round brightest</hi>
Spot is to be brought into the smallest compass that it
can (Tryal will make all this plain). When the Glass is
in this posture, if the <hi>bright</hi> Spot be projected just in
the middle of the fainter Light, the Glass is <hi>well centred.</hi> If
it be projected to the Left Hand of this middle, the Glass
is thickest towards the Left Hand Edge. And so to whatever
side of the faint Light, this bright Spot is projected, on
<hi>that side</hi> is the Glass <hi>thickest;</hi> and on <hi>that side</hi> lies the <hi>true
Centre.</hi> The reason hereof I shall explain in a Plano-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex-Glass,
and is the same in a double Convex; <hi>mutatis
mutandis.</hi> For the bright Spot is the Image of the Sun pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by the curve Surface of the Glass consider'd as a <hi>refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
Speculum</hi> (whereof more hereafter), and the faint Light
is the Reflection of the Sun from the other plain Surface.
<hi>Tab. 40. Fig.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">T. 40. F. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>a d e</hi> is a Plano-Convex-Glass, thicker towards
the side <hi>d e</hi> than towards <hi>a.</hi> Let the Curvity <hi>a d</hi> (whose
Centre is <hi>c</hi>) be exposed directly to the Sun: By the known
Laws of <hi>Catoptricks,</hi> the Parallel Rays (from the middle Point
of the Sun, for instance) falling on the Curvity (which paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
Rays in the Figure are expressed by continued Lines), are
united in the Focus at <hi>f,</hi> distant from the Curvity about half
its Radius, there causing a brisk Light and Heat. In the mean
time these parallel Rays do fall on the plain Surface <hi>ae obliquely,</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:96102:160"/>
and are reflected thereby alongst the prickt Lines; and these are
they which cause the <hi>faint</hi> Light. Now 'tis manifest, that if
a Plain at <hi>f,</hi> parallel to the plain Surface <hi>a e,</hi> received these
two Reflections, the <hi>bright</hi> Light at <hi>f</hi> would not be found in
the middle of the <hi>faint</hi> Light: For here we see the <hi>faint</hi> Light
is thrown much to one side. And the <hi>bright</hi> Light <hi>f</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
upwards from the middle of the <hi>faint</hi> Light; for the
Glass is thickest upwards towards its Edge <hi>d e.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Way of Examining the <hi>Centres</hi> of Glasses is yet
more <hi>compleat</hi> than the former; for it does not only discover
the Fault (if there be any, as in long Object-Glasses 'tis very
rare but there is; especially if they be wrought in the Form
by the unguided Hand, and not by Engine), but withal, it
rectifies the Fault. 'Tis thus; Cover the Surface of the Glass
with a thin piece of Paper, in which there is cut a round Hole
of about an Inch diameter, and round about this Hole there
are to be struck two or three Concentrick Circles; move this
Paper upon the Glass, till you see, on the plain that receives
the reflected Light, that the <hi>bright</hi> Spot is exactly in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the other fainter Light round it. This also one may
measure by a Pair of Compasses, having, to that end, slightly
fixed the Paper to the Glass, that we may more nicely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
whether this <hi>bright</hi> Spot be exactly in the middle.
This therefore being carefully adjusted by gently sliding the
Paper on the Glass (if it be requisite), we are, without the
least altering this <hi>true</hi> Position of the Paper, to fix it more
firmly <hi>to</hi> the Glass. And laying it thus on a Table, let us
mark on the Glass (by the Point of a Diamond) three Points
in one of the Circumferences Concentrick to the round Hole in
the Paper. And sticking a small piece of Cement on the Glass
about the middle of the round Hole; by means of the three
marked Points, let us find the exact Centre of this round
Hole. Then uncovering the whole Glass (except only the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in which the Centre is marked), with a Diamond-pointed
Compass, let us strike as large a Circle on the Glass,
as its Breadth will bear. Then <hi>round</hi> the Glass according to
this Circle, and 'tis as exactly <hi>centred</hi> as the Sense can judge.</p>
               <p>But note, That whereas I have said that the <hi>brighter</hi> Spot
is smaller than the <hi>fainter;</hi> and that the <hi>brighter</hi> Light is to be
reflected <hi>into</hi> the <hi>middle</hi> of the <hi>fainter.</hi> This is to be understood,
supposing the Breadth of the Glass will <hi>allow</hi> it. For the
Glass may be so narrow, that the Projection of the bright
Image of the Sun may be <hi>broader</hi> than the Breadth of the
Glass. But this happens so seldom in Practice, that I pass
it over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pere Cherubin,</hi> who is often very nice in matters of little
moment, and loose enough in those of greater weight and
absolute necessity, describes an implicated Contrivance for
true Centring of Glasses. <hi>Vision Parfait. Tom.</hi> II. <hi>p.</hi> 109.</p>
               <p>(5.) The same Frier lays down a Way of Examining the
Regularity and Goodness of an Object-Glass,<note place="margin">For trying the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and Goodness of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-Glass.</note> 
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 25. which
it may not be amiss here to insert. After we have <hi>centred</hi> the
Object-Glass as well as we can, by the foregoing Method:
To try the Regularity of its Form to the greatest exactness,
<hi>says he,</hi> We must do thus, On a Paper strike two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick
Circles; one whose Diameter is the same with the
Breadth of the Object-Glass; t'other of half that Diameter.
This inward Circumference divide into six equal Parts, by the
known way of applying the Radius six times in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
and making six fine small Holes therein with a Needle.
Let us cover one side of the Glass with this Paper; and then
exposing it to the Sun, we are to receive the Rays that pass
through these six Holes on a Plain at a just distance from the
Glass. And by withdrawing or approaching this Plain from or
to the Glass, we shall find, whether the Rays that pass
through these six Holes unite exactly together at any distance
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96102:160"/>
from the Glass; if they do, we may be assured of the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of this Glass, that is, of its <hi>just Form.</hi> And at the same
time we obtain exactly the Glasses <hi>Focal Length.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all, there is no better way for trying the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of an Object-Glass, than by placing it in a Tube; and
trying it with small Eye-Glasses at several distant Objects.
For that Object-Glass that represents the Objects the <hi>brightest</hi>
and most <hi>distinct,</hi> and bears the <hi>greatest Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Contrivance for managing great Glasses, in the <hi>Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
des Scavans, Ann. 1685. May</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Mons. <hi>Cassini,</hi> when I was with him at the <hi>Observatoir</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi>
(amongst other Curiosities, which according to his usual Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and Civility he communicated to me) shewd me two
very pretty Contrivances for managing great Glasses; which,
because not yet publick, I shall describe as well as I can by
Memory at this distance of time. The first was a plain Piece
of Clock-work, moved by a Spring and regulated by a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum
Vibrating half Seconds. This carried an Arm that
stood something prominent from the Body of the Work;
which Arm at its extremity carried the Object-Glass fixt in
a Ring. This Arm and the Object-Glass, by means of
graduated Arches in the Clock-work could be turned <hi>ad Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum</hi>
directly to any Star. Thus suppose <hi>Saturn</hi> were to be
observed; by a common <hi>Ephemeris,</hi> knowing his Longitude
and Latitude, together with the Time of Day or Night, the
Arches of the Clock being put to such and such Divisions,
and the Machine it self placed with such or such a part hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
or perpendicular; the Object-Glass was of course dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
exposed to the Star. Then the Pendulum being put in
motio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, the Machine kept the Glass constantly exposed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the Star in its diurnal Motion. This whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine
then, being placed upon an Height, carried the Object-Glass
in its due position; and the <hi>Observer below</hi> managed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96102:161"/>
the Eye-Glass by his free Hand, assisted with a <hi>Rest.</hi> Tho I
cannot retain so exact a Remembrance of this Engine, as to
venture at a Scheme of the particular Parts; yet this Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
perhaps will be sufficient to give the ingenious Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer
an Idea thereof, so as to apprehend the Contrivance
in general. Something much of the same kind may we find
described in Mr. <hi>Hooks Animadversions on Hevelius Mach. Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestis.</hi>
p. 66, 67, 68, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Contrivance he mentioned to me, if I forget not,
he or Mons. <hi>Borelly</hi> told me, was due to Mons. <hi>Azout.</hi> It is
thus; From the Tube of a small Telescope there stands out
an Arm perpendicular to the side of this smaller Tube: This
Arm carries the great Object-Glass; then an Observer upon
an Height manages this small Telescope, following therewith
the Motion of a Star; by which means the great Object-Glass
(being parallel to the Object-Glass of this lesser Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope)
is kept constantly in prosecution of this same Star: Then
the other Observer <hi>below</hi> manages the Eye-Glass as before.</p>
               <p>These two Contrivances are indeed pretty Thoughts; but
I cannot promise that they can be so easily practised; unless
the Machines that carry the great Object-Glass be made to
<hi>rise</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> at pleasure, as the Star rises or sets. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
the Observer that manages the Eye-Glass, shall soon
lose the sight of his Object; unless he have the opportunity
of <hi>rising</hi> and <hi>falling,</hi> by some such Contrivance as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Mons. <hi>Cusset</hi> proposes in the fore-cited place. But
this is vastly chargeable.</p>

great Glasses; of which he has given a small Specimen in the

of it; perhaps because the Contrivance requires <hi>reflecting
Speculums,</hi> which much weaken the light of the Object, and are
therefore found useless.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:96102:162"/>
(7.) I may reckon another Piece of <hi>Mechanick Dioptricks,</hi>
The <hi>proportioning</hi> of the Glasses in Telescopes and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscopes.
<note place="margin">Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of Glasses in Telescopes and Microscopes.</note>
We have said before, that, of two or more Object-Glasses
of the same Focal Lengths; that is the best, which will bear
an Eye-Glass of the greatest Convexity (this is usually called
the Deepest Charge): But yet there are some Proportions to
be observed, which Experience has found out, as the most
convenient and best adapted for most Mens Eyes, that are
well disposed. For so a good Object-Glass of 12 or 13
Feet, will bear a <hi>Charge</hi> of 3 Inches, better than a <hi>Charge</hi> much
<hi>deeper</hi> or <hi>shallower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But moreover, In adapting an Eye-Glass to an Object-Glass,
respect is likewise to be had to the <hi>Object</hi> we contemplate;
for Objects of a sedate Light, as <hi>Saturn, Iupiter, &amp;c.</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
deeper <hi>Charges,</hi> than those of a more brisk and strong
Light, as <hi>Venus, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore this whole Affair being only the Subject of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
to that I shall refer, and only hint by the bye; That
for Telescopes of three Convex Eye-Glasses, <hi>Cherubin</hi> advises
(<hi>Dioptrique Oculaire,</hi> III. <hi>Par. Sec. 2. Cap.</hi> VII. <hi>pag. 188.</hi>) that,
of the three Eye-Glasses, that next the Object-Glass should
be of the <hi>deepest</hi> Charge; the middle Eye-Glass ought to be
something <hi>shallower;</hi> and the immediate Eye-Glass the <hi>shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> of all.</p>
               <p>For Proportioning Glasses in <hi>double</hi> Microscopes, we may
consult the same Author. But 'tis tedious to transcribe.</p>
               <p>The LV. <hi>Prop.</hi> of the First Part, relates to the <hi>Apertures</hi> of
Object-Glasses. After which, we have nothing to add in this
place; which otherwise might have been challenged by a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
thereon, as being of a <hi>Mechanick</hi> Consideration.</p>
               <p>(8.) The last Piece of <hi>Mechanick Dioptricks</hi> I shall mention,
is an ingenious Thought of Mr. <hi>Hooks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. <hi>Hooks</hi> Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to make a Glass of a small Sphere serve a long Tube.</note> for making a short

Prepare (says he) two Glasses, the one exactly flat on
both sides, the other flat on the one side, and Convex on
the other, of what Sphere you please. Let the flat Glass be
a little broader than t'other. Then let there be made a
Cell or Ring of Brass very exactly turned, into which these
two Glasses may be so fastened with Cement, that the plain
Surfaces of them may lye exactly parallel, and that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex-side
of the Plano Convex-Glass may lye inward, but
so as not to touch the flat of the other Glass. These being
cemented into the Ring very closely about the edges: By a
small Hole in the side of the Brass Ring or Cell, fill the
interposed space between these two with <hi>Water, Oyl of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine,
Spirit of Wine, Saline Liquors, &amp;c.</hi> then stop the Hole
with a Screw: And according to the differing Refraction of
the interposed Liquors, so shall the Focus of this compoud
Glass be longer or shorter. <bibl>

               <p>This, I must confess is an ingenious Hint: But I doubt
the desired Effect will not be so successfully attained thereby,
so as to constitute an Object-Glass for a Telescope. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
were it effectual; 'tis so easie and withal so useful,
that before this time it would have obtained, and been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised

and the sumptuous Volumes of his Labours and Studies, which
he has published, have procured him an immortal Name of
Honour amongst the Literate. But notwithstanding all his
commendable Endeavours, he has not yet arrived at the height
of perfection; but something is yet wanting and deficient even
in his most costly Machines. Whoever peruses the large and
elegant Volume of his First <hi>Machina Coelestis,</hi> will admire at
the vast Treasure he has expended on Astronomical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all sorts; when he sees even the very <hi>Description</hi> of
them so very sumptuous. And yet, at the same time, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
peruses a small Book of <hi>Animadversions on this Machina Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestis,</hi>

                  </gap>by the ingenious Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> will find one grand <hi>Defect</hi>
does attend the noble <hi>Hevelius</hi> Instruments, which renders
them (I will not say, useless, faulty, or no better than <hi>Ticho</hi>'s,
yet) not so compleat and perfect, as otherwise they had been
by the Addition of <hi>Telescopick Sights.</hi> For <hi>Hevelius</hi> wholly
used <hi>Plain Sights,</hi> which certainly are not so accurate as Teles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copick.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96102:163"/>
And tho I must confess ingeniously, that this renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Astronomer, by his extraordinary Diligence, great Care,
and perpetual long-continued Practice, but chiefly by his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
sharpness of Sight, had arrived to a great exactness of
Observation by plain Sights (as I find by comparing the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
made by the most curious Astronomers of our Age,
<hi>Flamsteed, Halley, Cassin, &amp;c.</hi> by Telescopick Sights, with those
Observations made by <hi>Hevelius;</hi>) yet this we are to attribute
more to the peculiar acuteness of his Eye, and to his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Diligence and Care in Observation, than to the exactness
of <hi>plain Sights.</hi> For to me it seems manifest, from what the
Learned Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> lays down in the forementioned Book, that
the naked Eye cannot ordinarily perceive an Angle (or Object
that subtends an Angle) less than a Minute, or half a Minute
at the smallest. For tho we perceive Stars of that magnitude
that their Diameters are not half a Minute; yet this is by a sort
of <hi>adventitious</hi> or <hi>glaring</hi> Light, that is caused by the Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their Rays in the Air; which makes them appear to
us much bigger than really they are; as is manifest, when we
come to look at them with a Telescope that takes off this <hi>glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Light.</p>
               <p>(2.) The want therefore of Telescopick Sights is what
Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> chiefly insists upon, as defective in <hi>Hevelius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hevelius Objections against them.</note> costly
Astronomical <hi>Apparatus:</hi> But yet, in his whole Book of <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,</hi>
he takes no notice of the chief Objections, which
<hi>Hevelius</hi> uses against them. And I am perswaded the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of that Noble Astronomer (whose Memory must now
be sacred) was so great, that upon the removal of these Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
he would have given up the Cause; for it seems the
Controversie was long agitated between them.</p>
               <p>

               <p>For English Readers thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Add to this, That if at any time the Observator chances
not to look directly and precisely through the midst of the
Glasses (as believe me it may often happen) some Varieties
may easily intermingle with the Observations, which in time
may egregiously deceive the Astronomer. Moreover, seeing
the Needle or cross Threads, do stand so close to the Eye-Glass,
and near the Eye of the Observator; I question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these Sights, so near the Eye, can discover the smallest
Stars much more accurately, than our plain Sights, which
are distant from each other Six or Nine Feet. For, tho by
these Telescopick Sights, one may see the Object more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly;
yet because they are so nigh to the Eye, one may
err, more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

far asunder; so that I shall take no farther notice of another
Inconvenience, which is, that the Intersection of the Threads
shall cover the smallest Stars from your Sight.</q>

whereof, all those Objections would be answered, and would
naturally vanish. This had been the right Method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
amongst <hi>Candid Philosophers:</hi> Whilst vilifying his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
and slighting his Performances with them as no
better than those in the Age before him, did but exasperate
the Noble old Man, and made him adhere more obstinately
to his former Practice.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Hevelius</hi> did not rightly apprehend the Nature of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescopick
Sights,</hi> is manifest by this Objection which he makes
against them, from the <hi>shortness</hi> of the <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>Collimation,</hi>
which he imagins no <hi>longer,</hi> than between the Eye or Eye-Glass,
and cross Hairs; but is really as <hi>long</hi> as between the
Object-Glass and cross Hairs: As shall be evident from what
I shall now lay down.</p>
               <p>Wherein I shall briefly explain their usual Fabrick or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance;
their adjusting to a plain Ruler, Cylindrick, or

other Instruments; and the Dioptrick Reason of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance

               <p>(3.) And first, the Fabrick or contrivance of these Teles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copick

mistaken) 'tis sufficient, if the Glass be pretty nigh the matter,
as usually most Glasses are, immediately out of the Workmans
hands. This Object-glass and Eye-glass are each to be fixed
strongly on a brass Ring in the Ruler at their proper distance.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96102:167"/>
And exactly in the Focus of the Object-glass <hi>f m d i</hi> in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Ring is contrived to be moveable to the Right and Left hand,

otherwise. The Mechanick contrivance where of is obvious
enough, and needs not here be described, every one pleasing
himself in his own way.</p>
               <p>By the Doctrine in the first part 'tis manifest, that this Tube
being thus disposed and presented before a Distant Object <hi>ABC,</hi>
the Picture or Image of the Object is projected in the Focus of
the Object-glass <hi>f e d;</hi> and this Image in the distinct Base is at
the plain of the Cross-hairs. Wherefore all the Rays that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this Image, which escape, or do not fall on, the Cross-hairs,
shall arrive at the Eye freely, and distinctly. But the
Points in the Image, which are projected, and fall just on the
Cross-hairs, are hid by the Cross-hairs from the Eye: and the
Hairs themselves appear as if they were <hi>really</hi> stretch'd upon the
<hi>very Object.</hi> For they are extended in the distinct Base, which,
in this kind of Telescope, is the <hi>Locus apparens</hi> of the Object, by
<hi>prop. 50. schol.</hi> At the same time the Hairs themselves appear
very distinctly to the Eye <hi>q</hi> in the outward Focus of the Eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>We may then conceive, that there is <hi>some one</hi> Point in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as suppose B, which sending a Cone of Rays on the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-glass,
the Principal Ray of this Cone, or the Axis thereof, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
passing the Object-glass, runs parallel in <hi>ce</hi> to the side of the
Ruler or Tube <hi>l p.</hi> Wherefore, if the intersection of the Cross-hairs,
<hi>e,</hi> without removing or stirring the Object-glass in the Tube,
be brought to meet with this Line, or to cover this Point B in
the Object, and be there strongly fixed: Whatever Point, in any
Object, shall hereafter be found covered by this crossing of the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96102:167"/>
Hairs; we may be assured that this line of Collimation, <hi>viz.</hi>
the line from the Eye to this point in the Object or the line
from this Intersection <hi>e</hi> to the point in the Object, runs parallel
to the side of the Ruler or Tube, and therefore the side of the
Ruler is directly pointed towards that mark in the Object. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

               <p>In like manner, supposing the sides of the Tube were in the
lines D E, F G; and the Object-glass fixed upon it in the posture
expressed in the Figure. We may conceive some point A in the
Object, the Axis of whose Cone of Rays <hi>A c d</hi> after passing the
Object-glass, runs parallel to the sides D E, F G. If then the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersection
of the Cross-hairs <hi>e,</hi> without stirring the Object-glass
in the Tube, be brought downwards to <hi>d,</hi> so that it may meet
with the line <hi>c d,</hi> and cover the point A in the Object, and the
Ring of the Cross-hairs be there fixed. Whatever point in an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
shall hereafter be found covered by this crossing of the Hairs,
the line from the Intersection of the Hairs to this point in the
Object runs parallel to the sides of the Tube or Ruler D E, F G.
And therefore we may be sure, the sides of the Ruler are directly
pointed towards the mark A in the distant Object. Respect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
had to the Rulers Breadth.</p>
               <p>For from whatever point on the inner surface of the Object-glass
(how thick soever it be, or how <hi>ill</hi> soever <hi>centred</hi>) the Ray
<hi>c d</hi> emerges; no other Ray can emerge from that same point,
and fall on the point <hi>d,</hi> but it must necessarily be a principal
Ray or Axis of some Cone, and must run parallel to the side of
the Ruler D E. For whatever Optick Angle the length A B in
any Object subtends; that length shall be projected by this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-glass
in <hi>d e</hi> subtending the same Angle <hi>d c e.</hi>

from or nigher to the Object-glass; till the Eye, looking at such
a distant Object, and moving before the Eye-glass, perceives
the Cross-hairs, as it were, <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>immoveable</hi> on the Object.</p>
               <p>(<hi>Note.</hi> This is the way for exactly determining the Focal length of

And this is the first thing requisite for adjusting these Sights.</p>
               <p>This I have borrowed from my own <hi>Sciathericum Telescopicum,</hi>

for the easier obtaining of this, we are first to be ascertain'd,
that even the <hi>two sides</hi> of the Ruler or Tube are exactly parallel.

means, the side of the Tube <hi>a d h e,</hi> which in <hi>fig. 4.</hi> was <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest</hi>
from the Board, in <hi>fig. 5.</hi> is <hi>next</hi> the Board. Then looking
through the Tube, let us observe, whether the Cross-hairs fall
now on the same point in the Object, as in the first posture: If
they <hi>doe</hi> agree exactly, then is the <hi>line</hi> of <hi>collimation</hi> parallel to the
sides
<hi>a h, b g;</hi> if they do <hi>not,</hi> but fall to the <hi>right</hi> hand apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the said point in the Object, then are the Cross-hairs to be
removed (by whatever Contrivance they are made moveable)
to the <hi>Left</hi> hand (the contrary requiring the contrary), so that
the Tube continuing in this latter posture, the cross-Hairs may
cover a Point in the Object, middle between the Point cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the posture of <hi>Fig. 4.</hi> and in the posture of <hi>Fig. 5.</hi> at
the first sight. And thus by frequent Repetitions and Tryals,
we at last bring all to rights. After the same manner that we
have rectified the Line of <hi>Collimation</hi> to run <hi>parallel</hi> to any two
parallel Sides of the Tube, we may rectifie it to a <hi>Parallelism</hi>
with the other two parallel Sides of the Tube (supposing the
Ring that carriers the cross-Hairs to have all the Motions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to such Rectification). And so we fix all strongly,
chiefly the Object-Glass and cross-Hairs; and the Operation is
compleat.</p>

By this Method the <hi>Line of Sight</hi> of any Cylindrick or square

And let us take what care soever possible for truly centring
the Object-Glass, and placing it, and the cross-Hairs exactly in
the Tube; we must after all rectifie these Sights by some
such Method as I have laid down, or else we may be egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously

               <p>When these Telescopick Sights<note place="margin">Constancy and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of these Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopick-Sights.</note>
are rightly adjusted in the
Tube, and strongly fixt in their due Posture by Screws, and

are of all Sights the most constant and lasting, and the

Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> was as able, as any in the World, to inform
him rightly in this Matter.</p>
               <p>(5.) I come now to the Rectification of these Sights on
<hi>Quadrants</hi> and <hi>Sextants,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">To Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants, Sextants, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                  </note>
for taking Angles. This is done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the Divisions into Degrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are made
on the Limb of the Quadrant. If it be done <hi>before,</hi> then
we suppose the Telescope T L (<hi>Tab. 39. Fig. 6, 7.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tab. 39. Fig 6, 7.</note>)
fixt to
the Quadrant, which we suppose continued a little farther than
the Fourth part of a Circle. Choosing then an Object pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
near the Horizon; let us look through the Telescope,
in the usual Posture of Observation, as <hi>Fig. 6.</hi> and observe the
Point in the Object marked by the cross-Hairs; and at the same
time we are to note most nicely the Point <hi>c,</hi> which the Plumb-Line
<hi>f c g,</hi> hung from the Centre <hi>f</hi> of the Quadrant, cuts on
the Limb. Then we are to invert the Quadrant into the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of <hi>Fig. 7.</hi> (which is easily done by the usual Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96102:170"/>
for managing great Quadrants, by tooth'd Semicircles
and endless Screws) keeping still the Telescope T L nighly
upon the same height from the Ground, as before) unless the
Object we look at, be so far distant, that the Breadth of the
Quadrant subtends but an insensible Angle. But yet for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
'tis better to keep the Telescope, as 'tis said, upon the
same height from the Floor); then direct the Telescope T L,
that the cross Hairs may cover exactly the same Point in the
Object, as before in the Posture of <hi>Fig. 6.</hi> And hanging now
the Plumb-Line <hi>a f g</hi> on the Limb of the Quadrant; let us
remove it <hi>to</hi> and <hi>fro,</hi> till we find out the exact Point <hi>a,</hi>
from which the Plumb-Line being hung, shall most nicely
hang over the Centre of the Quadrant. <hi>f.</hi> Then carefully
marking the Point <hi>a,</hi> let us divide the Arch <hi>c a</hi> into two equal
Parts in <hi>b;</hi> and drawing <hi>b f,</hi> the Point <hi>b</hi> is the Point from
which we are to begin the Divisions of the Quadrant: And
the <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>Collimation</hi> through the Telescopick-Sight, stands
exactly at Right Angles to the Line <hi>b f.</hi> So that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant
<hi>b f d</hi> being compleated and divided, the said Line of
Sight through the Telescope runs exquisitely parallel to the
Line <hi>f d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, supposing the Quadrant <hi>b f d</hi> truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
and divided; and that we designed to fix thereto
the Telescopick-Sight T L; so that the <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>Sight</hi> may run
exactly at Right Angles to the Line <hi>b f,</hi> or parallel to the
Line <hi>d f.</hi> We are to do as in the foregoing Praxis. And if
in dividing the Arch <hi>ac,</hi> we find its half exactly coincident
with the Point <hi>b,</hi> we have our desire. But if it differ from
the Point <hi>b,</hi> and fall <hi>between b</hi> and <hi>d,</hi> then the <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation</hi>
through the Telescope stands at an <hi>obtuse</hi> Angle with
the Line <hi>b f;</hi> and the Instrument errs in <hi>excess:</hi> If this half
Arch fall <hi>without b</hi> and <hi>d,</hi> then the <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>Collimation</hi> makes an
<hi>acute</hi> Angle with the Line <hi>b f;</hi> and the Instrument errs in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96102:171"/>
                  <hi>defect.</hi> And by often Tryals, we are to remove the cross-Hairs
within the Tube, so much, as is requisite to correct
this Error. And when we have thus rectified them to their
due place, there they are to be strongly fixt. Or else, in
Observations taken by this Instrument, we are to <hi>make allowance</hi>
for this Error; by <hi>subtracting from</hi> (if it be in <hi>excess</hi>) or by
<hi>adding to</hi> (if it be in <hi>defect</hi>) each Observation so much, as we
find the Error to be.</p>
               <p>Then reason of this Rectification is most plain; for 'tis
manifest, that <hi>c f d (Fig. 6.) wants</hi> of a full Quadrant, as
much as <hi>a f d (Fig. 7.) exceeds</hi> a Quadrant. So the difference
of the two Arches in the two Postures being <hi>a c;</hi> half this
difference <hi>b c added</hi> in <hi>Fig. 6.</hi> or <hi>a b subtracted</hi> in <hi>Fig. 7.</hi> makes
<hi>b d</hi> a compleat Quadrant.</p>
               <p>If we find our Instrument <hi>err</hi> in taking Angles, and we
desire to know the Error <hi>more nicely,</hi> than perhaps the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Instrument it self will shew it: We are to do
thus; Let us observe diligently the Object pointed at, in the
Posture the Instrument discovers its Error; and the Object
pointed at when the Instrument lies <hi>truly.</hi> Then, with a large
Telescope and Micrometer (as is used in taking the Planets
Diameters, as shall be declared hereafter, <hi>Sec. 7.</hi>): Let us
take the Angle subtended at the Object-Glass of the Quadrants
Telescope by the length between these two Objects, and we
obtain the Error of our Instrument most <hi>nicely.</hi> Thus for
Example; Supposing the Quadrant <hi>b f</hi> d already accurately
divided, and that the Plumb-Line, <hi>Fig. 6.</hi> plays over the Point
<hi>c:</hi> And upon the Inversion of the Instrument, <hi>Fig. 7.</hi> we find
that before we can get it to play exactly over the Centre <hi>f,</hi>
we must hang it over the Point <hi>e;</hi> so that the Arch <hi>e b</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<hi>b c</hi> by the Arch <hi>e a;</hi> 'tis plain that the Angle <hi>e f</hi> a is
the Error of the Instrument: For had the Plumb-Line hung
over <hi>a,</hi> and over the Centre <hi>f</hi> in this latter Posture, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96102:171"/>
had been <hi>exact;</hi> because <hi>a</hi> is as much on one side
<hi>b,</hi> as <hi>c</hi> is on t'other side <hi>b.</hi> Wherefore <hi>e f</hi> a being the Angle,
by which our Instrument <hi>errs</hi> in observation: Let us turn the
Instrument into the usual Posture of Observation, as in <hi>Fig. 6.</hi>
and hanging the Plumb-Line on the Centre <hi>f;</hi> let us bring
it to play nicely on the Point <hi>e,</hi> and observe what distant
Object is covered by the cross-Hairs: Then let us bring it
to play exactly on the Point <hi>a,</hi> and observe likewise what
distant Object is pointed at by the Telescope-Hairs. Lastly,
by a large Telescope and Micrometer, let us measure the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
between these <hi>two Objects,</hi> and we shall have the Angle
of Error much more nicely, than 'tis possible the Angle <hi>e f</hi> a
should be given by the Divisions on the Limb of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant
<hi>e a.</hi> And thus much for adjusting a Quadrant.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Sextant</hi> is rectifi'd in like manner; If we consider (<hi>Tab.
39. Fig. 8.</hi>)<note place="margin">T. 39 F <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Divisions <hi>d</hi> there be drawn the Radius <hi>f d;</hi> and it be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
equally in <hi>c;</hi> and from <hi>c</hi> there be suspended the Plumb-Line
<hi>c b:</hi> When the Plumb-Line hangs over the 60th De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
at <hi>b;</hi> then the Line <hi>f d</hi> lies horizontal: And consequently,
if the Line of Collimation through the Tube be parallel to
<hi>f d,</hi> this Line also lies horizontal. To try which, Whilst
the Sextant stands in this Posture, observe the Object marked
by the cross-Hairs; then invert the Sextant; and over the
Point <hi>b</hi> hang the Plumb-Line; and when from the Point <hi>b</hi>
the Plumb-Line hangs over the middle Point <hi>c,</hi> then again is
the Line <hi>f d</hi> horizontal in this Posture. Mark then, whether
the cross-Hairs cover the same Object as before : If they do,
then the <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>Collimation</hi> is parallel to <hi>f d:</hi> If they do not;
but the Point in the Object marked in this latter Posture be
<hi>higher</hi> than the Point marked in the first Posture, the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
errs in <hi>excess;</hi> if it be <hi>lower,</hi> the Instrument errs in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
And either we are to remove the cross-Hairs, till we
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96102:172"/>
bring all to rights, and there fix them: Or by the Methods
before laid down in the <hi>Rectification</hi> of the <hi>Quadrant,</hi> we are
to find the Quantity of this erroneous Angle, and to allow for
it in Observation.</p>
               <p>In Instruments furnished with two pair of Telescopick-Sights,
<note place="margin">Rectifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a movable Sight.</note> one on a <hi>fixt</hi> Arm, and t'other on a <hi>moveable</hi> Arm
(by the Ancients termed an <hi>Alidade</hi>); 'tis easie rectifying the
Sights on the <hi>moveable</hi> Arm thus: After the Sights on the <hi>fixt</hi>
Arm are rectifi'd by what foregoes; bring the Index of the
moveable Arm to the beginning of the Divisions on the
Limb of the Instrument, be it Quadrant or Sextant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis
then manifest, that the <hi>Line of Collimation</hi> through the <hi>mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
Telescope (if it be right) should lye <hi>parallel</hi> to the Line
of <hi>Collimation</hi> through the <hi>fixt</hi> Telescope. Observe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
whether the cross-Hairs in <hi>both</hi> Telescopes do at the <hi>same
time</hi> cut the <hi>same</hi> Star, or fall on the <hi>same</hi> Point in an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

do <hi>not</hi> agree in making the <hi>same</hi> Point with the cross-Hairs
in the <hi>fixt</hi> Telescope; then the Hairs in this <hi>movable</hi>

Before I quit this Point,<note place="margin">Further Vse of a Telesco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick-Ruler</note> it may not be amiss to intimate
one <hi>Use,</hi> to which a plain Ruler furnished with Telescopick-Sights
(such as is expressed <hi>Tab. 39. Fig. 3.</hi>) may be apply'd;
and that is, not only for trying the exquisite <hi>straitness</hi> of <hi>either</hi>
of its <hi>own</hi> Edges, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>parallelism</hi> of its <hi>own</hi> two Sides; but
also, for the ready Tryal of the same in any <hi>other</hi> Ruler:
For 'tis but affixing (by a little Cement, or otherwise) this
<hi>Telescopick-Ruler</hi> over the Ruler to be try'd, and resting the
Edge of this latter against the Pins H, I, and gently sliding
the Edge alongst these Pins, and always touching them;
looking all the while through the Telescope, observe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the cross-Hairs do steadily adhere to the same Point in an
Object: For if the Edge of the Ruler have the least irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Crookedness, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> cross-Hairs will move from the Point
first observed. And this shall detect the least Curvity in the
Edge of a Ruler (especially if the Ruler be long, and the
Distance of the Pins be considerable) that shall escape the
most exquisite Eye of a Workman. The way of trying
the Parallelism of the two Sides of this latter Ruler, is the
same with what foregoes for the Telescopick-Ruler it self:
For when the Telescopick-Ruler is adjoyned over the other,
they may both be taken but as one Ruler with Telescope-Sights
affix'd.</p>
               <p>(6.) I come now to the last thing proposed concerning
Telescopick-Sights;<note place="margin">Dioptrick-Reason of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and that is, To shew the <hi>Dioptrick-Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
of their Performance and Exactness. But herein there
will be little requisite to be added to what foregoes, both
in the First Part concerning Telescopes in general, and to what
is laid down in this Chapter concerning Telescopick-Sights.
'Tis manifest by Experiments, that the <hi>ordinary Power</hi> of
Man's Eye extends no farther than perceiving what subtends
an Angle of about a Minute, or something less. But when
an Eye is armed with a Telescope, it may discern an Angle
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96102:173"/>
less than a Second. The Telescope that magnifies distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Appearance of <hi>Body,</hi> magnifies also distinctly the
Appearance of <hi>Extension, Space,</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> through this
Space; so if the Minute-Hand of a Watch, which can but just
be perceived to move, be looked upon with a Magnifying-Glass,
we shall see it give a considerable Leap at every
Stroak of the Balance. And thus likewise the slow diurnal
Motion of the Sun or Stars, which is hardly perceivable by
the bare Eye, unless assisted by an Instrument of a vast Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,
is most easily perceived through an ordinary Telescope
of 18 Inches long: Insomuch that we may determine to the
greatest Niceity and Exactness, when a Star passes just over
the cross-Hairs, even to the single Beat of a Second-Pendulum.
And let an Object in the Heavens rise never so little, the
Image in the Distinct-Base falls correspondently at the cross-Hairs;
and the Eye, by means of the Eye-Glass, perceives
this Motion, be it never so small. Thus suppose (<hi>Tab. 39.
Fig. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>) that a Star <hi>rise</hi> from B to A, the Image <hi>falls</hi> at the
cross-Hairs in the Distinct Base from <hi>e</hi> to <hi>d;</hi> then by means of
the Eye-Glass <hi>o p,</hi> the Space <hi>e d</hi> is mightly magnified, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently

risen, is made most sensible to the Eye <hi>q.</hi> By whatforegoes in
the First Part concerning the magnifying of this sort of Telescope.</p>
               <p>By this we may perceive, how the Noble <hi>Hevelius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hevelius</hi> Mistake farther manifest.</note> was
mistaken in his Estimate of these Sights; when he imagin'd
the <hi>Line of Collimation</hi> therein was no <hi>longer</hi> than between the
cross-Hairs and Eye-Glass: Whereas this Distance is not at all
to be consider'd in their Performance; the <hi>Line of Collimation</hi>
being full as <hi>long</hi> as the Distance between the Object-Glass
and cross-Hairs. I am perswaded, had he been rectifi'd in
this particular, he would never have adhered so obstinately
to the Use of <hi>plain Sights</hi> upon his most costly Instruments.
Tho I must confess, 'tis difficult to wean a Man from the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:96102:173"/>
Use of what he has been accustomed to for so many Years;

as that they are easily disordered, that the Glasses are easily
vitiated by the Breath of the Observer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are not
of any the least moment. For 'tis manifest, they may be
contrived so, as to be <hi>more secure,</hi> and <hi>less</hi> subject to Injuries,
than any other plain Sights whatsoever: And in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
Telescope-Sights are so far from being obnoxious,
that certainly they are preferable to the best contrived plain
Sights; for what can be more simple and easier preserved, than
the forementioned small (but strong) Brass Rings defended
by a Tin or Brass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Tube covering all? When once these are
adjusted and fixt, nothing can possibly injure them. 'Tis true,
the Breath of the Observer, if puft into the Telescope, will
fully the Eye-Glass; but how easily is this avoided? Who is
it goes purposely to make a <hi>speaking-Trumpet</hi> of a <hi>Telescope?</hi>
The other most considerable Objection against their Use is,
That in dark Nights, at the smaller Stars, the cross-Hairs in
the Telescope require a little <hi>enlightening,</hi> or else they are <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,</hi>
and cannot be seen when the Star just applies to them.
This is so easily remedi'd, by admitting to them, through
a small opening purposely left in the side of the Tube, the
least glimmering Light of a Lanthorn; or by placing a
Lanthorn a little aside before the Object-Glass; that 'tis not
worth mentioning as a Difficulty, much less is it to be made
an Argument for their utter rejection. As to what he says of
the Hairs being so gross as to cover the smaller Stars, this
only relates to the Material we employ; and the finest Silk-Worms
Clue will be found small enough almost to bisect
the smallest Stars: If not, let us use the <hi>finest Needle,</hi> on whose
slender Point we may distinctly receive the most minute Star.</p>

is the <hi>Micrometer.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Invention</hi> of this Ingenious
Instrument, I have only this to say, That for the Honour
thereof, there are several Competitors: Mons. <hi>Petit,</hi> Surveyor
of the Fortifications in <hi>France,</hi> was the first that publish'd to
the World the rough Draught hereof, 12. <hi>Mar. 1667<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vid.
Iournal des Scavans, 16. May 1667.</hi> After him Mons. <hi>Azout,</hi>
another Ingenious <hi>Frenchman,</hi> publish'd a Tract concerning
the exact Mensuration of the Planets Diameters, wherein he
seems to challenge the Invention of this Instrument to himself
and Mons. <hi>Picard, Iourn. des Scavans, 28. Iuin. 1667.</hi> and
<hi>Philosoph. Transact. Num. 21. pag. 373.</hi> But last of all a Candid
<hi>Englishman</hi> of our own, Mr. <hi>Rich. Townley,</hi> does vindicate
the first Contrivance hereof to its <hi>true</hi> and <hi>original Author,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Gascogne</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Gentleman, who was kill'd in King
<hi>Charles</hi> I. Service, <hi>Vid. Philosoph. Transact. Num. 25. pag. 457.</hi>
wherein Mr. <hi>Townley</hi> (who is of undoubted Credit) asserts,<note place="margin">Inventor of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crometer.</note>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:96102:174"/>
that Mr. <hi>Gascoigne</hi> made and used this Instrument before the
Civil Wars in <hi>England:</hi> And that Mr. <hi>Townley</hi> had then in his
Custody two or three of these Instruments first devised by
Mr. <hi>Gascoigne;</hi> to which Mr. <hi>Townley</hi> himself had added some
considerable Improvments. All which, with the exact Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,
and fitting of the Body of the Instrument to a Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope,
we shall find accurately described in <hi>Num. 29. p. 541.
Philosoph. Transact.</hi> to which I shall therefore refer the Reader;
and shall hint only such things concerning it in this place;
as may be <hi>there wanting</hi> for the clearer Instruction of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excercised
Beginner.</p>
               <p>First therefore for a brief Description thereof (as much as
is requisite to maintain the order of our Discourse); 'tis in
short this. In the Focus of the Object-Glass of a Telescope,
there are placed two fine parallel Hairs, or smooth Edges of
Brass Plates; these are made by Screws to open or close at
pleasure, as wide as the Telescope admits. The Turns of
these Screws are reckon'd out by proper <hi>Indices;</hi> so that in
opening the Edges of the Micrometer, the Indices do shew,
how many <hi>Revolutions</hi> of the Screws, and Parts of a <hi>Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
are compleated in that Opening. Suppose therefore the
Screws to be of so fine a Thread, as to contain 30. Threads
in an Inch length; then every Revolution of the Screw opens
or closes the Edges of the Micrometer a thirtieth part of an
Inch. By one Revolution of the Screw, the <hi>Index</hi> receives
one Revolution: Then, the Circumference of the Plate, over
which the <hi>Index</hi> moves (as the Hand of a Watch over the
Hour-Plate) being divided into 100 Parts; when the <hi>Index</hi>
moves one of these Parts, the Screw moves the Edges a three
thousandth part of an Inch; (or the one thirty six thousandth
part of a Foot; by which we find how easie 'tis to divide a
Foot into thirty six or forty thousand Parts) And this Motion,
tho every Minute, is made, by the Eye-Glass of the Telescope,
perceivable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:96102:175"/>
The way of taking small Angles by this Instrument is
thus; Suppose it were the Diameter of the Moon; Open the
Micrometer till the two Edges do just clasp or touch the
Moons Edges; then observe by the Indices how many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
and parts of a Revolution were compleated to
this opening; and by a proper Table (the way of composing
which I shall shew presently), convert these Revolutions and
Parts into Minutes and Seconds. In like manner, for observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
small Angles on the Earth, the Diameters of the other
Planets, the Distances of <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s <hi>Satellits</hi> from his Body, or
the Moons Spots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now for making the Table, First we are to fix the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crometer
exactly in the <hi>Focus</hi> of the Object-Glass (by the Rules
before given, <hi>Chap. 5. Sect. 4.</hi>) if it be at very distant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
we design to use it: Or otherwise in the <hi>respective Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
if it be designed for nigh Objects. We may then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Table two manner of ways: The first is more easie,
tho not so very certain and accurate, yet exact enough for
most Uses. Measure by Inches and Decimal Parts the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
between the Object-Glass and Micrometer, taking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Account two Thirds of the Object-Glass's Thickness:
Let us suppose the Distance 10 Foot, or 120 Inches, or
120000 Parts; and we desire to know what Angle is shewn
by the Micrometer, being open 2 Inches, or 2000 Parts.
The Computation is plain (<hi>Tab. 35. Fig. 4.</hi>)<note place="margin">T. 25. F. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>e y</hi> = 120000,
<hi>f d = 2000,</hi> then <hi>e d = e f = 1000.</hi> And As <hi>e y:</hi> To Rad. ::
So <hi>e d:</hi> To Tang. <hi>∠ e y d =  ∠e y f = 0 ° 28' 38",</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>∠f y d</hi> is equal to 0 ° 57' 16". Then finding by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Admeasurement, how many Revolutions of the Screws
or <hi>Index,</hi> are requisite to open the Edges 2 Inches; the same
compleats the Angle 0' 57' 16". Suppose therefore 60 Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
open the Micrometer 2 Inches; then 60 Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
shew, that the Object, that just appears through the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:96102:175"/>
Edges at that opening, subtends an Angle of 0°57' 16".
Then 30 (<hi>viz.</hi> half 60) Revolutions give 28' 38", <hi>viz.</hi> half
57' 16". And one Revolution gives an Angle of 57" 16".
and the hundredth part of a Revolution gives 34" +. And
thus the Table is composed to any Number of Parts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
requisite. But this Way, depending on the exact
Admeasurement of the Distance of the Micrometer's Edges
(which can hardly be obtained to sufficient Accuracy, unless
we know most nicely what Number of Threads in the Screw
there were in an Inch length; for then we know what Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Revolutions compleat an Inch), 'tis not so accurate
as what follows, which is,</p>
               <p>The second way for composing the Table, is this: Having
fixt the Micrometer at its due Distance from the Object-Glass;
on the side of a Wall or House far distant mark out two
conspicuous Objects, that may both at a time be received
into the Telescope: Measure nicely the distance of these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from each other; and also the distance of either of them
from the Object-Glass (which we suppose directly before the
Point in the Wall middle between the two Objects). And
by Trigonometry calculate the Angle, which the distance
between these two Objects subtends before the Object-Glass.
Then looking through the Telescope, open the Micrometer,
till the two Edges thereof exactly meet with or embrace these
two Objects; and observe, how many Revolutions and parts
of a Revolution are performed in this opening; for so many
compleat the Angle before calculated. And having the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
and Parts that compleat any one Angle, we may
easily find all the rest, as aforesaid. For in these small Angles,
the Angles and Revolutions are proportional; that is, if a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
Number of <hi>Revolutions</hi> give a <hi>certain Angle; half</hi> this <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
gives <hi>half</hi> this <hi>Angle;</hi> and the hundredth part of this Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
gives the hundredth part of the Angle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:96102:176"/>
In the first Method that I proposed for adapting the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crometer,
and composing the Table, I have allowed for the
Object-Glasses Thickness in measuring its distance from the
Micrometer. But this Nicety is hardly requisite; unless it be
in short Tubes. For at the Radius of 10 Foot, 1 Inch is
the Tangent of 28' 38"; and at the Radius of 10 foot + one
tenth of an Inch, 1 Inch is the Tangent of 28' 37"; so there
is but <hi>one Second</hi> difference; tho we should err one tenth of
an Inch in admeasuring the distance between the Object-
Glass and Micrometer.</p>
               <p>I might now mention the Application of a <hi>Lattice of fine
Hairs</hi> in the Focus of the Object-Glass of a Telescope,<note place="margin">Other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescopick-Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> as
an help to draw distant Objects in <hi>Perspective:</hi> And of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
there a pretty contrived Parallelogram for the same
purpose. But the first is obvious enough by the least inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
thereof; and the latter is so amply described by <hi>Pere
Cherubin d'Orleans</hi> in his <hi>Dioptrique Oculaire;</hi> that 'tis needless
to add any thing farther in this place.</p>
               <p>I conclude this Chapter with a brief hint of what I have
found very commodious for many purposes;<note place="margin">Instead of cross-Hairs.</note> that is; instead
of the forementioned cross-Hairs, I have often used a curious
piece of clear, thin, flat Glass, whereon there are drawn two
very fine cross-Lines by the curious Point of a Diamond,
smaller than the most fine Wyre or Hair; not easily disturbed
by a sleight Touch (unless we break the Glass), nor alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by Heat and Cold. Thus also may we make a Lattice.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And First in his Book of</hi> Perspective <hi>Part III. Dis. 2. C. 3.
he has these words;</hi> Si vero Corpora non sunt plana (<hi>having
treated of them before</hi>) per quae Visus videt, sed sphaerica; tunc
est magna Diversitas, nam vel Concavitas Corporis est versus oculum,
vel Convexitas, &amp;c. <hi>By which 'tis manifest, he knew what
a</hi> Concave <hi>and</hi> Convex-Glass <hi>was. Moreover, in the same Place</hi>

these are performed by refracted Vision; For thereby, 'tis easily made

and contrarily. Hereby also may we bring the Sun and Moon and
Stars down here below in Appearance, <hi>&amp;c. This, I think, is so
express in the Point, that it leaves no room to doubt, but
that he had some admirable Secret in Optick Glasses. Add

               <p>I Confess,<note place="margin">Note.</note> I have not by me at this time the Originals,
from whence these Passages are quoted; the present Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our miserable Country having separated me and my

Therefore, if in these Quotations I am any wise mistaken, I
must not be blamed, acknowledging that I have them <hi>at second
hand</hi> from the forenamed Authors.</p>
               <p>But to return to our <hi>Optick-Glasses.</hi> 'Tis evident that <hi>Bacon</hi>
was acquainted with them; and probably knew how to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt
them in a <hi>Telescope.</hi> But the long and close Imprisonment
he suffer'd before his Death (for tis said no one was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to speak to him; and that all his Writings, Books and
Instruments were seized and burnt; except only those few
Fragments of his which we have saved accidentally) was the
Reason, that we have no farther Advancements of his in this
kind transmitted to Posterity. But 'tis very probable that the
use of single Glasses in <hi>Spectacles,</hi> as being an Invention of
immediate Advantage to Human Life, and in it self very easie
and simple, might therefore be presently catched at by the
World, and put into Practice: Whilst his other more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Combinations of Glasses might be lost and forgot.
And this I am the more inclinable to believe; First, because

we find this sort of <hi>Monkish Men</hi> first take notice of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,

that I may not seem altogether partial, I shall here add the
Opinions of others, concerning <hi>Other Inventors</hi> of the <hi>Telescope.</hi>
For I find no other Pretenders to the Invention of single
<hi>Convex</hi> and <hi>Concave</hi> Glasses, but the forenamed. <hi>Borellus</hi> has
written a small Tract purposely on this Subject, <hi>De vero Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopii

                  <hi>An. 1609.</hi> A <hi>Dutchman</hi> also,
whom <hi>Surturus</hi> calls <hi>Lippersein. Adrianus Metius</hi> Mathematick
Professor at <hi>Franequer</hi> says,<note place="margin">Ja. Metius.</note> his Brother <hi>Iacobus Metius</hi> of <hi>Alk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maer</hi>
was certainly the first Inventor of the <hi>Telescope.</hi> And if
we believe the <hi>Italians,</hi> we shall have the Honour of inventing
this Instrument conferr'd on the incomparable <hi>Galileo.</hi> But he
himself in his <hi>Nuncius sidereus</hi> confesses, that the first Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he received of this Instrument, was, that a <hi>Dutchman</hi> had
then lately made one; which set him (<hi>Galileo</hi>) upon the
thought how to effect it; which, he says, he successfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
by the consideration of <hi>Refraction,</hi> and found that a
<hi>Concave</hi> and a <hi>Convex</hi> Glass rightly adapted would perform
what he only heard in general of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Invention.</p>
               <p>But certainly the first Publick notice of this Contrivance
came from some of the forementioned <hi>Dutchmen</hi> (for <hi>Frier
Bacon</hi>'s Hint mentions not the particular Combination of the
Glasses) and therefore the Instrument is deservedly called <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus

<hi>Galileo, An.</hi> 1610. (see his <hi>Nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this curious Instrument to Celestial Observations; and had then

made such wonderful Discoveries in the Heavens thereby, that
all his Philosophick Successors have ever since attempted to

they gave to disorder'd Eyes: but still were ignorant of the
vast Advantage the most <hi>acute</hi> Eye might receive by them,
even to the Increase of its Power, some Thousands of Degrees
beyond its natural Abilities. This was reserved for some lucky
Chance in a future Age, to be discovered by him that should
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96102:181"/>
first be so fortunate, as to adapt these Glasses at their <hi>due

some latent, hidden Properties, which, upon a right Application,
(to be discovered perhaps by some lucky Hitt) may be of the
most useful and surprising Effects. And that therefore, we
should not despair of making the greatest Discoveries about e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the <hi>meanest</hi> Things. Who could expect to see such Wonders
from an easie Composition of three such plain, simple Bodies,

And the Property of the <hi>Magnet's</hi> drawing Iron was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

we learn, not to despise the Products of Nature, even of the

appear to the naked Eye, as one united whitish Cloud.

That Mons. <hi>Gallet, Provost</hi> of S. <hi>Symphorian</hi> at <hi>Avignon,</hi> in the year
1684 has advanced an Hypothesis for solving its Appearances;
which, as it relates to the Telescope, may p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>operly be here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
I shall therefore briefly propose some of the chief diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
that seem to attend this Theory: And that I may not
be prolix, I shall suppose the Reader acquainted with what
Mons. <hi>Gallet</hi> lays down in the <hi>Iournal des Scavans, An.</hi> 1684.
<hi>May 15. &amp; Iune</hi> 12. and in Latin in the <hi>Acta Lipsiae, An.</hi> 1684.
<hi>Septemb.</hi> Pag. 421.</p>
               <p>First therefore, he supposes <hi>Saturn</hi> and the other Planets,
except the Moon, <hi>polite Globes,</hi> reflecting the Image of the
Sun as a <hi>Convex Speculum.</hi> Which seems not at all to be
founded on more than mere <hi>Conjecture:</hi> For we have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to think them different in this particular from the Moon;
which is found of a rugged uneven Surface.</p>
               <p>But secondly, granting that they (and especially <hi>Saturn</hi>)
may be <hi>polite Spheres,</hi> (for we will not confine the infinite Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of the Creation;) and granting that <hi>Saturn</hi> reflects two
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:96102:184"/>
sorts of Light; one whereby his whole Body becomes visible;
and the other the bright Image of the Sun from his Convex
Surface; as we see a Convex Speculum is it self visible, by the
Rays it reflects disorderly from its whole Surface; (which
so far partakes of a little Roughness) and at the same time
reflects a bright and orderly Image of the Sun, from one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
part of this Surface to the Eye rightly posited: Yet this
bright Image of the Sun, which is reflected from <hi>Saturn,</hi>
(how far soever <hi>Saturn</hi> be removed) can never be projected
by an Object-Glass, in its distinct Base, <hi>greater</hi> than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the whole Body of <hi>Saturn</hi> in the same distinct
Base. And yet (if I mistake not) this is the Foundation of
Mons. <hi>Gallet</hi>'s Theory. This is so evident to any one the
least versed in <hi>Dioptricks</hi> and <hi>Catoptricks,</hi> that 'tis needless to
insist upon it any longer. We may make a convincing Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
hereof: Expose a reflecting Convex-Speculum before
the Sun, and by a Convex-Glass project the Image of this
Speculum on a Paper in a dark Room: we shall there see
the Representation of the Speculum it self, and of the bright I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of the Sun on the Speculum. And indeed by the least
Consideration of the matter, it will be evident to us, that 'tis
impossible it should be otherwise: For the little Image of the
Sun, reflected from the Convex Speculum, possesses but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
small part of the Speculum's Surface; and therefore cannot
possibly be projected, by the Object-Glass in its distinct Base,
<hi>greater</hi> than the Projection of the Convex Speculum itself.
The same may we conceive of <hi>Saturn,</hi> by supposing him a
Convex, polite, reflecting Speculum; for though he should
then, besides the figure of his own Body, reflect the bright
Image of the sun, from a small part of his Spherick Surface
on the Object-Glass; yet the Object-Glass could never project,
in its distinct Base, the Representation of this Image of the
Sun <hi>greater</hi> than the Representation of the whole Body of
<pb facs="tcp:96102:184"/>
                  <figure/>

                  <hi>Saturn.</hi> And, notwithstanding the Evidence hereof, Mons. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>
affirms, the Appearance of <hi>Saturns Ring</hi> or <hi>Ansae</hi> proceed to
from hence; that the Object-Glass projects, in its distinct Base,
the representation of the bright Image of the Sun, reflected
from <hi>Saturn</hi>'s <hi>Convex polite Surface, greater</hi> than (or clearly <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>)
the Representation of his <hi>Body</hi> itself.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Mons. <hi>Gallet</hi> affirms, that the Reason why <hi>Iupiter,
Mars, &amp;c.</hi> are not projected by an Object-Glass, in its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Base, with a <hi>Ring</hi> or <hi>Ansae,</hi> is because these Planets are
<hi>nearer</hi> to us than <hi>Saturn:</hi> And therefore in the Projection of
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> the bright Image of the Sun reflected from its polite
Surface, is represented by the Object-Glass in its distinct Base,
<hi>equal</hi> to the Representation of <hi>Iupiters</hi> whole Body; in the
Projection of <hi>Mars</hi> it is <hi>less, &amp;c.</hi> But the Distance of these
Planets (even of the nighest) is so very great, (and as it were
infinite) in respect of the small Breadth of an Object-Glass;
that in comparison to this small breadth of an Object-Glass,
we can make no difference between the Distance of <hi>Saturn</hi>
and even <hi>Mercury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, the Experiments, on which Mons. <hi>Gallet</hi> founds his
whole <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> seems not at all to confirm, or in the least
wise to respect what he builds thereon. The Phaenomenon
arising from reflecting the Sun-Beams by an Object-Glass on
a Wall posited <hi>obliquely,</hi> proceeds from the Object-Glass being
consider'd as a <hi>Concave Reflecting Speculum,</hi> having also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Surface either Plain or Convex besides the Concave, (as
I have noted before, Chap. 4. Sec. 4.) and yet he superstructs
hereon a Theory, for explaining the Appearances of <hi>Convex
Polite Surfaces,</hi> such as he makes the Planets. This will be
manifest by <hi>Tab. 40. Fig.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">T. 40. F. 4.</note> wherein, for ease sake, we take a
Plano-Convex Glass <hi>a b c,</hi> and exposing its plain side <hi>a e c</hi> oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Suns Rays <hi>de, de, de,</hi> some of them shall be reflected
by the plain Surface <hi>a e c</hi> into <hi>ef, ef, ef;</hi> but others of them
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:96102:186"/>
entring the Glass run on in <hi>ei, ei, ei,</hi> (we do not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Refraction they suffer) and so falling on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
Surface <hi>a i b i c</hi> (for so I'll call it) are <hi>reflected</hi> by it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws of <hi>Spherick Catoptricks:</hi> But the Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of these immerged Rays I have not expressed, for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Confusion in the Scheme. I acknowledge, the <hi>Physical</hi>
Cause of this latter Reflection, from the Surface of the Glass
<hi>a i b i c,</hi> is perhaps not to be accounted for by Human Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
but the matter of Fact is certain. One should
think, when the Rays are arrived at the extreme Points
<hi>i, i, i,</hi> of the hindmost Surface of the Glass, they should, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any of them being reflected at all, emerge from the Glass:
But 'tis manifest <hi>some</hi> of them are <hi>reflected,</hi> and that too, just
in the same manner, as if the Surface <hi>aibic</hi> were a Polite,
Opake, Concave Surface; and not covered by the Surface
<hi>a e c.</hi> They that desire to enquire farther into the natural Cause
hereof, may consult <hi>Grimaldi Physico-Mathesis de Lumine &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loribus,
Bonon.</hi> 1665. 4<hi rend="sup">•</hi>.</p>
               <p>'Tis then by the Reflection from this Concave Surface <hi>aibic,</hi>
(give me leave so to call it) that the similitude of <hi>Saturns Ansae</hi>
are represented in <hi>Gallets</hi> Experiment; and by the Reflection
from the <hi>Plain</hi> Surface <hi>aeec,</hi> that the Similitude of his Body
is represented in the said Experiment. And how this can be
accommodated to the Reflection, which <hi>Saturn</hi> himself makes
from his own Body, and to his Appearance through a Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope,
I confess I cannot apprehend. Moreover <hi>Gallet</hi>'s Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
gives no Account of the two dark Spaces on each side
the Globe of <hi>Saturn,</hi> between his Body and the <hi>Ansae.</hi> For
the Experiment, on which he founds his Fancy, shews no such
Distinction; all being inlightened therein: As will be visible
to those shall try it.</p>
               <p>'Twere too tedious in this Place to consider particularly
Mons. <hi>Gallet</hi>'s Scheme, and his <hi>Particular System</hi> of <hi>Saturn;</hi>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:96102:186"/>
which might easily be shewn defective. But thus much I
thought requisite to say in this Place; because the Theory he
proposes is of a <hi>Dioptrical</hi> Consideration: Because it has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Observations of their Motions, tis requisite, we use Tubes
of 10 and 12 Feet and upwards. From the time of their
Discovery, many curious Astronomers have attended their
Motions round <hi>Iupiter</hi> with a diligent Eye; and have found,
that sometimes falling into the Shadow of <hi>Iupiter</hi> Body, they
disappear; and thence emerging, they again become visible:
sometimes they are hid behind the very Globe of their great
Lord; and sometimes being just in his Face, his Splendor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes

Part of Astronomy, are very great and ingenious; which
I hope, in time, he will impart to the World; as with much
Freedom and Generosity, he now communicates them to his

               <p>Before I quit this Article of the <hi>Satellites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Satellites</hi> all disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</note> I cannot omit
taking notice of an Observation, which, by mere Accident, I
made some years ago, of a <hi>Total Disappearance</hi> of all the <hi>Satel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi>
I had often attended their Motions with a good Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope
of 12 Foot; and often had them <hi>all four</hi> conspicous
at a time, very often <hi>three,</hi> frequently <hi>two,</hi> but never less than
<hi>one,</hi> and this but very rarely; till <hi>An. 1681. Novemb. 2. Hor.
10. p. m. Dublinii St. Vet.</hi> there was <hi>not one of them visible; Iupiter</hi>
there stood by himself, in all Appearance, without his Guards;
and a bold <hi>Lucian</hi> might have pull'd him from his Throne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Resistance. Some years after, I obtain'd from my learned
Friend Mr. <hi>Flamsteed</hi> his Tables of the Motions of these <hi>Satelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi>
And the Postures of these <hi>Iovial Moons,</hi> at that time, are found
by them to be as is expressed in <hi>Tab. 40. Fig.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">T. 40. F. 3.</note> The first, third
and fourth were <hi>just in his Face;</hi> and were therefore drown'd by his
Light, and the second was <hi>behind</hi> his Body. The rarity of this
Appearance (at least to me) makes me note it so particularly:
perhaps those that are more frequently imploy'd in watching
their Motions may meet sometimes with the like Conjuctions;
but I believe 'tis very seldom. <hi>Hevelius,</hi> in his constant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
on them, for more than a year and half, hit not
upon such an Appearance; as may be seen by the History of
his Observations at the end of his <hi>Selenographia;</hi> Nor <hi>Cassini,</hi>
as is manifest from his forementioned Ephemerides.</p>
               <p>Besides these <hi>four</hi> little <hi>Moons</hi> about <hi>Iupiter,</hi>

               <p>The last thing that has been observed in this Planet is a

A very strong Argument to prove, that our Earth may do so
likewise; since <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who is so considerably <hi>bigger</hi> than the

take notice of one admirable Property, for the Knowledge
whereof, we are beholden to the Telescope; and that is, the
wonderful Agreement which is found in all the several Systems
of our Vortex; as well between the General <hi>System</hi> of the Sun,
and Primary Planets with the particular <hi>System</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi>'s or
<hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Planets, as between the particular Systems themselves,
in this single Property, <hi>That the Periodical Times of the Planets
Revolutions are in a</hi> sesquialtera Ratio <hi>of their Distances from the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:96102:189"/>
Centre of the Planet about which they revolve.</hi> That is, As the
Square of the Period of the first <hi>Satellite</hi> (for instance) : To
the Square of the Period of the second :: So the Cube of
the Distance of the first from <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Centre : To the
Cube of the Distance of the second from his Centre. This
holds most exquisitely true in <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s <hi>Satellites,</hi> as is noted
by the admirably learned Mr. <hi>Newton,</hi> in his incomparable
Treatise, <hi>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica,</hi> Lib. 3.
Hypoth. 5. And the same <hi>Law of Motion</hi> is strictly observed
by the five Primary Planets, and the Earth about the Sun.
As he notes, Hypoth. 7, 8. This is also verifyed by Mons.
<hi>Cassini</hi> in the five <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Saturn;</hi> as appears by his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them in the <hi>Philosoph. Transact.</hi> Num. 92. P. 5178.
N. 133. P. 831. N. 181. P. 79.</p>
               <p>And from hence may we justly fall into the deepest Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same Law</hi> of Motion should be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Bodies so vastly distant from each other, and which seem
to have no Dependence or Correspondence with each other.
This does most evidently demonstrate, that they were all at
first put into Motion, by <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same unerring Hand,</hi> even
the <hi>infinite Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, who has <hi>fixt</hi> this <hi>Order</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them <hi>all,</hi> and has <hi>establish'd</hi> a <hi>Law,</hi> which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>transgress. Chance</hi> or <hi>dull Matter</hi> could never produce such
an <hi>Harmonious Regularity</hi> in the Motion of Bodies so vastly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant:
This plainly shews a <hi>Design</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> in the <hi>first
Mover.</hi> And with Submission to the Reverend and Learned
<hi>Divines,</hi> I am apt to think, that one Argument drawn from
the <hi>Order, Beauty</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of Things, is more forecible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Atheism,</hi> than Multitudes of Notional Proofs drawn

as the <hi>Satellites</hi> about <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Iupiter</hi> move round <hi>them;</hi> so
moves the <hi>Moon</hi> as a Satellite about our Earth. <hi>Galileo</hi> with his

after him <hi>Langrenus</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Cosmographer, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to draw her Picture. But the noble <hi>Hevelius</hi> in his
curious and costly Work of <hi>Selenography,</hi> has perfected this
Affair, perhaps beyond Amendment. There may we see the
<hi>Moons</hi> Countenance distinguished in an admirable difference
of Parts, both for Shape and Colour. We may there see
greater Parts that resemble our Seas, Lakes, Rivers, Islands,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:96102:191"/>
Peninsulas and Continents; other lesser Spots (almost infinite
in number) that resemble our Mountains, Hills and Vallies.
Of the <hi>greater</hi> Parts, those that are something <hi>obscure,</hi> may we
reckon <hi>Seas</hi> and <hi>Lakes;</hi> and the brighter may we account <hi>Land.</hi>
For just so does our Earth appear, when, from a distant Height
we look upon a Mixture of Land and Water enlightened by
the Sun. Of the <hi>smaller</hi> Spots, those that are <hi>brightest</hi> and <hi>shine,</hi>
are Mountains and Rocks; and the <hi>darker</hi> Parts, which are

               <p>Now that some Parts of the Moon are much higher than
others,<note place="margin">Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in the Moon.</note> is as manifest by the Telescope, as that some Parts of
our Earth are higher than others. For if we look upon it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Quarter-days, we shall plainly see the Edge, towards
the dark Part, broken and cragged; and many little bright
Spots, that are clearly separated from the rest of the enlightned
Part. Which is an evident Proof that these are the high Tops of
Eminencies, which receive the Suns Light, before the Parts <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
them are enlightned. Moreover the Moons Spots cast
their Shadows <hi>opposite</hi> to the Sun, that is, to the <hi>Eastward,</hi> whilst

                     </hi>
                  </note> I shall conclude all, with two remaining Uses of
the <hi>Telescope.</hi> The first is, <hi>To view nigh Objects therewith.</hi> The
most apposite Telescope for our Purpose, is that consisting of
a <hi>Convex Object-Glass</hi> and <hi>Convex Eye-Glass.</hi> But what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:96102:194"/>
hereof, is easily accommodated to the Telescope with
a Concave Eye Glass; but this latter, taking in but a narrow
space of the Object, is not so proper for our Purpose.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, suppose we have a Telescope, whose Object-Glass
has its <hi>Focal</hi> Length for very <hi>distant Objects</hi> just 3 Foot,
(how to find this exactly, I have shewn Chap. IV. Sect. 3.)
This we'll call the <hi>Solar Focus.</hi> And suppose the Focus of
the Eye-Glass be just 2 Inches; and that we were to view with
this Telescope an Object 20 Foot distant from the Object-Glass.
'Tis required to find the <hi>distinct Base</hi> of this Object-Glass
exposed now to this <hi>nigh</hi> Object 20 Foot distant, which
in the First Part is called the <hi>Respective Focus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is done by Prop. V. of the First Part: By this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy,</p>
               <p>As the difference between the Distance of the Object and
Glasses Focus :</p>
               <p>To the Glasses Focus ::</p>
               <p>So the Distance of the Object from the Glass :</p>
               <p>To the Distance of the respective Focus, or distinct Base
from the Glass.</p>
               <p>In the Numbers of our Example thus,</p>
               <p>204. 36 :: 240. 42<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>35 + = equal to the distinct Base of
this Object-Glass exposed now to this nigh Object. So that
the Distance of the Object-Glass from the Eye-Glass, which,
for viewing <hi>distant</hi> Objects, was 36 + 2 = 38 Inches; must
now be 42<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>35 + 2 = 44<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>35 Inches; and so much is the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescope
to be lengthened to view this Object distant only 20
Foot.</p>
               <p>The use of this Theorem is very pretty;<note place="margin">Viewing Pictures in Minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> and they who draw
Pictures in <hi>Miniature,</hi> may practise it to good Purpose. For
the small Picture (being <hi>inverted</hi> that it may appear <hi>erect,</hi> and
placed in a strong Light, and thus looked at with a Telescope)
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:96102:194"/>
may be made to appear full as <hi>bigg</hi> as the natural Face, or
<hi>bigger</hi> if we please. And by this means, the least Errors of
the Painter may be easily discovered, which cannot be done
so well by a single Convex-Glass as will be manifest to those
who shall try and compare both Ways. And this naturally
leads me to the last Use of the Telescope I shall here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and 'tis as it were the <hi>Converse</hi> of this I have just spoke
of. 'Tis,</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is the great <hi>Desideratum</hi> in <hi>Practical Geometry;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

This is evidently shewn by <hi>Tacquet (Geom. Pract.</hi>
Lib. 1. <hi>ad Finem</hi> Cap. 5.) concerning the Method proposed by
<hi>Clavius.</hi> And may be shewn of any other, that I have ever
yet heard of.</p>
               <p>Towards the latter end of the year 1665.<note place="margin">History of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</note> (as we may find
Num. 7. P. 123. <hi>Philosoph. Transact.</hi>) Mons. <hi>Auzout</hi> did propose
to Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> to exchange with him a Secret he had in Opticks,
for another which Mr. <hi>Hook</hi> had. Mons. <hi>Auzout</hi>'s was, <hi>Loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
Distantias ex unicâ statione, absque ullo Instrumento Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matico
metiri.</hi> And therein he declares the Instrument, he uses
for this Purpose, to be a <hi>great Telescope,</hi> with some necessary
Tables. Adding withal, <q>That tho the Practice do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
answer the <hi>Theory</hi> of his <hi>Invention,</hi> because that the
Length of the Telescope admits of some Latitude; yet one
comes <hi>near enough,</hi> and perhaps as <hi>just,</hi> as by most of the
Ways ordinarily used with Instruments.</q> But tho Mr. <hi>Hook</hi>
discovered the Secret which Mons. <hi>Auzout</hi> desired from him,
(which is that I mention at the End of Chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> IV.) yet Mons. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zout</hi>
never (that I know) published any thing farther of this
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:96102:195"/>
Invention of his own. And indeed I cannot see, how justly
Mons. <hi>Azout</hi> could say, that his Performance was, <hi>absque ullo
Instrumento Mathematico;</hi> and at the same time tell us, that it
was done by a <hi>great Telescope;</hi> which surely is a <hi>Mathematick
Instrument</hi> in the highest sense: Perhaps he means, 'tis none of
those <hi>Mathematick Instruments</hi> commonly used in this Practice.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> who then publish'd the <hi>Philosoph. Transact.</hi>
adds Pag. 125. <q>That the Secret of measuring the Distance
of Places by a Telescope fitted for that Purpose, and for one
Station, is a Thing already known (if I am not missin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)
to some Members of the <hi>Royal Society;</hi> who have
been a good while since considering of it, and have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Ways for the doing of it. Whether the same with
those of Mons. <hi>Azout,</hi> I know not; nor have I (at the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
that I am now from them) Opportunity of particular
Information.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is in short the History of this Affair. Wherein (for
ought as ever I could learn) nothing more has been done
hitherto. So that what I shall propose therein is my own
Thought and Contrivance. Whereof I shall first declare the
Method; and afterwards shall not conceal the Difficulties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
not doubting but more ingenious Heads may have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
of the same kind far exceeding mine; tho nothing
herein has ever yet been publish'd.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let the Distance of the Object from the Object-Glass
be called <hi>d,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal.</note> the <hi>Solar Focus</hi> of the Object-Glass, or its
<hi>Focus</hi> at very distant Objects <hi>f,</hi> the <hi>respective Focus</hi> or distinct
Base at a nigh Object <hi>r.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By Prop. V. and the Rule immediately mentioned:</p>
               <p>It shall be—<hi>d − f . f :: d. r</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Compounding—<hi>d . f :: d + r. r</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Permute—<hi>r . f :: r + d . d</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divide—<hi>r − f . f :: r . d</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:96102:195"/>
Which last Analogy is the Rule I give for finding the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of an Object by a Telescope, thus expressed in Words,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As the Difference between the</hi> Respective Focus <hi>and</hi> Solar
Focus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the</hi> Solar Focus ::</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So the</hi> Respective Focus:</p>
               <p>To the Distance of the Object from the Object-Glass.</p>
               <p>It now remains to shew how to obtain exactly the three
first Terms of this Analogy; That thereby we may find the
<hi>fourth</hi> required. And first for the <hi>Solar Focal Length</hi> of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-Glass,
'tis shewn before in Chap. IV. Sec. 3. how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it exactly. Secondly for the <hi>Respective Focus,</hi> or distinct
Base of any <hi>nigh</hi> Object we look at, I propose the Way to
obtain it thus:</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Micrometer</hi> is contrived to <hi>open</hi> and <hi>close</hi> in the Focus
of the Object-Glass, and the Indices give the exact Measure
of this <hi>Opening:</hi> So may we adapt an Instrument, which may
<hi>advance</hi> or <hi>withdraw</hi> the curious Point of a slender Needle to or
<hi>from</hi> the Object Glass. And an <hi>Index</hi> (after the manner of
the <hi>Micrometer</hi>) may shew how much the slender Point is
withdrawn from the Object-Glass. Then looking through the
Telescope at the Object, whose Distance we measure, let
us withdraw the Needle, till by moving the Eye before the
Eye-Glass, we perceive the Needle, as it were, <hi>fixt</hi> upon the
Object: (as is taught Chap. V. Sect. 4.) Then is the Needle
in the <hi>Respective Focus.</hi> And by observing the <hi>Index</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
we have the Measure of this <hi>Respective Focus</hi>
from the Object-Glass: And consequently the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
it and the <hi>Solar Focus.</hi> With which we are to work
according to the Rule, and we obtain what was required, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>Distance</hi> of the Object. Thus suppose, in the foregoing
Example, the Glasses Focus be = 36 Inches, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96102:196"/>
Focus be measured 42, 45: The Analogy will then
stand thus,</p>

                  </gap>35. 240 = to the Distance
of the Object from the Object-Glass. And thus may we make
a <hi>Table</hi> to any <hi>Telescope,</hi> that upon the first Sight of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Focus</hi> shall give the Distance of the Object.</p>
               <p>But now I shall not conceal the Difficulties,<note place="margin">Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty thereof.</note> that attend
this Method of observing Distances. And first, The Eye can
never be <hi>justly</hi> certain, when the Needle's Point is <hi>exactly</hi> in
the Respective Focus; for tho the Way I propose of examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it (<hi>viz.</hi> by moving the Eye before the Eye-Glass, and
observing whether or not the Needle seems to move on the
Object) be the best Expedient, and most certain that I can
think of at present: Yet we shall find, that it admits of some
<hi>Latitude;</hi> and that the Needle may be moved a little more <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
or <hi>backward,</hi> without shewing any visible Motion thereof
on the Object; and this too most especially, the longer the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescopes
are that we use, and the wider the Aperture. But
for the Remedy hereof, 'tis best to observe where the Needle
(being <hi>too nigh</hi> the Object-Glass) <hi>begins first</hi> to move on the
Object; as also to observe, where the Needle (being <hi>too far</hi>
from the Object-Glass) <hi>begins first</hi> to appear to move on the
Object; and to take the <hi>middle</hi> between these two Stations of
the Needle for the <hi>true Respective Focus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, where the Distance of the Object is <hi>very great,</hi>
and vastly disproportional to the Solar Focal Length of the
Object-Glass; the Observation will not be very accurate. And
therefore it is that Mons. <hi>Auzout</hi> in the forementioned Passage
out of the <hi>Philosoph. Transact.</hi> confines his Practice to <hi>great
Telescopes.</hi> For unless they be <hi>so,</hi> a considerable Alteration
in the Distance of the Object makes no sensible Alteration
in the <hi>Respective Focus</hi> of the <hi>Object-Glass.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:96102:196"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:96102:197"/>

               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:96102:197"/>
But if we believe the said Mons. <hi>Auzout,</hi> by this Way, (if this
Way which I propose be his, as I know not whether it be or
not) <hi>one comes near enough to Exactness, and perhaps as just as
by most of the Methods ordinarily used.</hi> However, tho the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
through some accidental Difficulties, do not so exactly
answer the Theory: Yet it cannot be deny'd, that the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is true. And perhaps farther Improvements may bring it
to Perfection.</p>

vanishes.</p>
               <p>This is the Declaration of the Phaenomenon, which any one
may experiment by placing two Candles, D 3 Foot, and C
1 Foot distant from the Eyes, and then standing so that the
Nose and two Objects may lie in or near a right Line, he fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Eyes on either Object, alternately open and shut them
I choose two Candles, and at that Distance and Posture, because
the Experiment thereby will be more sensibly evident; tho
it hold in any two Objects at whatever Distance, till the
Distance be so great, that the Interval between the two
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96102:198"/>
Eyes bears no sensible proportion thereto, that is, till
the Angle ACB (and much more A D B) is so very small,
that the Lines AC, BC, may be taken to run as it were
Parallel.</p>
               <p>This being declared, I explicate the Reason of this Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
as follows.</p>
               <p>In the first Case, both Eyes being fixed on C, if the Right
Eye B be shut, the Object D will appear to the left hand of
C; then shutting the Left Eye A, and opening the Right Eye
B, and looking at C, D will appear to the Right Hand of C;
therefore opening both A and B, and looking stedfastly on C,
the Object D will appear on both sides C, that is, both to
the Right and Left Hand of C, and therefore double. And
'tis manifest, the Right Eye B receives the Right Image of D,
and the Left Eye A the Left Image of D; therefore in this
Case, to the Right Eye being shut, the Right Image of D
disappears, and to the Left Eye being shut, the Left Image
of D disappears.</p>
               <p>But in the second Case, fixing both Eyes on D, C seems
double, for the Left Eye A being shut, C appears to B on
the Left Hand of D; then the Right Eye being shut, the
Left Eye A sees C on the Right Hand of D; so that in this
Case, the Right Eye receives the Left Image of C, and the
Left Eye the Right Image of C, and consequently the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or shutting of either, does in this Case make the contrary
Image of C disappear. And why C should seem double, is
plain in this Case; for the Right Eye sees it on the Left
Hand of D, and the Left Eye on the Right Hand of D; so
that both Eyes see it on both Hands of D, and therefore
double. But then in the first Case, the Object D, and not
the Object C, seems double. And in the second Case, the
Object C, and not the Object D, seems double. For in
Vision, there is a Difference between <hi>looking</hi> and <hi>seeing;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96102:198"/>
Object I <hi>look</hi> at with both Eyes appears <hi>single,</hi> and all
others more remote or nigher, that I <hi>see,</hi> appear <hi>double;</hi> for upon
the Object, I <hi>look</hi> at, the Optick Axes do concur, but not so on
those I only <hi>see.</hi> And this is the Reason that at any time I
can make all the Objects about me seem confused, only by
turning the Optick Axes so, that they may concur in the free
Air; as if there were a certain visible Object there before
them, tho really there be none.</p>
               <p>And that the Concurrence of the <hi>Axes Optici</hi> in a single
Point or Object is sufficient to make that Object seem but
one besides the Proof of the foregoing Experiments, I shall
endeavour to evince, or at least to explicate, by an other
known Affection of Vision; the Explanation whereof is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by all men as satisfactory, 'tis this, in <hi>Tab. 41. Fig.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Image <hi>a b</hi> of the Object A B is painted on the <hi>Retina</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and yet the Eye (or rather the Soul by means of
the Eye) sees the Object erect and in its natural Posture;
Because the Mind takes no notice of what happens to the
Rays in the Eye by Refraction or Decussation, but in its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
towards the Object; it follows streight alongst the
Rays as they by their Impulse and in their plain Course lead
it, and consequently following the Rays <hi>a A,</hi> it is directed strait
to the upper part of the Object; and also following the Rays
<hi>b B,</hi> it is directed to the lower part of the Object, and so of
the rest: for suppose the Ball of the Eye taken out of its Sock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
or Cavity in the Skull, and a Man receives in the Socket
an impulse by a Stick coming in the posture of <hi>B b,</hi> and hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him on the upper part of the Cavity, surely he would
never look for the Original of this Blow at <hi>A,</hi> but would
be certainly directed to hunt back as it were alongst the Stick
<hi>b B</hi> towards the Place from whence the Stroak comes. So
the mind does hunt back by means of each Pencil of Rays
(which are as it were a Stick giving the <hi>Retina</hi> a certain
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:96102:199"/>
Impulse) to the Point from whence it comes, and is thereby
directed strait thereto. To apply this to what I intend, I say
then, that the Mind or visive Faculty (if I may have leave to
use that Word for a thing we all understand and cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
express) takes no notice that there are two <hi>Axes Optici,</hi> or two
Pictures made by those <hi>Axes Optici</hi> on each <hi>Retina,</hi> but follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back, and hunting <hi>counter</hi> alongst these Axes, it is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to, and determined in <hi>one single</hi> Point, and therefore it sees
it as <hi>one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And seeing this Speculation does naturally lead me to the
Consideration of an Opinion, first as I think started by the
celebrated <hi>Gassendus,</hi> and since embraced by many, <hi>viz.</hi> that
we see but with one Eye at once one and the same Point
of an Object, <hi>otiante alio,</hi> (as they term it) whilst the other
is idle and does nothing. I shall not think it improper to
subjoyn to my former Discourse something relating to that
Opinion, confining my self only to what may something il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate
my former Explanations, for to enumerate all the
Experiments that prove we see with two Eyes, would swell
this far beyond the limits I design it. Therefore to the
Matter.</p>
               <p>Against our seeing with two Eyes at once one and the
same Point of an Object, it is commonly objected, that if it
were so, every Object would seem in two places at once,
<hi>vide</hi> Gassendi <hi>Epist. 4. de Magnit. Solis humilis &amp; sublimis, &amp;</hi>
Taqueti <hi>Opt. lib. 1. Prop.</hi> 2. Thus in Tab. 41. Fig. 3.<note place="margin">T. 41. F. 3.</note> If
the Eyes A, B, look at the Object C, and both see it at a
time, A would see it on the opposite Wall suppose at E, and
B at D.</p>
               <p>I am so far from thinking this an Objection, that I assert first,
that we do see all Objects in two places, and that this is not
taken notice of by us upon these Accounts. First, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Objects of our sight are large, and the Axes of our Eyes
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:96102:199"/>
directed to but one Physical Point thereof at a time, and then
we cannot be expected to see such in two places at once; for
when I read on a flat broad Book, where is the opposite Wall
for a single small Letter to be seen on at two places, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
themselves are fixt to the Surface that determines the Sight.
What I Instance in Letters on a Book may be accommodated
to most other Objects. Secondly, There are few Objects dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
fitly for shewing us that we see them in two places,
for either their Bulk hinders the Experiment from appearing so
plainly, or their distance from each other or from the Eyes.
Thirdly. The Wall DE and the Parts thereof are seen so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly
by the Eyes A, B, when fixed on C, that we cannot
so clearly observe this Experiment; and this happens to all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
more remote or nigher to us than C, when the Eyes are
fixed on C, still supposing that it self be but in a moderate
Distance from us, that is, in such a Distance from us, as
may bear some considerable Proportion to the Distance of the
two Eyes from each other. Fourthly, the chief Reason why
we do not perceive so plainly the Object C to cover both D
and E is, because, though D be cover'd by C from the Eye
B, yet it is not covered from the Eye A, and therefore we
think it not covered at all. Also though E be covered by C
from the Eye A, yet it is not covered from the Eye B, and
consequently because we see E, tho but with one Eye B, we
imagine it not covered at all, so that both the Points D and
E being open to both the Eyes A and B, <hi>viz.</hi> the Point D to
the Eye A, and the Point E to the Eye B, we think neither
of them covered, whereas really they are both obscur'd, each
to its proper Eye, as will be evident by winking. And from
hence is manifest the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alsity of <hi>Taquets</hi> Assertion in the forecited
Place, <hi>viz.</hi> that opening both Eyes A and B (<hi>Fig.</hi> 3.) and
looking at C, it shall appear only to cover E (he imagining
that most Men see generally with their left Eye) whereas I
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:96102:200"/>
say it shall appear to obscure neither E nor D, tho to each Eye
respectively it cover each. Fifthly, whereas the Bulk of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
(as I have noted) does hinder the Experiment from
being so sensibly evident; if by any Experiment I can shew
how a large Object may be doubled, I think 'twill be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
plain. Therefore in <hi>Tab. 41. Fig.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the two Eyes, before which at a convenient Distance
place the two Candles C, D, then take a large piece of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
E F G H K, in whose middle at K there is a small
Hole. This Paper so place between the Eyes and Candles,
that the Eye A may through the Hole K see the Candle
D; and at the same time the Eye B may see through the
Hole K the Candle C; the due Distance of the Paper that
is requisite for this will be found by Tryals, and winking
alternately with the Eyes. When all things are in this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
open both Eyes A and B, and direct them to look
at either of the Candles, I say the Hole K shall seem dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and what is proved of the Point K is true of all other
Points in the Paper, so the whole Paper appears double; but
no Points thereof are so evidently doubled as the Point K,
because they want the Advantage of Lights behind them to
render the Experiment more sensible. And upon this Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I cannot but hint to all Persons that are desirous to make
Experiments about Vision, that they always imploy the most
luminous and vigorous Objects they can possibly, for many
Experiments will be evident by them, that will not sensibly
succeed with others.</p>
               <p>But I assert secondly, that unless we saw with both Eyes,
the two first mentioned Experiments would not succeed, and
they may be reckoned amongst the greatest Arguments that
can be produced for it. For suppose in <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. A and B
to look stedfastly on C, I say they see C in two Places at
once, for they see it both on the Right hand and Left hand
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:96102:200"/>
of D. For tis the same thing to see C between two Ds,
as to see it at two Places at once. And this I'll declare more
fully <hi>Tab. 41. Fig.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">T. 41. F. 5.</note> supposing the two Eyes A and B fixed on
the Object C, I say C appears on the opposite Wall X Z in two
Places, <hi>viz.</hi> at E and F (tho neither E nor F are obscur'd
thereby for the foregoing Reason) for let us suppose the
Object D of the first Figure to be placed duly on this Wall;
shutting A, the Object C shall appear to B on the left hand
of D by the Angle D B E: then shutting B, the Object C
shall appear to A on the right hand of D, by the Angle
DAF; wherefore to both open at a time and looking at
it, it shall appear on both sides of D, to A on the right
side, to B on the left side, and this happens by doubling
of D; so that from hence this Paradoxical Corollary arises,
<hi>That an Object may be seen in two Places, and yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot seen
double.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that assert that we see but with one Eye, whilst
the other is idle and does nothing, assert likewise that all
visual Spirits recede from the idle Eye, and only supply the
Eye that sees; but I see no Reason why the Eyes A, B,
looking at C, either of them should be said destitute of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in respect of C, which they see single, and yet both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished
with Spirits in respect of D, which they see Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The Images of C and D both are painted on the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi>
of A as well as of B, and therefore A and B both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
replenished with Spirits to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee D, (even by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of our Adversaries) why not to see C also, at which
they stedfastly look?</p>
               <p>To conclude, I propose it to the learned and ingenious
Dr. <hi>Briggs,</hi> or to any other of the Philosophical Spirits of this
Age to explain the foregoing Phaenomena by the Doctor's
Theory of Vision. And as a Conclusion to the whole shall
only add one Experiment that Demonstrates we see with
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:96102:201"/>
both Eyes at once; and 'tis, that which is commonly known
and practised in all Tennis-Courts, that the best Player
in the World Hoodwinking one Eye shall be beaten by the
greatest Bungler that ever handled a Racket; unless he be
used to the Trick, and then by Custom he gets an Habit of
using one Eye only.

C R: O P :: <hi>C z: P x,</hi> and C R: <hi>C z</hi> :: O P: <hi>P x.</hi> Again C R is to

               <p>The several Cases of Rays Diverging or Converging as they
enter the curve Surface of a <hi>Convex</hi> or <hi>Concave Lens,</hi> are for the
Readers Ease delineated in the first four Figures of <hi>Tab.</hi> 42. as
are in <hi>Fig.</hi> 5 and 6 thereof, and in <hi>Fig.</hi> 1, 2. of <hi>Tab. 43.</hi> the
like Cases of emerging Rays. All which are drawn with the same
Letters to their respective Points, only in some the Point F fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
far distant, is to be understood in the Intersection of the
Line P F with the Axis.</p>
               <p>This thus demonstrated in the most difficult Cases, will give
all the Rules <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or the Foci of Rays parallel to the Axis as likewise
for the principle Focus, where the Rays nearest the Axis do unite,
all which Rules I shall collect in these following Corollaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cor. 1.</hi> If O P be equal to C r, then the Points Q and C are
coincident, and the Rays O P after Refraction run on parallel
to the Axis.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:96102:204"/>
                  <hi>Cor. 2.</hi> If the Point Q fall on the same side the Axis as is the
Point P, then the Beams after Refraction do tend on, either
diverging or converging as before: But if Q fall on the other
side the Axis, as in <hi>Fig. 1.</hi> the diverging Rays are made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verge
by a Convex, or the converging to diverge by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
Glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cor. 3.</hi> If O P do exceed C R, the Focus is in all Cases on
the same side of the Glass as is the Centre of the Sphere C. But
contrarywise if O P be less than C R, the Focus falls on the other
side of the Glass beyond the Vertex V.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cor. 4.</hi> An Object may be so placed, that the Rays next
the Axis of a Convex-Glass shall have an imaginary Focus, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
diverging Rays, when the more remote Parts thereof
shall make them converge to a real Focus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cor. 5.</hi> If O V the Distance of the Object from the Pole or
Vertex of the Glass, be taken instead of O P, then will C Q
be the difference of O V and C R, and as that difference to
C R, so the Radius C V to C F the Distance of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Focus from the Centre of the Sphere whereof the Glass is a
Segment: or else as C Q to O P or R Q :: so P C to V F the
focal distance from the Pole of the Glass. Whence follows a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rule for the Foci of all Glasses, only according to <hi>Corol. 3.</hi>
if O V do exceed C R, the Focus is on the same side of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Glass as is the Centre of the Sphere. But if C R be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
then the Focus is on the opposite side of the Glass, whence
it will be determined whether the Focus be real or imaginary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cor. 6.</hi> What has hitherto been said of one Surface of a <hi>Lens</hi>
is easily applicable to the other; taking F the <hi>Focus</hi> of the first
Surface as an Object, and using it as O in the Figures for emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Rays, whereby the <hi>Focus</hi> of both Surfaces will be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
as in <hi>Tab. 43. Fig. 3.</hi> where I have given an Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cor. 7.</hi> Hitherto we have considered only <hi>oblique Rays</hi> either
<hi>Diverging</hi> or <hi>Converging;</hi> it now remains to add something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:96102:205"/>
                  <hi>Rays parallel</hi> to the <hi>Axis:</hi> In this Case the Point O must
be considered as infinitely distant, and consequently O P, O C,
and C R are all infinite; and O P and O C are in this Case
to be accounted as always equal, (since they differ but by a Part
of the Radius of the Sphere G P V L, which is no part of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them,) wherefore the <hi>ratio</hi> of C R to O P will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the same, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>s</hi> to <hi>r</hi> for immerging Rays, and as
<hi>r</hi> to <hi>s</hi> for those that emerge. And by this Proposition C F is
to P F in the same <hi>ratio.</hi> It remains therefore to shew on the
Base C P, to find all the Triangles C P F wherein C F is to
P F in the <hi>ratio</hi> given by the degree of Refraction. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
has been very fully considered by the celebrated Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi>
in his late Treatise of Algebra, pag. 258. to which I refer; but
I must here repeat the Construction thereof, <hi>Tab. 43. Fig. 4, 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let G P V L be a <hi>Lens,</hi> V C or P C the Radius of its
Sphere, and let it be required to find all the Points <hi>f, f,</hi> such
as <hi>C f,</hi> may be to <hi>P f</hi> in the given <hi>ratio</hi> of <hi>s</hi> to <hi>r</hi> for immerging
Rays, or as <hi>r</hi> to <hi>s</hi> for the emerging. Divide C V in K, and
continue C V to F, that C K may be to V K, and C F to
V F in the proposed <hi>ratio:</hi> Then divide K F equally in the
Point <hi>a,</hi> and with that Center sweep the Circle FK F; this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
being drawn gives readily all the Foci of the Parallel Rays
O P, O P. For having continued CP till it intersect the Circle
in F, P F shall be always equal to <hi>V f</hi> the Distance of
the Focus of each respective Parcel of Rays O P, from the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex
or Pole of the <hi>Lens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To demonstrate this, draw the prickt line V F, and by what
is delivered by Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> in the aforecited Place, V F and C F,
will be alwayes in the same proposed <hi>ratio.</hi> Again <hi>V f</hi> being
made equal to P F, C F and <hi>C f</hi> will be likewise equal, as are
C P, V C; and the Angles P C <hi>f,</hi> V C F being <hi>ad verticem</hi>
are also equal: Wherefore <hi>P f</hi> will be equal to V F, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<hi>C f</hi> to <hi>P f</hi> in the same <hi>ratio</hi> as C F to V F, whence
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:96102:205"/>
and by what foregoes, the Points <hi>f, f</hi> are the several respective
Foci of the several Parcels of Rays, O P, O P. Q. E. D.</p>
               <p>That C F is to P F in the <hi>ratio</hi> of the Refraction, in
the case of parallel Rays, will be yet more evident, if it be
consider'd, that the Angle at C is equal to the Angle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence,
and the Angle at P to the refracted Angle; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
PF the side opposite to the Angle at C, is as the Sine
of the Angle of Incidence, and C F opposite to the Angle
at P, is as the Sine of the respective refracted Angle; whence
in all Cases of parallel Rays, C F is to P F in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<hi>ratio</hi> of Refraction.</p>
               <p>If it shall be desired to effect in Numbers what we have
here done by Lines, it will be most easie to adapt a Calculus
to the foregoing Geometrical Construction. For if in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
P O C there be given the Radius C P equal to <hi>Unity,</hi>
C O the distance of the Object from the Centre of the Sphere,
and the Perpendicular <hi>P x</hi> equal to the Sine of the Angle P C O,
the side P O = Q R will be equal to <gap reason="math">

                  </gap> Then as Q R or P O to <hi>P x</hi> :: so C R to
the Sine of the Angle C Q R, and the Complement to 180<hi rend="sup">gr.</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s C P O and C Q R is the Angle
C R Q = C F P; and as <hi>P x</hi> to P O so the Sine of the Angle
C R Q to C Q; and as C Q to C P so C R to C F, which
is the distance of the respective Focus of all the Rays P O
from the Centre of the Sphere C.</p>
               <p>But the Foci of Rays parallel to the <hi>Axis</hi> may be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
computed, following the Footsteps of the Construction
delivered in <hi>Coroll. 7. (Tab. 43. Fig. 4, 5.</hi>) for thereby it will
appear, that the Radius of the Circle K F, <hi>viz. a</hi> F, is equal to

but for immerging Rays, as in <hi>Fig. 5, Ca</hi> will be found to

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96102:206"/>
                  <hi>Axis = P x,</hi> in the Case of parallel Rays Emerging, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Focus will be found, P F = <gap reason="math">

                  </gap> C P.
And for immerging Rays, the Focal distance is found by a like
Rule, P F = <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

<gap reason="math">

                  </gap> + C P. These Canons
are so easily deduced from the Constructions, that I shall not
need to trouble the Reader with their Demonstration; only I
shall add two Tables which I computed from them, with little
more work than a continual Addition; which may by way
of Example, serve to instruct and exercise the young Student
in this part of Mathematicks.</p>
