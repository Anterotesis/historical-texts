            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE, CONTAINING A Vindication of the Ancient way of the Parliament OF ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE more Words the more Faults,</hi> is a divine Maxime, that hath put a ſtop to the publiſhing of this ſecond part for ſome time; but obſerving the ordinary humor ſtill drawing off, and paſſing a harſher cenſure upon my intentions in my firſt part, then I expected: I doe proceede to fulfill my courſe, that if cenſure will be, it may be upon better grounds, when the whole matter is before: Herein I ſhall once more minde, that I meddle not with the Theologicall right of Kings, or other Powers, but with the Civill right in fact, now in hand. And becauſe ſome mens Pens of late have ranged into a denyall of the Commons ancient right in the Legiſlative power; and others, even to adnull the right, both of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons therein, reſolving all ſuch power into that one principle of a King, <hi>Quicquid libet, licet</hi>; ſo
<pb facs="tcp:52042:4"/>
making the breach much wider then at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; I ſhall intend my courſe againſt both: As touching the Commons right, jointly with the Lords, it will be the maine end of the whole; but as touching the Commons right, in competition with the Lords, I will firſt endeavour to remove out of the way what I finde publiſhed in a late Tractate concerning that matter, and ſo proceede upon the whole.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of that Diſcourſe conſiſteth of three parts, one to prove that the ancient Parliaments, before the thirteenth Century, conſiſted onely of thoſe whom we now call, the Houſe of Lords; the other, that both the Legiſlative and Judiciall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Parliament reſted wholly in them: laſtly, that Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of Parliament, or the Houſe of Commons, were not knowne nor heard of, till punier times then theſe. This laſt will be granted, <hi>Viz.</hi> That theſe ſeverall titles, of Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, were not known in Parliament till of later times: Nevertheleſſe, it will be inſiſted upon, that the Commons were then there: The ſecond will be granted, but in part, <hi>Viz.</hi> That the Lords had much power in Parliament in point of Juriſdiction, but neither the ſole, nor the whole.</p>
            <p>The firſt is abſolutely denyed, neither is the ſame proved by any one inſtance or pregnant ground in all that Book, and therefore not cleerly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Hiſtories and Records beyond contradiction, as the Title page of that Book doth hold forth to the World. Firſt, becauſe not one inſtance in all that Book is excluſive to the Commons; and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:52042:4"/>
the whole Argument of the Diſcourſe will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>Ab authoritate Negativa,</hi> which is no argument in humane teſtimony at all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the greateſt number of inſtances in that Booke, are by him ſuppoſed to concerne Parliaments, or generall Councils of this Nation, holden by the Repreſentative thereof; whereas indeed they were either but Synodicall Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Church matters, whereunto the poore Commons (he well knoweth) might not come, unleſſe in danger of the Canons dint; or if they did, yet had no other worke there, then to heare, learne, and receive Lawes, from the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks.</hi> And the Lords themſelves, though preſent, yet under no other notion were they, then as Councell to the King; whom they could not caſt out of their Councell till after Ages, though they often endeavoured it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Author of that Tractate alſo well knoweth, that Kings uſually made Grants and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feodations by advice of the Lords, without the ayde of the Parliament: And it is no leſſe true, that Kings, with the Lords, did in their ſeverall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges exerciſe ordinarily Juriſdiction, in caſes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive Juſtice; eſpecially after the <hi>Norman</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance: For the ſtep was eaſie from being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in Warr, to be Lords in peace; but hard to lay downe that power at the foot of Juſtice, which they had uſurped in the rude times of the Sword, when men labour for life rather then liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and no leſſe difficult to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their deportment in commanding of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and governing of Countrey-men; till peace
<pb facs="tcp:52042:5"/>
by continuance had reduced them to a little more ſobriety: Nor doth it ſeeme irrationall, that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate differences betweene party and party, ſhould be determined in a more private way, then to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the whole Repreſentative of the Kingdome, with matters of ſo meane concernment. If then thoſe Councils mentioned by the Author, which concerne the Kings Grants, and Infeodations, and matters of Judicature, be taken from the reſt of the Preſidents, brought by him, to maintaine the thing aimed at; I ſuppoſe ſcarce one ſtone will be left for a foundation to ſuch a glorying Structure, as is pretended in the Title page of that Booke: And yet I deny not, but where ſuch occaſions have befalne the Parliament ſitting, it hath cloſed with them, as things taken up by the way.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It may be that the Author hath alſo obſerved, that all the Records of Antiquity paſſed through (if not from) the hands of the Clergy onely, and they might thinke it ſufficient for them to honour their Writings, with the great Titles of Men of Dignity in the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, omitting the Commons, as not worthy of mention, and yet they might be there then preſent, as it will appeare they were in ſome of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances enſuing, to which we come now in a more punctuall conſideration.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe by his owne words, appeare to be a Church-mote, or Synod; it was in the yeare 673. called by the Arch-Biſhop, who had no more power to ſummon a Parliament, then the Author himſelfe hath: And the ſeverall conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb facs="tcp:52042:5"/>
made therein, doe all ſhew that the people had no worke there, as may appeare in the ſeverall relations thereof, made by <hi>Matthew Weſtminſter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> an Author that he maketh much uſe of, and therefore I ſhall be bold to make the beſt uſe of him that I can likewiſe, in Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the truth of the point in hand: For, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this Councill was, its the leſſe materiall, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Author recites a preſident of King <hi>A<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thelbert,</hi> within ſix yeares after <hi>Auſtins</hi> entry into this Iſland, which was long before this Councill, which bringeth on the Vann of all the reſt of the Opponents inſtances, which King called a Councill, ſtyled, <hi>Commune Concilium tam Cleri quam Populi:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 126.</note> and in the concluſion of the ſame, a Law is made upon the like occaſion, <hi>Si Rex populum Convocaverit, &amp;c.</hi> in both which its evident, that in thoſe times there were Councils holden by the People, as well as the <hi>Magnates,</hi> or <hi>Optimates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next inſtance is in the yeare 694. which is of a Councill holden by the Great Men, but no mention of the Commons, and this he will have to be a Parliament, albeit that he might have found both Abbateſſes, or Women, and Preſbyters, to be Members of that Aſſembly, and (for default of better) atteſted the concluſions of the ſame, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Canon, <hi>Nemo militans Deo, &amp;c.</hi> But I muſt alſo minde him, that the ſame Author reciteth a Councill holden by King <hi>Ina, Suaſu om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Aldermannorum &amp; Seniorum &amp; Sapientum Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>: and is very probable, that all the Wiſe men of the Kingdome, were not concluded within the Lordly dignity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52042:6"/>The third inſtance can have no better ſucceſſe, unleſſe he will have the Pope to be allowed power to call a Parliament, or allow the Arch-Biſhop power to doe that ſervice by the Popes command, for by that authority; this (what ever it be) was called, if we give credit to the relation of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil.

            <p>In the next place, he bringeth in a Councill hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the yeare 747. which (if the Arch-Biſhop were then therein Preſident,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> pa. 242.245.</note> as its ſayd, in the preſence of the King) was no Parliament, but a Church-mote, and all the concluſions in the ſame doe teſtifie no leſſe; they being every one concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eccleſiaſticall matters.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 219.</note>And furthermore, before this time, the Author out of whom he citeth this Councill, mentioneth another Councill holden by <hi>Ina</hi> the Saxon King, in the preſence of the Biſhops, Princes, Lords, Earles, and all the wiſe old Men, and People of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, all of them concluding of the intermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between the <hi>Brittons, Picts,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> which formerly, as it ſeemeth, was not allowed: And the ſame King by his Charter; mentioned by the ſame Penman, noteth that his endowment of the Monaſtry of <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> was made, not onely in the preſence of the Great Men, but, <hi>Cum praeſentia populationis</hi>; and he ſaith, that <hi>Omnes confirmaverunt,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52042:6"/>
which I doe not mention as a worke neceſſary to be done by the Parliament, yet ſuch an one as was holden expedient as the caſe then ſtood.</p>
            <p>Forty yeares after, hee meeteth with another Councill, which he ſuppoſeth to be a Parliament alſo, but was none, unleſſe he will allow the Popes Legate power to ſummon a Parliament: It was holden in the yeare, 787. and had he duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the returne made by the Popes Legate, of the Acts of that Councill, which is alſo publiſhed by the ſame Author, hee might have found,<note place="margin">Pag. 300.</note> that the Legate ſaith, that they were propounded in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Councill, before the King, Arch-Biſhop, and all the Biſhops and Abbots of the Kingdome, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, Dukes, or Captaines, and people of the Land, and they all conſented to keep the ſame.</p>
            <p>Then he brings in a Councill holden in the year, 793. which he would never have ſet downe in the liſt of Parliaments, if he had conſidered how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper it is to conſtrue, <hi>Provinciale tenuit Concilium,</hi> for a Parliament, and therefore I ſhall need no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to trouble the Reader therewith.</p>
            <p>The two next are ſuppoſed to be but one and the ſame; and its ſayd to be holden, <hi>Anno</hi> 974. before nine Kings, fifteene Biſhops, twenty Dukes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which for ought appeares, may comprehend all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is no Parliament of one Nation, but a party of many Nations, for ſome great matter, no doubt, yet nothing in particular mentioned, but the ſolemne laying the foundation of the Monaſtry of <hi>Saint-Albans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What manner of Councill the next was, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not, and therefore nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb facs="tcp:52042:7"/>
therefrom, but that it was holden in the yeare, 796.</p>
            <p>That Councill which is next produced, was in the yeare, 800. and is called in great letters, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium Provinciale,</hi> which he cannot Gramatically conſtrue to be a Parliament; yet in the Preface it is ſayd, that there were, <hi>Viri cujuſcunque dignitatis</hi>; and the King in his Letter to the Pope, ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it,<note place="margin">Pag. 321.</note> 
               <hi>Viſum eſt cunctis gentis noſtrae ſapientibus</hi>; ſo as it ſeemeth by this, and other examples of this nature, that though the Church-motes invented the particular concluſions, yet it was left to the Witagen-mote to Judge and conclude them.</p>
            <p>There can be no queſtion, but the next three Preſidents brought by the Opponent, were all of them Church-motes:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Brit.</hi> Pag. 328.</note> For the firſt of them, which is ſayd to be holden in the yeare, 816. is called a Synod, and both Preiſts and Deacons were there preſent, which are no Members of Parliament, conſiſting onely of the Houſe of Lords, and they all of them did, <hi>Pariter tractare de neceſſarijs &amp; uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatibus Eccleſiarum.</hi> The ſecond of them is called a Synodall Councill, holden, <hi>Anno</hi> 822. and yet there were then preſent, <hi>Omnium dignitatum opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,</hi> which cannot be underſtood onely of thoſe of the Houſe of Lords, becauſe they ought all to be perſonally preſent, and therefore there is no Optimacy amongſt them. The laſt of theſe three is called, <hi>Synodale Conciliabulum,</hi> a petty Synod in great letters;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Brit.</hi> Pag. 334.</note> and beſides, there were with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Abbots, many Wiſe men; and in all theſe reſpects it cannot be a Parliament onely of the great Lords.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52042:7"/>The next Councill ſaid to be holden in the yeare 823. cannot alſo be called properly a Parliament, but onely a conſultation, between two Kings and their Councill, to prevent the invaſion of the Danes; and the atteſts of the Kings Chapplain, and his Scribe, doe ſhew alſo that they were not all Members of the Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>The Councill cited by the Opponent in the next place, was holden, An: 838. being onely in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Councill for Law, or Judicature, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the validity of the Kings Grant made to the Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; which is no proper worke for a Parliament, unleſſe it befall during the fitting of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The next is but a bare title of a Councill ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be holden, An. 850. And not worth its room, for it neither ſheweth whether any thing was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, nor what the concluſions were.</p>
            <p>The worke of the next Councill alleadged to be holden, An. 851. was to confirme the Charter of the Monaſtry of <hi>Croyland,</hi> and to determine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affaires belonging to the <hi>Mercinies</hi> and if it had beene a Parliament for that people, it might be worthy of inquiry how regularly the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors from the Weſt Saxons could ſit amongſt them and atteſt the concluſions therein made, as wel as the proper members of that Nation.</p>
            <p>He commeth in the next place to a Councill hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the yeare, 855. which is more likely to be a Parliament then moſt of them formerly mentioned; if the Tithes of all <hi>England</hi> were therein given to the Church, but hereof I have ſet downe my opinion in
<pb facs="tcp:52042:8"/>
the former part of the diſcourſe. And though it be true, that no Knights and Burgeſſes are therein mentioned, as the Opponent obſerveth out of the Title; yet if the body of the Lawes be duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, towards the concluſion thereof it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that there was preſent, <hi>Fidelium infinita mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo qui omnes regium Chirographum Laudaverunt Dignitates vero ſua nomina ſubſcripſerunt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Brit.</hi> Pag. 350.</note> And yet the Witagen-motes in theſe times began to be rare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually inrerrupted by the invaſions of the Danes.</p>
            <p>The three next Councills alleaged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be in the yeares 930. 944. 948. Were doubtleſſe of inferiour value, as the matters therin concluded were of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour regard, being ſuch as concerne the paſſing of the Kings Grants, Infeodations, and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>The Councill mentioned to be in the yeare 965. is ſuppoſed to be one and the ſame with the next foregoing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Brit.</hi> Pag. 480.</note> by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> which calls it ſelfe a generall Councill, not by reaſon of the generall confluence of the Lords and Laity, but becauſe all the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> did then meet. The <hi>Primi</hi> and <hi>Primates</hi> were there, who theſe were is not mentioned; but its evident that the King of Scots was there, and that both he and diverſe that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Miniſtri Regis,</hi> atteſted the concluſions: It will be difficult to make out how theſe ſhould be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe of Lords, and more difficult to ſhew a reaſon why in the atteſting of the acts of theſe Councills which the Opponent calls Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we finde ſo few of the Laity that ſcarce twelve are mentioned in any one of them, and
<pb facs="tcp:52042:8"/>
thoſe to deſcend ſo low as the <hi>Miniſtri Regis,</hi> to make up the number.</p>
            <p>Five more of theſe inſtances remaine, before the comming in of the <hi>Normans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of which was in the yeare 975. and in a time when no Parliament,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Britt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Pag. 490.</note> according to the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents principles could ſit, for it was an <hi>Inter reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two next were onely Synods to determine the difference between the Regulers, and the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, in the Kings abſence, by reaſon that he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age; and they are ſayd to be in the yeares 977 and 1009. But its not within the compaſſe of my matter to debate their dates.</p>
            <p>The laſt two were Meetings or Courts for Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, to determine the crime of Treaſon, which every one knowes is determinable by inferiour Courts before the high Steward or Judges, and therefore not ſo peculiar to a Parliament, as to be made an argument of its exiſtence. And thus are we at an end of all the inſtances brought by the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, to prove that Parliaments before the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> times conſiſted of thoſe whom we now call the Houſe of Lords. All which I ſhall ſhut up with two other notes taken out of the Book of Councils, publiſhed by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of which concerneth a Grant made by <hi>Canutus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 534.</note> of an exemption to the Abby of <hi>Bury</hi> Saint <hi>Edmonds,</hi> in a Councill wherein, were preſent Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Dukes, Earles. <hi>Cum quamplurimis gregariis militibus, cum populi multitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne copioſa votis regiis unanimiter conſentientes.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken out of the confeſſors Lawes, which tells
<pb facs="tcp:52042:9"/>
us that Tithes were granted to the Church, <hi>A Rege Baronibus &amp; populo.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 621.</note> And thus ſhall leave theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to debate with one another, whiles the Reader may judge as ſeemeth moſt equall to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Being thus come to the <hi>Norman</hi> times, and thoſe enſuing; I ſhall more ſummarily proceed with the particulars concerning them, becauſe they were times of force, and can give little or no evidence againſt the cuſtomes rightly ſetled in the Saxon times, which I have more particularly inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the originall conſtitution of this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may the better appeare. Now for the more ſpeedy manifeſting of the truth in the particulars following; I ſhall pre-adviſe the Reader in three particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the Church-motes grew more in power and honor, by the aide of the <hi>Normans</hi> Law, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the concurrence and perſonall preſence of Kings, whom at length they excluded from their Councils with all his Nobles; and therefore it is the leſſe wonder if we heare but little of the Commons joyning with them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the <hi>Norman</hi> way of government grew more Ariſtocraticall then the Saxon, making the Lords the cheif Inſtruments of keeping Kings above and people underneath, &amp; thus we meet with much noiſe of meetings betweene the King and Lords, and little concerning the grand meetings of the Kings, and the repreſentative of the people; although ſome footſteps wee finde even of them alſo. For Kings were miſtaken in the Lords; who meaned nothing leſſe then to ſerve them with the peoples
<pb facs="tcp:52042:9"/>
liberties, together with their owne which they ſaw wrapped up in the groſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by this meanes the Councils of the King and Lords grew potent, not onely for adviſe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſions, but in matters of judicature, and declaring of Law, ordering of proceſſe in Courts of Plees; which in the firſt framing were the workes of Wiſe and Learned men, but being once ſetled become part of the liberties of every Free-man. And it is not to be doubted but theſe Councills of Lords did outreach into things two great for them to mannage, and kept the Commons out of poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their right, during the preſent heat of their ruffling condition, yet all this while could not take abſolute poſſeſſion of the legiſlative power.</p>
            <p>I now come to the remainder of the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances produced by the Opponent, which I ſhall reduce into ſeverall Categories, for the more cleere ſatisfaction to the Reader, with leſſe tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it cannot be denied but the Councill of Lords gave adviſe to Kings in caſes of particular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergency, nor is it incongruous to the courſe of government even to this day, nor meete that the Parliament ſhould be troubled with every ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and therefore the giving of adviſe to <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, what courſe he ſhould take to ſettle the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> according to the inſtances in Councills holden, An: 1060. And 1070. And to gaine favour of the great men according to that in An: 1106. and in the manner of endowment of the Abby of <hi>Battell,</hi> as in pag: 25. of the Opponents diſcourſe: and what to do upon the reading of the
<pb facs="tcp:52042:10"/>
Popes Letter, according to that in An: 1114. And whether the Popes Legate ſhould be admitted, as in pag. 18. And how King <hi>Steven</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> ſhall come to agreement, as An: 1153. And how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Lawes by Judges and Juſtices <hi>Itinerant,</hi> as An: 1176. And touching the manner of ingageing for a voyage by <hi>Croiſado</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> An: 1189. And to give anſwer to Embaſſadors of a forraine Prince, pag. 25. And how King <hi>John</hi> ſhall conclude peace with the Pope, An: 1213. Where never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe <hi>Math. Paris</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> was <hi>Turba multa nimis:</hi> I ſay all theſe might well be done by a Councell of Lords, and not in any poſture of a Parliament; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that in none of all theſe doth any thing appeare but that the Commons might be preſent in every one, or many of them all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as touching judicature, the Lords had much power therein, even in the Saxon times, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better opportunites for Knowledge, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially joyned with the Clergy, then the Commons in thoſe times of deep darkneſſe, wherein even the Clergy wanted not their ſhare, as in the firſt part of the diſcourſe I have already obſerved. Whatſoever then might be done by Judges in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courts of judicature, is inferiour to the regard of the Parliament; and therefore the Plea between the Arch-Biſhop and <hi>Aethelſtan,</hi> concerning Land, inſtanced, An: 1070. And betweene <hi>Lanfranke</hi> and <hi>Odo, An:</hi> 1071. <hi>and betweene the King and Anſelme, pag:</hi> 15, 16. and the determining of Treaſon <hi>of John</hi> (afterwards King) againſt his Lord and King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> pag: 23. And the difference concerning the title of a <hi>Barony</hi> between <hi>Mowbray</hi> and <hi>Scotvile,</hi> pag:
<pb facs="tcp:52042:10"/>
25. And giving of ſecurity of good behaviour by <hi>William Brawſe</hi> to King <hi>John,</hi> pag. 26. All theſe might well be determined onely before the Lords, and yet the Parliament might be then ſitting or not ſitting, as the contrary to either doth not appeare, and therefore can theſe forme no demonſtrative ground to prove that the Parliament conſiſted in thoſe times, onely of ſuch as we now call the Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>A third worke whereby the Opponent would prove the Parliament to conſiſt onely of the Houſe of Lords, is, becauſe hee findeth many things by them concluded touching the ſolemnization, and the ſettling of the ſucceſſion of Kings; both which, he ſaith, were done by the Lords in Parliament, or thoſe of that Houſe; and I ſhall crave leave to conclude the contrary: For neither is the election, or Solemnization of ſuch election, a proper worke of the Parliament, according to the Opponents principles, nor can they prove ſuch Conventions, wherein they were to be Parliaments. Not the election of Kings, for then may a Parliament be without a King; and therefore that inſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>William Rufus, page</hi> 16. will faile, or the Opponents principles, who will have no Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without a King.</p>
            <p>The like may alſo be ſayde of the inſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning King <hi>Steven, page</hi> 18. Much leſſe can the ſolemnization of the election by Coronation, be a proper worke for the Parliament: Nevertheleſſe the Opponent doth well know that both the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a King, and the ſolemnization of ſuch ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by Coronation, are Spiritleſſe motions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:52042:11"/>
the preſence of the people; and therefore though his inſtance, <hi>page</hi> 17. concerning the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, by the Biſhops and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, may ſeeme to be reſtrictive as to them, yet it is not ſuch in fact; if <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> may be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, who telleth us, that in the <hi>Conventus omnium,</hi> was <hi>Clerus</hi> and <hi>Populus univerſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Seldens Title of Honor.</note> and might have been noted by the Opponent out of that <hi>Learned Antiquary,</hi> ſo often by him cited, if he had pleaſed to take notice of ſuch matters.</p>
            <p>A fourth ſort of Inſtances, concerneth matters Eccleſiaſticall, and making of Canons; and hereof enough hath been already ſayd, that ſuch worke was abſolutely challenged by the Church-motes, as their proper worke; and therefore the Inſtance, <hi>page</hi> 16, 17. of the Councill in <hi>Henry</hi> the firſts time, and the Canons made by the Biſhops there; and that other called by <hi>Theobald</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and inſtanced by the Opponent, <hi>page</hi> 19. I ſay, both theſe doe faile in the concluſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, As touching the moſt proper worke of Parliaments, which is, the making of Lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the liberties and benefit of the people; the Opponent produceth not one inſtance concerning the ſame, which doth not conclude contrary to his propoſall; for as touching thoſe two inſtances in his thirteenth page, <hi>Anno</hi> 1060. they concerne not the making of Lawes, but the reviving of ſuch as had been diſuſed formerly, which might well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be done by private Councell. But as to that in his fifteenth page, of the Law made by the Conquerour, concerning <hi>Remigius,</hi> Biſhop of
<pb facs="tcp:52042:11"/>
               <hi>Lincolne,</hi> although it be true, that wee finde not the particular titles of Knights, Citizens, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, yet beſides the Councill of Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbats, and Princes, we finde the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councill; for ſo the words are, <hi>Communi Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio, &amp; Concilio Archiepiſcopus, Epiſcopus, Abatus, &amp; omnium Principum,</hi> although the Opponent would ſeeme to wave theſe words, <hi>Et Concilio,</hi> but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in a ſmall Character, and the reſt in a voluminous Letter, that the Readers eyes might be filled with them and overlook the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as to the inſtance of the Councill at <hi>Clarindon,</hi> in his nineteenth <hi>page,</hi> which he citeth out of <hi>Matthew Paris, Matthew Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>Hoveden,</hi> although he pleaſeth to mention the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall rankes of Great Men, and thoſe in blacke Letters of a greater ſize; and ſaith, That not one Commoner appeares, yet Maſter <hi>Seldens Hoveden,</hi> in that very place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit. Honor,</hi> Pag. 703.</note> ſo often by the Opponent ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, tells him, that both <hi>Clerus</hi> and <hi>Populus</hi> were there.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Opponent citeth an inſtance of Lawes made by <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, in his twenty fourth <hi>page,</hi> and hee ſetteth downe the ſeverall ranks of Great Men, and amongſt the reſt, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly mentioneth, <hi>Milites,</hi> but it is with a Gloſſe of his owne, that they were Barons that were made Knights, when as formerly Barons were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the generall, and therefore how proper this Gloſſe is, let others judge; eſpecially ſeeing that not onely <hi>Milites,</hi> and <hi>Milites Gregorij,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Miniſtri,</hi> were preſent in ſuch conventions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Saxon times: And Maſter <hi>Selden</hi> in the

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, He citeth in his twenty fifth <hi>page,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other inſtance in King <hi>Johns</hi> time, in which, after the aſſent of Earles, and Barons, the words, <hi>Et om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium fidelium noſtrorum,</hi> are alſo annexed, but with this conceit of the Opponents, that theſe <hi>Fideles</hi> were thoſe that adhered to the King, againſt his enemies; be it ſo, for then the Commons were preſent, and did aſſent; or they may be, ſaith he, ſome ſpecially ſummoned as Aſſiſtants; take that alſo, and then all the true hearted in the Kingdome were ſpecially ſummoned and were there, ſo as the concluſion will be the ſame.</p>
            <p>In the fifth place, hee citeth a ſtrange Preſident (as he calls it) of a Writt of Summons in King <hi>Johns</hi> time, in his twenty ſeventh <hi>page,</hi> wherein <hi>Omnes miletes</hi> were ſummoned, <hi>Cum armis ſuis,</hi> and he concludes therefore the ſame was a Councell of Warr.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe they were to come armed, its very true, and ſo they did unto the Councills in the ancient Saxon times, and ſo the Knights of the Counties ought to doe in theſe dayes, if they obey the Writte, <hi>Duos Milites gladijs cinctas, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He ſaith, That the Knights were not to come to Councill; that is his opinion, yet the Writt ſpeakes, that the <hi>Diſcreti Milites</hi> were to come, <hi>Ad loquendum cum Rege ad negotijs regni:</hi> Its true, ſaith hee, but not, <hi>Ad tractandum &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendum

            <p>The ſixth and laſt inſtance mentioned by the Opponent, is in his thirtieth <hi>page,</hi> and concerneth Eſcuage granted to King <hi>John,</hi> who by his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter granted, that in ſuch caſes he would ſummon Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Earles, and the greater Barons, unto ſuch Conventions by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Writts, and that the Sheriffe ſhall ſummon promiſcuouſly all others which hold in <hi>Capite</hi>; and thence hee concludes, That none but the Great Lords, and the Tenants in <hi>Capite</hi> (whom he calls the leſſer Barons) were preſent, but no Knights, Citizens, or Burgeſſes; all which being granted, yet in full Parliament the Citizens and Burgeſſes might be there. For Councills were called of ſuch perſons as ſuited to the matter to be debated upon.</p>
            <p>If for matters purely Eccleſiaſticall, the King and his Councell of Lords, and the Church-men made up the Councill.</p>
            <p>If for advice in immergencies, the King and ſuch Lords as were next at hand determined the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
            <p>If for Eſcuage, the King and ſuch as were to pay Eſcuage, made up a Councill to aſcertaine the ſum, which was otherwiſe uncertaine.</p>
            <p>If for matters that concerned the common li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, all ſorts were preſent,<note place="margin">Littlet. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> as may appeare out

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Opponent takes that for granted that never will be, <hi>Viz.</hi> That all the Kings Tenants <hi>In Capite,</hi> were of the Houſe of Lords; when as himſelfe acknowledgeth a difference, <hi>page</hi> 28. <hi>Viz.</hi> That the Barons are ſummoned by Writs, <hi>Sigilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> as all the Members of the Houſe of Lords are, but theſe are by generall ſummons, their number great, and hard it will be to underſtand, how, or when, they came to be excluded from that Society.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſiſt no further upon the particulars of this Tractate, but demurr upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and leave it to judgement upon the premiſes, which might have beene much better reduced to the maine concluſion, if the Opponent, in the firſt place, had defined the word <hi>PARLIAMENT:</hi> For if it was a Convention without the People, and ſometimes without the <hi>KING,</hi> as in the Caſes formerly mentioned, of the Elections of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and of <hi>King Steven:</hi> And if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Parliament of Lords onely, may be againſt the King, and ſo without King or People; as in the Caſe betweene <hi>Steven</hi> and <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:52042:13"/>
and the caſe likewiſe concerning King <hi>John,</hi> both which alſo were formerly mentioned; poſſibly it may be thought as rationall for the Commons in after Ages, to hold a Parliament without King, or Houſe of Lords; and then all the Opponents la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is to little purpoſe.</p>

            <p>Hence forward, for the ſpace of three hundred yeares next enſuing, Kings by experience and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, finding themſelves unequall to the double chace of abſolute Supremacy, over the Sturdy Laity, and incroaching Clergy; you will obſerve, to lay aſide their pretentions againſt the peoples Liberties, and more inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to trench upon the Spiritualty, now growne to defie all Government, but that of Covetouſneſſe.</p>

            <p>It will be ſuperfluous to recount the particular atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments formerly attained by theſe Eccleſiaſticall men; the former Treatiſe hath already ſayd what was thought need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full concerning that: For the future, I ſhall even premiſe this, That the inſuing times being thus bleſſed with a truce, or ſtricter League between Kings and Commons; the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in Government more readily doe appeare; the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in natures of men more frequently diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and thereby the body of the Statute-Lawes begin to ſwell ſo bigg, that I muſt be inforced to contract my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them into a narrower compaſſe; and render the ſame unto the Reader, ſo farr forth onely as they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the generall ſtreame of Government; leaving thoſe of privater regard, unto every mans particular conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as occaſion ſhall lead him: For what ever other men pleaſe to inſiſt upon, this I take for a Maxime, <hi>That though the Government of a King is declared by his actions, yet the Government of a Kingdome is onely manifeſted by ancient Cuſtomes, and publique Acts of Parliament.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. I. A ſumm of the ſeverall Reignes of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second.</head>
               <p>SEverall I may well call them, becauſe they are the moſt different in their wayes and ends, of any two of that race, that ever ſwayed their Scepter; and yet the entrance of the firſt gave countenance to the concluſion of the laſt. For the Scepter being caſt away, or loſt by <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, it was the Lot of his Son, <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, a Youth of fifteen yeares of age, to take it up; he knowing whoſe it was, and feeling it too heavy for him, was willing enough it ſhould returne; but being overſwayed by Councels drawn from reaſon of State, and preſſed thereto by thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to truſt his Father any more, he wiſely choſe to manage it himſelfe, rather then to adventure it in another hand; but that is not all, for as its never ſeene that the Crowne doth thrive after Divorce from the Scepter, but like a blaſted bloſſome, falls off at the next gale of adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſuch was the iſſue to <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, his Power once gone, his Honour followed ſoon after, he had ceaſed to be King, and within a ſmall time did ceaſe to be <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Son, thus made compleate by his Fathers ſpoyle, had the honour to be the Repairer of the ruines that his Father had made; and was a Prince which you might thinke by his ſtory, to be ſeldome at home, and by his Lawes ſeldome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; nor can it be reconciled without wonder, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52042:16"/>
ſhould at once beſtow upon <hi>England,</hi> a couragious People, brave Captaines, wiſe Councell, and a King that had the endowments of them all. Otherwiſe it had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached conceit it ſelfe, that this ſmall Iſland, waſted by the Barons Warrs, the people beaten out of heart by all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, in the time of the Father, ſhould nevertheleſſe in the time of the Son, with honour, wade through ſo many difficulties of mighty Warrs on every ſide abroad, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Peſtilence at home; and yet lay a platforme of an Epulent, wiſe, and peaceable Government, for future Generations.</p>
               <p>Yet hee had his failings and misfortunes, a great part whereof may be attributed to infirmity of Age; which in the firſt part of his Reigne was too little, and in the later part too much. True it is, that Governours of the Perſons of Kings, may in ſome meaſure ſupply defects of Non-age, but ſeldome where the Governours are many, and never if they be ambitious: And it was this Kings fate to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in both; for he had in his Youth twelve Governours by conſtitution, and they, two ſupreame by uſurpation, <hi>Viz.</hi> The Queen and <hi>Mortimer,</hi> till they were both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in the flame which themſelves had kindled. And this diſparity wrought ſomewhat unſucceſſefully in the Kings firſt Warr: For the generoſity of his ſpirit (himſelfe being young and active) minded his Councell to adviſe him imployment in a Forraine Warr, rather then they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture its motion at home, leaſt it might prove circular, which is moſt dangerous for Government, if the Prince be not under command of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>This firſt Warr was with <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe power was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to that of <hi>France</hi>; the King young, and the danger neerer; and therefore though the laſt affront was from <hi>France,</hi> that more freſh in memory, and more peinant; yet the King was adviſed to give place, and ſpeake faire, till he had tryed maſteries with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thereby ſecured his Rere: This he wiſely hearkened unto, and met with ſuch a ſucceſſefull turne of Providence, that like an <hi>O Yes</hi> before
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52042:16"/>
a Proclamation gives warning to <hi>Scotland</hi> that the Wheele is turned upon them; and that there is ſomewhat more then humane motion in the matter, that exaſperates the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> upon an enterprize, ſo often croſſed by Providence hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto; and the King alſo (being but a Souldier in hope as yet) to dare againſt thoſe that had ſo ſhamefully foyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Father, and alſo put himſelfe already once to the Retreat.</p>
               <p>And yet there did concurr a kinde of neceſſity of ſecond Cauſes; for, the King found the Crowne ingaged, and the minds of the <hi>Scots</hi> ſo elate, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mans caſe was not to live to Fight, but to Fight to live; and ſo imbittered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another by the fierce Warrs under the Barrons, that nothing could quench the fire, but the withdrawing of the Brands into Forraine action, like ſome angry ſpirits that ſpoyle their owne bodyes, unleſſe they chide or fight it out with others.</p>
               <p>In the firſt brunt with <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King gained nothing, but underſtanding of the humours of ſome of his great Lords; which once purged out, he renues the Warr, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes, and after ten yeares ſtirr (wherein hee became a trained Souldier againſt the <hi>Scots</hi>) hee wann the Croſſe, and then goes to play his Prize in <hi>France,</hi> to compleat his Crowne with the Flower <hi>De lis:</hi> Which was the great worke of the reſt of his Reigne; in which foure parts of five was Victorious; the fifth and laſt, was declining like ſome Gameſters, that winn at the firſt, and for want of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the turning of the Dice, come off looſers at the end.</p>
               <p>For the King being rather ſatiated then ſatisfied with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and Honour, returned home to enjoy what he had, leaving his Son, the Black Prince, to purſue the Warr, and to act the Souldiers alone, who now began to honour his Valour above his Fathers. But, the Tyde is ſpent, the Prince of Chivalry dyes, the brave Commanders waſted; and the <hi>French</hi> too fickle to continue ſubject to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> longer then needs muſt, tack about for another Adventure, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52042:17"/>
make it plaine, that <hi>France</hi> is too bigg to be Garriſon'd by <hi>England,</hi> and that it will coſt <hi>England</hi> more to hold it then to have it.</p>
               <p>His Religion was more to the purpoſe, then of any of his Predeceſſors ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> times; he reflected upon God in common events,<note place="margin">Antiq.

               <p>His cheife policy at home, was, to be much at home, great with his People, and they great with him; what the Parliament did, he accounted well done; he never queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Power, though he was over-reached in queſtioning their Wiſedome: For he that ſhall preferr his owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome above that of the Parliament, muſt needs thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe extreamly Wiſe; and ſo much the more, to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ſuch: But the worſt of his fate was, to live to his Winter age, and after fifty yeares Reigne, or more, to dye in his minority under the rule of a Woman of none of the beſt fame, after hee had ſo long enjoyed the honour of greateſt note in the Chriſtian World, in his dayes.</p>

               <p>Religion now began to dawne through the foggs of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh uſurpations and ſuperſtitions, ayded thereto by a Sciſme in the triple Crowne, that continued forty yeares, with much virulency abroad, and with as bad influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Myters at home: Some of whom were called <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentines,</hi> others <hi>

The Laity, though lookers on, yet were not quiet: For though Liberty be a hopefull thing, yet its dangerous to them that are not a Law to themſelves; eſpecially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Opinion; for that arraines the rule, and layes the way open to licentiouſneſſe. And now that the Liberty from the Keyes began to be taught as a duty of Religion, the inferiour ſort meet with Doctrines of licentiouſneſſe, upon miſtake of the notion, and will acknowledge no rule now they muſt be all at liberty: and thus ſprang up the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Servants and Bond-men againſt their Lords and Maſters, under <hi>Cade</hi> and <hi>Strawe</hi>; that might have brought the Common wealth into a hideous <hi>Chaos,</hi> had not the Lords and Great Men betimes beſtirred themſelves; and the King ſhewed an extraordinary ſpirit, or rather a kinde of rage, that put it ſelfe forth beyond the ordinary temper of his minde.

               <p>The Kings minority rendred him unequall unto theſe contrary motions; he was in his eleventh yeare, when he entred the Throne; and (which was worſe) his yeares came on faſter then his Parts, but his worke poſted before them all. The common helpe of Protectors left him yet more unhappy, for they were prepoſſeſſed with ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of particular Intereſts; and ſo were eyther not wiſe enough, or not good enough for all. This brought forth a third inconvenience, the change of Protectorſhip; and that change of Affaires and Intereſts, an uncertaine good that brings forth a certaine evill; for variety of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and Intereſts move ſeverall wayes, and though the end be one; the difference concerning the way, many times, doth as much hinder the Journey, as ſo many blocks in the way.</p>
               <p>The Protectorſhip was thrice changed, the Kings Unkles had the firſt eſſay; any one of them was bigg enough for one Kingdome, but all of them together were too great to make one Protector. The Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> would have done well alone, if he had been alone, and that work alone; but he being ſomewhat ingaged with the <hi>Wickleiffiſts,</hi> and ſo intangled with the Clergy, and other reſtleſſe ſpirits, and drawne off by his private ayme at the Crowne of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> ſaw this worke too much, and ſo he warily withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, leaving the Directory to a Committee of Lords, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraine Plaiſter, queſtionleſſe, where the times are whole, but not for theſe diſtractions, wherein even the Committee it ſelfe ſuffered its ſhare: Thus the breach is made the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and for a cure of all, the Government is committed into one hand, wherein the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> acquitted himſelfe well, for he was wiſe enough to obſerve ſuch as the people moſt honoured: And thus paſſed over the two firſt yeares of the Kings Reigne.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the Kings minority, was rather in common repute then in true account: For the King, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

young, took little more from the Protector, then he ſaw meet to collour his own commands with opinion of Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and ſo his will came to full ſtrength before his wiſdome budded. Thus lifted up, he ſets himſelf above all intereſts of Parliament, Protectors, Councellors, Unkles, wiſe, Men and Law; leaving them all to be rules for thoſe below. And ſo long as the Kings deſire is thus ſerved, he is content to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a Minor, and be as it were under protection of others, though not under their direction; and is content to continue thus untill his two and twentieth year: Some might thinke him very moderate, had hee been moderate; but he forbears ſuing out his Livery ſo long as he may live without care, and ſpend without controll: For by this time the humour of his great Grand-father budded in him; he pawned his heart to young men of vaſt deſires, and ſome ſay ſo inordinately, as he proſtituted his chaſtitie unto them.

A Parliament therefore is called; in which diverſe Lords aſſociate,<note place="margin">11.

               <p>It was an Act of Parliament that gave power to fourteen Lords and others, to regulate the Profits and Revenues of the Crowne, and to doe Juſtice to the People; this was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for one whole yeare. The Paraſites no ſooner found the effect hereof to their Coſt, but the King growes ſicke of it, and findes an Antidote to over-rule Acts of Parliament, by Acts of Privy Councell, declares this ill-favoured Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion voide; and the Contrivers, Adviſers, and Inforcers, Traytors. To make it more Majeſticall, he cauſeth the Judges to Subſcribe this Order, and ſo it becomes Law in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. This foundation thus laid, he buildeth in haſt an Impeachment of theſe Commiſſioners of high Treaſon; and

ſuppoſing that they would not readily ſtoope, himſelfe ſtoopes lower; for he would put his Right to triall by battell, which was already his owne, by the judgement of the Maſters of the Law: For ſo they may be well called, ſeeing they had thus Maſtered it. In this the King had the worſt, for he loſt his Honour and himſelfe: (God hath a care of common right even amongſt Idolaters.) Then comes the Parliament of Wonders, wherein the Kings Party are declared Traytors, and the chiefe Judges with their Law, judged by another Law. The King not medled with, thinks it high time to come out of his Minority, and aſſumes the Government of the Kingdome and himſelfe, to himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now three and twenty yeares of age; old enough to have done well if he had cared for it: But reſolving to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the way of his owne will, at length it led him to his owne ruine: onely for the preſent two things delayed it, <hi>Viz.</hi> The Authority, Wiſedome, and Moderation of his Unckles, eſpecially of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> now come out of <hi>Spain</hi>; and the great affection which the King pretended to the Queen, who had alſo gained a good opinion amongſt the People: The benevolent aſpect of the People, not for their owne advantage, but for the Publick quiet, procured many Parlies and interviewes between the King and People, and many Lawes for the upholding of the Court and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, although both Warre, Lawes, Juſtice, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, all are faint, as all is faint in that man that hath once diſmanned himſelf. This he perceives well enough, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Peace he muſt have by any means. The Queen dies, himſelfe being nigh eight and twenty yeares old, takes a Creature like a Wife, but in truth a Childe of eight yeares old, and this is to get Peace with <hi>France.</hi> Its no wonder if now he hunts after unlawfull game, and that being ill taken brings all things out of order (<hi>For abuſed Marriage never wants woe:</hi>) Civill men are now looked upon as <hi>ſevere Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>; and his Unckles, eſpecially the <hi>Duke of Gloceſter</hi> with a jealous eye, which accompliſhed his death in the concluſion. <hi>The Dukes of Lancaſter and Yorke forſake the Court,</hi> Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites

The Pardon of the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> is adnulled, contrary to the adviſe of the major part, and the <hi>Arch Biſhop,</hi> the Earles brother is baniſhed. The Lords for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the wilfull King, ſtill the Kings jealouſie ſwells; The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Hertford</hi> is baniſhed, or rather by a hidden Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſent out of the way for a further worke. The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> dies, and with him all hope of moderation is gone, for he was a wiſe Prince, and the onely Cement that held the joynts of the Kingdome in correſpondency. And he was ill requited, for all his Eſtate is ſeiſed upon. The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Hertford,</hi> and his Party are looked upon by the People as Martyrs in the Common Cauſe, and others as Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts; Extremities haſten on, and Prerogative now upon the wing is towering above reach. In full Parliament downe goes all the worke of the tenth and eleventh yeares Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had never bin, if that Parliament had continued by adjournment. The King raiſeth a Power which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his Cuard, of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> men; under the terror of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing rod,<note place="margin">21.

The Kings Conſcience whiſpers a ſad Meſſage of dethroning, and well it might be, for he knew he had deſerved it.

               <p>But the King was not thus quiet, the ſting of guilt ſtill ſticks within, and for remedy he will unlaw the Law; and gets it enacted, that all Procurers of the Statute of 10. <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and the Commiſſion and Procurers of the Kings
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52042:20"/>
aſſent thereto, and hinderers of the Kings proceedings, are adjudged Traitors. All theſe reach onely the branches, the root remains yet, and may ſpring again; and therefore in the laſt place, have at the Parliament it ſelf: For by the ſame its further declared, That the King is the ſole Maſter of the Propoſitions for matters to be treated in Parliament, and all gainſayers are Traitors.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the King may diſſolve the Parliament at his pleaſure, and all gainſayers are Traitors.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the Parliament may not proceed againſt the Kings Juſtices, for offences by them committed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without the Kings conſent, and all gainſayers are Traitors. Theſe and the like Aphoriſmes once Voted by the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> men, aſſented unto by the Parliament, with the Kings <hi>Fiat,</hi> muſt paſſe for currant to the Judges, and if by them confirmed or allowed, will in the Kings opinion make it a Law for ever, That the King and all Parliaments is <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus fac primum,</hi> and <hi>Dominus fac totum.</hi> But the Judges remembred the tenth yeare, and <hi>Belknaps</hi> intertainment, and ſo dealt warily; their opinion is thus ſet down, <hi>It belongeth to the Parliament to declare Treaſon, yet if I were a Peere, and were commanded, I ſhould agree:</hi> So did <hi>Thorning</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-write, and thereunto alſo conſented <hi>Rickill,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Clopton,</hi> the laſt being chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench, the firſt chief Juſtice of the Common-Pleas, and the ſecond another Judge of the ſame Bench. The ſumme in plainer ſenſe is, that if they were Peeres, they would agree; but as Judges, they will be ſilent. And thus the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> by the firſt of theſe foure laſt mentioned conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions attainted themſelves; by the ſecond yeilded up their liberties, by the third their lives, and by the laſt, would have done more, or been leſſe: And to fill up the meaſure of all, they aſſigned over a right of Legiſlative Power unto ſix Lords and three Commons, and yet the King not content, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded, that it ſhould be Treaſon for any man to indeavor to repeal any of their determinations.</p>
               <p>The Common-wealth thus underneath, the King tramples
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52042:20"/>
upon all at once; for having eſpied the ſhadow of a Crown fleeting from him in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he purſues it, leaves the noble Crown of <hi>England</hi> in the baſe condition of a Farme, ſubject to ſtrip and waſte by mean men; and croſſes the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Seas, with an Army. This was one of <hi>Englands</hi> Climactericall years, under a diſeaſe ſo deſperate, that no hope was left but by a deſperate Cure, by ſudden bleeding in the head, and cutting off that Member that is a principle of motion in the Body: For it was not many moneths ere the winde of affaires chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the King now in <hi>Ireland,</hi> another ſteps into the Throne; the noiſe hereof makes him return, afarr of inraged: but the nigher he comes the cooler he growes, his conſcience revives, his courage decayes, and leaving his Army, his Lordſhip, Kingdome, and Libertie, behinde, as a naked man ſubmits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to releaſe all homage and fealtie; to reſigne his Crown and Dignitie, his Titles and Authoritie; to acknowledge himſelf unworthy and inſufficient to reign; to ſwear never to repent of his Reſignation; &amp; thus if he will have any quiet, this wilfull man, he muſt be content for the future, neither to will nor deſire: And poore <hi>England</hi> muſt for a time bee contented with a dolefull condition, in which the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rule, and the Parliament will not, and the whole body like a Chäos capable of any form that the next daring ſpirit ſhall brood upon it.</p>

               <p>A King in Parliament is like the firſt-born of <hi>Jacob, The excellencie of Dignitie, and the excellencie of Power,</hi> but alone unſtable as water: Examples of both theſe we have in theſe two Kings, <hi>Whereof the firſt was Crowned by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Crowned it; the latter alſo Crowned it, but with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52042:21"/>
Thornes; and yet the Parliament in all held on that wiſe way, that it neither exceeded its own bounds, nor loſt its own right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall enter into the conſideration of particulars under theſe heads: Firſt, <hi>In relation more immediately to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the King</hi>: Secondly, <hi>To the intereſt of the Kingdome in generall.</hi> The King, though higher then all the people by the head, and ſo hath the Prerogative of Honour as the moſt worthy, yet his ſtrength and abilities originally doe riſe from beneath, otherwiſe, he is but like a Generall without an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the Title big, but aiery; and many times his perſon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſo much danger, that in ſtead of drawing the eyes of all the people to look upon him with admiration, they are drawn to look to him with obſervation, and in this reſpect he may be ſaid to be leſſe his own man, and more the Kingdomes then any of the inferiour ſort. This befell in both theſe Kings in a ſpeciall manner; each entering upon the grand govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Kingdome before they were able to underſtand the work, or govern themſelves: and therefore were under power of Protectors for the guard of their Perſons and their Education, and of the Parliament for Councell and Direction in Caſes relating to the Kingdome. The chide of a mean man when its Parents are dead, is <hi>Filus Amici,</hi> but of a King, is <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Populi,</hi> to be by them trained up in ſuch manner, that he may be <hi>Pater populi,</hi> when he is come to age. In the mean time though he be a King, yet his Perſon like a precious Jem muſt not out of the ring, but muſt be directed by Councell, though under ſome kind of reſtraint,<note place="margin">1 E. 3. Stat. 1.</note> &amp; the Councellors all the while no Offenders in ſuch Caſes againſt the Prerogative Royall. And therefore though it be true that Kings grow faſter then other men, and ſooner come to full age then they, yet <hi>Edward</hi> the third now in his ſixteenth yeare might not paſſe over Sea into <hi>France,</hi> though it were for reſtoring of Peace, but by direction of the Parliament: nor is it meet in ſuch Caſes that Kings ſhould ſtand upon the Prerogative of a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. Secondly, it may likewiſe be ſaid, that his Family is leſſe his owne as he is a man, then another mans. For pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Families are no further under the publique Law, then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52042:21"/>
in relation to the publique Peace, to puniſh after breach made. But the Families of Kings are looked upon by all in relation to the honour and profit of the Publique; not onely becauſe the Kings ſervants have by their nigh attendance upon his Perſon a more powerfull influence into his actions, which may reflect a malevolent aſpect upon the whole courſe of affaires, if they be not better ordered that are ſo nigh him. But more eſpecially in regard that the government and order of the Royall Family trencheth deep upon the Honor of the Kingdome, and purſes of the People, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to ſee the ſame accommodated ſutable to the State and Port, which the Nation would bear forth to the World. And therefore for the Parliament to intermeddle in the Kings Family, is not forrain nor new: <hi>Alice Piers</hi> was a Familier, if not of the Family of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, yet both her ſelfe and others of that Family were complained of as a grievance. <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, was once a young man, and ever a young King; and what <hi>Edward</hi> the third wanted onely in his youth, and in his infirme old age, this man ever want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for he that knew not how to govern himſelfe, how much leſſe could he govern his Family: And if in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the Parliament become his Stewards, to ſet a yearely Survey and Check upon his Servants and Family,<note place="margin">9 Rich. 2. n. 31. 11 Rich. 2. n. 23.</note> in order to good order of the ſame, and Kingdome, otherwiſe men muſt conclude, it did that which was juſt: though <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and thoſe of his minde thinke not ſo. But this is not all; Kings have not onely ſuch as ſerve the outward man, but ſome that ſerve their Conſciences, of old time called Confeſſors; in thoſe dayes without name, for feare of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, yet the thing remaineth ſtill in ſome well favored Chaplain, and their work is to lead the Kings Conſcience in dark wayes, or rather into them; commonly he hath a devout outſide, and that is the Kings Idol: but if while his eye be towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> his minde be towards the dead Sea, the King is his; and then the blinde leads the blinde: Like ſome <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> to ſuch as know it not: No man is ſo well knowne by his company as Kings are by theſe men, and theſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52042:22"/>
men by their Actions. Although ſome have bin ſo witty as to cheat the whole generation of Mankinde, by entertaining holy men to be their Chaplains: themſelves the mean time, without any ſparke of that holy Fire. Yet this King was not ſo cunning, he had a Confeſſor of his own choice, and according to his owne heart, who was complained of as a grievance,<note place="margin">5 Rich. 2. n. 17, 18.</note> and the Parliament removed him: So nigh they adventured, even to invade the Kings owne conſcience, if it may be called conſcience, that will acknowledge no Law, but that of its owne minde.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Kings Revenue was under the check and controll of the Parliment, for it befalls ſome Princes, as other men, to be ſomtimes poore in abundance, by riatous flooding treaſure out in the leſſer currents; and leaving the greater channells dry. This is an inſupportible evill, becauſe it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the very being of affaires, whether for Warr or Peace. For the Kings treaſure is of a mixt nature, much of it being intended for publique ſervice, as himſelfe is a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique perſon. And for this cauſe he hath Officers of ſeverall natures attending upon this treaſury. Some for land, ſome for Sea, ſome for the generall treaſure of the Kingdome, ſome for that of the houſhold, and ſome for the privy purſe: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon end of all, being to maintaine ſtate in time of peace, and ſtrength againſt time of Warr: becauſe its no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to maintaine the juſt proportions for each of the ſaid ends, it is the leſſe wonder that ſuch a brave Prince as <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Third ſhould Labour under want for maintenance of the Warrs; and ſo laviſh a Spendthrift as <hi>Richard</hi> the Second; ſhould Labour under more want to maintaine his port and countenance in peace. And therefore, though it be true that the publique treaſure is committed to the King as the cheife Steward of the Realme, yet it is as true that he is but a Steward; and that the ſupreame ſurvey of the Treaſure reſteth in the Parliment, who are to ſee that the treaſure be not irregularly waſted, to reduce the ſame into order; and for that end to call the Treaſurers and Receivers to account, to ſee to the puniſhing of ſuch as are unfaithfull,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52042:22"/>
and encouraging of others that are faithfull; for when by extravagant courſes, the Treaſure is waſted; by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſes it muſt be ſupplied, which ever is out of the Subjects purſes. And in ſuch caſes it is great reaſon that they ſhould obſerve which way the courſe lies of ſuch expenſes. If then in ſuch caſes, ſometimes the Parliament hath ſtayed the iſſuing out of the Kings Revenue for ſome time,<note place="margin">2 Kich. 2. n. 12. 9 Rich. 2. n. 4. or. 41. 14 E. 3. n. 6. 27 E. 3. n. 8. 9 R. 2. n. 40. 15 E. 3. n. 16.</note> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe viewed and examined the ſame, charged it with condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 22 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 29.14 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 15. limitted it to certaine u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in caſe of miſuſer refuſed to levy or make payments, the caſe will be without diſpute, that the Parliament order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the publique treaſure as they ſaw moſt need. But much more if wee conſider how the greateſt part of this treaſure was raiſed. <hi>Viz.</hi> Not from the old Revenues of the Crowne, but by new impoſitions, levies, and aſſeſments, layd upon the people, even what they pleaſed, and in what manner they thought meet, and not otherwiſe. Aydes are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full if they be legally given by common conſent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Taxes if legally given by Parliament,<note place="margin">14 E. 3. cap. 20.</note> are no leſſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet they muſt be collected in ſuch manner and by ſuch means as the Parliaments Order doth direct: Loans of monys to the King may be made by them that will, but the King muſt not demand them, becauſe the ſubject hath no means to recover the debt.<note place="margin">25 E. 3. n. 16.</note> This trick had been lately tryed by <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Second, much mony he got, and it was repaied by the order of the Parliament. But of all the reſt, nothing ſhewed more abſolute authority in the publique Revenue, then the care that was had of the Demeſnes of the Crown,<note place="margin">1 E. 3. vet. 1.</note> for whereas the expenſes of Kings grew ſo vaſt, that neither the yeerly Revenue could ſuffice; nor aides, aſſeſments, and taxes could ſatisfie, however ordinary they in theſe times were become; rather then Kings would contiane themſelves they would invade their own Demeſnes, by pauning, ſelling, and giving them a way, either for love or mony; and thus was poverty treaſured up againſt the future, both for King and Crown. The Parliament, eſpying this leake that was like to undoe all, applyed a ſpeedy remedy, undoing what was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52042:23"/>
done, and undoing ſome by an act of Reſumption, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by taught Kings to looke to their honor better for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;<note place="margin">1 Rich. 2. n. 48.</note> and people alſo to take heed of medling with ſuch conſiderated matters, and to know that he that hath ſuch in his poſſeſſion, hath them by a cract title that cannot bee amended but by Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, An Engliſh King is no Out-law, nor can he do any wrong, though the man may: he hath a double rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one as a King, the other as a man, and the uniting of both in one Perſon, hath cheated many a man of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Caſe of Prerogative: he hath a double will, and theſe many times contrary, equally as in other Relations; and in this contrariety, ſometimes the King overcomes the man, and ſometimes the man the King; ſo as if any man, the King hath much more cauſe to cry out, <hi>O miſerable Man</hi>: Theſe divers wills are generally led by diverſe rules. One of a man, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> many times reacheth no higher then the Affections; and if the man be weak they deſerve little better name then Luſts. The rule of a King is Law, or Councells, of theſe in place; and unto theſe in all prudentialls, he muſt ſubmit his judgement and will, as he is a King: nor can he doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, unleſſe he will preſume to be wiſer then his Councell: Sutable hereunto doth that clauſe in one of the Statutes of theſe times conclude,<note place="margin">25 E. 3. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor.</note> 
                  <hi>Viz. That the King is bound by his Oath, to paſſe all Lawes that are for the good of the Kingdome:</hi> For were the power of election, or determination of the Point onely in the King, then were the Oath in vain, nor is the Parliament at all (in caſe of the Kings diſſent) to judge of the convenience or inconvenience of Propoſalls made for the good of the whole body,<note place="margin">21 E. 3. n. 64. 3 Rich. 2. n. 83. 2 Rich. 2. n. 38.</note> according to that power which it exerciſed in theſe times: Nor is it irrationall to inferre here from that, if Law and Councell be the rule of a King, then the obedience of the people unto this King muſt be in order to Law and Councell, otherwiſe the diſobedience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be determined to be againſt the King, but againſt the Man; and though againſt the private will of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet not againſt the Law, nor therefore can it be ſaid il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52042:23"/>
or unjuſt. The Parliament in theſe times held forth this Doctrine plainly to the World, that it is their proper work in Caſes needfull to doe right to ſuch as are wronged by the King: his command is no Warrant in ſuch Caſes.<note place="margin">15 E. 3. n. 6, 7.</note> If a man be wrongfully impriſoned by him,<note place="margin">1. E. 3. Ver. 1. 15 E. 3. cap. 3. 11 Rich. 2. n. 11.12.15.17.</note> he ſhall be releaſed and ſet at liberty by them: Let his Act be never ſo authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall under the Broad-Seale, it can take no mans right away. <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, did his utmoſt to ſatisfie and quiet the tumultuous rabble under <hi>Cade</hi> and <hi>Straw</hi>; and granted ſtore of Manumiſſions to the Bond-men by Declaration, and by his Letters Patents, but not one of them good enough to deprive any one of the meaneſt of the Free-men of their rights in thoſe Bond-men. The priviledge of ſhewing mercy,<note place="margin">5 Rich. 2. n. 8.12.13.</note> and granting pardon hath beene antiently betruſted to the King, as to an Overſeer of the execution of Law, yet he hath not that Prerogative, To have mercy on whom he will have mercy. Ever ſince this Narion had learned to read the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Murder hath been excepted from mercy, nor did the Law ever allow any King any Prerogative to pardon that. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, did not challenge any ſuch, not onely bound thereto by his Coronation Oath,<note place="margin">10. E. 3. cap. 2. 14 E. 3. c. 15. 2 E. 3. cap. 2.</note> but by publique Acts of State, declaring the ſame; yet becauſe the Parliament was not alwayes ſitting, and Kings were ever ſubject to this Temptation, to favour Servants, by granting mercy to Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; a generall rule of Inhibition is made againſt all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to be granted by the King, in Caſe of Fellony, but onely in Caſes allowed by adviſe of the Councel. Its true that in the firſt times of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, he liked not to be thus girt in his power, which he pretended was more at liberty in his Predeceſſors; poſſibly he meaned King <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, who many times did what they liſted; yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his favour, no Law was ſo ſhameleſſe,<note place="margin">13 Rich. 2. Sr. 2. cap. 1.</note> as to hold forth ſuch a power, till <hi>Richard</hi> the Seconds Law countenanced it: But why doe I call it a Law, which is onely a Declaration by conſent of the Lords, ſuch as then were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">11 Rich. 2. n. 3.6. 21 Rich. 2. n. 35.</note> the Commons would never owne ſuch an opinion; and therefore it ſoone proved abortive; for within three or foure yeares, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52042:24"/>
Act of Parliament, its peremptorily declared, that the Kings Pardon ſhall not extend to murther: So as upon the whole matter its plain that it is not the Kings will, though ſupported by the Councell of Lords, and backed by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Judges, that muſt be a rule for the government of this Kingdome, nor doth any Allegience binde obedience thereunto, in Caſe where Juſtice, or the liberty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is concerned.</p>
               <p>Three things yet remain which Kings have claimed to be their own, <hi>Viz. Conferring Titles of Honour, and places of Truſt, and the Legiſlative power.</hi> The firſt is but a Feather, and not worthy of regard, yet it is plain that theſe times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many preſidents of Dukes, Marqueſſes, and Earles, made in Parliament, and poſſibly it may be apparent that the firſt motion of any ſuch Title of Honour, did firſt fetch its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall thence, if not in the field. But its not worthy of the labour. The ſecond is more conſiderable, <hi>Viz. The power of conferring places of Publique Truſt:</hi> This, Kings have pretended unto, although in courſe of Congruity, it will be thought more meet that it belongeth rather to that cheife and grand Truſt of the whole Kingdome committed to the Parliament, and the Practice of theſe times is not much diſcrepant, whether we regard ſuch as are for advice or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, Of the firſt of theſe are thoſe whom we commonly call, the Privie-Councell, whoſe adviſe in courſe toucheth firſt upon the Kings Perſon, but by reflexion worketh ſtrong impreſſions upon the People, ſo far as the influence of the Kings power extends. And therefore its not beyond the Sphear of the Parliament to interpoſe and qualifie that influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo as it may be for the generall good of the whole Kingdome: For many times Kings are either above or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath themſelves; and in ſuch Caſes if the Councell be of the Kings ſuite, he is of the deeper die, and proves more Malignant to the People. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, growing into great opinion in the World, his Proportion exceeds his own Portion,<note place="margin">14 E. 3. n. 55.</note> and the Peoples good wills to boote<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they think the fault is in the privy Councell, and an Inquiſition ſet upon it:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52042:24"/>
So alſo they doe in his fiftieth yeare when he growes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.<note place="margin">50 E. 3. n. 10. 1 Rich. 2. n. 5<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </note> And the like in the beginning of <hi>Richard</hi> the Seconds Reigne, he being now a Youth, and therefore unſtable in his Reſolutions, and unable to make Election: So as upon the whole matter, if the King fall ſhort in point of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Reſolution, or inordinate in his Affections:<note place="margin">3 Rich. 2. n. 34. 5 Rich. 2. n. 17, 18.28. 6 Rich. 2. n. 19.</note> But more eſpecially where they obſerve the Major, or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the Councell to draw towards a deſigne; in ſuch Caſes as theſe, the Parliament as its own duty under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to ſettle a good Councell about the Kings Perſon, that might adviſe him during their Receſſe. For the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell is never more it ſelfe then when it is an Epitome of the Common Councell of the Kingdome. In like manner ſuch Officers as concern Execution of Law, and Councell, are as narrowly to be inquired into: for if their motion be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, its leſſe materiall what the rule be: the Parliament therefore held it their duty to interpoſe in the Election of grand Officers of the Kingdome; ſuch as are the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Judges, and Juſtices, or to confirm or diſplace them, or binde them by Oath, the Rolls of the eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and thirty ſixth years of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and the ſixth, tenth, and eleventh years of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, do manifeſt this ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>I have done with the Subject matter or work of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the mutuall Relation of the King and it, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding was either joyntly with the King, or without him; and either joyntly with the two Houſes, or ſeverally; and either immediately by themſelves, or their Committees. As touching the firſt, its evident that in all matters wherein gain ariſeth to the Crown from the people, by Subſidy, or otherwiſe, the ſtrength of the Grant by Act of Parliament reſteth in the two Houſes, and that the Kings aſſent is but <hi>Pro forma,</hi> as touching that matter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch Grants have been made as tended in ſome meaſure to derogate, either from the Kings wiſedome, care, or fidelity, yet even theſe have paſſed with the Royall Aſſent, though the full Aſſent or good will of the Perſon of the King was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52042:25"/>
not correſpondent thereto: as in theſe Caſes formerly noted, where Subſidies were given with Limitations and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and upon rendering account to the People. And it is as evident, that where the Kings Perſon is diſabled to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand (as in Caſe of Infancy) there the Royall Aſſent can bear litle weight with it;<note place="margin">37 E. 3. n. 34. 1 Rich. 2. n. 5. 5 Rich. 2. n. 75.</note> but moſt of all in the Kings abſence, where either the Aſſent is put thereto by Commiſſioners, that know not the Kings particular minde, or the Act is done onely by the Houſes, in nature of Ordinances; and yet theſe of force to binde all Parties, but the King. But nothing more debaſed the Royall Aſſent in theſe times, then a trick that <hi>Edward</hi> the Third plaid in the middeſt of the fulleſt ſtrength of his Government: It was in time of War, which never is time of good Husbandry and laying up, nor of ſober adviſe in laying out, nor of equity in levying and collecting money for the nerves of War. This forward Warrier in the heat of his Atchievements, findes his ſtrength benummed for want of money, he leaves off, comes home, rages againſt his A. Biſhop, to whom he had committed the care of Proviſion for his War, and the A. Biſhop, as hotly falls upon ſome of the Treaſury in the Army on the one ſide, and upon others in the Countrey; whoſe oppreſſions, ſaith he, in ſtead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in money,<note place="margin">15 E. 3. c. 3.</note> made the people to give a ſtop thereto. A conteſt hereupon thus had, it was concluded by the Power of the Parliament, that ſuch men ſhould be questioned, and that the Parliament from time to time ſhould call all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of State to account,<note place="margin">Antiq. Britt. Eccleſ.</note> and thereupon enſues a calme. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Parliament ended, the King repeats the matter, it makes his heart ſick, he diſgorgeth himſelf by a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by adviſe of Nobles, and Wiſe men, as he ſaith, and tells all the World he diſſembled with his Parliament, and what he did was done by dureſs of minde, to pleaſe for the time, and to gain his ends, which being now had, he by his Proclamation revokes what he had done in Parliament,<note place="margin">15 E. 3.50.</note> or indeavoured it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus is <hi>England</hi> put to ſchool to learn to diſſolve three hard knots: Firſt, <hi>Whether a King can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble with his Parliament.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Whether</hi> Edward 3. <hi>his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52042:25"/>
diſſembling aſſent makes a Law.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Whether by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, by adviſe of Nobles and Wiſe men, he can Declare that he diſſembled with his Parliament, and therein not diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Royall Aſſent, ſo as to bring all the Lawes made in any Kings time into queſtion at leaſt during his life.</hi> However the reſult may be, its evident the Royall Aſſent gets no honor hereby, and the Statute as little, that hath ſuffered this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation all this time to paſſe among the number of the Statutes in Print as a Law, when as many Statutes that are Lawes of note are left out as uſeleſſe.</p>
               <p>Although in the generall, the two Houſes joyned in every Act, <hi>Ad extra,</hi> yet, <hi>Ad intra,</hi> and in relation one to another, they had their ſeverall operations, the Houſe of Commons intermedled more in the matter of fact, the Houſe of Lords in matter of right, although in either of theſe there is a mutuall aſpect from both: In matters of judicature, much reſted with the Lords, and therefore it is ordained, that,<note place="margin">15 E. 3. c. 1. 15 E. 3. c. 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The Houſe of Lords ſhall remedy all offences contrary to the Law of Magna Charta</hi>: And in caſes where no remedy is left, nor judgment by the Law, the matter ſhall be <hi>determined in Parliament, and the King ſhall command execution to be done according to the judgment of the Peeres:</hi> Which Lawes ſeeme to bee but declarative of the former Lawe, and in the nature of reviving that power into Act which was formerly layd aſleep, and doth ſtrongly implye that the ultimate act in judicature reſted with the Lords, in relation not onely to the Houſe of Commons, but alſo in relation to the King, whoſe work in ſuch caſes, is, not to judge above, or with the Peers, but to execute their ſentence: and that carries with it a liſt, whereby the power of a King may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not to be ſo ſupreame in making of the Law, as ſome would have it; for if his Judgement and Conſcience be bound by the Votes of the Peers in giving a Law, in Caſe of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer perſon, where the Law was not formerly known: Let others judge of the value of this Negative Vote, in giving Law to the whole Kingdome. Its true that this Parliament was quarrelled by the King, and he kept it at a bay by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52042:26"/>
that pretended Revocation, as far as a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could revoke an Act of Parliament; but it effected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor did the conteſt laſt long: Now though this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction thus reſted in the Houſe of Lords, in ſuch Caſes, as well as in others; yet is it not ſo Originally in them, as to be wholly theirs, and onely as they ſhall order it; for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England</hi> have a right in the courſe and order of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, which (as the known Law) is part of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and in the ſpeedy execution of Juſtice, as well as they have right to have Juſtice done: and therefore whereas in Caſes of Error, and delayes, the Appeale was from the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Court to the Parliament, which immediately determined the matter,<note place="margin">14 E. 3. cap. 5.</note> and now the trouble grew too great by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Pleas: For remedy hereof, a kind of Committee is made of 1 Biſhop, 2 Earls, 2 Barrons, who by the advice of the <hi>Chancellor, Treaſurer,</hi> and the <hi>Judges,</hi> ſhall make good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all Caſes of Complaint of delay in Judgement, which Committee is not made by Order of the Lords alone, which they might have done in caſe Juriſdiction had bin wholly and onely ſhut up in their cuſtody, but by Act of Parliament, and joynt concurrence of the Commons with the Lords: For as the Commons challenge ſpeedy Execution of Juſtice, as one of their liberties: So alſo to be under the juriſdiction of ſuch Judges, and Courts, as the Lawes (in the making whereof themſelves challenge a Vote) do eſtabliſh &amp; appoint.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this Chapter with the Conſtitution of the Parliament in theſe times. For, the difficulties that befell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kings and their people, or Houſes of Parliament, wrought two ſad effects, <hi>Viz.</hi> A propenſity to decline cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Parliaments, ſo often as was uſed and exſpected; and when it aſſembled, as great a propenſity in the Members to decline their attendance,<note place="margin">Walſing: An. 1315.</note> by means whereof, as the Hiſtorians tell us, the Parliament was ſomtimes inforced to adjourn it ſelf for want of number ſufficient: the firſt of theſe aroſe from want of good will in the Kings, the other from want of courage and zeale in the people. The firſt of theſe was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and deſtructive to good Government; for though in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52042:26"/>
diſtempered Parliaments its good to withdraw, yet in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered times its neceſſary to meete, and gain a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of all parties; and therefore theſe times were ſo happy as to binde themſelves by publique Acts of State to recontinue the Aſſembling of Parliaments. For the face of the Times repreſented unto all, that Agitations were like to be quick, violent, and to continue for ſome ſucceſſion of Time: Its therefore ſafe, if not neceſſary, that every eye ſhould be open, and Counſells ready for every Occaſion. A law at length is agreed upon, that <hi>A Parliament ſhall be holden once every yeare, or more if need be.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4 E. 3. cap. 14.</note> But in thirty yeares the power of this Law is waſted out of minde, and the evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, revives alſo the Statute,<note place="margin">36 E. 3. c. 10.</note> and yet they had thirteen or fourteen Parliaments in thirty yeares ſpace, and not above three, or but once foure yeares diſtance of time between any two of them in Succeſſion. This was the ſenſe of the Members of the Houſes in their meeting, but at home, they had homely conceits, and its found no leſſe difficult to bring them to the meeting, then to continue the meeting according to the Law, being either loath to adventure their thoughts into the troubleſome affaires of the Publique, or their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to expence and hazard: But the Publique muſt be ſerved, and therefore an Act of Parliament is made,<note place="margin">1 Rich. 2. c. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>That all ſuch Members as decline their appearance at the Parliament, after Summons made, ſhall be amerced, and the Sheriffes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that ſhall neglect return of Summons</hi>: And the Statute implyeth that it was no Introduction of a new Law, but a reviving of former Law now or lately difuſed, or a Cuſtome now out of Cuſtome. And to take away all Objection in point of charges and expences, another Law was made to eſtabliſh the aſſeſsments, and levying of their Wages,<note place="margin">12 Rich. 2. cap. 12.</note> upon the Lands that anciently were chargeable therewith, in whoſe hands ſoever the ſame ſhall come.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude with this, that the Parliament, though like a Garment, it ſometimes covers the goodly feature and proportion of a well compoſed body, yet it keepes the ſame warme, and as a Sheild is firſt in all dangers, and meets
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52042:27"/>
with many a knock which the body feels not: This is their worke and reward; Its true, that in the wearing it is felt heavy, but it is the eaſier born, if it be duely conſidered, that it is better to be ſo clothed, then to be naked.</p>

               <p>THe later muſt make way for the former, for according to their Perſonall eſteeme in their own Countries, ſuch is their Authority at the Board in joynt Councells: And it was one point of happineſſe in a ſad time of Warre, that all men looked one way. The Lords were much addicted to the Feild, and could doe much with <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, who was a brave Leader, and more with the People, who had bin ſo long time uſed to the rough trade of Souldiery, that they loved not to be at home about matters of Husbandry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had ſo little experience. And having ſo fair a Garland in their eye as <hi>France,</hi> its no wonder if Domeſtick deſignes ſeemed meaner, or more dangerous. Thus did God doe <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a good turn, although it was made for the preſent thereby neither ſo rich or populous, as it might have bin in a time of Peace. This <hi>French</hi> Heate waſted many a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Spirit, and Innobled the Fame of the King and Lords, not onely abroade, but won them much Honour and Repute of thoſe that remained at home; and ſo by congregating Homogenealls, and ſevering Heterogenealls, rendered the body of the People more Univecall; which tended much to the ſettling of the joynts of this diſtracted Nation. A time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly birth hereof doubtleſſe was the peaceable entry of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the Second, upon the Throne, and quiet ſitting there; whiles as yet he was but a Childe, the Princes of the blood many; and they of generous, Active, and daring Spirits: yet doe we not meete with a whiſper in Story of any turbulent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52042:27"/>
or aſpiring humor in them or the People, during thoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer times of that Kings reigne. But after that he came to know more in himſelfe then was to be found; and to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reare his abilities, having ſome of the Lords ready at his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow to help him: theſe changed the Kings courſe, although the generall part of that Noble Band kept ſtill their Array; and retaining the body of the People in due compoſure, thereby declared themſelves to be the Kings Friends, though the others were <hi>Richards</hi> Favorites, ſo as he was fain to ſtoop to occaſion, and ſubmit to be a King, that would have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe beene more or leſſe. And thus the Lords were become Supporters to the Crown, Studds to the Throne, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to the People, againſt the violent motions of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled minde in their King; who ſeeing them ſo united, and indeavouring to break them into parties to obtain his deſire, loſt both it and himſelfe. It is a degree of cleanly modeſty to impute the miſcarriages of unruly Kings, to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell: For however during their minority, Councellors are more rightly Officers of State; yet when Kings will be their owne Men, their Councellors are no other then the breath of the Kings owne breaſt; and by which a King may be more truely diſcerned then any man, by his boſome Friends. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Third, was a man of a publique Spirit, and had a Councell ſuitable to his aime: <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, a man that deſired what him pleaſed, would have what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; and a Councell he had that ſerved him in all: for God anſwers the deſires of mens hearts in Judgement as well as in Mercy; and a ſore judgement it is both to King and People, when the corrupt deſires of the King are backed by a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Councell.</p>
               <p>It muſt be granted that the Privy Councell of Kings, hath been an old ginne of State, that at a ſudden lift could doe much to the furthering of the preſent Eſtate of publique Affaires: Nevertheleſſe, through the Riot of Kings, their Deſignes generally tended to make more worke for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, then to diſpatch; to doe much, rather then well; like workes for ſale, rather then for Maſter-peice, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52042:28"/>
to undermine, yea, to outface the Parliament it ſelfe; like ſome unruly ſervants that will put away their owne Maſters: Nor can it otherwiſe be expected, unleſſe the Kings elected ones be turned into the Parliaments Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee; or that conſtant annuall Inquiſition by Parliament, be made into their Actions: for occaſionall inquiries breed ill blood, though no attainder be; nor are they eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, whereas conſtancy in ſuch Caſes makes the worſt to be reſolved but into a matter of common courſe.</p>
               <p>The naturall and originall power of the Privy Councell, is very obſcure, becauſe there are ſeverall Degrees of them that occaſionally have beene uſed, all of whom may deſerve the name of Privy Councell, in regard of the Parliament, which is the moſt publique Councell of all the reſt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hath a generall intereſt in all Cauſes in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe, is that which was called, <hi>The Grand Councell of the King,</hi> which as I thinke, was not the Houſe of Lords, who are called by Summons, and were onely to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend during the Parliament; but a body made up of them: and other wiſe men of his owne retinue: and of this it ſeems there was a conſtant body framed, that were ſworn to that ſervice;<note place="margin">16.

               <p>The ſecond of theſe Councells was alſo a great Councell, and probably greater then the other; but this was called onely upon occaſion, and conſiſted of all ſorts, like a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet was none: An example whereof we have in the Ordinances concerning the Staple, which at the firſt were made by the King, Prelates, Dukes, Earles, Lords, and great Men of the Kingdome, one out of every County, Citty, and Burrough,<note place="margin">27 E. 3. <hi>Stat.</hi> 2 28 E. 3. cap. 13.</note> called together for that end; their reſults were but as in point of triall for ſixe moneths ſpace, and then were turned into Statute-Law by the Parliament. Theſe two are <hi>Magna Concilia,</hi> yet without power, further then as for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe; becauſe they had no ancient foundation, nor conſtant

continuance. Another Councell remaineth more private then the other, of more continuall uſe, though not ſo Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally founded, and this is called the Kings Privy Councell, not taking up a whole Houſe, but onely a Chamber, or a Table, ſignifying rather communication of Advice, then power of Judicature, which more properly is in <hi>Banco</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And yet the power of this grew as virile and royall, as it would acknowledge no Peere but the Parliament, and uſurped the repreſentative of it as that had bin of the whole Kingdome. The ambition thereof hath ever bin great, and in this moſt notoriouſly evident, that as it had ſwallowed up the grand Councell of Lords, it ſeldome can endure the mention of a Parliament, but when Kings or Affairs are too rugged for their owne touch.

rule by Proclamation; experience taught ſucceeding times ſufficiently: Nevertheleſſe theſe times wherein Parliaments were every moment upon the wing, and kept this Noble Band in awe, by taking them into their Cogniſance, placing and diſplacing ſome or all of them, directing and binding them by Oath, as they ſaw occaſion, of which the Records are full and plentifull. I ſay, theſe times thus conſtituted added yet further incouragement to them, by giving them powers by Statute-Law, over and beyond what by ancient Cuſtome they had obtained. The King and Councell of Lords had anciently a power of Juriſdiction, that hath bin in the firſt part of this diſcourſe already obſerved; yet its very probable that it was not any ſelect company of Lords, but the whole Aſſociation; for its granted by all, that they had originally a Principall hand in the juriſdiction: And its hard to conceive how any private number ſhould catch ſuch a power, if not by uſurpation. But the manner of acquiring, is leſſe materiall; the principall conſideration reſteth upon the quality of this Juriſdiction. For it is evident that much difference hath bin, both concerning the place and manner of exerciſing this Authority. In generall, It muſt be granted that all Pleas, <hi>Coram Rege,</hi> were grounded upon Writs firſt purchaſed, and returnable, either in <hi>Banco,</hi> or in <hi>Camera</hi>;<note place="margin">20. <hi>Aſs. pl.</hi> 52.</note> or in <hi>Cancellaria.</hi> And no difference at all will be concerning the Juriſdiction in <hi>Banco,</hi> for that was by the Courſe of the Common Law; and the people held it one of their liberties to have one known courſe of Law, for determining matters of right and wrong. As touching theſe Pleas, which were holden by Writs returnable in <hi>Camera,</hi> they were properly ſaid to be <hi>Coram Rege &amp; Conſilio,</hi> whoſe meeting was in the Councell Chamber, in thoſe dayes called the Star-Chamber.<note place="margin">41 E. 3. <hi>Rat.

ſuppoſe all this be given up, yet was this Liberty to hold Pleas ſo qualified, that the perſon could not be touched, till the thing did appear by Inquiſition, and then in a Legal way: ſuch proceedings was had upon ſuggeſtion made againſt the City of <hi>London,</hi>

Amongſt theſe, matters of debt and contract coming into the account, this Office taking notice of the Record, tooke Cogniſance of the thing, and for the executing thereof: and thus in theſe, and ſuch like Caſes, granted Judiciall Writs, and ſo found out a way of Judicature,<note place="margin">Fleta, lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>13.</hi> Sect. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> to as many Cauſes as the State would truſt it with: and becauſe it pretended Cogniſance onely of matters of Record before them, they found out a way of examining of witneſſes by Commiſſion, and returning their Depoſitions in writing, which being become a Record before them; they gave their Sentence upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without the ancient ordinary tryall, <hi>Per pares:</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a kinde of Peculiar, exempting it ſelfe from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe in manner of triall, and from the ordinary rules of Law, in giving of Sentence, and as a back doore for the Kings Arbitry, in caſe of Judicature in matters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas, as the Councell Table was in Crowne Pleas, they both are looked upon with a very pleaſing eye of Majeſty, which loves not to be ſtraite laced; yet all is imbattelled under the colours of Equity, Honor, Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, and Conſcience, like a Monopoly that is bred

under the wings of the Publique, but feeds it ſelfe upon it.</p>
               <p>That this had attained the Title of a Court ſo anciently, as in K. <hi>Stevens</hi> time (as the Honorable Reporter noteth) I much queſtion,<note place="margin">

Yet is this power much darkned in the limits and extent thereof, chiefly in regard that the Chancellor is betruſted with many things, whereof there is no evidence for the Chancery to claim any Cogniſance. For he was in theſe times a perſon of many intereſts and relations, being one of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> in the Star-Chamber, of the Kings Councell, chief in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, moſt commonly a Clergy man, and therewith <hi>Legate è latere,</hi> and in theſe ſeverall Relations might act directly, and yet in ſeverall Courts. And therefore, though he had power with others, to puniſh neglects of Execution of the Statutes of Wines,<note place="margin">4 E. 3. cap. 12. 9 E. 3. cap. 1. 14 E. 3. cap. 5.</note> by Act of Parliament, and alſo of the Statute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Victuall, and to determine matters of controverſie between parties in Caſes depending before the Parliament, and in ſome matters that concern the Kings Revenue; yet cannot theſe be ſaid to be the proper worke belonging to the Cogniſance of the Chancery, but to the Chancellor by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Commiſſion in another relation: Allbeit I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but the Court it ſelfe had Cogniſance in matters of as ſtrange a nature,<note place="margin">27 E. 3. cap. 26. 36. E. 3. c. 9. &amp; cap. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> To puniſh diſturbances of Merchants in their trade, to ſee to the executing of the Statutes of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiors, and to remedy greivances contrary to other Statutes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52042:32"/>
(which generall words let in a wilde liberty to that Court to intermeddle in Lawes which were never intended for their touch) to puniſh Nuſances according to diſcretion,<note place="margin">12 Rich. 2. c. 12. 27 E. 3. c. 24.</note> to give remedy to Merchants upon the Statute of Staple; ſo that its clear enough the Parliament intended it ſhould be a Court, and gave their Seale to their power of Judicature. Nor as it ſeemeth, was this any regret to the Courts of Common Law, but as a thing taken for granted. For the Reports tell us, that if the King grants Tythes, ariſing from without the bounds of any Pariſh, the Patentee ſhall ſue in the Chancery by <hi>Scire Facias,</hi> and ſhall there proceed to iſſue or demurrer,<note place="margin">22 <hi>Aſſ. pl.</hi> 25.</note> and then to the common Law; where upon triall, if the Defendant make default, the Plaintiffe ſhall have Judgement,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bro. ſcire fac.</hi> 154. 24 E. 3.73.</note> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. And if the Heire be in Ward to the King, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall ſue and recover her Dower in the Chancery. And they tell us that it had power to prohibite Spirituall Courts, and Courts of common Law, yea, to over-rule or reverſe judgements: and yet the common Law held its ground when it was concerned: for neither were all ſuites there by Bill, as in caſes of Equity, nor determined according to ſuch rules,<note place="margin">43 <hi>Aſs. pl.</hi> 32. 24, E. 3. pl. 35. 39 E. 3. fo. 14. 21 E. 3. fo. 47.</note> nor did the power of Judicature reſt in the breaſt of one Chancellor, but in him joyntly with other Councell of the King, which were alſo learned Judges of the Law. For the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port informeth that <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, had granted a Rent in Taile to the Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> who dying, his Sonne under age, and Ward to the King, <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, ſeiſed, amongſt other Lands, the rent, and granted it to Sir <hi>John Molins</hi>: Upon Petition, the King refers the matter to the Arch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and others of the Councell, calling to them the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor: A <hi>Scire Facias</hi> goes forth to Sir <hi>John Molins</hi>; he upon appearance, pleaded to the juriſdiction, as a caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the common Law; but it would not be allowed, becauſe it was to repeale the Kings Charter.</p>
               <p>And whereas it was objected that the reference was to the Arch Biſhop, and others, and therefore the cauſe ought not to be determined in the Chancery; it was reſolved that it did properly belong to the Chancery, by the Law: And in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52042:33"/>
Argument of the caſe, it appeares clearely that the Kings Councell there,<note place="margin">43. <hi>Aſs. pl.</hi> 35.</note> were learned in the Law. And the ſame is yet more evident by the Title of Bills in thoſe dayes exhibited in the Chancery, which was directed to the Chancellor, and the Kings Councell, and the rule given, <hi>Per tout les Juſtices</hi>; which I rather note for the ſhortneſſe of the forme of Bills in thoſe dayes, farre different from theſe times, wherein the ſubſtance of the complaint, however ſmall in it ſelfe, is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times blowne out into ſo great a bubble, that it breakes to nothing: And the Statutes formerly mentioned do aſſert the ſame thing, as touching the Kings Councell. For though they ſpeake of the Councell or Chancery in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, yet in the Originall the words are, <hi>Conceill en Chancery.</hi>

               <p>Having thus touched upon the matters under the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Chancery, and Judges in the ſame: in the next place, the manner of proceedings comes to conſideration. For it ſeems they had been formerly very irregular, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Grand Charter, upon a bare ſuggeſtion in the Chancery, the party complained of was impriſoned, and no proceedings made thereupon: for remedy whereof, it was ordained, that upon ſuggeſtions ſo made, the complainant was to finde Sureties to purſue the ſuggeſtions, and that the proceſſe of Law ſhould iſſue forth againſt the party without impriſoning him, and that if the ſuggeſtions were not proved true, the complainant ſhould incur the like penalty, that the Defendant ſhould have done,<note place="margin">37 E. 3. cap. 27.</note> in caſe be had beene found guilty: but afterwards this later clauſe was altered by another Statute, becauſe it was full of uncertainty; and it was ordained, that in ſuch caſe the Complainant ſhall be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,<note place="margin">38 Ed. 3. c. 9.</note> untill he ſhall ſatisfie the Defendant of his damages: And furthermore, ſhall make Fine and Ranſome to the King. But becauſe that the Defendant many times held his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, even to extremity; this courſe laſted not long, but a new Law was made,<note place="margin">17 Rich. 2. cap. 6.</note> which put the power of awarding da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages in ſuch caſes into the Chancellor, to doe according to his diſcretion: And thus the Chancery obtained power to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52042:33"/>
award damages, which they never had formerly, and the Chancellor, a Precedency both in the Chancery,<note place="margin">43 <hi>Aſs. pl.</hi> 32.</note> and of the Councell in the Court of Starre-Chamber, and in many caſes in the Exchequer: by the firſt he had a power in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi>; by the laſt in matters, <hi>Mei</hi> and <hi>Regis</hi>; and by the other in matters <hi>Mei</hi> and <hi>Regni.</hi> A conſiderable man certainly he was in the motions of Government; but how much more if he be made Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Cardinall, and Legate <hi>è Latere</hi>; or Arch Biſhop, Lord Treaſurer, and Legate <hi>è Latere</hi>; as theſe dayes had divers times ſeen. Extraordinary advancements beſtowed upon the Nobility, brings Honour to the Throne, but if they be not men of noted worth, and uprightneſſe, they make the Scepter ſtoope, by ſtirring up of envy in the Nobility, and indignation from the People. For ſeldome is it ſeene, that Advancements are fed from the Crowne, though they be bred from thence; but either maintained by new ſupplies from the Peoples purſes, or the ruine or decay of ſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more ancient then themſelves, or both: And ſuch was the condition of the Chancellor, he ſucked fat from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and blood and Spirits from the Grand chiefe Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciar of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo reduced that Honourable Potentate, unto the Degree of chiefe Juſtice of the Kings Bench, leaving ſcarcely unto him the name or title of Lord. One thing more remaineth touching the election, or nomination of this Great man. At the firſt, he was no better then a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, or the Kings remembrancer, or Secretary, having alſo the Honour to adviſe the King in ſuch matters as came within the circuite of the Writings in his cuſtody; and queſtionleſſe, <hi>Eo uſque,</hi> its ſutable to all the reaſon in the World, that he ſhould be of the Kings ſole Nomination and Election: But when it befalls, that in ſtead of adviſing the King, his word is taken to be the rule, and a Judicatory power put upon that; and unto this is ſuperadded that Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truſt of keeping and governing the great Seale of the Kingdome, with the continuall growing power occaſionally conferred upon him by the Parliament: He is now become
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52042:34"/>
no more the Kings Remembrancer, but the Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and Supreame Officer of State. And it ſeemes but reaſonable that he ſhould hold his place by publique Election, as well as the Grand Juſticiar, (whoſe Plumes he borrowed,) and other Grand Officers of State did before him. For he that will have his Servant to worke for another, muſt give the other that Honour of Electing him thereto; nor was this laid aſide or forgotten by theſe times, but a claim was put in for the Election or allowance of this principall Officer amongſt others,<note place="margin">15 E. 3. n. 10.15. 15 E. 3. c. 3. 10 Rich. 2. n. 16.10.</note> the Parliament obtaining a judgement in the caſe by the Kings Confeſſion, and ſo the thing is left to the judgement of future Ages, <hi>Viz. Whether a King that can do no man wrong, can diſſemble the Royall Aſſent in Parliament, or declare himſelfe Legally in that manner by Proclamation?</hi>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of Admiralls Court.</head>
               <p>THis is a third Court that maintained the Kings judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power, in a different way from that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Common law, and by many is therefore ſuppoſed, to advance the Kings Prerogative, but upon miſtaken grounds: It is very true, that the way is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the common rode, both in its originall, and in the courſe of proceedings; nor could it other be, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the condition of the Nations, and the People of the ſame, intereſted in common traffique. The people thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, as much differed from the other ſort of dry men (if they may be ſo called) as Sea from Land, and are in nature but as march men of ſeverall Nations, that muſt conſenter in ſome third way for the maintenance of commerce for peace ſake, and to the end that no Nation may be under any other Law then its owne. The condition of the Nations in the times when civillized government began to ſettle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52042:34"/>
them, was to be under the Roman Emperours, who having ſetled one Law in the generall grounds throughout all Nations, made the Sea likewiſe to ſerve under one rule which ſhould float up and downe with it, that men might know upon what tearmes they held their owne, whereſoever they went; and upon what tearmes to part with it for their beſt advantage: in its originall therefore this Law may be called Imperial, and likewiſe in the proceſs, becauſe it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in one way of triall, and by one law, which had its firſt birth from the Imperiall power: and probably it had not been for the common benefit of Europe to have been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, at other time, or by other directories formed. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe this became no Gemm of Prerogative to the Engliſh Crowne, for if <hi>England</hi> did comply with forraine Natives for its owne benefit, it being an Iland full of the Sea, and in the common rode from the moſt parts of Europe that border upon the Sea, and of delight in Merchandiſe, it is but ſutable to it ſelfe; and it did ſo comply, as it ſaved the maine Stake by voluntary entertaining thoſe Laws without being impoſed upon by Imperiall power: for the <hi>Saxons</hi> came into this Kingdome a free People and ſo (for ought yet appeareth to me) continueth to this day: I ſay that in thoſe firſt times, they did take into the conſideration of Parliament the regulating of the fluctuating motions of Sea-laws; nor were they then, or after, properly impoſed by the Kings Edict. For though it were granted, that <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt reduced the Sea-laws in the Iſle of <hi>Oleron</hi>; yet that the ſame ſhould be done without adviſe of Parliament in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from the holy Land, is to me a riddle, conſidering what Hiſtories doe hold forth concerning of his returne through <hi>Germany,</hi> nor can that be good evidence to intitle Kings of <hi>England</hi> to a power to make and alter Laws accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their private pleaſure and intereſt. Nor doth that Record mentioned in the <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> warrant any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but rather on the contrary groundeth the complaint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laws, ſtatutes Franchiſes, and Cuſtomes, Eſtabiliſhed,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:52042:35"/>This Law was of a double nature according to the Law of the Land, one part concerning the Pleas of the Crowne, and the other between party and party; for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Kings authority in the Admiralty is but an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Judicature, according to Laws eſtabliſhed, which both for proceſſe and ſentence are different from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, as much as the two Elements do differ, yet not different in the power that made them: I ſhall leave the particulars to be inquired into, by them that ſhal minde it elſewhere, and only touch ſo much as ſhall reflect upon the maine Government. This power was executed by Deputies diverſly, according as the times and opportunities were, for Warr or peace, and either <hi>tranſitu</hi> or <hi>partu.</hi> What was done in time of Warr, or whiles this Shipp is out of the Engliſh Seas, comes not to our purpoſe, and therefore I ſhall not meddle with that, further then this, that in the firſt times Kings were wont to divide the worke of judicature, and of Warr into ſeverall hands. The power of Warr and Peace they committed unto men of approved courage and Skill in that ſervice, and therefore generally, not to the men of higheſt ranke, who had neither minde nor Skil for a worke of ſuch labour, dyet, and danger: this power paſſed under divers names, ſometimes by grant of the cuſtody of the Sea coaſts, ſomtimes of the parts and Sea coaſts, ſomtimes by being made Captain of the Sea men, and Marriners, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Admiral of the Ships. It was a great power, and had bin much greater but that it ſuffered a double diminution; the one in the time, for three or four years commonly made an end of the command of one man, and at the beſt it was, <hi>quam diu Regi placuerit</hi>;<note place="margin">Gloſſ. fol. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> the other diminution was in circuit of the power, for all the Maritine coaſts were not ordinarily under the power of one man, but of many; each having his proper precinct upon the South, or North, Eaſt, or Weſtern ſhotes: and under the title of Admirall in the times of <hi>Ed.</hi> the firſt and forwards, who brought that title from the holy Land; nevertheleſſe about the end of the times, whereof we now treat; the cuſtody of the whol Sea began to ſettle in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52042:35"/>
one hand, under the title of Admirall of the Engliſh Seas, and the place was conferred upon men of the greateſt ranke, and ſo continued ever afterward. The power of juriſdicton, or judicature all this while remained diſtinct, and it ſeemes was ſettled in part in the power of the Sheriffe and Juſtices. For by the Law the Sheriff and Juſtices had cogniſance of matters betweene the high water and the low water marke, and what was done, <hi>Super altum mare,</hi> was within the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory of the Admirall, theſe were but few things, and of ſmall conſiderableneſſe: the principall of them being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Warr or peace, and thoſe only within the Engliſh Seas. But after <hi>Edward</hi> the third had beaten both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> at Sea, the people grew much more towards the Sea, and became ſo famous, that the greateſt Lords thought the Regiment of Sea affaires worthy of the beſt of their ranke, and were willing with the title of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, whiles they left the worke to others; and ſo the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall became a perſon of more honour and leſſe worke then he had been formerly. The greatneſſe of the honour of this place thus growing, ſoone alſo began to contract greatneſſe of power beyond what it had formerly; and this was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in matter of juriſdiction. For not contented with the power of a cheife Juſtice of Warr and Peace within the Seas, which was his proper dominion: the Lord Admirall gained the ſame within the low water marke, and in the maine ſtreames below the next Bridge to the Sea,<note place="margin">15 Rich. 2. c. 3. <hi>Dier.</hi> 15. &amp; 16. <hi>El. mic. pl.</hi> 2. 8 E. 3. <hi>Coronn.</hi> 199.</note> and in all places where Ridells were ſet; and yet theſe places were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the body of the County. Nor did he indeavour leſſe to gaine in matters of diſtributive juſtice, for although he had a legal juriſdiction in things done upon the open Sea, ſo farr as to defend, order, determine, and cauſe reſtitution to be made, in caſes of damage done unjuſtly; yet was it no leſſe difficult to keep this power within its own bounds, then the watry Element upon which it floated; but it made continual waves upon the franchiſe of the Land; and for this cauſe, no ſooner had theſe great men ſavored of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and authority of that dignity, but comes a Statute
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52042:36"/>
to reſtrain their Authority in the Cogniſance of Caſes onely, unto ſuch matters as are done upon the main Sea,<note place="margin">13 Rich. 2. cap. 5.</note> as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was wont to be: and within two yeares after, that Act of Parliament is backed by another Act to the ſame purpoſe, in more full expreſſions,<note place="margin">15 Rich. 2. cap. 5.</note> ſaving that for Man-ſlaughter, the Admiralls power extended even to the high water marke, and into the main ſtreams. And this leadeth on the next con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, <hi>Viz.</hi> What is the ſubject matter of this Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and Authority: I ſhall not enter into the depth of particulars, but ſhall reduce all to the two heads of Peace and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The Lord Admirall is, as I formerly ſaid, a Juſtice of Peace at Sea, maintaining the Peace by Power, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the Peace by ſetting an Order unto matters of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as well between Forrainers, as between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Forrainers; as may appeare by that Plea in the fourth Inſtitutes formerly mentioned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That point of Juſtice principally concerneth matters of Contract, and Complaints for breach of Contract; of theſe the Admirall is the Judge, to determine according to Law and Cuſtome. Now as ſubſervient unto both theſe, he hath authority of command over Sea men, and Ships that belong to the State, and over all Sea men and Ships in order to the ſervice of the State, to arreſt and order them for the great voyages of the King, and the Realme, and during the ſaid voyage;<note place="margin">25 Rich. 2. cap. 3.</note> but this he cannot doe without expreſſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe the determining of a voyage Royall, is not wholly in his power.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Lord Admirall hath power, not onely over the Sea men ſerving in the Ships of State,<note place="margin">2 Rich. 2. cap. 4.</note> but over all other Sea men, to arreſt them for the ſervice of the State; and if any of them run away without leave from the Admirall, or power deputed from him, he hath power by inquiry to make a Record thereof, and certifie the ſame to the Sheriffs, Maiors, Bayliffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who ſhall cauſe them to be apprehended and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned. By all which and divers other Lawes, not onely the power of the Admirall is declared, but the originall from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52042:36"/>
whence it is derived, namely from the Legiſlative power of the Parliament, and not from the ſingle Perſon of the King, or any other Councell whatſoever. But enough hath been already ſaid of theſe Courts of State, in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Precincts One generall intereſt befalls them all, that as: they are led by a Law much different from the Courts of Common Law, ſo are they thereby the more indeared to Kings, as being ſubſervient to their Prerogative, no leſſe then the Common Law is to the Peoples liberty: in which condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition being looked upon as Corrivalls, this principall Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime of Government will thence ariſe, That the bounds of theſe ſeverall Lawes are ſo to be regarded, that not the leaſt gap of intrenchment be laid open each to other, leaſt the fence once broken, Prerogative or Liberty ſhould become boundleſſe, and bring in confuſion in ſtead of Law.</p>

               <head>CAHP. VI. Of the Churchmens Intereſt.</head>
               <p>BUt the Churchmens intereſt was yet more tarte, ſtanding in need of no leſſe a lay, then that of the Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for that the King is no leſſe concerned therein, then the People; and the rather, becauſe it was now growne to that pitch, that it is become the Darling of Kings; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually henceforth courted by them; either to gaine them from the Papall Juriſdiction, to be more ingaged to the Crowne, or by their means to gaine the Papall Juriſdiction, to be more favourable and complying with the Prerogative Royall. The former times were tumultuous, and the Pope is gained to joyne with the Crowne to keep the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, though by that means, what the Crowne ſaved to it ſelfe from the people, it loſt to <hi>Rome</hi>: Henceforth the courſe of Affairs grew more civill, or (if you will) graced with a bluſh of Religion: and it was the pollicy of theſe times,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52042:37"/>
whereof we now Treat, to carry a benigne aſpect to the Pope, ſo farre onely as to ſtave him off from being an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whiles Kings drove on a new deſigne to ingratiate and ingage the Churchmen of their owne Nation unto its owne Crowne. This they did by diſtinguiſhing the Office, or Dignity of Epiſcopacy, into the Miniſteriall, and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts; the later they called Prelacy, and was ſuperadded for incouragement of the former, and to make their work more acceptable to men for their Hoſpitalities ſake; for the maintenance whereof, they had large Endowments, and Advancements: And then they reduced them to a right underſtanding of their Originall, which they ſay, is neither <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 E. 3. <hi>Stat.</hi> 6.</note> nor <hi>Romanum,</hi> but that their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, Power, and great Poſſeſſions, were given them by the Kings, and others of this Realm. And that by vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Patronage and cuſtody of the Poſſeſſions in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy ought to belong to the Kings, and other the Founders; and that unto them the right of Election into ſuch advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe belong, and not unto the Pope, nor could he gain other Title unto ſuch power, but by uſurpation, and incroachment upon the right of others. But theſe Great men were not to be wonne by Syllogiſmes; Ordinarily they are begotten between Ambition and Covetouſneſſe, nouriſhed by Riches, and Honour; and like the Needle in the Compaſs, turn ever after that way. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to winne theſe men, heaped Honour and Priviledges upon them, that they might ſee the gleanings of the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> to be better then the vintage of the triple Crown. Doubtleſſe, he was a Prince that knew how to ſet a full va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon Churchmen, eſpecially ſuch as were devout; and it may be, did ſomewhat outreach in that courſe: For though he ſaw God in outward events, more then any of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and diſclaiming all humane merits, reflected much upon Gods mercy, even in ſmaller bleſſings: yet we finde his Letters reflect very much upon the Prayers of his Clergy, and loved to have their Perſons nigh unto him, put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to places of greateſt Truſt, for Honour, and Power, in Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52042:37"/>
that not altogether without cauſe, he had thereby purchaſed unto his Kingdome, the name and repute of being a Kingdome of Preiſts. But all this is but Perſonall, and may give ſome liking to the preſent Incumbents, but not to the Expectants; and therefore the Royall Favor extended ſo far in theſe times, as to bring on the Parliament to give counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the Courts and Judiciary power of the Ordinaries, by the Poſitive Law of the Kingdome, although formerly the Canons had already long ſince made way thereto by practice: I ſhall hereof note theſe few particulars en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing.</p>

               <p>Things formerly bred by the Canon, nouriſhed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall practiſe, allowed by Ordinance of Parliament, or Grant from Kings in Parliament, are now confirmed by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne concurrence of the whole repreſentative Body of the Kingdome, to have and to hold with Warranty.

               <p>The firſt of theſe was an ancient Law, grounded upon great reaſon; although dulled by time, and by covetouſneſſe of the needy Patrons, next to laid aſide, if not quite put out of countenance: So as a new Law muſt be made to revive it, and to aboliſh that corrupt cuſtome, or practice of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predating thoſe Poſſeſſions given to a holy uſe in common ſuppoſall, contrary to the truſt by them undertaken, and the uſe ſtill continuing. But the ſecond Branch is in nature of a Law of Reſtraint, ſet upon the Common Law: for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of theſe Spiritualized men, were of ſo aiery conſtitution, as they could not be holden by hands made out of the Clay, ſuch as the rude Laity were; and therefore the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, upon all occaſions uſed to lay hold upon that, whereof there was ſome feeling, which were called Temporalties, and thereby drew them to appearance at the Lay Courts; for however Spirituall the Clergy were, they would not eaſily part with their Lay Fees. But now by this Law, the times are ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> attenuated, that the very Temporalties are made ſo Spirituall, as not to be medled with by the Lay Magiſtrate, unleſſe upon judgement firſt obtained againſt them.

Theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators thus made, had a greater power then ever the Ordinary had, or could give. For though the Ordinary by the Statute at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> was bound to pay the Debts of the Teſtator, yet could he never bring Action as the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator to all intents by this Law is inabled to doe: And though it be true, that the Adminiſtrator is by this Law ordered to account to the Ordinary, yet doth not that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title the Ordinary to any intereſt in the perſonall Eſtate; but onely gives him a bare authority to take the account, without any compulſory power by Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, to inforce him thereto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is ſuch an account, as is no Evidence in any Court of Record: And Laſtly, if upon the foot of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, any arreare remained, or ſurpluſage of Eſtate; the Ordinary could neither recover, nor order the ſame; becauſe by the Law anciently, the next freinds had the ſole intereſt therein: and being by this Statute made Adminiſtrators,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52042:40"/>
the whole power of ordering the Eſtate is veſted in them.</p>
               <p>To conclude, this Statute was made in favour, and for the eaſe of the Ordinaries, if they would pleaſe ſo to take it, for they could get no benefit by executing the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their owne Perſons, if they intended to Adminiſter according to the Law.</p>

               <p>Theſe condiſcentions might have wedded the Engliſh Clergy to the Engliſh Crowne, but that it was coy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected further gratuities: beſides they beheld their old Stepdame <hi>Rome,</hi> now in its full Splendor and power, and deeply intereſted in the ſway of affaires in this Kingdome, and above all the reſt, the nigh affinity between the Prelate and the Pope was ſuch, that they ſucked one milke, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed one aire, and like the Philoſophers twinns, lived in each other: The later of theſe was not diſcerned by thoſe dim ſighted times, and therefore they could do nothing towards the diſſolution of that knot, but left it to future times, who found no other way then to cut it aſunder: But <hi>Edward</hi> the Third and his ſucceſſor eſpied the firſt, felt the inconvenience thereof, and applyed themſelves to ſuch remedy as they found moſt ready at hand. All things that are ſubject to time are alſo ſubject to change, which comes comonly ſlower upon Governments that are leſs Ecleſiaſtical, for Churches continue longer in a growing condition then in their compleat eſtate, like a Chriſtian that ſeldom endures long after his full ripeneſſe. Thus <hi>England</hi>; its hitherto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a thouſand yeares ſince the Goſpel came to the Saxons, and well nigh a thouſand yeares ſince the Pope ſet his foot amongſt us; ever approaching nigher the Throne, and aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto; but finding it full of a King that would not remove, he ſits downe in his lapp; a heavy burden queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

he was, conſidering his claime of juriſdiction, his pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viſions, penſions, exemptions, impoſitions, and ſuch like oppreſſions; and therefore its no wonder if the King feeling the incumbrance, gives a lift at the Popes power, by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the currant of mony from <hi>England</hi> Rome-wards:<note place="margin">4 E. 3. cap. 6. 5 E. 3. cap. 3.</note> To this end the Statute made at <hi>Carlile</hi> is revived, wherby the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are inhibited from conveying treaſure beyond the Seas; but the Pope knew how to ride, and will not ſo eaſily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go his ſaddle.

But neither witt nor courage to over-rule his luſts, which in the concluſion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled all rule, and brought himſelfe to deſtruction.

Nor was it without Cauſe that their fear was ſuch, for as the Pope had two hands to receive, ſo they had two hearts, making ſhow of forming blowes at the Pope, but then alwayes at a diſtance, or when without the Popes Guard; and thus the Lawes begin to ſtammer and cannot ſpeake ſo plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> as they were wont. The people here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at offended, reſolve to put the Clergy into the Van, and to try their mettle to the full.</p>

And though the Prelates cautionary way of proceeding, might be a principall reaſon why the Popes power held ſo long in <hi>England,</hi> in an uſurping way: yet Kings alſo much conduced thereto, by ſeeking too much their Perſonall eaſe above the Honour of their Place, and the Popes bleſſings, and opinion of his Favour, more then their owne good, or

               <p>Nevertheleſſe, theſe two Comrades, whiles they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, reſolved to make the moſt of each other that they could; and therefore though the Popedome liked not the King, yet the Pope had his love ſo farre, as he could deny himſelfe; for he had already denied his Kingdome:<note place="margin">Antiq.

                  </note> And (if the Articles exhibited againſt the King by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, be true) the Pope had his Faith alſo: For (that he might be rid of his reputed Enemy, Arch Biſhop <hi>Arundell</hi>) he truſted the Pope with that Complement of making <hi>Walden</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in <hi>Arundells</hi> ſtead; which the Pope tooke ſo kindly, as he made it a Preſident for Proviſors for the future. Nor did the King ſtick in this one Singular; but made it his Cuſtome in paſſing of Lawes, (eſpecially, ſuch as the King was moſt devoted unto) to put more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the Popes <hi>Amen,</hi> then in all the Prayers of his Commons, with his owne <hi>Soit fait,</hi> to boot. The ſumme then will be that the Prize was now well begun, concerning the Popes power in <hi>England. Edward</hi> the Third, made a fair blow, and drew blood; <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, ſeconded him, but both retired; the former left the Pope to lick him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf whole, the later gave him a ſalve, and yet it proved a Gangrene in the concluſion.</p>

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:52042:43"/>The ſecond means uſed to bring down the power of the Pope in this Nation, was to abate the power or height of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy: for though the times were not ſo cleare as to eſpy the Root of a Pope in Prelacy, yet experience had taught them, that they were ſo nigh ingaged, that they would not part. And therefore, firſt, they let theſe men know, that Prelacy was no Eſſentiall Member to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Kingdome; but as there was a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed before that ranke was known, ſo there may be the like when it is gone.

Theſe Prelates thus diſcovered, the Parliament depended no more upon them, further then they ſaw meet: At ſixe or ſeven Parliaments, determined matters without their Advice; and ſuch as croſſed the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of theſe men: and therefore in a rationall way might require their Senſe above all the reſt, had they not beene prepoſſeſſed with prejudice, and parties in the matter. Nor
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52042:43"/>
did <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, ever after hold their Preſence at ſo high Repute at ſuch meetings; and therefore Summoned them, or ſo many of them, as he thought meet for the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; ſometimes more, ſomtimes fewer, and at a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in his fourty and ſeventh yeare, he Summoned onely foure Biſhops, and five Abbots. And thus the matter in Fact paſſed in theſe times, albeit the Clergy ſtill made their claim of Vote; and deſired the ſame to be entered upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
               <p>And thus the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> tells all the World,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. <hi>23.</hi> Co.</note> that they hold themſelves compleat without the Clergy, and to all intents and purpoſes, ſufficient to conclude matters concerning the Church, without their Concurrence. Thus began the Mewing time of Prelacy, and the principall Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their wings to fall away, having now flouriſhed in <hi>England</hi> nigh eight hundred years; and had future Ages purſued the flight as it was begun, theſe Lordings might have beaten the Aire, without making any ſpeedy way, or great work, ſaving the noiſe.</p>
               <p>A third ſtep yet was made further, in order to the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the power of the Popedome in <hi>England,</hi> but which ſtumbled moſt immediatly upon the greatnes of the Prelates. For it was the condition of the Spirituall Powers, beſides their height of Calling to be ſet in high Places, ſo as their Title was from Heaven; but their Poſſeſſions, were from men, whereby they gained Lordſhip, Authority, and Power, by way of Appendix to their Spirituall Dignities: This Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition however it might pleaſe them, yet it for a long time ere now had been occaſion of ſuch murmur and grudge in the Commons againſt the Clergy, as though it advanced the Clergy for the preſent, yet it treaſured up a back recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for theſe men, and made them lyable to the diſpleaſure of the Laity, by ſeiſure of their great places: when as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes their Eccleſiaſticall Dignities had been beyond their reach. And of this, theſe times begin now to ſpeak louder then ever, not onely by complaints made in Parliament by the People,<note place="margin">25 E. 3. <hi>R<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52042:44"/>
to the King, that the Kingdome had been now long, and too long time governed by the Clergy, to the diſheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Crown; and therefore prayed, that the principall Offices of the Kingdome, might henceforth be executed by the Laity: and thus the ſtir aroſe between the Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and Spirituall, each prevayling or looſing ground, as they had occaſion to lay the way open for them. The Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> being ſtill upon the upper ground, that as little regarded the Popes Curſe, as the Clergy loved him.</p>
               <p>But the worſt, or rather the beſt, is yet behinde; Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Power, and Honourable places, are but underſetters, or props to this Gourd of Prelacy, that might prove no leſſe prejudiciall by creeping upon the ground, then by perking upward: For ſo long as Error abideth in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Truth can have little ſecurity amongſt Princes; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it cannot be denyed, but its a good ſigne of a clear morning, when the Sun riſing, glorieth upon the top of the Mountains. God gives Commiſſion therefore to a Worme, to ſmite this Gourd in the roote, and ſo at once both Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and Pope, doe wither by undermining. This was <hi>Wickleife,</hi> that had the double Honour of Learning in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Divine Myſteries; the latter of which had for many yeares paſſed obſcurely, as it were in a twilight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the meaner ſort, who had no Indowments to hold it forth amongſt the throng of learned or great men of the World.</p>
               <p>And though the newes thereof did ſound much of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Devotion, Theames unmeet to be propounded to an Age ſcarce Civillized: Yet becauſe divers of them were more immediately reflecting upon the Policy of the Church, wherein all the greater ſort of the Churchmen were much concerned, but the Pope above all the reſt; the acceſſe of all the matter, was made thereby more eaſie to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the great Lords and Princes in the Kingdome, who out of principles of State, were more deeply ingaged againſt the Pope, then others of their ranke formerly had been: Duke <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gant</hi> led the way in this Act, and had a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52042:44"/>
party amongſt the Nobility, that had never red the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law.</p>
               <p>Theſe held forth <hi>Wickleife</hi> and his Learning to the World, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Third himſelf ſavoured it well enough, but in his old Age deſiring his eaſe, was contented to looke on, whiles his Lords Temporall and Spirituall played their Prize, yet giving his plaudite rather to his Sonne, then his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Fathers, as if led by Principles of Nature, rather then Religion: This was the bloſſoming part of the <hi>Wickleifiſts,</hi> but the principall ſtrength was from beneath, where the roots ſpread and faſtned exceedingly, eſpecially in the South, and Eaſtern parts of this Kingdome. <hi>To tell of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Clergy, the Idolatry of their coſtly Worſhip, the vanity of their Curſes, &amp;c.</hi> was exceeding welcome newes to an oppreſſed multitude, eſpecially where theſe things were rightly underſtood. The Iſſue ſoon manifeſted it ſelfe to the World, no Parliament paſſed without reflections at Prelates, <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing; and not onely the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and practices of theſe men, but even their Lawes and Canons, were begun to be had in contempt;<note place="margin">51 E. 3. n. 46.47.</note> and their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives ſleighted. And thus theſe men pretending Patronage, both from Right drawn from Heaven, and derived from men, faile in their Evidence, unleſſe the people doe ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive more then they are able to underſtand.</p>
               <p>No marvell if <hi>Rome</hi> be now rouzed, and that ſort of men that formerly were Wolves in Sheeps clothing, become now red and fiery Dragons, taking up a new courſe of Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Power by Perſecution. This was a way of Power indeed, but its a touchy thing to have to doe with fire, leaſt it gets too high. It is therefore holden a point of diſcretion by the Prelates, not to meddle with the Lords or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People; the former were too great, the later too many: the one ſort would not heare, the other would not underſtand: The Teachers therefore being the Velites, at them they give fire. <hi>Wickleife</hi> their Leader, comes on bravely; and notwithſtanding, they all made at him, he routes them, and in deſpite of them all, comes off fairely,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52042:45"/>
and dies in his bed by the courſe of Nature:<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit.</note> Then an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is levelled at the reſt of the Teachers: This was made of an old Canon, the nature whereof was to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5 Rich. 2. Stat. 2. c. 5.</note>
                  <hi>That upon complaint of the Biſhop, the Kings Writt ſhall be granted, to apprehend Preachers of Hereſies, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and matters of Slander, tending to Diſcord, and Diſcention, betweene the States of this Realme, with their Factors, and Abbettors; and to impriſon them, till they be acquitted according to the Law of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Law (for ſuch it yet appears) gives occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of theſe particulers, <hi>Viz. The Crime, the Delinquents, the manner of Inquiſition, and the penalty.</hi> For the firſt, (not to trouble my way with Debate, about the right of liberty of Preaching) the matter in Fact was, that men did publiquely Preach without Authority, matters of <hi>Theology,</hi> tending (as its ſaid) to ſow diſcord and diſſention; ſo as they are under conſideration &amp; cenſure of the Church-Men, and Canon Law, in one regard, and of the Lawes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Civill Magiſtrate, as diſturbers of the Peace, on the other ſide: and thus the Subjects liberty is caſt into a myſterious, cloudy, and doubtfull poſture, by matters of Opinion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Perſons Delinquent, are alſo left to an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Conſtruction: For they are not onely Preachers in publique, which might be an Order of Men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church Cogniſance as things then ſtood; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it was permitted to the Church, to Authorize Men to preach, but alſo their Factors, and Abbettors; words that might comprehend any other perſon whatſoever, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the paſſion or diſcretion of the Church-men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the manner of this Inquiſition muſt be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Canon, and then the people are at the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens mercy, to returne Complaints againſt whom they pleaſe, upon ſuch Grounds as they ſhall thinke meet. The Perſons that muſt make this Inquiſition by this Law, are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52042:45"/>
the Ordinaries, or any one of them, and for ought appeares the ſame might be done, <hi>by Pope, Councell, generall, Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, Provinciall, Dioceſſan, or their Delegates, according to the Canon</hi>: Although the laſt preſident that I met with, was executed by a Grand Councell of Lords, and Prelates, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. But now the Clergy find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laity, began to ſwell againſt the Canon; they thought it high time to get the Civill Sword to joyne in the worke, to be as their Hands to apprehend, and Goalers to hold in Cuſtody, ſuch as they ſhould complain of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Legall Conviction; although hereby, they not onely diſclaimed the exerciſing of their owne power of Impriſoning, which they by the Canon formerly claimed to have in ſuch Caſes; but alſo acknowledged to receive their power Judicatory in ſuch Caſes from the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Thus was this Ordinance levelled, as I ſaid, but the ſhot fell ſhort: For this Law attained no further perfection, then a meere ſhape, and was complained of by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, within few moneths after its firſt noiſe, that it was made and publiſhed without the Commons conſent,<note place="margin">6 Rich. 2. <hi>Artic.</hi> 52.</note> or knowledge; and that the Nature thereof was directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Liberties of the people; and therefore they prayed that it might be repealed, and the ſame was done accordingly; although the times have been ſuch as would not ſuffer the ſame to come into the publique Booke of Statutes in Print. But whether Statute or no Statute, they tell the King plainly, that they will not further be bound or juſtified by the Prelates, then they, or their Anceſtours were anciently uſed to be; and beſides that, they thought ſomewhat more, which they laid up againſt future times; nor was it long ere they diſcovered it. For a Subſidy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered to the King by the Laity, under a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that the Clergy would grant a tenth; the Clergy tooke this Articulating of the Commons in ſnuffe, and proteſted that the Laity ſhould not charge them. The Commons hereat begin to bid battell, to the Temporalties of the Clergy, and had not the King been a faſt freind in good earneſt unto the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52042:46"/>
Clergy, the Laity had won the Feild. Thus were theſe times like the motion of the Ballance unto the Churchmen, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times up, ſometimes down; getting ſomewhat which they formerly had not, with leſſe aſſurance in what they had.</p>

               <head>CAHP. VII. Concerning Trade.</head>
               <p>KINGS hitherto had lived upon the main ſtocke, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the ſame to the utmoſt penny: few of them laid up for the future, much leſſe indevoured to advance the principall for their ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>There had now beene ten Kings of this Nation ſince the Conqueſt, all of them ſpending what they had, or could get from the people, in the maintenance of their Patrimony, or their own Luſts: if any overplus was either gained by, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the game, their Executors might be the better for it, their Heires were not: but <hi>Edward</hi> the third had a new game to play, he muſt gaine his right by his Sword, or he muſt looſe it; his Spirit was too big to ſit ſtill and bear blows: and yet pre-adviſing himſelfe about the poverty of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that their patience would be ſpent ſoone after their ſupplies, if they continually ſaw much going out, and nothing comming in; he had a rule upon his private expences, a good gloſſe upon the publique, and a platforme for the augmenting of the treaſure of the Kingdome, as well for the benefit of the people, as of the Crowne. In order to the firſt, it is conſiderable, that the Royal family was great and numerous above all his predeceſſors: that beſides the King and Queene who were of a gallant and accompliſht deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they had a ſon, a Prince of as great renoune as ever Prince had, and he alſo family ſutable to his generoſity: that they had other children, every on like their Father, both for Warr and Peace; and that for the maintenance of all theſe, the expences muſt be in reaſon larger then formerly they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52042:46"/>
were wont to be; nevertheleſſe; becauſe purveyance for the King had already ſwelled ſo big, that all other oppreſſions ſeemed to be ſwallowed up into that one, the King to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the rigor thereof made nigh twenty Statutes,<note place="margin">4 E. 3. cap. 4. 14 E. 3. c. 19. 34 E. 3. cap. 2. 36 E. 3. cap. 2.5, 6.</note> firſt exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all ſervants at wages; and Horſes and Dogs which were put to board with the Sheriffs: then reducing the purveyance only to the families of himſelfe, his wife, and children, then to the families of himſelfe, the Queen, and Prince: and in the levy hereof, ſome mens eſtates were abſolutely priviledged, and ſome kind of goods, as ſheep before ſhearing,<note place="margin">14 E. 3. cap. 1. 24 E. 3. cap. 6. &amp; 15. 4 E. 3. cap. 4. 14 E. 3. c. 19. 36 E. 3. c. 3. 4 E 3. cap. 3. 28 E. 3. c. 12.</note> and trees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the dwelling houſe. Nor is the ſettling of the manner leſſe conſiderable. It muſt be levied by authority in writing under the ſeale: and it muſt not be taken againſt the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will, or upon malice; nor muſt be ſpared for reward; the price muſt be the ſame with the true Market price; the meaſure according to the common meaſure ſtricked, and the payment muſt be immediatly, if the price be under twenty Shillings, if above,<note place="margin">36 E. 3. cap. 2.</note> it muſt be made in a quarter of a year, and no man muſt charge more carrige then is neceſſary, and thus was this wild Ivie of purveyance that like ſome kinds of plants ſpreads over all, by rooting up and cutting downe brought into ſome kind of faſhion, that if did no good it might do the leſſe hurt unto the People.</p>
               <p>Secondly, although it be true that <hi>Edward</hi> the third was a King of many taxes above all his predeceſſors, yet cannot this be imputed as a blot to the honour of the Law, or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people; for the King was not ſo unwiſe as either to deſire it without evident cauſe, or to ſpend it in ſecret or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne private intereſts, nor ſo weak and irreſolved as not to imploy himſelfe and his Souldiers to the utmoſt to bring to paſſe his pretentions, nor ſo unhappy as to faile of the deſirable iſſue of what he took in hand: ſo as though the people parted with much money, yet the Kingdome gained much honour and renoune, and becomming a terror to their neighboures, injoyed what they had in fuller ſecurity and ſo were no looſers by the bargaine in the concluſion. Secondly, although they parted with much, yet nothing to Prerogative
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52042:47"/>
but in a Parliamentary way; and ſo it was not taken but given. Thirdly, though the taxes were frequent, yet but light; for frequent light taxes ſteal inſenſibly without regret, and as they grow into matters of courſe, ſo they meete with acceptance of courſe. Two things made them of light account. Firſt, they were not taxes altogether of Money in kind, but of goods, ſuch as the ſheafe and fleece, and ſuch like things, whereof the ownerſhip is viſible, whereas many are ſuppoſed to have Money which have it not, but muſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it or ſell their goods at an under rate many times to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it for the payment of their Taxes.<note place="margin">5 E. 3. c. 6.</note> Secondly, theſe Taxes were aſſeſſed by the Neighborhood, and not upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Survey, by Commiſſioners, who many times are ſubject to miſcarry upon grounds of private Intereſt, or for want of due information, or by making more haſte then good ſpeed.</p>
               <p>Theſe Taxes likewiſe were reduced to the ancient rule, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the firſt. And thus did this King ſhew himſelf truely Royall in demanding his Taxes upon evident grounds of State, levying them with a tender hand,<note place="margin">25 E. 3. c. 11.</note> and imploying them to their right end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that which digeſted all, and bred good blood, was in that the people had <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> by the advance of Trade, wherein the King ſhewed himſelfe the Cape Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of the World. Certainly, mens parts in theſe times were of vaſt reach, that could manage ſuch Warres, ſettle ſuch a Government, and lay ſuch a foundation of a treaſury by Trade, a thing neceſſary to this Iſland, next unto its owne being, as may appear, not onely in regard of the riches of this Nation, but in regard of the ſtrength thereof: And in regard of the maintenance of the Crowne; the two later of which being no other then a naturall effluence of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it will be ſufficient to touch the ſame in order to the thing in hand. Now as touching that, its evident that the riches of any Nation are ſupported by the Conjuncture of three regards.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the naturall Commodities of the Nation may be improved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:52042:47"/>Secondly, that the poorer ſort of people, be ſet a worke.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the value of money be rightly ballanced.</p>
               <p>For as on the one part, though the people be never ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, if the naturall Commodities of the Iſland be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by their labour, the people can never grow much richer, then barely for ſubſiſtance during their labour: ſo neither can the improvement of the naturall Commodity inrich the Kingdome, ſo long as many mouthes are fed upon the main ſtock, and waſte the ſame by idleneſſe, and prodigality: Nor though both theſe ſhould concurre, yet cannot the Kingdome be ſaid truly to be rich, unleſſe by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe and traffique, there be an emptying out of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of ſuch Commodities by way of barter, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. for ſuch Forrain Commodities, whereof this Nation ſtandeth in moſt need, for ſupply of all occaſions. For God hath ſo attempered the whole Regiment of the earth, in ſuch manner, that no one Nation under Heaven, can well and comfortably ſubſiſt in, and by it ſelf, but all muſt give and receive mutuall Commodity from each other: otherwiſe, ſuperfluity would make any Commodity (though in it ſelf never ſo precious) vile; and little conducible to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of the Nation. Now for the compaſſing of all theſe, the Wiſe men of theſe times, firſt tooke into their conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the principall Commodities of this Kingdome,<note place="margin">2 E. 3. cap. 9.</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they found them impounded in the Staple, they ſet all at liberty to buy and ſell the ſame as they pleaſed: And thus began a Free Trade of Wooll, throughout the Realme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and matter for imployment by every man that would: but this continued not long. The people ſoon had Commodity enough for work, and Kings liked too well of the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that liberty, in order to their owne benefit, and ſoon found out occaſions to reconcile the reaſon of State with their own Intereſts, and at length ſettled the Staple in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places in ſeverall parts of the Kingdome;<note place="margin">27 E. 3. cap. 3.</note> but this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended onely unto the Commodities of Wooll, Leather, and Lead; for as yet the Manufactures were not come to Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52042:48"/>
Secondly, the indeavour was to advance Manufacture, and principally ſuch of them as are made of the Staple Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, amongſt all which, Wooll had the precedency, as being the moſt principall and ancient Commodity of the Kingdome; and the Manufacture of Wooll of long uſe, but had received little encouragement before theſe times. For that it formerly had been the principall flower in the <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Garden, and nouriſhed from this Nation, by the continuall ſupply of Wooll that it received from hence, which was the principall cauſe of the ancient League between the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and this Crowne. But <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, was now too well acquainted with the <hi>Flemings</hi> Affaires, by a joynt Engagement with them in the Wars with <hi>France,</hi> and therein had gained ſo good an opinion amongſt them, that he might adventure to change a Complement for a Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. The Staples beyond the Sea were now taken away, he now inhibiteth the Importation of Forraine Cloathes, and having gained theſe two ſteps onward his way, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the <hi>Flemings</hi> their unſettled Condition,<note place="margin">11 E. 3. cap. 2.3, 5.</note> by theſe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Warres with <hi>France,</hi> the peaceable Condition of <hi>England,</hi> and Freedome of the People; then propounds to them an Invitation to come over into <hi>England,</hi> promiſeth them ſhare and ſhare like with his own People, with ſuch other Immunities, as they take his offer, come over, and brought their Manufacture with them, which could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after be recalled: So as now the Wooll, and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture dwell together, and like to Man and Wife, ſo long as they care for one another, both will thrive, but if they come to play their games apart; both will be looſers in the Concluſion.</p>
               <p>The third ſtep to the advance of Trade, was the Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſurpluſage of the Staple Commodities, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained over and beſides that proportion that ſhould ſuffice for the Manufactures; to which end, it was ordered, that no Wooll ſhould be Exported till it had remained at the Staple by the ſpace of fifteen dayes.<note place="margin">31 E. 3. c. 8.</note> That time was neceſſary, and longer time might have been Convenient, but that the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52042:48"/>
Markets beyond the Sea could not be delayed longer time, without much damage to the Merchant and Owner, for as much as Winter time is no time to prepare Wooll for the Manufacture, and by over long continuance of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity upon the hand of the Merchant, or Owner, both the Commodity, and the Manufacture might ſurfet, lye in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, and Trade choked thereby. For its a neceſſary prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative to Trade, to keep the Nation in ſome kinde of hunger after the Staple Commodities, ſo as the main ſtock be not too great to occupy, and yet to leave enough to uſe. But becauſe this Nation formerly had been, and as yet were uſed too much to Forrain Manufactures, the importing of which, did debaſe the Home made Manufactures, and diſcouraged that work; therefore the Law was made to reduce the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Apparrell, (which infected theſe times) to more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety.</p>
               <p>Some delight in Forrain Commodities, and Manufactures, is doubtleſſe profitable both for Trade and Shipping; ſo as what is Imported, exceeds not what is Exported: for too much of that makes the Domeſtick Commodity contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Nation poore, and the People want work, becauſe its a noted vanity of this Nation, That they love things far fetcht, and dear bought. As a cure therefore to this diſeaſe,<note place="margin">43 E. 3. cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloath by Law is injoyned to be worn by all Perſons,<note place="margin">11 E. 3. c. 2, 3.</note> under the Degree of a Lord, and ſo the former Inhibition of Importation of Forrain Cloathes was ſtrengthened thereby. And becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clothiers ſhould not take advantage hereby, to raiſ the price of their Cloathes to their own cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous pin:<note place="margin">27 E. 3. c. 4. 7 Rich. 2. c. 9. 17 Rich. 2. cap. 2. 50 E. 3. c. 7.</note> Therefore the Law alſo ſettled a certain price and meaſure, &amp; the ſame before ſale was to be allowed upon view, and for the goodneſſe of the Cloathes, and perfect working thereof; Lawes were likewiſe made againſt Exportation of all ſuch as were not perfectly made.</p>
               <p>A fourth ſtep in the advancement of Trade, was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> men to work; for when publique imployment calls men forth for ſervice in the Feild; their minds once in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, or upon the Wing, can hardly ſettle any where, or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52042:49"/>
ſtoop to the Perke again, unleſſe upon hope of prey or gain to be gotton thereby. Such were the times of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, wherein partly for that cauſe, and partly for the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of men left from the Sword and Peſtilence, not onely work-men were ſcarce and deare, but even the Maſſe it ſelf was grown ſtately, the private delights of Kings and great Men, and ſcarce vouchſafeing to be ſeen by common gaze, but at a great diſtance: The Prieſts had little Charity, and the Poore had as little money; ſo as no penny, no <hi>Pater Noſter.</hi> A ſick and very crazy time queſtionleſſe was it, when the Clergy were ſtately,<note place="margin">36 E. 3. c. 8.</note> and the Poore idle. The Preiſts wages for this cauſe are now ſettled, and they that would get much, muſt get many littles, and doe much: but the greater ſore was amongſt the poorer ſort; either they would not ſerve,<note place="margin">23. &amp; 25. E. 3. 2 Rich. 2. c. 8.</note> or at ſuch wages, as could not conſiſt with the price of the Cloaths, and the ſubſiſtance of the Clothier. Lawes therefore are made to compell them to work, and to ſettle their wages; ſo as now its as beneficiall to them to ſerve the meaner ſort of Clothiers, as the richer ſort: For the Maſter muſt give no more, nor the Servant take more, and thus became labour currant in all places.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A fifth means to advance Trade, was the ſetling of a Rule upon Exportation, and Importation: this wrought a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect, <hi>Viz.</hi> The inriching of this Kingdome with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Commodities, and the maintaining of Shipping, which was and is a principall means, not onely of riches, but of ſtrength unto all Sea bordering Countries, eſpecially regard being had to theſe three Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that Importation do bring in more profit, then Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation disburſeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that both Exportation, and Importation be made by Shipping belonging to this Nation, fo farre as may conſiſt with the benefit of this Nation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the Exportation be regulated to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, ſaving the main ſtock at home. The truth of the firſt will be evident from this ground, That no Nation can be rich that receives more dead Commodities from abroad, then
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52042:49"/>
it can ſpend at home, or vend into Forrain parts, eſpecially if it be vended in its proper kinde, and not in money;<note place="margin">27 E. 3.</note> and therefore the Lawes provided that no Merchant ſhould Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port more money then he Importeth, and what he doth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port muſt be of the new ſtamp, which it ſeemeth was infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in vallue to the old: yet the times may prove ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious, that this rule may be waved for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is no leſſe beneficiall; for as it is in Warre, ſo in all Trades; the greater the number is that is imployed, the more effectuall the iſſue will be: and therefore though it in the generall be more beneficiall, that all Exportation and Importation might be by our own ſhipping; yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard times may be ſuch, as now they were, that the ſhipping of this Nation, is more then ordinarily imployed for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the State: And that every Nation ſtriveth to have the benefit of Exportation by Veſſels of their owne.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, in regard the caſe may be ſuch, as Importation may be, at a cheaper rate by Forrain Veſſels, and Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion likewiſe may for the time be more prejudiciall to this Nation, if done by our own ſhipping, then thoſe of other Nations. Therefore the courſe muſt be changed, ſo far forth as will ſtand with the occaſions of the State, and common profit of this Nation. And for theſe cauſes, and ſuch like,<note place="margin">27 E. 3. 43 E. 3. c. 1. 5 Rich. 2. c. 3. 6 Rich. 2. c. 8. 14 Rich. 2. c. 5</note> in the times whereof we now Treat, the Lawes often varied; ſometimes no Staple Commoditie muſt be Exported in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> bottomes; ſometimes all muſt be done by them, and within a yeare again that liberty was reſtrained; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, liberty given to Forrainers to Export as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt Conſideration is as neceſſary as any of the former; for if Trade be maintained out of the maine Stock the Kingdome in time muſt needs be brought to penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe it is their Magazine:<note place="margin">31 E. 3. c. 8.</note> and for this cauſe it was provided, that all Wooll ſhould remaine at the Staple 15 dayes, to the end it might be for the Kingdomes uſe: if any one would buy, they muſt doe it within that time, otherwiſe it might be Exported.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:52042:50"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The ſixth means of advancement of Trade, was the ſettling of the Staple; for as it was an incouragement to the firſt eſtabliſhing of the Manufacture, that the Staples were let looſe, ſo when the Manufactures had taken roote, the Staple eſpecially now fixed to places within this Kingdome, brought much more incouragement thereto.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for preſerving a full Market, for whiles the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity lies ſcattered in all places, the Market muſt needs be the leaner; partly in regard the Commodity lies in obſcurity, and partly becauſe when it is known where, yet its not eaſily diſcovered whether it be vendible or not; and beſides ſmall parcells are not for every mans labour, and the greater are not for every mans money.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Staples are convenient for the ſtating of the generall price of the Commodities; in regard the quantity of the Commodity is thereby the more eaſily diſcovered, which commonly maketh the price. And the quantity of the Commodity thus diſcovered will not onely ſettle the price to it ſelfe, but alſo ballance the price of the Manufacture.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Staple having thus diſcovered the quantity of the Commodity, will be a ready way to ſettle the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the main Stock that muſt be preſerved, and regulate Exportation as touching the overplus. But it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that the firſt and principall mover of the making of the Staple, was the benefit of the Crown: for when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity was gone beyond the Sea, it importeth not to the Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> whether the ſame be ſold at one place, or more, or in what place the ſame be ſettled, untill the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture was grown to ſome ſtature; and then the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Litigious. The benefit of Exportation, pretended much intereſt in the ſettling thereof beyond the Sea, but in truth it was another matter of State; for when it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſea, it was a moveable Engine to Convey the Kings pleaſure or diſpleaſure, as the King pleaſed; for it was a great benefit to the Countrey, or place where ever it ſettled; or elſe it moved or ſtayed according to the inclination of the people where it was, either for Warre, or Peace. But on
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52042:50"/>
the contrary, the Intereſt of the People began to interpoſe ſtrongly: and for theſe Cauſes the Parliament likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termed<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed in the place; and thus the Scene is altered: ſome times its beyond the Seas, in one place, or in another: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in <hi>England.</hi> In <hi>Edward</hi> the Thirds time,<note place="margin">43 E. 3. cap. 1. 12 Rich. 2. cap. 16. 14 Rich. 2. cap. 11.</note> we finde it ſometimes at <hi>Calis,</hi> ſometimes in <hi>England,</hi>: In <hi>Richard</hi> the Seconds time; we finde it again beyond the Seas, at <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> thence removed to <hi>Calis,</hi> and after into <hi>England</hi>: where at length the People underſtood themſelves ſo well, that the Parliament ſettled the ſame, it being found to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome for the Manufactures to travell t<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Staple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, for the Commodity that grew at their owne doores, beſides the inhancing of the price, by reaſon of the carriage, which falling alſo upon the Manufactures, muſt needs tend to the damage of the whole Kingdome. This was one way indeed, and yet poſſibly another might have been found; for if a Computation had been made of the main Stock, and a Staple ſettled within the Kingdom for that, and the overplus exported to a Staple beyond the Sea, it might have proved no leſſe commodious, and more complying. It is very true, that there are many that call for the liberty of the People, that every man may ſell his own Commodity as he pleaſes; and it were well that men would conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well in their Relations, as in their own Perſonall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: for if every man were independent, his liberty would be in like manner independent; but ſo long as any man is a Member of a Common-wealth, his liberty muſt likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the good of the Common-wealth; and if it be not good for the Nation, that every man ſhould ſell his owne Commodity as he pleaſeth; he may claim the liberty as a Free man but not as an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man; nor is that liberty juſt, ſo long as his Countrey hath an intereſt in his Commodity for its ſafety and welfare, as in his own perſon. I doe not aſſert the manner of buying the Staple Commodities, by Merchants of the Staple, to ſell the ſame again in kinde, for their private advantage; divers limitations muſt concur to ſave it from an unlawfull ingroſſing; nor doth it appear to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52042:51"/>
me that the Staplers in theſe times uſed ſuch courſe, or were other then meer Officers for the regulating of the Staple, in nature of a Court of Piepouders, belonging to ſome Faire or Market. Nevertheleſſe, I conjecture that it may well be made evident from Principles of State, that Mart, Markets, and Staples of Commodities, that are of the proper Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of this Nation, are as neceſſary to Trade, as Conduits are to places that want water.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The ſeventh and laſt means that was ſet on foot in theſe times; for the advance of Trade, was the regulating of the Mint, and the current of Money. This is the life and ſoule of Trade, for though exchange of Commodities may doe much, yet it cannot be for all, becauſe it is not the lot of all to have exchangeable Commodities, nor to work for Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and Victuall. Now in the managing of this tricke of Money, two things are principally looked unto; Firſt, that the Money be good and currant. Secondly, that it ſhould be plentifull.<note place="margin">25 E. 3. Stat. 5 cap. 13. 6 E. 3. cap. 2. &amp; 3.</note> As touching the excellency of the Money, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Rules were made, as againſt imbaſing of Money, againſt Forrain Money not made currant, againſt counterfeit and falſe Money: For according to the goodneſſe of the Money, ſo will the Trade be more or leſſe, for the Merchant will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looſe in the price of his Commodity in Money, then in exchange for other Commodity, becauſe the vallue thereof is leſſe certain, and the Tranſportation more chargeable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as touching the plentie of Money, that is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the advance of the Trade, as of the goodneſs of it: for according to the plenty thereof, will be the plenty of the Manufactures, becauſe Handy-crafts men having no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities but their labour, cannot work for exchange, nor can exchange ſupply Rents and maintenance to the greater ſort of people.<note place="margin">6 E. 3. c. 2, 3. 17 Rich. 2. cap. 1.</note> To this end therefore it is provided againſt melting of Money, and Exportation of Silver and Gold: And yet to incourage or not diſcourage Importation of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold, liberty was given to every man to Export ſo much as they did Import, provided that what they carry away, muſt be of the new ſtamp, or Minted in this Nation.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52042:51"/>
By this means Bullion came in with probability,<note place="margin">27 E. 3.</note> that much thereof would remain in the Nation in liew of Commodities exported, or if not, the greater part; yet at leaſt the Mint gained, and that was ſome benefit to the Nation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for the fuller currence of the Money, the Mint was eſtabliſhed in ſeverall parts of this Kingdome, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ancient cuſtome, and this was advantageous both to the Mint, and to the ſtocke of Money in the Kingdome. This eſtabliſhment was with this difference,<note place="margin">18 E. 3. c. 6.</note> that though the Mint was ſettled by the Parliament, yet the Exchange was left to the Directory of the King and his Councell;<note place="margin">18 E. 3. cap. 6. 25 E. 3. Stat. 5. cap. 12.</note> becauſe the Exchange is an uncertain thing, ſubject to ſudden alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in other Nations, and its neceſſary that in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, it be as ſuddenly ballanced, with the Exchange in other Countreyes, or in a ſhort time, the Nation may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive extreame damage. In regard whereof, and many other ſudden exigencies in Trade, it ſeemeth to me convenient, That a particular Councell were eſtabliſhed for continuall influence into all parts of theſe Dominions, to take into conſideration the quantity of the Staple Commodities, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be retained as a Stock at home, for the uſe of the People, and the Manufactures; and accordingly to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Trade of Exportation and Importation; by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, and inlarging, or ſhutting, and ſtraitning the Streame, as occaſion doth require.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, to watch the courſe of the Exchange in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Parts, and to parallell the courſe thereof, in this Land thereto: For otherwiſe, the Publique muſt neceſſarily ſuffer ſo long, as Private men ſeeke their own particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, onely in their courſe of Trade.</p>

               <p>AS times change manners, ſo doe manners change Lawes: For its the wiſedome of a State, when it cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule occaſion to purſue and turn it to the beſt iſſue it can. Multitude of Lawes therefore are not ſo much a ſore to the People, as a Symptome of a ſore People; yet many times Lawes are ſaid to be many, when as they are but one, branched into many Particulars, for the clearing of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples underſtanding, (who uſually are not excellent in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing,) and ſo becomes as new Plaiſters made of an old Salve, for ſores that never brake out before. Such ſore times were theſe, whereof we now Treate, wherein every touch made a wound, and every wound went to the heart, and made the Category of Treaſon ſwell to that bigneſſe, that it became an <hi>individuum vagum,</hi> beyond all rule, but the preſent ſence of timerous Judges, and a touchy King. Thus were many of the ignorant and wel meaning people in an hideous danger of the gulfe of forfeiture before they found themſelves nigh the brimme.</p>
               <p>All men do agree that treaſon is a wound of Majeſty, but all the doubt is, where this Majeſty reſteth originally, and what is that legiance which is due therto, the breach where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of amounteth to ſo high a cenſure; for ſome men place all Majeſty in one man, whom they call an abſolute Monarch. Others in the great men, and others in the people, and ſome in the concurrence of the King and body of the people: and it is a wild way to determine all in one concluſion, when as the ſame dependeth wholy upon the conſtitution of the body; looke then upon <hi>England</hi> in the laſt poſture, as the rigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſort of monarchiall polititians do, and Majeſty will never be in glory, but in the concurrence of the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

or convention of Eſtates, &amp; ſo upon the whol account it wil be upon the people, whoſe welfare is the ſupream Law. <hi>Rome</hi> had Kings, Conſuls, Dictators, Decemviri, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes long before the Orators time, and he ſaw the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Empire, or perpetuall Dictatorſhip in the perſon of the firſt of the <hi>Caeſars</hi>; any of all which might have challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſupremacy of Majeſty above the people: and yet the often change of Government ſhewed plainly that it reſted upon another pinne; and the Orator in expreſſe words no leſſe; when ſpeaking of the Majeſty of that Government, he allotteth it not to thoſe in cheife command, but defineth it to be, <hi>magnitudo populi Romani</hi>;<note place="margin">Cic. partit.

                  </note> that if the proper ſeat of Majeſty was in the people of <hi>Rome</hi> when Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours were in their fulleſt glory, its no defacing of Majeſty in <hi>England</hi> to ſeat it upon the whole body, from whom the ſame is contracted in the repreſentative and ſo much thereof divided unto the perſon of the King, as any one member is capable of, according to the work allotted unto him. Theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſeats of Majeſty making alſo ſo many degrees do alſo imply as many degrees of wounding, for its writen in nature, that the offence tending to the immediate deſtruction of the whol body is greater then that which deſtroyeth any one member only, and when the written Law maketh it treaſon to compaſſe the deſtruction of the Kings Perſon, it leaveth it obvious to common ſenſe, that its a higher degree of Treaſon to compaſſe the deſtruction of the repreſentative, and above all, to deſtroy the whole body of the People; crimes that never entred into the conceit of wickedneſſe it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52042:53"/>
ſelfe in thoſe more innocent times; much leſſe ſaw they any cauſe to mention the penalty by any written Law. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe becauſe many ſadd examples had accurred within the memory of this preſent age, of the danger of the perſon and honor of Kings; and yet on the otherſide they ſaw that in ſuch caſes of Treaſon the Kings honor was made of retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leather, and might eaſily be ſtrained within the compaſſe of a wound of Majeſty: therefore <hi>Edward</hi> the third imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Tiberius,</hi> reduced the crime of wound of Majeſty in the Perſon of the King, into certaine particular inſtances, out of the compaſſe whereof, the Judges of the Law in ordinary courſe muſt not determine Treaſon. Theſe concerne either the ſafety of the Perſon of the King, or of the ſucceſſion in the Royall Throne;<note place="margin">25 E. 3. Stat 5. cap. 2.</note> or laſtly, the ſafegard of the publique right by the board and privy ſeale, the vallue of Mony, and by perſons in matters of judicature judicially preſiding, all of them reflecting upon the King, conſidered in his politick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; for otherwiſe many crimes might have beene menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, more fatally reflecting upon the King in his naturall capacity, which nevertheleſs are omitted as not worthy of ſo high a cenſure.<note place="margin">17 R. 2. n. 20, 21. 3 R. 2. n. 18. 22 <hi>Aſs. pl.</hi> 29. <hi>Stat.</hi> 11 R. 2.</note> Other Treaſons are left to the determination of the Parliament as occaſion ſhould offer it ſelfe, whereof divers examples of a new ſtamp accurred within forty yeares next enſuing, which were of a temporary regard, and lived and died with the times.</p>
               <p>To theſe two notions of Majeſty and treaſon, I muſt add a third, called Legiance, for it is that which maketh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to be ſuch indeed, and lifteth it into the Throne, and whereof the higheſt breach makes Treaſon: and becauſe that which hath been already ſayd reflecteth upon an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rather a knot of opinions (for I find them not punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adjudged) in <hi>Calvins</hi> caſe, I muſt a little demur to them, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe as their ſenſe is commonly taken; it alters the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental nature of the Government of this nation from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal to a pure Monarchy. In handling of this caſe the ho. Reporter took leave to range into a generall diſcourſe of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, although not directly within the concluſion of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52042:53"/>
caſe; and therin firſt ſets down the general nature therof, that it is a mutual bond between an Engliſh King and his people; and then more particularly ſets forth the nature of this bond in the ſeverall duties of obedience and fealty, fo. 5. a. and thoſe alſo in their ſeverall properties, <hi>Viz.</hi> naturall, abſolute, fo. 7. a. due to the King, <hi>omni ſoli &amp; ſemper,</hi> fo. 12. a. in his naturall and not politick capacity, fo. 10. a. whereas he ſaith, this bond is natural, he meaneth that its due by birth, fo. 7. a. By abſolute (if I miſtake him not) he meaneth, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, fo. 5. b. <hi>Viz.</hi> not circumſcribed by Law, but above Law, and before Law, fo. 13. a. and that Laws were after made to inforce the ſame by penalties, fo. 13. b. and therefore he concludeth that this legiance is immutable, fo. 13. b. and fo. 14. a.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſtated the point as truely as I can, both for the nature of legiance, and the object thereof, <hi>Viz.</hi> the King, and not the people, otherwiſe then in order to the ſafety and honor of the Kings Perſon, conſidered in his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall capacity as he is a man; I ſhall in the next place examine the grounds as they are ſeverally ſet down, and therein ſhall lead the Reader no further then the Reporters owne conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Not troubling the Reader with any doubt, whether this bond conſiſts in obedience only, or in that fealty: and in all ſhall ever be mindfull of the honour of that Pen with which I have to deale.</p>
               <p>Firſt, whereas it is ſaid, that Engliſh legiance is naturall, and grounded upon the birth of each party within the Kings dominions and protection, it needeth no debate, ſo as the ſame be taken, <hi>ſano ſenſu, Viz.</hi> for a qualified legiance beared of thoſe ſublimities of abſolute, indefinite, immutable, &amp;c. for otherwiſe if ſuch a high ſtrain of legiance be due from every Engliſh man by birth; then all the <hi>Magna carta,</hi> or laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the liberties of the People come too late to qualifie the ſame, becauſe they cannot take away the Law of nature, <hi>f.</hi> 14. <hi>a.</hi> and thus the party once born Engliſh muſt for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main abſolutely obleiged to the King of <hi>England</hi> although haply he lives not two Months under his protection all his enſuing life time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:52042:54"/>Secondly, the legiance of an Engliſh man to his King ariſeth from that civil relation between the two callings of King and ſubject, and therefore it is not a naturall bond which cannot be taken away. The firſt is true by the Reporters owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions; <hi>Protectio trahit ſubjectionem, &amp; ſubjecti oprotectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>; ſo he ſaith, <hi>fo.</hi> 5. <hi>a. fo.</hi> 9. <hi>b.</hi> and therefore though it be granted that Magiſtracy in general is from nature, as he ſaith, <hi>fo.</hi> 13. <hi>a.</hi> yet of weak birth is that inference which he maketh, <hi>Viz.</hi> That Engliſh allegiance is a principle in nature. Unleſſe it be alſo admitted that all men on earth that ſubmit not to Engliſh legiance do ſinne againſt nature. The difference then will ſtand thus, Magiſtracy is founded in nature, therefore legiance alſo. But Engliſh Magiſtracy is from civil conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore is Engliſh legiance of the like nature. In the next place, the Reporter ſaith, that before any municiple Law was made, Kings did <hi>dare jura,</hi> and he mounts as high for an example as the Trojans age by the teſtimony of <hi>Virgil:</hi> but I beleeve he intended not much ſtrength in this, ſeeing its wel known by any that knows the ſcriptures, that there were mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal laws given, and that concerning the office of a King by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was more ancient then thoſe of <hi>Troy,</hi> and long before the time of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who neither tels us in what manner thoſe Trojan Laws were made, though the Kings gave them, nor if al were according to the Reporters ſenſe is the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a Poet (who ſomtimes uſeth his <hi>poetica licentia</hi>) to be taken in <hi>terminis,</hi> in the next place, the Reporter vouches the teſtimony of <hi>Forteſcue, c.</hi> 12 &amp; 13. which is as abſolutely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the maine point in hand, as any Penn can declare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he tels us of divers ſorts of Kingdomes, ſome gotten by conqueſt, as thoſe of <hi>Nimrod</hi> and <hi>Belus,</hi> &amp;c. But ſaith he, there is a Kingdome politick, which is by the aſſociation o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> men by conſent of Law, making one cheife, who is made for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Law, and of his ſubjects bodies and Eſtates, and he cannot govern by any other power, and of this nature, ſaith he, the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> is, <hi>fo.</hi> 30.31.32. A ſecond peice of the foundation of this opinion of the Reporter is taken, <hi>ab inane,</hi> it is a vaine thing, ſaith he, to preſcribe Laws
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52042:54"/>
but where by legiance foregoing, people are bound to obey: but this compared with the words of <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> formerly mentioned, falls of it ſelfe to duſt, and therefore I ſhall not further inlarge concerning it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Reporter brings in to helpe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the conſent of the Law in elder times, by certaine caſes vouched to that purpoſe; the firſt concerning the Legiance of Children to Parents, which commeth not to this caſe, becauſe it is a legiance of nature, and this legiance whereof we ſpeake is yet under a litigious title. And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe will in the concluſion be found to reſt only upon a civil conſtitution, therefore I leave that. The ſecond is, that a man attainted and outlawed, is nevertheleſſe within the Kings protection for this (ſaith the Reporter) is a Law of nature, <hi>Indelibilis &amp; immutabilis,</hi> and the Parliament nor Statute can take this power away, <hi>fol.</hi> 13. <hi>b.</hi> 14. <hi>a.</hi> and therefore the Reporter concludes, that as well the Legiance of the ſubject as the protection of him by the King are both of them from the Law of nature. An opinion that ſpeakes much mercy, yet it ſeemes ſtrange, conſidering the penne, for if it be a Law of nature, and immutable, for the King to protect Perſons attainted, then muſt no ſuch Perſon ſuffer, for if he be under the Kings protection, that, being by a Law of nature, cannot be changed by any poſitive Law, as the Reporter ſaith, nor can the King, be ſo bound, by any ſuch Statute, but by a <hi>nonobſtante,</hi> he can ſet himſelfe at liberty when he pleaſeth, &amp; then the iſſue will be this, the King hath a naturall power to protect the Perſons of Law-breakers, from the power of the Law, therefore much more their Eſtates; and then farewell all Law, but this of the Kings naturall protection. I ſay that theſe are of a high ſtraine, conſidering what the Reporter ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">11. <hi>Co. fo.</hi> 88. 8. <hi>Co. fo.</hi> 20. 4. <hi>Co. fo.</hi> 35. 7. <hi>Co. fo.</hi> 36.</note> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. But to perſue his inſtance, he ſaith, that the King hath power, to protect an attainted perſon, that if any man kill him without warrant he is a manſlayer; and yet this Perſon attainted hath loſt the legall Protection. Its true, yet not to all intents, for by the ſentence of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52042:55"/>
Law, his life is bound up under the Law of that Sentence, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">35 H. 6.63.</note> 
                  <hi>That he must not ſuffer in other manner then the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence determineth, nor before warrant of Execution iſſue forth to that end.</hi> And notwithſtanding the Sentence, yet the Law leaveth him a liberty of Purchaſe, or Inheritance, though to the uſe of the Crowne, and therefore in ſome reſpects, the Law protects his Perſon ſo long as he lives, and the Kings Naturall Protection is in vaine in ſuch Caſes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſuppoſe the King hath a power of <hi>Nonobſtante,</hi> if the ſame be allowed to him in a limited way by the Law, it is no argument to prove the Kings naturall Power which is driven at under naturall Legiance, much leſſe if it cannot be made forth that the Law doth allow any ſuch power of <hi>Nonobſtante</hi> at all; but by the iniquity of the times, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſame to ſubſiſt, onely to avoyd Contention, as it came into this Kingdome by way of Uſurpation. And thus I have onely diſcovered the Foundation of this firſt qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which I ſhall onely leave naked, ſuppoſing that no man ſeeing it, will build at all thereupon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond property that commeth to be conſidered, is, <hi>That Engliſh Legiance is abſolute, fol.</hi> 5. <hi>b. fol.</hi> 7. <hi>a.</hi> which is a word of a vaſt extent, ſerving rather to amaze mens appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, then to inlighten them; and therefore the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter did well not to trouble himſelf or the Reader, in the clearing or proof thereof, but left the Point rather to be beleived, then underſtood, nor ſhall I in the Negative; for God himſelf can have no other Legiance from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, then abſolute Legiance; and Kings being (as other men) ſubject to erre, eſpecially in this Point of Prerogative, are much rather ſubject thereto, being miſled by ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as theſe are;<note place="margin">Act. 14.19.</note> The Scripture determines this Point, and cuts the knot in ſunder.</p>
               <p>The third property of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Legiance, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter inſiſteth upon, is that it is indefinite; which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth to be <hi>Proprium quarto modo,</hi> ſo as it is both Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall and Immutable, <hi>fol.</hi> 5. <hi>b. fol.</hi> 12. and neither defined
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52042:55"/>
by Time, Place, or Perſon: As touching the Time, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Reporter inlarged not at all, therefore I ſhall onely leave the Reader to chew upon the Point, ſuppoſing himſelf in the firſt times of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, when <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, was then alive; and let him reſolve to which of them his Legiance had been due, conſidering them both in their naturall Capacity, as the Reporter would have it. But as touching the Place, its reported that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Legiance is not onely due from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; but in all places of the Kings Dominion, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe Forrain, as to the power of the Law of <hi>England</hi>: yea, ſaith the Reporter, as farre as the Kings power of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection doth extend. And yet this had not been enough, if the Premiſes be granted: for if this Legiance whereof we ſpeake be abſolute, and <hi>omni ſoli &amp; ſemper,</hi> then is it due to the King, from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, <hi>ubivis Gentium.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, to take the Reporter in a moderate ſenſe; it is worth conſideration, whether <hi>Engliſh</hi> Legiance in the dayes of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Third, extended as far as the Kings power of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; when as he had the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> in a Forrain right to that of <hi>England.</hi> In this, the Reporter is extreamly Poſitive upon many grounds which he inſiſteth upon,</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſaith, that <hi>Verus</hi> and <hi>Fidelis</hi> are qualities of the minde, and cannot be circumſcribed within the predicament of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi</hi>; and upon this ground, he might conclude, that this Legiance is due to the King, from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man all the world over, as well as in all the Kings Dominions; but concerning the ground, it may be denied, for though ſimply in it ſelfe conſidered as a notion, Verity or Fidelity are not circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in place, yet being qualities of the ſoul, and that being in the body, in relation thereunto, it may be in the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi</hi>; for where ever that Body and Soul is, there is Faith and Truth, according to its modell, which though not abſolute, and indefinite, yet if according to the Lawes of the place wherein the man is, he is truely ſaid to be <hi>Verus &amp; Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Reporter argueth, that the Kings Protection
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52042:56"/>
is not Locall, or included within the bounds of <hi>England</hi>; therefore alſo is not the Legiance: for, <hi>Protectio trahit Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giantiam, &amp; Legiantia Protectionem</hi>: Had this reaſon been formed into a Syllogiſme, it had appeared leſſe valuable; for the Protection of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King <hi>qua talis,</hi> of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, is locall and included within the bounds of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: But if the ſame King be alſo King of <hi>France,</hi> or Duke of <hi>Aquitane</hi>; and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man ſhall travell into thoſe parts, he is ſtill under the ſame Kings Protection, yet not as King of <hi>England,</hi> but as King of <hi>France,</hi> or Duke of <hi>Aquitane,</hi> otherwiſe, let the party be of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> all is one, he muſt be (whether <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi>) under an unlimitted abſolute Protection, without regard had to the Cuſtomes or Lawes of the place; yea, contrary to them, which I beleive the Reporter never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to affirme.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Reporter falleth upon the matter in Fact, and tells us that the King of <hi>England,</hi> did many times, <hi>De facto,</hi> grant Protections to Perſons in places out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Confines, and it will not be denied: But never was any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and indefinite Protection ſo granted; for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction extends to defence from injury, and all injury is to be expounded and judged according to the Lawes of the place: Nor doe any the Preſidents vouched by the Reporter clear, that the King of <hi>England</hi> did grant as King of <hi>England,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to any <hi>Engliſh</hi> man in any parts of the Kings Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beyond the Seas, which was not qualified according to the Lawes and Cuſtomes of that place: eſpecially, it being apparent, that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King may hold Dominion in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain parts, in Legiance under a Forrain King; as <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, held the Dutchy of <hi>Guien,</hi> and therefore cannot grant abſolute Protection in ſuch place, nor receive abſolute Legiance from any perſon there being.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Reporter ſaith, that the King of <hi>England,</hi> hath power to command his Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> to goe with him in his Warres, as well without the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> as within the ſame; therefore the Legiance of an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52042:56"/>
man to his King, is indefinite, and not locall, or circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by place, or within the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the firſt of theſe be granted, yet will not the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence hold, for poſſibly this may ariſe from the conſtitution of a Poſitive Law, and not from naturall or abſolute Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor doth any authority by him cited juſtifie any ſuch Legiance: But I cannot agree the firſt; for it is not true, that the King hath any ſuch power from his own Perſonall intereſt; nor doe the authoritie of former Ages warrant any ſuch matter: for a fuller diſquiſition, whereof I ſhall refer the Reader to the eleventh Chapter enſuing, becauſe the <hi>Whole matter concerning the Militia, commeth there to be handled in courſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, to cloſe up all the reſt, the Reporter brings, <hi>The Teſtimony of the Judges of the Common Law, out of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of</hi> Hengham; <hi>wherein an Action was brought by a</hi> French <hi>woman, against an</hi> Engliſh <hi>man, who refuſed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, becauſe the Plaintiffe was a</hi> French <hi>Woman, and not of the Legiance or Faith of</hi> England: This was diſallowed by the Judges, becauſe Legiance and Faith was referred to <hi>England,</hi> and not to the King? Thereupon the Defendant averred, that the Plaintiffe is not of the Legiance of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> nor of the Faith of the King: And upon this Plea thus amended, the Plaintiffe gave over her Action. The Reporter from hence obſerveth, that Faith and Legiance is referred to the King, indefinitely, and generally; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſo due to him. The reaſon might have had more force, had the Object of Allegiance, or the nature thereof, been the point in queſtion; but neither of them comming to debate, and Allegiance being ſubjected to <hi>England,</hi> and Faith to the King. I ſee not what more can be concluded from hence, but that Allegiance from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man is due to <hi>England,</hi> and Faith to the King, which I ſuppoſe muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be in order to that Allegiance; becauſe by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Plea, <hi>England</hi> had them both, and the King was wholly left out of the Caſe. Nevertheleſſe, I rather thinke that the preſent Point in controverſie, will receive little light here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from on either part.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:52042:57"/>We are now come to the fourth Property of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, that it is due to the Kings Naturall Capacity, and not to his Politique Capacity, or due to the Office of a King, in regard of the Perſon of the man, and not to the Perſon in regard of the Office, <hi>fol.</hi> 20. And becauſe this is of no ſmall importance, neither eaſily underſtood, nor granted: Therefore he backeth his Opinion by many reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſaith, that the King ſweareth to his Subjects in his Naturall Capacity, therefore the Subjects ſwear to him in his Naturall Capacity. This reaſon was intended to be taken from Relatives, and then it ſhould have been thus: <hi>A King doth ſweare to his Subjects in their Naturall Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, therefore Subjects ſweare to a King in his Naturall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi>: but it being otherwiſe, it is miſtaken, and proves not the Point. Yet if we ſhould take the Reporter, <hi>in ſano Senſu,</hi> there is no queſtion but the Oath is made to the Naturall Capacity; yet not Terminative, more then the Oath of the Tenant to his Lord, which this Author pleaſeth to couple with the mutuall dependence between King, and Subject, <hi>fol.</hi> 4. <hi>b.</hi> 5. <hi>a.</hi> Nor doth the Oath of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man binde him to the Obedience of all, or any Commands, which the King ſhall give in relation onely to his Naturall Capacity, or in oppoſition to his Politick Capacity: Nor will the Reporter himſelf allow that the Politique Capacity of the King, can be ſeparate from his Naturall Capacity, <hi>fol.</hi> 10. And yet it is evident that a King may in his Naturall Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city command that, of which in his Politique Capacity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give allowance.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon of this Opinion, is taken from the nature of Treaſon, which ſaith the Reporter, is committed againſt the Naturall Perſon of the King; and this is againſt due Legiance, according to the form of Indictments, in that Caſe provided. This is not demonſtrative, becauſe that crime which is done againſt the Naturall perſon of a man, may as well extend to it, in relation to his Place, or Office; and ſo may Treaſon be plotted againſt the Naturall Perſon of a King, as he is King: neither is their any other difference
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52042:57"/>
between the murther of a King, and a private Man, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of the Place and Office of a King, which makes the murther of him Treaſon; for which cauſe all Indictments that doe conclude, <hi>Contra Legiantiae debitum,</hi> doe as well alſo conclude, <hi>Contra Coronam &amp; Dignitatem, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third reaſon is this; A body politique, can neither make nor take Homage, 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Bro. tit. Fealty:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot the King in his Politique Capacity take Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The firſt muſt be granted onely, <hi>ſub modo,</hi> for though it cannot take Homage immediately, yet by the means of the Naturall Capacity, it may take ſuch ſervice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Rule holds, onely where the Body Politique is not aggregate, and not one perſon in ſeverall Capacities, for the Tenant that performes his ſervice to his Lord, performs the ſame to his Lord in his Naturall Capacity, but it is in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Politique Capacity, as he is his Lord: For Lord and Tenant, King and Subject, are but Notions, and neither can give nor take ſervice; but that man that is Lord, or Tenant, or King, or Subject, may; even as the power of Protection is in a King, not as he is a Man, but as a King.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon is this, The Kings naturall Perſon hath right in the Crowne by Inheritance, therefore alſo in the Legiance of the Subject. This is the ſtrength (as nigh as I can collect) of that which is ſet down as a ſixth reaſon, but I make it the fourth: becauſe the third, as I conceive is but an illuſtration of the ſecond; and the fifth is upon a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of a <hi>Fides ficta</hi>; whereas that Faith of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is according to Law, is the truer of the twaine. But to the ſubſtance of this fourth reaſon; If the firſt be granted, yet the Reporter cannot attain his concluſion; for the King may in his Naturall Capacity, have right to the Crowne by Inheritance, and yet not right in the Legiance of his Subjects, otherwiſe then in right of the Crowne; As in the Caſe of Lord and Tenant, the Lord may inherite the Lordſhip in his naturall Capacity, but the Service is due to him as Lord, and not as by Inheritance in the Service in the abſtract. And though it be granted that the Legiance to a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52042:58"/>
King, is of a higher ſtrain, then that of a Tenant to his Lord, <hi>fol.</hi> 4. <hi>b.</hi> 5. <hi>a.</hi> Yet doth the Reporter bring nothing to light, to prove them to be of a different Nature in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.</p>
               <p>The fifth and laſt reaſon that commeth to conſideration, is, from a Teſtimony of the Parliament; for it is ſaid, That this damnable Tenet of Legiance to the King in his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Capacity, is condemned by two Parliaments: But in truth I can finde but one under that Title, that mentioneth this Opinion, and that is called <hi>Exilium Hugonis,</hi> which in ſumme is nothing elſe, but Articles containing an enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the particular offences of the two <hi>Spencers</hi> againſt the State, and the Sentence thereupon: The offences are, for compaſſing to draw the King by rigor, to govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their wills: for withdrawing him from hearkning to the advice of his Lords, for hindering of Juſtice, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and (as a means hereunto,) They cauſed a Bill or Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule to be publiſhed, containing that Homage and Legiance is due to the King, rather in relation to the Crowne, then abſolutely to his Perſon; becauſe no Legiance is due to him, before the Crowne be veſted upon him: That if the King doe not govern according to Law; the Leiges in ſuch caſe are bound by their Oath to the Crown, to remove him either by Law or Rigor.</p>
               <p>This is the ſubſtance of the Charge, and upon this exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the Lords Houſe, the Lords, <hi>ſuper totam materiam,</hi> baniſh them before their Caſe is heard, or themſelves had made any appearance thereto: So as to the matter of this Scedule (which contains an Opinion ſuitable to the Point in hand, with ſome additionall aggravations) the Parliament determineth nothing at all: but as to the publiſhing of the ſame, to the intent to gather a party, whereby they did get power to act other enormities mentioned in the Charge; and in relation to theſe enormities, the Lords proceeded to Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of baniſhment; all which was done in the preſence of the King, and by his diſconſent, as may appear by his diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereat, as all Hiſtorians of thoſe Affaires witneſſe: and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52042:58"/>
it is not probable that the King would have been diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the proceedings of the Lords, in aſſerting the Prerogative of a King, in that matter of the Scedule, if he had perceived any ſuch thing in their purpoſes. Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto that the Lords themſelves juſtified the matter of the Scedule in their own proceedings, all which tended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the King to govern according to their Councells, and otherwiſe then ſuited with his good pleaſure: By force they removed <hi>Gaveston</hi> from the Kings preſence formerly, and afterward the <hi>Spencers,</hi> in the ſame manner: So they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the King from his Throne, and not long after, out of the World.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, I ſhall make uſe of one or two Conceſſions, which hath paſſed the Reporters own Penne (in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his) for the maintaining, that the Legiance of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, is neither Naturall, nor Abſolute, nor Indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, nor due to the Naturall Capacity, but qualified accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Rules.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, <hi>Engliſh</hi> men doe owe to their Kings Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, according to the Lawes, therefore is it not Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or Abſolute, or Indefinite. The inference is neceſſary, for the later is boundleſſe, and naturall; the former is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and by civill conſtitution: If any branch therefore of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Legiance be bounded by Lawes, then the Legiance of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man is circumſcribed, and not Abſolute, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall. The major Propoſition is granted by the Reporter, who ſaith, that the Municipall Lawes of the Kingdome, hath preſcribed the order and form of Legall Legiance, <hi>fol.</hi> 5. <hi>b.</hi> And therefore if by the Common Law, the Service of the Kings Tenant, as of his Mannor, be limited, how can that conſiſt with the abſolute Legiance formerly ſpoken of, which bindeth the Tenant being the Kings Subject, to an Abſolute, and Indefinite Service: Or if the Statute-Lawes have ſettled a Rule, according to which each Subject ought to goe to Warre in the Kings Service beyond the Sea, as the Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter granteth, <hi>fol.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. Then cannot the Legiance be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute to binde the Subject to goe to War according to the Kings own pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:52042:59"/>Secondly, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings Protection of his Subjects, is not Naturall, Abſolute, Indefinite, nor Originally extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto them in their Naturall Capacity: therefore is not the Legiance of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject to his King, Naturall, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, Indefinite, nor Originally extendeth to the King, in his Naturall Capacity.</p>
               <p>The dependance of theſe two reſteth upon the Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters owne words, who tells us, that <hi>Protectio trahit Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectionem, &amp; Subjectio Protectionem</hi>; Protection drawes with it Subjection, and Subjection drawes with it Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo as they are <hi>Relata,</hi> and doe prove mutually one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Nature, <hi>fol.</hi> 5. <hi>a.</hi> And in the ſame <hi>Page</hi> (a few lines preceding) he ſhewes why this Bond between King and Subject is called Legiance, becauſe there is a reciprocall, and double Bond: for as the Subject is bound in Obedience to the King, ſo is the King bound to the Subject in Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But the King is not Naturally bound to protect the People, becauſe this Bond begins not at his Birth, but when the Crown ſettles upon him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this Protection is not abſolute, becauſe the King muſt maintaine the Lawes, <hi>fol.</hi> 5. <hi>a.</hi> and the Lawes doe not Protect abſolutely, any man that is a breaker of the Lawes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this Protection is not Indefinite, becauſe it can extend no further then his Power, and his Power no further then his Dominions, <hi>fol.</hi> 9. <hi>b.</hi> The like alſo may be inſtanced in continuance of time.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Kings Protection extendeth not Originally to the Naturall Capacity, but to the Politique Capacity; therefore till a Forrainer commeth within the Kings Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he commeth not within his Protection: And the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all words of a Writ of Protection ſhewes, that the party Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, muſt be in <hi>Obſequio nostro, fol.</hi> 8. <hi>a.</hi> The ſumme then is, that as Protection of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King, ſo neither is Legiance, or Subjection of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man Naturall, Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, Indefinite, or terminated in the Naturall Capacity of the King. And to make a full Period to the Point, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52042:59"/>
make the ſame more cleare, I ſhall inſtance in one Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that theſe times of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third produced. The former <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings, had Title to many Teritories in <hi>France,</hi> but <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, had Title to all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: And being poſſibly not ſo ſenſible of what he had in poſſeſſion, as of what he had not; He enters <hi>France</hi> in ſuch a way, and with that ſucceſſe, that in a little time, he gaines the higheſt Seate therein, and ſo brought much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; and more then ſtood with the ſafety of the Kingdome. For in the union of two Kingdoms, its dangerous for the ſmaller, leaſt it be ſwallowed up by the greater.</p>
               <p>This was foreſeen by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who knew <hi>England</hi> did bear but a ſmall proportion to <hi>France,</hi> and complained of that inconvenience; and thereupon a Law was made, that the People of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14 E. 3. Stat. 4</note> ſhould not be ſubject to the King, or his Heires, as Kings of <hi>France</hi>: which manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly importeth, that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King may put himſelfe in ſuch a Poſture, in which Legiance is not due to him; and that this Poſture is not onely in Caſe of Oppoſition, but of diverſity, when he is King of another Nation, and doth not <hi>de facto,</hi> for that Time, and Place, rule as an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King: which if ſo, I ſuppoſe this notion of Naturall, Abſolute, and Indefinite Legiance to the King in his Naturall Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is out of this Kingdome, if not out of the World: and then the foot of the whole Account will be, that the Legiance of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, is Originally according to the Lawes: The ſumme of all, being comprehended in the joynt ſafety of the People of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>THe great growth of Courts, founded upon Prerogative, derogated much in theſe times from the ancient Courts, that formerly had attained the Soveraignty over the People, and in the hearts of them all. This was a hard Leſſon for them to learn, but eſpecially of the Kings Bench, that was wont to learn of none; and yet muſt be content to part with many of their Plumes to deck the Chancellor, much of their work to buſie the Prerogative Courts, holden <hi>Coram Rege</hi>; and more to thoſe holden <hi>Coram Populo,</hi> I mean, <hi>The Courts of Oier and Terminer, Goale delivery, and Ju<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tices of Peace.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> were now grown very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but leſſe eſteemed, as being by men of mean regard nominated for the moſt part by the party that ſued out the Commiſſion, which for the moſt part was done in behalfe of thoſe that were in danger, and meaned not to be juſtified by Works, but by Grace. Theſe eſcapes, though ſmall in the particulars, yet in the full ſumme made the matter ſo foul, as it became a common greivance, and a Rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſet by the Parliament, for the regulating both of the Judges of ſuch Court,<note place="margin">2 E. 3. cap. 2. &amp; 7.</note> and the Cauſes. The Commiſſions for Goale delivery likewiſe, grew more mean and ordinary: The chief ſort of men in the ſeverall Counties, had formerly the power, but were found to ſavour too much of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and Alliance; the leading of the work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is now committed to the Judges at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the other made onely Aſſociates to them. But above all, the Courts of Sheriffes, Coroners, and Leets, were now grown ſoure with Age, having attained courſes by common Practice, differing from Oppreſſion onely in name; and yet were the times ſo unhappy, as by theſe courſes they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52042:60"/>
fovour, and reſpect, amongſt the great men, and ſo gained more power from above to abuſe them below. Theſe men loved to be Commiſſioners of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and having learned how to make capitall offences pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary, found ſuch ſweetneſſe, as they uſed not to be weary of their places, though the Countrey grew weary of them; and therefore diſliking uncertainties, in ſuch matters of benefit, they cannot reſt till they obtaine more certaine ſettlement in their places; ſome for yeares, others for life, and ſome for ever. The diſeaſe thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by degrees, the cure muſt be accordingly; firſt the Sherifwicks much diſmembred to pleaſe the Court Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and fill the Kings privy purſe, and all raiſed to the utmoſt penny of the full, and beyond the juſt vallue.<note place="margin">4 E. 3. cap. 12. &amp; 15.</note> A Law is made to reſtore the ſeverall Hundreds, and Wepentakes to the Sheriffs and their Counties, and all of them are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the old rent; and it is likewiſe provided that none ſhal execute that place in County or Hundred, who ſhall not then have ſufficient Lands in that County to anſwer dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages for injuſtice by them done.<note place="margin">2 E. 3. cap. 4. 4 E. 3. cap. 4.</note> And that no Sheriff ſhall ſerve in that place above one yeare; and then not to be choſen againe for that ſervice, till three yeares be paſt: which later clauſe was only a <hi>medium</hi> taken up for the preſent occaſion,<note place="margin">1 R. 2. cap. 1<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> in regard that men of ability became very rare in theſe times, eſpecially, in ſome of the Counties. The election of the Sheriff is likewiſe not to be forgotten, for though the Counties had the election of Coroners in regard they looked that no man ſhould come nigh their blood, but whom they truſted;<note place="margin">28 E. 3. cap. 6.</note> yet the Sheriffe came not ſo nigh their skinne, nor yet ſo nigh their freeholds, as anciently they had done, for that their power in judicature was much abated, and ſo not worthy of ſo high regard, yet in reſpect he was ſtill to be a Miniſter of juſtice, and his place valuable more then formerly; it was holden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient that ſuch as had the cheife power of judicature at <hi>Weſtminſter, Viz.</hi> the Chancellor, Treaſurer, Cheife <hi>Baron,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14 E. 3. cap. 7.</note> and the two cheife Juſtices, ſhould nominate the man

that ſhould be their Servant, and in the Parliament ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,<note place="margin">14 E. 3. n. 33.</note> interpoſed in that Election as often as they ſaw cauſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as touching Cauſes criminall, which more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily come within the Cogniſance of theſe Courts: They generally held the ſame regard in the eye of Law in theſe times that they had done formerly; nevertheleſſe, in two crimes theſe times wrought diverſly, urging the edge of Law againſt the one, and abating it as to the other. The later of theſe is commonly called <hi>Petit Treaſon,</hi> which is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deſtructive to the Common-wealth, in an inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and at a further diſtance, becauſe it is deſtructive to that Legiance, by which Families doe conſiſt, and of whom Kingdomes are derived.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mirror Juſt.</hi> cap. 2. Sect. 13. 21 E. 3. fol. 17. <hi>b.</hi>
                  </note>In former times it extended unto the Legiance between Lord and Tenant, and Parents and Children: but by this Law of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. it is reduced to the Legiance onely of Man, and Wife, Maſter, and Servant, Clerk, and his Ordinary: the laſt of which was now lately taken up; and might have beene as well laid aſide, as divers others were, but that in theſe times much is to be yeilded to the power of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, who loved to raiſe the power of the Ordinary, to an extraordinary pitch, that themſelves might be the more conſiderable.</p>
               <p>This reducing of Treaſon into a narrower ground, made the Regiment of Fellonies to ſwell: A hard thing it was in a Warring time, for men to conceit themſelves well dreſt, untill they were compleatly armed: Some uſed it for a Complement, and amongſt others, honeſt men had as good cauſe to uſe it, as ſome that were ill affected, had a bad; and of the laſt ſort, ſome did aime at private revenge, though many aimed againſt the Publique quiet. But however the intentions of men thus harneſſed might be different, the lookes of them all are ſo ſoure, that its hard to know a man for Peace, from a man for Warre. And therefore the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were now ſo greedy after Peace, as they are ready to magnifie, or multiply all Poſtures of Armed men into the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52042:61"/>
worſt faſhion, being well aſſured that the readieſt way to keep themſelves from the hurt of ſuch men, is to have none of them at all. But <hi>Edward</hi> the Third,<note place="margin">25 E. 3. c. 2.</note> had more need of them then ſo, and will therefore allow men to ride Armed, but not to Troope together, to rob, kill, or impriſon any man; and if any Perſon did otherwiſe, it ſhould be Fellony, or Treſpaſſe, but not high Treaſon.</p>
               <p>All this was in favour to the People, and yet it was not all, for when Mercy groweth profuſe, it becomes cruelty: Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is very incident to times of Warre, yet is an Enemy to the Peace, of ſo high a nature, that though the Kings pardon may doe much, yet both King and People declare it an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable crime, by the Common Law, and that the Kings Prerogative ſhall not extend ſo farre, as to Pardon the ſame. This juſtice done to the party dead, was a mercy to them that were alive; a means to ſave blood, by blood-ſhed, and not ſo much by the Kings Grant, as by his Releaſe. One thing more in theſe caſes of blood, the people obtained of the King, which they had not ſo much by Releaſe, as by Grant, and that was the taking away of <hi>Engliſhire,</hi> an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Badge of the Imperiall Power of the <hi>Danes</hi> over the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and which had either continued through the deſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> in the times of <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, unto the <hi>Normans</hi> time, or by them taken up again, and continued, untill theſe times that <hi>Edward</hi> the Third was ſo farre deſirous to declare his readineſſe to maintaine the Liberties of the people, as to be willing to reſtore them where they failed, and in particular tooke away the manner of Preſentment of <hi>Engliſhire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14 E. 3. cap. 4.</note> blotting out the Title and Clauſe concerning it, out of the Articles of inquiry for the Judges <hi>Itinerant.</hi> And thus whether Native or Forrainer all men are now made in death equall, and one Law ſerves all alike,</p>
               <p>Next unto blood, theſe times grew more ſenſible of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhments, then former times had done: For though they had determined a ſevere Penalty againſt ſo foule a Crime, and made it in the nature of Fellony capitall, which was
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52042:62"/>
enough to have ſcared any man from ſuch attempts, yet for the proof of the matter in Fact, much reſted upon the will of the Woman, which for the moſt part grounded upon ſelf reſpects, and private prudence laboured to conceale that which could not be made whole by revealing; and by after conſent skind over the ſore as to themſelves, which corrupted inwardly, and indangered the whole body; to cure which, a Law is made to reſtrain ſuch late connivance in the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,<note place="margin">6 Rich. 2. c. 6. 5 E 4. fol. 58.</note> by depriving her both of her Joyncture, and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which otherwiſe had been ſaved to her by ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, as after conſent unto ſuch violations.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. Of the Courſe of Civill Juſtice, during theſe Times.</head>
               <p>HOwever the courſe of the Law concerning matters of the Crown, paſſed in a troubled wave, yet in matters of Common Pleas, it paſſed in a calme and full Channell; as the Reports in Print doe ſufficiently witneſſe, nor was their any change of Principles, but onely ſome alteration tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a clearer manifeſtation of the ſame. I will not touch upon every particular, but onely upon two, which reflect ſomewhat upon the Publique pollicy, the one touching the courſe of Inheritance in ſome particular Caſes; the other touching pleading in the Courts of Civill Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe was occaſioned from Conjuncture of Affaires, the Caſe being ſuch, that <hi>Edward</hi> the Third had now gotten himſelfe a new Kingdome unto that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and muſt looke to maintaine that by Power, which he obtained by force, and conducing thereunto, muſt have continuall imployment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in that Service, as being moſt truſty to his Cauſe. And that it is un reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> as had devoted themſelves to his
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52042:62"/>
Service in this Cauſe, and in order thereunto, had tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves, and their Families into thoſe Forrain parts, ſhould thereby looſe the benefit of Leiges,<note place="margin">17 E. 3. n. 19.</note> in the Birth-right of their Children, borne in thoſe Forraine parts. Upon conſideration had hereof, and of a former leading Opinion of the Lawyers and Parliament, a Declarative Law was made;<note place="margin">25 E. 3. Stat. 2</note> 
                  <hi>That all Children borne without the Kings Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, whoſe Father and Mother at the time of their Birth, ſhall be under the Faith and Legiance of the King of</hi> England, <hi>ſhall have the benefit of Inheritance within the ſame Legiance, as other Inheritors have.</hi> Theſe are the words of the Statute, and doe occaſion a double obſervation, one from the matter, the other from the manner of the Expreſſion.</p>
               <p>The Subject matter is ſo delivered, not as an Introduction of a new Law, but as a Declarative of the old, that lay more obſcurely hidden, for want of occaſion to reveale it, and the ſubſtance thereof reſteth onely in this, to enable the Children of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Natives, borne beyond the Seas; not the Children of thoſe that are of Forraine birth, though within the Kings Teritories in thoſe parts, as the opinion hath beene, nor doth any ancient Preſident, or Caſe, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the ſame, as might be at large manifeſted, if it might conduce to the end of this diſcourſe, and for the ſame cauſe, after this Statute; when as the Commons would have had a generall Naturalizing of all Infants borne beyond the Sea, within the Kings Segniories; the ſame would not be granted,<note place="margin">42 E. 3. c. 10.</note> otherwiſe then according to the former Statute, and the Common Law.</p>
               <p>That which in the next place concerneth the manner of expreſſion, is this, That a Childe is ſaid to be borne out of the Kings Legiance, and yet the Father and Mother at the ſame time to be of the Faith and Legiance of the King of <hi>England</hi>: It ſeemeth to me, that it intendeth onely thoſe Children of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parents, borne within the Kings Teri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories beyond the Seas, becauſe the words inſuing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Certification of Baſtardy of ſuch Children, are, that the ſame ſhall be made by the Biſhop of ſuch place upon the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52042:63"/>
Kings Writ directed to him, which could never have paſſed into thoſe places that are not of the Kings Teritories: and ſo the Iſſue will be, that the Legiance of thoſe born in thoſe parts, though they are Leiges to the King, yet they are not of the Legiance of the King of <hi>England,</hi> but as Lord of that Teritory.</p>
               <p>The other matter to be obſerved concerning pleading in the Courts of Civill Juſtice, is this, That whereas ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">36 E. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WArre is ever terrible, but if juſt and well governed, majeſticall; the one may excite reſiſtance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but the other Conquers, before blow given; becauſe it convinceth the judgement, and ſo prevails upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: For that heart can never be reſolute in its own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that is at Warre with its own underſtanding; nor can ſuch a heart conſider ſuch a Warre, otherwiſe then as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and bearing the face of an Ordinance of God; and then how can the Iſſue be unſucceſsfull. It is no ſtrange
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52042:63"/>
thing for Kings to miſcarry in their Warres, becauſe its rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen that they are under good Councell; but if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Councell miſcarry, we may conclude it extraordinary, in the efficient Cauſe, and no leſſe wonderful in the iſſue, and end. Upon this ground, it concerneth a Chriſtian Nation, not onely in point of Honour, but of ſafety and continuance, to ſettle fundamentall Lawes for War, againſt time of War; as of Peace, in time of Peace. Neither was <hi>England</hi> deficient herein, ſaving that ancient times were more obſcure in the particulars, and theſe dayes revealed them at ſuch a time, wherein we may ſay, that <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not onely King of <hi>England,</hi> but of himſelf, above the ordinary ſtrain of expectation; for being now become a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Commander and Conquerour, having alſo an Army inured to fight and overcome, and ſo might have given a Law; he nevertheleſſe, received the ſame, ſubmitting both it and himſelf to the Directory of the Parliament, in making a Warre with <hi>France,</hi> which was three to one againſt him in every reſpect, (but in the Title) beſides the diſadvantage from <hi>Scotland,</hi> that lay continually beating upon his reare. The like may be obſerved of his Warre with <hi>Scotland,</hi> in both which, he evidently telleth the World, that he held it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to enter upon the managing of an offenſive Forraine Warre, without the concurrence of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of the people; and that not onely for the thing it ſelfe, but alſo for his owne perſonall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in the Service. For a King, though he be the <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> yet is he ſo from the people, and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being of that high value, is not to be expoſed to every occaſion, that may provoke Warre, without due advice firſt had with the publique Councell, becauſe in his perſon the people adventureth as well as himſelf. And in this manner were the Warres in <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> concluded upon debate. In the next place, as touching the arraies of Men for Warre, I finde no foot-ſteps of any power which was claimed as peculiar to the King therein, and acknowledged by the Parliament; but many
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52042:64"/>
inſtances do I meet with in the oppoſite; all which do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell us,<note place="margin">13 E. 3. n. 15, 17, 18, 37, 38. 14 E. 3. n. 14, 15, 16, 19, 42, 53. 20 E. 3. n. 14.</note> that the old ſhifts of <hi>Jurati</hi> and <hi>obligati ad ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> could do little either in the calling of men forth, or arming them for the Warr. But in caſe of publique defence againſt forrainers, men were ſummoned upon their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as anciently was uſed. And this was by both King and Parliament fully declared, and all ſuch obligations by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called in and damned as diſhonorable to the King. In forraine ſervice the courſe was no leſſe regular; if the Warr was by eſpeciall direction of the Parliament,<note place="margin">1 E. 3. cap. 15.</note> they likewiſe ordered the manner of the raiſing of Souldiers, <hi>Viz.</hi> So many out of a County, and ſo many out of a Burrough, all which are by the expreſſe words of the Statute, ſaid to be granted by the Knights and Burgeſſes.<note place="margin">4 E. 3. cap. 5.</note> But if it was only upon the Kings particular inſtigation and not by order or conſent of the Parliament, the King in ſuch caſes being <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteir,</hi> all the Souldiers were in like manner; unleſſe ſome particular Law, or Tenure, otherwiſe obleiged them. As touching the arming of Souldiers; the Law was yet more certaine and particular.

whether determinatively, or careleſly, I cannot tell, but all of them doe differ in ſence one from another, and from the Truth; ſome of the common Books have the words thus: <hi>None ſhall be deſtrained to goe out of their Counties, unleſſe for cauſe of neceſſity, and of ſudden coming of Strangers, or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, into the Kingdome:</hi> Others reade it thus, <hi>But where neceſſity requireth, and the coming of ſtrange Enemies into the Kingdome.</hi> The Kings anſwer to the Parliaments Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning the Commiſſion of Array,<note place="margin">

Againſt what hath been thus noted, the judgement of Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in <hi>Calvins</hi> Cafe lies yet in the way,<note place="margin">Fol. <hi>7.</hi> b.</note> who affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> are bound by their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to goe with the King in his Warres, as well within the Realme, as without; and this Legiance he telleth us, is that Naturall Legiance which he ſaith, is abſolute and Indefinite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not Locall, which if not ſo, then were not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> bound to go out of <hi>England</hi>; an inference that is neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, nor is the thing affirmed certain. It is not neceſſary,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52042:66"/>
becauſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> men may be bound to goe out of <hi>England,</hi> by vertue of their Tenures, particular Contract, or elſe by ſpeciall Act of Parliament, and not by vertue of that Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Legiance, which in Truth is no where.</p>
               <p>Now for the maintenance of the Point, the Reporter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth two Statutes affirming the thing, and Common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; and laſtly, Authorities of the Judges of the Common Law.<note place="margin">11 H. 7. cap. 1. 2 E. 6. cap. 2.</note> As touching the Statutes, one in <hi>Henry</hi> the Sevenths time, and the other in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixths time: I ſhall ſpeake of them in the ſucceeding times, when we come at them, for they are no Warrant of the Law, in theſe times whereof we now treat; much leſſe is the modern practice of theſe later dayes, a Demonſtration of the Law in the times of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, nor of the Nature of the Law in any time, ſeeing that it is obvious to times, as well as particular Perſons, to doe and ſuffer things to be done, which ought not ſo to be; and therefore I ſhall for the preſent lay thoſe two Conſiderations aſide. But as touching the Opinions of the Judges of the Common Law, two Caſes are cited in the Affirmative, which ſeeme in the Negative, and the reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not to the Point.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the two caſes, is the opinion of Juſtice <hi>Thirning</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, word for word, thus, <hi>A Protection lies for the Defendant in a Writ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">7 Hen. 4. <hi>Protect.</hi> 100.</note> 
                  <hi>upon the Statute of Labourers, and yet the Defendant ſhall not have ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by way of Plea, Viz. That the King hath retained him to goe beyond the Sea: for the King cannot compell a man to goe out of the Kingdome,</hi> That is, (as the Reporter ſaith) <hi>Not without Wages</hi>; intimating thereby, that if the King ſhall tender wages to any man, he muſt goe whither the King ſhall pleaſe to ſend him, which is not onely deſtructive to the opinion of <hi>Thirning,</hi> concerning the Plea, but alſo (though granted) is deſtructive to the Reporters judgement in the main point: For if an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man may refuſe to goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wages, then is he not bound to goe by any naturall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Legiance, as the Reporter would have it. And as touching the ſecond Caſe, which is <hi>Bigots</hi> and <hi>Bohuns</hi> Caſe,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52042:66"/>
it cleareth the ſame thing; for it was reſolved, that they ought to goe but in manner and form, according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, then is not the ground in the abſolute Legiance, for that is not qualified, but in the Poſitive Statute-Law, which tieth onely in manner and form, and that by voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Parliament.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the Caſes, do neither conclude the main point, nor the particular thing that the Reporter intendeth: for he would imply to the Reader, that <hi>Engliſh</hi> men were anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently uſed to be impreſted for the Warres in <hi>France</hi>:<note place="margin">44 E. 3. fol. 12 12 H. 4.7. 32 H. 6. fol. 4. 17 <hi>H.</hi> 6. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect. 19 H. 6.35.</note> and hereunto he voucheth one Authority out of ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Law, in <hi>Edward</hi> the Thirds time, one authority in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and three in the time of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Sixth; none of all which doe ſpeake one word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning impreſting, and that in <hi>Edward</hi> the hird, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the contrary; for the Caſe is, that in a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat,</hi> a Protection was offered by the Defendant, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to goe beyond Sea with the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi>; and the Plaintiffes Councell alledged that the Defendant had been beyond Sea, with the Duke, and was returned: To this the Defendants Councell anſwered, that the Duke was ready to return again; and for this cauſe the Protection was allowed: Yet a <hi>Quere</hi> is made upon this ground, that it might be that the Defendant would not goe over with him, nor was it proved that he would, which ſheweth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the party was not impreſted, for then the thing had not been in his power to will or nill.</p>
               <p>The laſt inſtance that the Reporter produceth, is that of <hi>Forinſecum Servitium,</hi> or Forrain Service, and that ſeemerh to be Knight Service to be performed abroad: But this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſhort of the Reporters intention in three reſpects,</p>
               <p>Firſt, though it belongeth to the King, yet not to him onely, but to other cheif Lords, ſo ſaith <hi>Bracton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is not due from every <hi>Engliſh</hi> man:<note place="margin">Bract. li. <hi>2.</hi> fol. <hi>36.</hi> &amp; <hi>37,</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, it is a Service due by vertue of Tenure, and then the Concluſion will be, That which is due by Tenure of Lands, is not due by naturall and abſolute Legiance: and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52042:67"/>
ſo this Forrain Service, ariſing meerly by compact, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between Lord and Tenant, and not by the naturall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> born Subject, (which is the thing that the Reporter driveth at in all this diſcourſe) will be ſo far from maintaining the Reporters opinion, as it will evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſame.</p>
               <p>And thus the Poſture of this Nation, in the Feild remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth regular in the rule, what ever hath been ſaid againſt it; notwithſtanding, that in the very inſtant of Action, there may be ſome irregularity, which no doubt both was, and ever will be, in ſtormy times; nor did it conquer the Law: For though Warre may ſeem to be but a ſickneſſe of the State, yet being in Truth, as the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimum refugium,</hi> and onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve unto Law, beaten to a retreat by oppreſſion: It is no wonder if this motion, or rather commotion that brings on the Law of Peace in the reare, be ſtill and ever ſubject to a rule of Law, how unruly ſoever it ſelfe ſeemeth to be. Now becauſe Law imports execution, and that preſuppoſes a triall, and it a Court; therefore did our Anceſtors (amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courts not regulated by the Common Law) forme a Court for the Service of Warre, called The Court Martiall, or the Conſtables Court, according as the Office of one or the other, had the pre-eminence. The proceedings herein, were ordered as I ſaid, not according to the Common Law, for that is like the Land, much diſtant from all other Nations, and the negotiation of this Iland with other Nations, (as in time of Peace, ſo of Warre,) require a rule common to all thoſe Nations, or otherwiſe no negotiation can be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: And for this cauſe, the proceedings in this Court, were ever according to the rule of the Civill Law: The work of this Court is principally judiciall, and in ſome Caſes Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall.</p>
               <p>The firſt reflects upon cauſes Forrain and Domeſtick, and both of thoſe, are either Criminall, and ſuch as concern the common Peace of the place of warre, or more civill, relating onely unto private intereſt. As touching the firſt of theſe, I ſuppoſe it is no Bull, to ſpeake of a Common Peace, in the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52042:67"/>
place of Warre; for a Common Peace muſt be in each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty within it ſelfe, or otherwiſe no party at private variance can ſubſiſt within it ſelfe, much leſſe make Warre with the other; and therefore in order unto Warre, there muſt be a Law of Peace, for the triall of Offenders, and puniſhing them, for offences committed againſt the good government of the Warre; ſuch as are breaking of ranks, deſerting the Standard, running away from the Colours, mutinies, murders, rapes, plunderings, private quarrells, diſobedience to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſuch like; all which doe bear the ſhew of Crimes againſt the Common Peace of the Army, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>Of the ſecond ſort, are matters concerning Quarter, and Contracts in order to the government of the Warre, ſaving ſuch as are made, before either party be Inrolled for the Warre: For if a man doth covenant to ſerve in the Warre,<note place="margin">13 Rich. 2. Stat. 1. cap. 20 8 Rich. 2. n. 31. 8 Rich. 2. c. 5. <hi>Regiſt. ſol.</hi> 191.2.</note> and keepeth not his day at the firſt <hi>Rendezvouz,</hi> he is to be attached by Writ at the Common-Law. Cauſes Domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call likewiſe fall under the like diviſion: for whatſoever Cauſe may be Forrain, may alſo be Domeſtick; becauſe the Army is ever imbodied within the Kingdom, and muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Directory of the Martial-Law, upon the firſt forming thereof. Now though the particular Lawes of the Army, for the government thereof, be ordinarily according to the Prudence of the Generall, yet certain Fundamentalls have been <hi>ab Antiquo,</hi> made by Cuſtome, and the Parliament, againſt which the courſe of Judicature muſt not goe; and as the Parliament ſaw need, it ſet alſo particular Directions,<note place="margin">50 E. 3. n. 33. n. 161. 3 R. 2. n. 27.</note> as for the payment of Souldiers wages, for remedy of waſtings and plunderings in their owne Countrey, and other ſuch Emergencies. But the execution of all theſe Lawes O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally, was in the Martiall of the Army, and becauſe that the Army was generally diſſolved, or ſuch perſons ingaged in ſuch matters of Controverſie, departed from the Army, before the ſame were concluded. Therefore the Martialls Court continued in order, to the determining of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and in continuance of time, other matters alſo crouded
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52042:68"/>
into that Society, although ſometimes under the Directory of the Conſtable of <hi>England,</hi> as well as at other times under the Martiall; more particularly, that power of determining matters concerning <hi>Torniament,</hi> a ſport that like a Sarciſme tickles the fancy, but wounds the heart, and being of as little uſe in a Common-Wealth, as of benefit; therefore is laid aſide, nor need I to ſpeake any more concerning it. There is one thing more, ſomewhat like a <hi>Torniament,</hi> but that it is in good earneſt, and that is called <hi>Duell.</hi> This commeth likewiſe within the Cogniſance of this Court, but in a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall way, and as ſubſervient to the Common Law, in Caſes of appeale and right: Hereof needs likewiſe little more then the naming, and therefore, I ſhall leave the Reader that would underſtand the particular managing thereof, unto the diſcourſe compiled by the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gloſſ.</hi> 129.</note> in <hi>Richard</hi> the Seconds time.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as touching the Antiquity of this Court, though it may be great, yet the power thereof was doubtfull, and ſcarce taken notice of in any publique Act of State, till about theſe times; when as a complaint was made by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, for the incroachment of that Court, upon the liberty of the People, and bounds of the Courts of Common Law; Nor is it ſtrange, that ſuch unquiet times brought forth ſuch Preſidents, but much more ſtrange that the Common Law held up its head againſt ſuch violent irruptions of Warre.</p>

               <p>YOu have ſeen the Kingdome in Armor, now ſee it in Robes, and you will ſay that its Majeſty therein, is as grave, as it was in the other brave. Its true, the tempers are ſo contrary, as it may be wondred how one and the ſame ſhould be wiſe and willing for both: but when God will
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52042:68"/>
doe much, he gives much, and can make a people as one man, like unto <hi>Caleb,</hi> fitted both for Warre and Peace: Beſides, the times were now much conducing hereto, its vain to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to allay humours in the body, which are maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Agitation, they muſt be purged out, or the whole will ſtill be indangered: and therefore although Kings hitherto did indeavour to eſtabliſh a peaceable Government, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led by ill Principles of private Intereſts, they laboured to little purpoſe: but now the Scene is altered, and one wiſe moderate King, that was as wiſe as valiant, did more then they all: And firſt ſet a rule upon his own deſires, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf with the condition of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King; and then upon his people, making them contented with the condition of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men.</p>
               <p>The order herein was no leſſe obſervable; for the former wrangling times having trained up the minds of men in a tumultuous way, nor could they skill to pace in the ſteps of Peace, the King led them into Forrain parts to ſpend their heat, till being either weak or weary, they are contented to return home, and ſtudy the happineſſe of a quiet life: theſe men thus ordered, the reſt at home are made more coole, like a body after Phyſick, and all are now contented to ſubmit to Law and Magiſtracy. A fitting time now it was for Juſtices of Peace to come upon the Stage in their beſt garbe: For though the work was more ancient, yet like ſome looſe notes laid aſide in ſeverall places, it was not to be found, but at a diſtance, and after long delay. But <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, ſums up all into one breif, and brings a compleate modell thereof into the World for future Ages to accompliſh, as occaſion ſhould lead the way. The courſ was now eſtabliſhed to have Juſtices ſettled in every County, there to be reſident and attending that Service.

Firſt, they were choſen out of the good and lawfull men of each County: After that they were two or three choſen out of the worthieſt men, and theſe were to be joyned with Lawyers. Then was one Lord
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52042:69"/>
and three or foure in each County of the moſt worthy men,<note place="margin">34 E. 3. cap. 1.</note> adjoyned with Lawyers. Afterward in <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds time,<note place="margin">12 R. 2. c. 10.</note> the number of Juſtices in each County might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the number of ſix, and no Steward of any Lord to be admitted into the Commiſſion: but within half a yeare all is at large, ſo be it that the choiſe be out of the moſt ſufficient Knights,<note place="margin">14 R. 2. c. 12.</note> Eſquires, and Gentlemen of the County. Again, within two yeares, the number in each County, is ſet at eight, yet in all theſe, the Judges and Serjeants were not reckoned, ſo as the work then ſeemeth not ſo much as now a dayes, although it was much of the ſame kinde; and yet it grew up into that greatneſſe which it had by degrees. Before, they were ſettled by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, there were <hi>Cuſtodes pacis,</hi> which might be thoſe whom we now a dayes call the High-Conſtable of the Hundred, whoſe work was purely Miniſteriall.</p>
               <p>Afterward about the ſecond yeare of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, the Guardians of the Peace had power of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> in matters of riding Armed upon the Statute 2. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.

Stat. 1. c. 7. 34 E. 3. c. 11.</note> which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe as the times then ſtood, was as commendable work as it was neceſſary: For Souldiers were ſo many that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers were very few; and thoſe that once are accuſtomed to Armes, thinke ever after meanly of the handycraft; nor will they ever ſtoop thereto after their Spirits are once eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by Maſtery of Adventures. And ſecondly, thoſe few Labourers that remained of the Sword, Plague, and other diſaſters of theſe waſting times, underſtood their advantage,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52042:69"/>
and ſet a value upon their labours, far above their merit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that men would rather part with too much of a little, then to let their work lie ſtill, that muſt bring them in all they have; but theſe Commiſſioners laſted not long, though the worke did: The Juſtices of Peace are looked upon as meet for that ſervice,<note place="margin">42 E. 3. c. 6.</note> and its a vain thing to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Commiſſions, where the work may be done by one, that before this time had obtained an additionall Cogniſance of all Cauſes of Riots, Batteries, wandering dangerous Perſons, and offences in Weights and Meaſures, and in Purveiance.<note place="margin">34 E. 3. c. 5, 6.</note> To them, I ſay, all this work concerning Labourers, is alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Parliament; and herewith a way was laid open for Crimes of greateſt regard under Fellony, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by triall in the Countrey, according to the courſe of Common Law. The iſſue of all which was not only eaſe to the People, but a great eſcape from the rigor of the Councel-Table in the Star-Chamber, and the Kings-Bench at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> on the one ſide, and alſo from the gripe of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy on the other; who hitherto held the Cogniſance of the Markets in Weights and Meaſures to themſelves. This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell ſo pleaſed all men, that <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, that was pleaſed with nothing but his owne pleaſure, gave unto the Juſtices of Peace yet further power to execute the Statute at <hi>Northampton,</hi> againſt riotous ridings,<note place="margin">14 R. 2. c. 12.</note> and to ſettle the wages of Labourers and Servants, to puniſh unlawfull Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by the meaner ſort of people, and regrators of Wooll,<note place="margin">13 R. 2. cap. 8. cap. 13. 14 R. 2. cap. 4. 16 R. 2. cap. 4. 17 R. 2. cap. 9.</note> falſ Weights in the Staple, unlawfull wearing of Liveries, and unlawfull fiſhings, contrary to the Statute at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> 2. Thus was the power of Juſtices of the Peace grown to that heighth in theſe and other things, that it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined, not onely the Councel-Table and Kings Bench, but the Commiſſions of Gaole delivery, and of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> ſo farre forth as their work was, much leſſe then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for Neighbous in caſes of Crime, are better truſted, with the lives and eſtates of men, then ſtrangers, ſo as in all this the people are ſtill the gainers.</p>
               <p>The manner of Judicature by theſe Juſtices of the Peace
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52042:70"/>
ſtill remains: nothing appears by any Statute in theſe times, that one Juſtice of the Peace might doe alone,<note place="margin">15 R. 2. cap. 2.</note> but record a forcible detainer, although queſtionleſſe in point of preſent ſecurity of the Peace and good behavior by the intent of the Statutes, he might doe many things, but in Caſes of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> all muſt be done in publique Seſſions, which the Juſtices of the Peace had power to hold by Commiſſion onely, untill the thirty ſixth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and ever after that they held their Seſſions, by vertue of the Statutes,<note place="margin">34 E. 3. cap. 1. 16 R. 2. cap. 4.</note> and had power to determine divers things in their Seſſions, according to diſcretion. Theſe were remedies after the Fact, now ſee what preventing Phyſick theſe times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded.</p>
               <p>One thing that much irritated the ſpirits of men into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, was falſe newes, or ſlanderous reports, raiſed and ſpread amongſt the great men: For in theſe times the Lords were of ſuch conſiderable a power as the vexation of one Lord, proved the vexation of a multitude of the meaner ſort; and though the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the 1. formerly had provided againſt ſuch tales, yet it touched onely ſuch as concerned diſcord between the King and People, although by implication alſo it might be conſtrued to extend further. But <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, willing to live in quiet, that he might injoy his pleaſure, would have the people know their duties in plain words,<note place="margin">2 R. 2. cap. 6.</note> and agreed to a Law, that all ſuch as publiſhed ſuch falſe newes, tending to ſow ſtrife between the great men,<note place="margin">12 R. 2. c. 11.</note> ſhould be impriſoned untill the firſt mover was found, and if he were not found, then the Relator ſhould be puniſhed by advice of the Councell: So much power was then given to the Councell, what ever it was.</p>
               <p>Thus the ſeed was choked, or was ſo intended to be, though every paſſion was not thus ſuppreſſed: For ſome angers conquer all feare, and will hold poſſeſſion, come what will: In the next place therefore, proviſion is made againſt the firſt actings in ſorting of parties, by tokens and liveries; utterly inhibiting the meaner ſort of the people, from giving of Liveries to maintain quarrells,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> R. 2. cap. 7.</note> upon pain of Fine and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52042:70"/>
and the triall to be before the Juſtices of Aſſize, which it ſeems was in affirmance of former Lawes, as by the Preamble of the Statute doth appeare, though the Lawes themſelves are not extant. About fifteen years after, it was by ſad experience found, that the Lords maintained quarrells by multitude of Liveries, and therefore another Law was made inhibiting the Lords to give Liveries to any,<note place="margin">16 R. 2. cap. 4.</note> but their meniall Servants; and its ordered, that the Juſtices of the Peace, ſhall make inquiry of ſuch offences, and puniſh them according to their diſcretion.</p>
               <p>A third prevention was provided againſt gathering together of parties, after they are ſorted. For the humors may ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, as nothing will keep them in; they muſt either breake out into a ſore, or a long ſicknes of State will certainly follow; To this end therefore, the Statute made at <hi>Northampton,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 E. 3. cap. 3. 7 R. 2. c. 13. 20 R. 2. cap. 1.</note> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain revived, expreſly forbidding all Perſons to ride Armed, unles in ſome particular Caſes of executing Juſtice, or guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſon of the King, or his Juſtices, and ſuch like: And if men will be ſo adventerous, as to outdare Law, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique force, Troopings together, and Riotous ridings: Another courſe is taken, not by Commiſſion of the Peace, but rather of Warre, directed unto valiant perſons in every County, and they have power thereby to apprehend ſuch Offenders, and impriſon them untill the Goale-delivery, though no Indictment be found thereof, untill the Goale-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery ſhall be. By this Commiſſion therefore power is given of <hi>Poſſe Comitatus,</hi> in nature of a Commiſſion of Array, with an additionall power of fighting and deſtroying, ſo as though the King granteth the Power by the Commiſſion, yet the Parliament giveth the power to the Commiſſion; and be it a Commiſſion for Peace or Warre, it is Originally from that power.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt prevention, was the taking away means of continuance and ſupporting ſuch Riotous wayes,<note place="margin">13 R. 2. cap. 15</note> 
                  <hi>Viz. Caſtles and Goales out of the Cuſtody of private hands, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring them to their Counties.</hi>: For Goales and Caſtles are taken promiſcuouſly for places of ſecurity, in times of Peace
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52042:71"/>
to keep ill perſons from going out, and in times of Warre, from getting in: Amongſt theſe, ſome belonged to the King, and were committed to ſuch as he favoured, who commonly (in ſuch times of Oppreſſion and Violence) grew too big for Juſtice, uſurping a Gaole-delivery, and making ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſtrength many times, even to the innocent, a Priſon to keep them from the Law, but unto guilty perſons an <hi>Aſſilum</hi> to defend them againſt the Law. And theſe thus belonging to the King, were under no Law, but of Prerogative, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as other Caſtles of private perſons were under the yoake of the Statute, 13 <hi>E.</hi> 1. For remedy of all which, the Kings Caſtles are once more returned to the Sheriffes Cuſtody, by Act of Parliament; who queſtionleſſe hath the power to diſpoſe of all places of Strength, whether in order to Peace, or Warre, and could not diſpoſe them into a more fafe, and indifferent hand, then the Sheriffes; who is as well the Kings Officer, as the Kingdomes Servant, and much intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law in the execution of its owne power. And thus is this Nation now prepared for a ſettled Peace, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that is long in ripening, and ſoon rotten, unleſſe it be well fenced, and over-awed by a good Conſcience: But <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, was neither ſo good, nor ſo happy; his Heart affected to be high, but his Head could not bear it; he turns giddy, and runs far wide: Thoſe that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him, he inforces into Forrain Countries; and himſelfe holds on his careere over hedge and ditch into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where under pretention of holding Poſſeſſion of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he loſt <hi>England,</hi> and whiles he playes his game in that Country, another playes King, by your leave, in this, and ſteps into the Throne; teaching the King thereby this leſſon, though too late; <hi>That Nonreſidency is dangerous for a Preiſt, but unto a Prince, fatall, unleſſe his Subjests be faſt to him, when he is looſe to them.</hi>

               <p>HE that played this pranke was the baniſhed Duke of <hi>Hertford,</hi> ſonne of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and by his death, now become Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> by Title, and as the times then were, it proved not hard to get more: For in uncertain Common-wealths, it is an eaſie thing for a man of opinion, that hath leſſe then his due, to get more then he ought. As ſonne of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> this Duke had the peoples good wiſhes; he (a wiſe and a brave man, and under oppreſſion) gained the more upon the people, by how much they love brave men, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, ſuch as ſuffer wrong, eſpecially from ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, from whom they all found the like meaſure. All theſe concurring with the Kings abſence, invited the Duke to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture himſelf upon the influence of the peoples favour, to gain his own right, and what more the people would allow him; and if no more, yet his Honour is ſaved, he came for his own, and attained his end.</p>
               <p>Thus then he comes over, without Army, or Forraine power, or other help, ſaving the advice and intereſt of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Arundell,</hi> who was his Companion in ſuffering, Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Cauſe, and no leſſe welcome to the Clergy, then the Duke himſelf was to the people; and ſo gained power to the Duke, though he brought none. Upon their Arivall the aſpects of all are benigne; the Dukedome waits for him,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52042:72"/>
and in that, as in a mirrour he beholds the way fair and eaſie; yet further, it pities him to ſee the Kingdome ſo torne in peices and ſpoyled: The People knew him able, and hoped him willing to amend all; they offer him their Service, which he accepts, and therewith the Crowne: ſo hard a thing it is for to put a ſtop to a Conquerour in his careere.</p>
               <p>By this time was the Duke of <hi>Hertford</hi> thus become Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and King of <hi>England,</hi> under the name of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Fourth, by a deſigne, that in the proof was more eaſie then commendable; and which being effected, coſt more skill to make that ſeem fair, which was ſo foul, then to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the thing. He therefore firſt heaps together Titles, enough to have buried the clamour of Uſurpation, if it would have ſucceeded. Conqueſt was a Title freeſt from diſpute, whiles Power holds; but it lookes better from a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Enemy, then one ſworn to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crowne; and therefore after that had ſerved his turne, he diſclaymed it as that which was, though meet enough to have, yet unmeet to hold.</p>
               <p>His right by Deſignation from his Predeceſſour, he glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon, but durſt not adventure it too deep into the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples conſideration, whoſe Anceſtors had formerly over-ruled the Caſe againſt King <hi>John.</hi> He then ſtayed upon a concealed Title, from a concealed Sonne of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, of whom they who liſted might be perſwaded; but few beleived the thing, nor did himſelf, but thence takes his flight up to a <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> or ſome hidden Fate that called him to the worke; but even there his wings failed him, and ſo he falls flat upon the Peoples Election, <hi>De bene eſſe.</hi> Some of theſe, or all together might make Title enough for a great man that reſolved to hold by hooke, what he had got by crooke; and therefore truſſing them up all together, he enters his claime to the Crown, <hi>As comming from the blood Royall from King</hi> Henry, <hi>and through the Right that God his grace hath ſent me; with the help of my Kinne, and Freinds, to recover the ſame, which was in point to be undone, for want of good Governance, and due Justice</hi>: The extract of all, is, that he was choſen
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52042:72"/>
by the People and Parliament then ſitting: And allbeit that by the Reſignation of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, the Parliament might ſeem, in ſtrict conſtruction of Law, to be expired, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Kings power, who called them together, yet did not that Parliament ſo apprehend the matter, but proceeded, not onely to definitive Sentence of Depoſing him, but declared themſelves by their Commiſſaries, to be the three States, and Repreſentative of the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> maintaining thereby their ſubſiſtency by the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the Members together, although their Cheif was for the preſent like a head in a trance, till they had choſen <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth to ſucceed in the Throne, by this means preventing the conceit of diſcontinuance in the very Bud of the Notion.</p>
               <p>Much like his entry was his continuance, a continuall tide of Forraine and Domeſticke Warre and Conſpiracy, enough to exerciſe his great Courage, although he was more Wiſe then Warlike, being loath to take up Armes; (for well he knew, that a ſick Title never ſleeps but in a Bed of Peace) and more loth to lay them down; for beſides Victory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he gained upon his Enemies in time of Warre; he knew how to make advantage of them in time of Peace, to ſecure his Freinds to keep others in awe, to inforce ſuch Lawes as ſtood with reaſon of State, and the preſent poſture of Affaires, and where Lawes failed, to fill up the period with Dictates of his owne will. And upon this Account the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was a government full of Ulcers, of Blood-ſhed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard of Perſons, whether of the Lay, or Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without Legall triall, or priviledge of Clerke. So was Arch Biſhop <hi>Walden</hi> Dethroned, Arch Biſhop <hi>Scroope</hi> put to death, and Dukes were diſmounted without Conviction, or Imputation, ſaving of the Kings diſpleaſure: Taxes mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, although begotten they were upon the Parliament, like ſome monſtrous Births ſhewne to the World, to let it know what could be done; but concealed by Hiſtorians,<note place="margin">Walſing.</note> to let it know what may not be done. Yea, the priviledges of Parliament invaded in point of Election: A thing that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52042:73"/>
none of his Predeceſſors ever Exemplyfied to him, nor none of his Succeſſors ever Imitated him in; nor had he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, but that he was loath the People ſhould know more of the Government then needs muſt.</p>
               <p>To keep off Forrain troubles, he made Peace with <hi>France,</hi> for longer time then he lived; yet was ever infeſted with the Sword of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in behalf of <hi>Richard</hi> the Seconds Queene, and with the Factions betweene the Houſes of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in which he had intereſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to preſerve the Forraine Neighbour-hood in Parties one againſt another, that himſelfe might attend his owne Security at home. He would have moved the <hi>Scots,</hi> but they were already under <hi>Engliſh</hi> Banners; nor could he reach ſo farre, having ſo many Enemies even in his owne boſome. The <hi>Welſh</hi> were big with Antiquity, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Defence; they beginne to bethinke themſelves of their Ancient Principality, hold the Kings Armes at hard Duty,<note place="margin">2 H. 4. cap. 12. 4 H. 4. cap. 26.32. &amp; cap. 19.20, 28.31.</note> till by Lawes enacted in Parliament, they loſt their Liberties of bearing Office Miniſteriall, or of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of holding Caſtle, of Convention without the Kings Licence, yea, of Purchaſe; and ſo by degrees were brought downe from the height of a Free Principality to be ſtarved in their Power, and inferiour to a Free People. And thus the <hi>Welſh</hi> on the one ſide, the diſcontented Lords on the other; and <hi>Mortimars</hi> Title in all, ſo buſied the King, as though he lopped off the tops as they ſprang up, yet they ſprang forth as they were lopped; nor was it the Kings lot all this while to finde out the Root of All, or to ſtrike at that.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when time had made all troublers weary, yet he ſtil ſits upon thornes; he was jealous of his Subjects, jealous of his Son, yea jealous of himſelf. It being ever the firſt and laſt of his thoughts, how to keep his Crowne. For the moſt part of his Reigne, he was troubled with the walking Ghoſts of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond; ever and anon he was alive, he was here, he was there, and ſo the Peoples mindes were alwayes kept at random; but when all theſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52042:73"/>
Spirits are conjured downe, <hi>Richard</hi> the ſeconds Ghoſte is yet within <hi>Henries</hi> owne breaſt. So ruled <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, an unhappy confident man, that durſt undertake more then he would, did more then he ought, was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull in what he did, yet never attained his end; to be ſure of his Crowne, and quiet of minde. For a plaiſter to this ſore, he turned ſomewhat towards Religion; but ſhewed it more in Zeale to Church-men, then workes of Piety, and therefore may be thought to regard them, rather as his beſt freinds in right of Arch Biſhop <hi>Arundell,</hi> then as in relation to Religion; yet as if he overlooked that,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Eccleſ. Ang. <hi>618.</hi>
                  </note> he deſires their prayers, becomes a ſtrict obſerver of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious rights, is fiery Zealous againſt the Lollards, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a journey into the holy Land, and Warr againſt the Infidels, (the common Phyſick of guilty Kings in thoſe dayes.) Breifly, he did will to do any thing but undoe what he had done; and had done more, had his journey to the holy Land ſucceeded; but (whither haſtned or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, by a propheſie of the ending of his dayes, falls not within my Penn to cenſure:) entring upon the worke he died; in the beginning of his purpoſes, in the midſt of his feares, never came to the holy Land, and yet yeilded up his laſt breath in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe Parliament was then ſitting,<note place="margin">Henry the Fifth.</note> and was witneſſe of the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, as it had beene of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon the Throne, as if purpoſed to ſee to the courſ of the Crowne, in the doubtfull currant; betweene the two Houſes of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> and to maintaine their own honor in directing the Scepter according to their warranty upon a late intaile by act of Parliament; yet did not all reſt upon this; for the Heire of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was a man every inch of him, and meant not to Moote upon the point: His Father died a King, and he his Heire; had the Crowne, and was reſolved to hold it: A rough young man he had beene formerly, and bold enough to outface ſmall doubts in point of ſucceſſion, for he could (for a need) outface
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52042:74"/>
common civility it ſelfe. This might have lien in his way, for he that cannot govern himſelfe, can much leſſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern a Kingdome: Yet a hidden Providence concluded quite contrary, and rendred him a cleare teſtimony of a ſtrange change by the annointing oyle, like that of <hi>Saul</hi> that forthwith had the Spirit of another man: So though not hammered thereto by affliction, as was <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt; yet was he his parallell in Government and ſuperiour in ſucceſſe. Being ſeated in the Throne, all men thought it dangerous to abide the adventure of the turne of this Kings Spirit. The Clergy had but yeſterday tryed the Maſtery with the Laity, and gained it but by one Vote; there was no dealing with the Clergy, while Arch Biſhop <hi>Arundell</hi> lived, nor with him whiles <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or his merits were in memory, but now they both are dead, the Clergy, and the Laity, are upon even ground; this might make the Clergy now not over confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: The Lords looked on the King as a man like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſtrike him that ſtands next: The wiſe men ſaw he would be doing; all men were tired with inteſtine quarrells; and jumped in one, that he that would be in action ſhould act abroad, where he might get renowne, and a purchaſe big enough for his Spirit. <hi>Scotland</hi> was a Kingdome yet incompetent to the Kings appetite. <hi>France</hi> was the fairer marke and better game, and though too big for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> gripe, yet the Eagle ſtooped, and ſped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo well, as within ſix yeares he faſtned upon the Sword and Scepter, and a daughter of <hi>France,</hi> and might have ſeiſed the Crowne; but choſe to ſuffer a blurr to lye upon his title derived from <hi>Edward</hi> the third, rather then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr the Cenſure of Arrogancy over a ſtooping enemy; or to Pluck the fruit from the tree before it was fully ripe; which in time would fall into his lap, by a better Law then that of the Sword; otherwiſe it might be well conceited, that he that hath both right and Power, and will not ſeiſe, diſclaimes. Beſides the King was as well Inheritor to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Fate as Crowne; ſtill he had ſucceſſe, but the end
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52042:74"/>
was ſo farr diſtant that he died in the way thereto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The brave <hi>Dauphine</hi> of <hi>France</hi> maintaining Warr (after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the French King had yeilded up the Bucklers to <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth) till <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth died, and the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> did foregoe what they had formerly gotten in <hi>France,</hi> by the Sword of that great Commander. Nor did the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> gaine any thing in the concluſion of this Warr, but an honorable windy repute, of being one of the five cheif Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſtendome, (if honor it be to be reputed amongſt the Nations) a Conquerer of <hi>France</hi>; the cheif Leader unto the dethroning of three Popes at once, the election of Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> and of giving a cure to that dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound of the Popedome, which had ſpent the bloud of two hundred thouſand mens lives loſt in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</p>
               <p>Theſe forraine ingagements made the King leſſe ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, of point of Prerogative at home; and the rather, becauſe he knew the way to conquer; his private enemies armes, and his Subjects hearts; without loſſe of honor in the one, or reverence in the other. He loved juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ranke of his Predeceſſors, and in ſome reſpects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove himſelfe; for he advanced <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> for doing ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, though to the Kings owne ſhame. He liked not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude himſelfe into elections, and therefore though requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Monks of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Antiq. Brit.</note> he would not nominate a Succeſſor to Arch Biſhop <hi>Arundell,</hi> but left the whole worke to them. In the authority of his place, he was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and where his Predeceſſors did matters without the Lords conſent,<note place="margin">Walſing.</note> when he made his Uncle the Marquis of <hi>Dorcet</hi> Duke of <hi>Exceter</hi> and had given him a pention to maintaine that honor, he asked the Lords conſent thereto. To the Clergy he was more then juſt, if not indulgent, led thereto by his Fathers example, as being wrapped up in the ſame Intereſt as I conceive, rather then out of any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their wayes, now growing more bold upon uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then in former times. Or it may be that having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in that work in <hi>France,</hi> which to any rationall man

muſt needs appear above the power of the King, and all the Realm of <hi>England</hi>; he looked upon it as more then humane, and himſelf as an inſtrument of Miracles; and was ſtirred up in his zeal to God, according to his underſtanding in thoſe darke times, to give the Clergy ſcope, and to pleaſure them with their liberty of the Canon Law, that began now to thunder with fire and terror, in ſuch manner, that neither greatneſſe nor multitude could withſtand the dint, as was evidenced in that Penance inflicted upon the Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> and his Lady,<note place="margin">Antiq.

                  </note> in Caſe of bloodſhed in Holy Ground, and their hot purſuit of the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> unto a death of a new Nature, for ſomewhat done, which was ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Treaſon, and ſometimes Hereſie: And thus became <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth baptized in the flames of the <hi>Lollards,</hi> as his Father had ſadly rendered up his Spirit in the ſame. I ſay, in this he is to be looked upon, as one miſled for want of light, rather then in oppoſition againſt the light: For in his laſt Will, wherein men are wont to be more ſerious and ſincere; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his private regards, he forgets not to reflect upon Religion to this purpoſe; <hi>We further bequeath</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the redundant Mercy of the moſt excellent Saviour, the Faith, Hope, and Charity, the Vertue, Proſperity, and Peace, of the Kings our Succeſſours, and of our Kingdome of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>that God for his Goodneſſe ſake would Protect, Viſite, and Defend them from Diviſions, Diſſenſions, and from all manner of deceitfulneſſe of Heretiques.</hi> And thus Piety, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Moderation of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, Adorned and Crowned the honour of his Courage, and Greatneſſe, with that honourable Title of <hi>Prince of Preiſts</hi>; and had he been bleſſed with a clearer light, he might as well under God have obtained the Title of <hi>Prince of Princes,</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing that might have rendered him a preſident of Fame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:52042:75"/>BUt the time is now come,<note place="margin">Henry the Sixth.</note> that the Tide of <hi>Englands</hi> Glory muſt turn, and the ſudden Conqueſt in <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, not unlike the <hi>Macedonian Monarchy,</hi> muſt diſgorge it ſelfe of what it had haſtily devoured, but never could digeſt. Three things concurred hereunto, one dangerous, the other two fatall to the flouriſhing condition of any Nation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the King is a <hi>Minor</hi> in the leaſt degree that ever any Prince ſate on <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne; He entered thereinto, neither knowing what he did, nor where he was; and ſome ſay, he ſate therein in his Mothers lap: for his life had been more in the wombe, then abroade. A ſad preſage of what followed, for many men thinke that he was in a lap all his dayes. Nor are the cheife men to be blamed herein, for its a certain Truth, that its much better that Election of a King ſhould be grounded upon a rule that is known, though it be by diſcent of Inheritance, then upon none at all. For if a Childe ſhould ſucceed, or a Lunaticke, yet where the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Government reſteth upon the Repreſentative of the People, there is the leſſe cauſe of complaint, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being ſtill the ſame, both for Wiſedome, Strength, and Uniformity; though it may be the Nation not ſo active and brave. For a Common-wealth can admit of no Minority, though a Monarchy by deſcent may.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this deficiency in Nature might have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, but that theſe times were unhappy in the great power of the Lords; to pleaſe whom, the Government is parcelled out into two ſhares: One is made Protectour of the Kings Perſon, the other Protectour of the Kingdome; too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by one: For let their Perſons be never ſo eminent for Abilities, if they be not as eminent for Humility, and ſelfe-Command, their hearts will ſoon over-rule their heads into a Faction: And therefore though the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> was a wiſe man, and the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> a wiſe man, yet the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> were not wiſe. On the other ſide, the Protectorſhip of the Kings
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52042:76"/>
Perſon, being in the Duke of <hi>Exceter,</hi> and that of the Realm in the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi>; things ſucceeded paſſing well, for they both had one publique aime, and the Duke of <hi>Exceter</hi> could comply with the Spirit of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who otherwiſe was not ſo pliant: But after five years, the Duke of <hi>Exceter</hi> dying, and the government of the Kings Perſon devolving to the Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> who ſided with the proud Cardinall of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and ſo not onely conſumed the reſt of the Kings Nonage in a reſtleſſe diſturbance of Affaires, but alſo diſpoyled <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, of the ſpirit of a King for the future, and ſo the Kingdome of a King: For it was not the condition of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, to be indowed with a ſpirit of ſuch height, but might well have been led by advice, and needed not the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> rugged brow, to overlooke him; who was not content to have the King onely attendant upon his advice; but muſt likewiſe have him under his rod, to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for his faults, and that by a Commiſſion under the Kings owne hand and ſeale, dated in the eleventh yeare of the Kings Reigne, and ſo under colour of Curbing, he killed that ſpirit in the King, which otherwiſe, doubt leſſe, had both ſpirit and pride enough to act himſelf above his due height, and could not have been ſo long a Childe, and ſo little a Man as he was.</p>
               <p>It is very true, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth by Will, ſeemed to countenance his Brothers, and it cannot be denied but the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> was of ſuch noble parts, that they could hardly dilate in any work inferiour to the government of a Kingdome. Nevertheleſſe, to yeild much to the will of a diſeaſed King in ſuch Caſes, is as ill a Preſident, as the making of a King by Adoption: and it had been better for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to have adhered to the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> alone, then by joyning him with another, bring into preſident ſuch a luxurient Complement of State, as a Protectorſhip of a Kingdome, which is of ſuch little uſe to a Common-wealth, and of ſo bitter Fruit to the Party, as muſt needs bring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance when it is too late: <hi>For he that can manage the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52042:76"/>
Protectorſhip of a Realme, without anger of good men, or envy of bad men, is fitting to live onely with Angels, and too good for the World.</hi> Nor did the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> meet with better meaſure, how wiſe ſoever he was, and truely devoted to the good of the Realme: For after foure and twenty years government, ſo wiſely and faithfully carried on by him, that Juſtice it ſelf could not touch his Perſon; unjuſtice did, and he received this reward from his Nephew <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, that he died in the darke, becauſe the Cauſe durſt not indure the light.</p>
               <p>Now is <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, perſwaded that he is of full age, he had laid aſide his Guardian, the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi>; but forgetting to ſue out his Livery, he betakes himſelf from the Grace of God, into the warm Sunne, (as the Proverb is) changing the advice of a faithfull experienced wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, for the government of an Imperious Woman, his Queen, who allowed him no more of a King, then the very Name; and that alſo ſhe abuſed to outface the World: and after ſhe had removed the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> out of the way, undertook the ſway of the Kingdome in her own Perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Forrainer, neither knowing, nor caring for other Law, then the will of a Woman.</p>
               <p>Thus the glory of the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> goes down, and now a Star of the Houſe of <hi>Yorke</hi> appears in the riſing, and the People looke to it. The Queene hereat becomes a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and begins the Civill Warres, between the two Houſes, wherein (her <hi>Engliſh</hi> party growing wiſe and weary) ſhe prayes aide of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a <hi>Nation</hi> that like unto Crowes, ever wait to prey upon the infirmities of <hi>England.</hi> The Warres continue about ſixteen yeares by fits, wherin the firſt loſſe fell to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> party, the pretentions being yet onely for good Government: Then the Feild is quiet, for about foure yeares, after which the clamor of ill Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment revives, and together therewith a claime to the Crown by the Houſe of <hi>Yorke</hi> is avouched; thereupon the Warres grew hot, for about foure yeares more, and then an ebbe of as long quiet enſues.

Unhappy King, I ſay, that to purchaſe his Kingdomes Freedome from a Forraine Warre, ſold himſelfe to a Woman, and yet loſt his bargaine, and left it to Obſervation; <hi>That a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious man, that marries for by-regards, never thrives:</hi> For <hi>France</hi> eſpied their advantage, they had maintained Warre with <hi>England,</hi> from the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, with various ſucceſſe: The Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> being Regent for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the ſpace of fourteen yeares mightily ſuſtained the fainting condition of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> affaires in thoſe parts, and having Crowned his Maſter <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the ninth yeare died, leaving behinde him an Honourable Witneſſe, even from his Enemies, <hi>That he was a brave Commander, a true Patriot, and a faithfull Servant, to his Lord and Brother</hi> Henry <hi>the Fifth, and to his Sonne</hi> Henry <hi>the Sixth.</hi> But now the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> is dead; and though <hi>France</hi> had concluded a Peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet they could not forget the ſmart of their Rod; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded their Peace upon a Marriage, to be had with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of their own blood, and intereſt; and what they could not effect by Armes in their own Feild, they did upon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> ground by a feminine Spirit, which they ſent over into <hi>England</hi> to be their Queen, and in one Civill Warre (ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sword, then they could formerly doe by all the men of <hi>France</hi>) were revenged upon <hi>England</hi> to the full,<note place="margin">Comin. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi>

A Kingdome is never more befooled, then in the Marriage of their King; if the Lady be great, ſhe is good enough, though as <hi>Jezabell,</hi> ſhe will not either reverence her Husband, obey her Lord and King, nor regard his People. And thus was this Kingdome ſcourged by a marriage, for the ſinne of the Wiſe men, that (building upon a falſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation) adviſed the King in the breach of Contract with the Earle of <hi>Arminiacks</hi> Daughter.

               <head>CHAP. XIV. Of the Parliament, during the Reignes of theſe Kings.</head>
               <p>THe intereſt of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> is never more Predominant, then when Kings want Title or Age: The firſt of theſe was the Caſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, but of them all in relation to the pretended Law of the Crown: but <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, had the diſadvantage of both, whereof in its due place.</p>
               <p>The pretended Law of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> is to hold by Inheritance, with power to diſpoſe of the ſame, in ſuch manner, by ſuch means, and unto ſuch perſons, as the King ſhall pleaſe. To this it cannot be denied, divers Kings had put in their claimes, by deviſing their Crowne in their laſt Will; but the ſucceſſe muſt be attributed to ſome Power under God, that muſt be the Executor when all is done, and which muſt in Caſes of Debate concerning Succeſſion, determine the matter by a Law, beſt known to the Judge himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Not much unlike hereunto, is the Caſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, who like a Bud, putting up in the place of a fading Leafe, diſmounts his Predeceſſor; Firſt, from the Peoples

But when he comes to plead his Title to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Princes by Proteſtation, laying aſide the mention of them all; he juſtifies upon the unanimous conſent of the Parliament, and the People in his own onely Perſon: And ſo before all the World, confeſſed the Authority and power of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in diſpoſing of the Crown in ſpeciall Caſes as a ſufficient barr unto any pretended right that might ariſe from the Houſe of <hi>Mortimar.</hi> And yet becauſe he never walks ſafely that hath an Enemy purſuing him ſtill within reach, he bethinks himſelf not ſure enough, unleſſe his next Succeſſors follow the dance upon the ſame foote; to this end an Act of Parliament leades the tune, whereby the Crowne is granted or confirmed to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth for life, and intailed upon his Sonnes, <hi>Thomas, John,</hi> and <hi>Humphrey,</hi> by a Petition preſented, 5. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.</p>

               <p>Now if ſuch as theſe things were thus done, not by one Parliament, which poſſibly might be overwayed by Factions, but by the courſe of a <hi>Series</hi> of Parliaments, that mightily laboured againſt Faction, and unworthy ends and aimes, that man ſhal determin the ſame to be unjuſt or indiſcreet, ſhould himſelf firſt be determined to be very juſt, and exceeding wiſe. Nor was the Parliament partiall in all this, but being in a way of Reformation, it ſet upon the work of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Some that are very zealous in the point of Arbitrary and abſolute Government of Kings in this Nation, and all in other, amongſt other grounds, reſt upon this one, That an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King hath power to call Parliaments, and diſſolve them; to make and unmake Members as he ſhal pleaſe. I do eaſily grant that Kings have many Occaſions and Opportunities to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile their People, yet can they do nothing as Kings, but what of right they ought to doe: They may call Parliaments, but neither as often or ſeldome as they pleaſe, if the Statute-Laws of this Realme might take place: Nor if they could, is that power neceſſarily, and abſolutely ariſing from Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; ſeeing it is well known that ſuch power is betruſted
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52042:79"/>
by the Superiour States in other Nations, to the Inferiour, who dayly attend on publique Affaires, and therefore can diſcern when the generall Conventions are moſt neceſſary. As touching the diſſolving of Parliaments againſt the wills of the Houſes, its true that ſad Preſidents have beene of later times in that kinde; and ſo for want of due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, Parliaments have been inforced to adjourn, to prevent a worſe inconvenience; but theſe are infirmities, better bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in ſilence, then produced as Arguments of power, ſeeing its evident that Kings themſelves were no greater gainers thereby, then an Angry man is by his paſſions. It is true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that Kings may make Lords, and Corporations, that may ſend their Burgeſſes to the Parliament, and thus the King may make as many as he will (as the Pope did with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi>) yet cannot he unmake them when he pleaſes, nor take the Members from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, without attainder and forfeiture, according to the knowne Law: Neither can all theſe Inſtances prove, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have the ſole and ſupreame Power over the Parliament: Nor did the Parliament in theſe times allow of any ſuch Authority, and therefore proceeded for the reforming of themſelves, by themſelves, in many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars as the Statutes do hold forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">7 H. 4. cap. 15.</note>And firſt in the point of Elections, (for an error in that, is like an error in the firſt Concoction, that ſpoiles the whole Nutriment,<note place="margin">23 H. 6. cap. 15.</note>) they ordained that the Election of Knights ſhall be at the next County Court, after the Writ delivered to the Sheriffe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in full Court betweene the houres of eight and nine in the morning, Proclamation ſhall be made of the day and place of the Parliament. That the Suters duely ſummoned, and others there Preſent, ſhall then proceed to the Election; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any Prayer or Commandement to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. That the names of the Perſons elected, (whether preſent or abſent they be) ſhall be returned by Indenture, betweene the Sheriffe and the Elizors; and that a Clauſe to that end ſhall be added to the Writ of Summons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:52042:79"/>This was enough to make the Sheriffe underſtand,<note place="margin">11 H. 4. cap. 1. 8 H. 6. cap. 7. 23 H. 6. c. 15.</note> but not to obey, till a penalty of one hundred pound is by other Lawes impoſed upon him, and a yeares impriſonment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baile or Mainpriſe, beſides damages for falſe return in ſuch Caſes: and the party ſo unduely returned, Fined, and deprived of all the wages for his ſervice. Thus the manner of Election is reduced; but the Perſons are more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: For hitherto any man of <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood promiſcuouſly had right to give or receive a Vote, although his reſidency were over the wide World.</p>
               <p>But the Parliament in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth,<note place="margin">1 H. 5. cap. 1. 8 H. 6. cap. 7.</note> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced theſe alſo, (whether they were ſuch as did chuſe, or were choſen) unto their proper Counties, or elſe rendered them uncapable to Vote or ſerve for any County. And the like Order was made for the Burroughs, <hi>Viz. That no Perſon muſt ſerve for any City or Burrough,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">23 Hen. 6. cap. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>nor give Vote in Electing ſuch as ſhall ſerve for that Towne, unleſſe they be both Free, and Reſiants within that City or Burrough</hi>: A Law no leſſe wholſome then ſeaſonable. For the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, had taught men to know by experience, That a King that hath Souldiers ſcattered over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, can eaſily ſway the County-Courts, and make Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments for their owne tooth. Yet this was not enough, For all Elizors, though of the meaneſt ſort, yet are ſtill able to doe as much hurt with their Vote, as thoſe of the beſt ſort both for wiſedome and publique minde, can doe good by theirs. This made Elections much ſubject to parties, and confuſions, and rendered the Parliament much leſſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>A remedy hereunto is provided, in the minority of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth,<note place="margin">8 H. 6. cap. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Viz. That no man ſhould give his Vote in Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the County, unleſſe he hath forty ſhillings yearely in Free Lands or Tenements, and this is to be teſtified upon Oath of the Party.</hi> And more plainly it is ordered (within two yeares after) that each Elizor ſhall have Frank Tenement of that vallue within the ſame County.<note place="margin">10 H. 6. cap. 2.</note> And thus the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men yeilded up their liberty of Election to the Free-holders,

poſſibly not knowing what they did; Nevertheleſſe, the Parliament well knew what they did; this change was no leſſe good then great.</p>
               <p>For firſt, theſe times were no times for any great meaſure of Civility: The Preface of the Statute ſhewes, that the meaneſt held himſelf as good a man, as the greateſt in the Countrey, and this tended to parties, tumults, and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, where the multitude prevaile, the meaner ſort are upon the upper hand; and theſe (generally ignorant) cannot judge of Perſons, nor Times, but being for the moſt part led by Faction or Affection, rather then by right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, make their Elections, and thereby the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell of this Nation, leſſe generous and noble.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is no leſſe equity in the change, then po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy: for what can be more reaſonable, then that thoſe men onely, ſhould have their Votes in Election of the Common Councell of the Kingdome, whoſe Eſtates are chargeable with the publique Taxes and Aſſeſſements, and with the wages of thoſe perſons that are choſen for the publique Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: But above all the reſt, this advancing of the Free-holders in this manner of Election, was beneficiall to the Free-men of <hi>England,</hi> although perchance they conſidered not thereof; and this will more clearly appeare in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe three particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it abated the power of the Lords, and great men, who held the inferiour ſort at their Devotion, and much of what they had by their Vote.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it rendered the body of the people more brave; for the advancing of the Free-holder, above the Free-man, raiſeth the ſpirit of the meaner ſort to publique regards, and (under a kinde of Ambition) to aſpire unto the degree of a Free-holder. that they may be ſome what in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and thus leaving the meaneſt rank ſifted to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry branne, they become leſſe conſiderable, and more ſubject to Coercive power, whiles in the mean time the Free-holder now advanced unto the degree of a Yeoman, becomes no
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52042:80"/>
leſſe carefull to maintain correſpondency with the Lawes, then he was induſtrious in the attaining of his degree.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by this means now the Law makes a ſeparation of the inferiour Clergy, and Cloyſtered people, from this ſervice, wherein they might ſerve particular ends much, but <hi>Rome</hi> much more. For nothing appeareth, but that theſe dead Perſons in Law, were nevertheleſſe Fsee-men in Fact, and loſt not the liberty of their Birth-right, by entering into Religion, to become thereby either Bond, or no Free-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the people of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, as a binding plaiſter above the reſt, Firſt a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Law is made,<note place="margin">23 H. 6. c. 15.</note> that the Perſons elected in the County muſt not be of the degree of a Yeoman, but of the moſt noted Knights, Eſquires, or Gentlemen of the Countrey; which tacitely implies that it was too common to advance thoſe of the meaner ſort; whether by reaſon of the former waſting times, Knights and Eſquires were grown ſcant in number, or (by reaſon of their rudeneſſe) in account: Or it may be the Yeomanry grew now to feel their ſtrength, and meant not to be further underlings to the great men, then they are to their Fethers, to were them no longer then they will make them brave. Secondly, the Perſon thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, his intertainment muſt be accordingly, and therefore the manner of taxing in full County,<note place="margin">23 H. 6. c. 11.</note> and levying the rate of Wages for their maintenance, is reformed and ſettled. And laſtly, their Perſons are put under the Protection of the Law in an eſpeciall manner, for as their work is full of reflexion, ſo formerly they had met with many ſad influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences for their labour.<note place="margin">11 H. 6. c. 11.</note> And therefore a penall Law is made againſt force to be made upon the Perſons of thoſe workmen of State, either in their going to that Service, or attending thereupon, making ſuch Delinquents liable to Fine and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and double damages. And thus however the times were full of confuſions, yet a foundation was laid of a more uniforme Government in future times, then <hi>England</hi> hitherto had ſeen.</p>

                  <note place="margin">32 H. 6. m. 7.</note> This title carried along with it a power, different from that of a King onely in honor, and the Perſon ſo adorned may be ſaid to ſway the Scepter, but not to weare the Crowne. And therefore in the minority of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, when as the Government was ordered by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to that end a Protector was made, and he wel guarded with a Privy Councill, and they provided with inſtructions, one of them was, that in all matters not to be tranſacted ordinarily but by the Kings expreſſe conſent, the Privy Councell ſhould adviſe with the Prorector; but this
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52042:82"/>
is not ſo needfull, in regard that it concerneth the power of executing of Lawes, which by right of the liberty of the Subject is the known duty of the Scepter, in whoſe hands ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is holden. And therefore I ſhall paſſe to the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, wherein its evident that the Protectors power was no whit inferiour to the Kings power. For firſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, <hi>Ex officio,</hi> by advice of the Councell, did ſummon Parliaments by Writs, even as the Kings themſelves, under their owne Teſte; and if not bear the Royall Aſſent, yet did they direct the ſame, and received Petitions in Parliament to them directed as to Kings, and every way ſupplied the roome of a King, in order to the perfecting, publiſhing, and inforcing of Law to Execution, Secondly, the Parliaments holden by Protectors, and Lawes therein made, are no whit inferiour to thoſe by the King, whether for Honour, or Power: And therefore, if a Parliament be-holden by the Lord <hi>Warden,</hi> and ſitting the Parliament, the King in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall arrive, and be there preſent; neither is the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament interrupted thereby, nor the power thereof changed at all; though the power and place of the Wardenſhip of the Kingdome, doth utterly vaniſh by the perſonall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the King; becauſe in all Caſes where the King is ſubſervient to the Kingdome, or the Common-wealth: The Lord <hi>Warden</hi> in his abſence is conſervient unto him, being in his ſtead, and not under him, for the very Place ſuppoſeth him as not, becauſe not preſent. And this was by a Law declaratively publiſhed at ſuch time as <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth was Regent of <hi>France,</hi> and therefore by common preſumption,<note place="margin">8 H. 5. cap. 1.</note> was likely to have much occaſion of reſidence in that Kingdome, and it holdeth in equall force with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lawes of the higheſt Size, which is the rather to be noted becauſe it is (though under a Protector) obligatory to the King, and makes his perſonall preſence no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable then the preſence of his ſhadow. For the King ſpent three whole yeares in the <hi>French</hi> Warres, and during that time never ſaw <hi>England,</hi> where nevertheleſſe in that <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> three Parliaments had been holden, one by the Duke of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52042:82"/>
                  <hi>Bedford,</hi> and two by the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi>; in the laſt of which this Law was made. And in truth if wee looke upon this title of the Kingdomes Guardianſhip in its bare linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without lights and ſhadows, it will appeare little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a Crown of feathers worne onely for bravery, and in nothing adding to the real ability of the governing part of this Nation: Neither were the perſons of theſe <hi>Magnificoes</hi> ſo wel deſerving, nor did the Nation expect any ſuch matter from them. <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt was a wiſe King, and yet in his abſence choſe <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond to hold that place, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then not above fourteen yeares of age; afterwards <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the ſeconds Queen, and the Lords of her party, were wiſe enough in their way, and yet they choſe <hi>Edward</hi> the third to be the <hi>Cuſtos regni,</hi> then not fourteen yeares old, his Father in the meane time being neither abſent from the Kingdome nor depoſed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rot. Pat.</hi> 5. E. 3. p. 1. m. 16.</note> but onely diſmiſſed from acting in the adminſtration of the Government. <hi>Edward</hi> the third follows the ſame example, he firſt makes his Brother <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Eltham, Cuſtos regni,</hi> and this he did at two ſeveral times, once when he was but eleven yeares old, afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when hee was about fourteene: Then he made his Sonne the Black Prince upon ſeverall occaſions three times Lord <hi>Warden</hi> of the Kingdome, once he being about nine yeares old, and againe when he was eleven yeares old, and once when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fourteen yeares old. Laſtly, <hi>Edward</hi> the third ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his ſon <hi>Lionell</hi> Duke <hi>Clarence</hi> unto this place of <hi>Cuſtos regni,</hi> when as he was ſcarce eight years old; all which will appeare upon the comparing their ages with the ſeverall Rolls of 25 <hi>E</hi> 1. and 3, 5, 12, 14, 16, 19, <hi>E</hi> 3. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the worke of a <hi>Cuſtos regni</hi> be ſuch as may be as wel done by the infants of Kings as by the wiſeſt Councellor, or moſt valiant man; it is in my opinion manifeſt that the place is of little other uſe to this Common-wealth then to ſerve as attire to a comely Perſon, to make it ſeeme more faire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in faſhion, nor doth it advance the vallue of a King, one graine above what his perſonall endowments doe deſerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:52042:83"/>Hitherto of the title and power; the next conſideration will be of the original Fountain from whence it is derived, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the preſidents are cleare and plaine, that ordinarily they are the next and immediate ofſpring of Kings, if they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent whithin the foure ſeas; to be by them enabled by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents or Commiſſion: But whether preſent or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the Parliament when it ſate did ever peruſe their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and if it ſaw need, changed, inlarged, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged, both it and them. Thus was the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> made Lord <hi>Warden</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth (he being then in <hi>France</hi>) in the roome of the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> the like alſo in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixths time, when as the King was young; for then the Parliament made the Duke of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Lord <hi>Warden,</hi> and added unto that title, the title of Protector. Afterward at the Dukes going over into <hi>France,</hi> they committed that Service to the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> (if I forget not the nature of the Roll) during the Duke of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> abſence, and with a <hi>Salvo</hi> of his right. Nor unlike here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto was the courſe that was taken by the Parliament in theſe ſullen later times of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, whereof more hereafter in the next Paragraph.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the limitation of this high power and title is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent according to the occaſion, for the Guardianſhip of the Kingdome by common intendment, is to endure no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the King is abſent from the helme, either by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary deſerting the worke, or imployment in forrain parts; though united they be under the Government of the ſame King; together with this Nation, ſuch as are theſe parts of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> then under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fee: This is apparent from the nature of that ſtatute of <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth formerly mentioned; for if there was need to provide by that Statute, that the Kings Arrivall and Perſonall Preſence ſhould not diſſolve the Parliament, aſſembled by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Cuſtos regni</hi>; then doth it imply, that the perſonall preſence of the King, by and upon his Arrivall had otherwiſe determined the Parliament and that authority whereby it ſate. But the preſidents are more cleare, all of them generally
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52042:83"/>
running in theſe or the like words, <hi>In abſentia Regis,</hi> or <hi>Quamdiu Rex fuerit in partibus tranſmarinis.</hi> It is alſo to be granted, that the Kings will is many times ſubjoyned thereunto, as if it were in him to diſplace them, and place others in his abſence; yet doe I finde no preſident of any ſuch nature, without the concurrence of the Lords or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet that the Parliament hath ordered ſuch things without his conſent. For when <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, paſſing to the Holy Land, had left the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> to execute that place during his abſence in remote parts; the Lords finding the Biſhop unfaithfull in his Charge, excluded him both from that place and Kingdome, and made the Kings Brother <hi>John,</hi> Lord <hi>Warden</hi> in his ſtead.</p>
               <p>But in the Caſe of the Protectorſhip, which ſuppoſeth diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the Perſon of the King, the ſame by common intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to continue during the Kings diſability; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Caſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, it was determined,<note place="margin">8 H. 6. n. 2.</note> that the Protectorſhip doth <hi>Ipſo Facto,</hi> ceaſe at the Kings Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becauſe thereby the King is ſuppoſed able to govern; although in later times it hath not ſo beene holden: For Kings have been capable of that Ceremony, as ſoon as of the Title, and yet commonly are ſuppoſed to be under the rule of neceſſity of Protectorſhip, till they be fourteen years of age, or (as the Caſe may be) longer: For although <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was once thought ripe, when he was eight yeares old, yet in the iſſue he proved ſcarce ripe for the Crowne at his two and twentieth yeare. Nevertheleſſe, the default of Age is not the onely incapacity of Kings; they have infirmities as other men, yea more dangerous then any other man; which though an unpleaſant tune it be to harp upon, yet it is a Theame, that Nations ſometimes are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ruminate upon, when God will give them Kings in his wrath, and thoſe alſo over to their own luſts in his anger. In ſuch Caſes therefore, this Nation ſometimes have fled to the refuge of a Protector, and ſeldome it is, that they can determine for how long: When <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty yeares old; <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> was made
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52042:84"/>
Protector, and Defendor of the Realme, and of the Church; It was done (if the Record ſaith true) by the King himſelfe, <hi>Autoritate Parliamenti</hi>: It was further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by the Parliament, that though this was to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, <hi>Quamdiu Regi placuerit,</hi> yet the Duke ſhould hold that place, till the Kings Sonne <hi>Edward,</hi> ſhould come to yeares of diſcretion, and ſhall Declare that he will take that place upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>Rot. Pat.</hi> 32. Hen. 6. m. 7.</note>The ground hereof is ſaid to be, that the King was, <hi>Gravi infirmitate detentus,</hi> which could not be intended of any bodily diſtemper; for neither doth any ſuch thing appeare by any Author, or Record. Nor if ſuch had been, yet had it been an irrationall thing in the Parliament, to determine the ſame upon the Princes diſcretion, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Charge upon himſelfe. It ſeemeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it was, <hi>Gravis infirmitas Animi,</hi> and that this way of the Parliament tended to a tacite ſliding him out of the Government of the Kingdome, by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Expreſſion of a Generall incapacity in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion of all that hath beene ſaid concerning this Title, is double: One, that both the <hi>Custos Regni,</hi> and <hi>Protector,</hi> are not ſubſiſtent, but conſiſtent, with that of a King, becauſe it ſuppoſes a King under incapacity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they tend to teach the people a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of having one Cheife, although it may, in truth, ſeem to be but a tricke of State; like ſome pretty carved Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims in the Roofe of a building, that doe ſeeme to beare it up, when as, in truth, it is the Pillers that ſupporteth both it and them.</p>

               <p>NAtions doe meet with their Exigencies as well as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and in ſuch condition, Reſolutions taken up by ſudden Conceit, are many times more effectuall then more mature deliberations, which require more time in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, are more ſlow in Concluſion, let ſlip opportunities, and fall ſhort of Expectation in the end. Such are the wayes of debate in the Grand Repreſentative of the Kingdome. Add hereunto, that in putting the Lawes in execution, greater diſcretion is required, then can enter into the head of any one man, and greater ſpeed then can ſtand with debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many: And therefore it is beyond all doubt, that the Conventicles of Councell, are no leſſe neceſſary in their Degree, then the Aſſembly of the Eſtates of this Nation, in their Grand Convention.</p>
               <p>Yet with this Caveat, that one Genius may move in both; for otherwiſe the motions of Government muſt needs be inconſtant, inconſiſtent, and like that of an Hipocrite, one way abroade, another way at home; neither comfortable to it ſelfe, nor confiding to others: and therefore cannot theſe privater Councells, by any proportion of Reaſon, be better Conſtituted, then by the Repreſentative it ſelfe, that it may be a Creature made in its owne Image, one and the ſame, with the Image of the maker.</p>
               <p>This was the wiſedome and the practiſe of theſe times,<note place="margin">5 Hen. 4. n. 57 8. n. 31. 11. n. 44. 2 H. 6. n. 15, 16. 31 H. 6. n. 31.</note> more ordinarily then in the former; for the Parliament was no leſſe jealous of the power of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, then of the infirmities of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; nor more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in the aimes of any of them all, then themſelves were in their own title to the Crown.</p>
               <p>Neither was this ſufficient, for the Parliament looked upon themſelves as a body that ſomtimes muſt retire to reſt,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52042:85"/>
and upon the privy Councel, as watch-men ſubject to change, and therefore they not onely give them inſtructions,<note place="margin">8.

Their inſtructions were ſomtimes occaſionall but ſome more generall, of which I ſhall inſtance onely in two, which were to be of everlaſting regard. Firſt, that they ſhould hold no Pleas before them, that is to ſay, at the Councell table, or at the privy Councell, nor before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, unleſſe as Judges in the Chancery Exchequer, or Benches at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8.

Unity gives life to action, carrying therewith both Authority and Power; and when all is done, muſt derive its originall from without, and in all good ends from above. And therefore as a ſeale to all the reſt it was wiſely done by the Parliament to draw the minds of the Privy Councell together, and to preſent them joyntly before God,<note place="margin">11. H 4. n. 14.39.</note> by an oath oblieging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a ſolemn and conſtant obſervance of their inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to perſevere therein; for the unchangeable God can onely ſtamp a laſting Image upon the minde, and bind the ſame (that is ſo ſubject to change) to an unchangeable Law; whereby the People may be made as happy for continuance as for Righteouſneſſe and Peace.</p>
               <p>The privy Councell thus ſettled, dreſſed, and girt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of high eſteeme, both for truſt and honorable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in great matters. The Mint is the very Liver of the Nation, and was wont to be the cheife care of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe in all the dimenſions thereof; now the Mint is two wayes conſidered, <hi>Viz</hi>: either in the vallue of the Mettall and Mony, or in the coynage.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe &amp; things moſt immediatly concurring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, the Parliament ſtill retaines to its owne immediate Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey; ſuch as are the inhibiting of exportation of Gold, and Silver; and of melting of Coyne into Plate or Bullion; the regulating of the currant of Forraine Coyne, the reducing of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52042:85"/>
Money, both Eorrain and Domeſtick, imbaſed by Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, clipping, waſhing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The regulating of allay of Gold and Silver; the regulating exchange, and ſuch like; concerning all which, the Reader may pleaſe to peruſe the Statutes, 2 H. 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 5, 6, 11, 13. 4 H. 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. 3 H. 5. <hi>Stat.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. And 2 H. 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Conſideration touching the Mint,<note place="margin">1 H. 6. cap. 1. 9 H. 5. cap. 6.</note> concerned the election, and government of the Officers, touching the Mint and Exchange, or the places where they ſhal be holden, which with ſome other matters of inferiour Nature, were left to the Order of the Privy Councell, either with the King, or alone, in Caſe of the Kings abſence or diſability.</p>
               <p>A ſecond power given to the Privy Councell, was in point of Trade, and Merchandize: formerly they had ſomewhat to doe therein, but ſtill the Parliament ſet out their bounds in <hi>Richard</hi> the Seconds time, the people had liberty of trade in ſome Commodities, by way of Exportation,<note place="margin">17 R. 2. c. 7.</note> but the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Councell might reſtrain them upon inconvenience to the Publique: Now the ſame is confirmed,<note place="margin">4 H. 6. cap. 5.</note> and though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Corne onely, yet it was a Preſident that led the way to a much larger power in the Trade of the Staple Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of this Iland, to inlarge or ſtraiten it as they thought meet; and ſo they became in a fair way to have a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall power over the Revenues and Riches of this Nation. But this laſted not long, for within ten yeares, theſe Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Tranſportation coſt the Merchant ſo much,<note place="margin">15 H. 6. cap. 2. 20 H. 6. c. 6.</note> as he could make little gaines of all his care and paines, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a rule is ſet to a generall allowance of all Tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Corn, till the price of Wheat came to a Noble, and Barly at three ſhillings, and no longer. This being firſt made Temporary, was afterwards made perpetuall,<note place="margin">23 H. 6. cap. 5.</note> and ſo gave a reſtraint unto the power of the King and Councell. But where no Poſitive reſtraint was made by any Statute, the King and Councell ſeemed to have the ſole power left unto them, to open and ſhut the paſſes of Trade as they pleaſed: For whereas the Commodity of Butter, and Cheeſe, was made Staple, the King and Councell had
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52042:86"/>
power to ſtop the ſale thereof; notwithſtanding, that the Law gave full liberty to the Subjects to bring all their Staple Commodities to the Staple:<note place="margin">18 H. 6. cap. 3.</note> Nevertheleſſe, this power in the King is not Primitive, but derived from the Parliament, for they had power over the Kings Licences, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints in ſuch Caſes, as by the ſeverall Statutes doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p>A third power given to the Privy Councell, was a power of Summons and Proceſſe againſt Delinquents, in Caſes of Riots, Extortions, Oppreſſions, and greivous Offences; the Summons to be by Privy Seale, the Proceſs, Proclamations, and for Non-appearance,<note place="margin">31 Hen. 6. cap. 2.</note> Forfeiture, if the Delinquent be of the Degree of a Lord, if of inferiour ranke, then a Fine or Outlary. At the firſt view the Statute hath an ill-favoured aſpect, as if it raiſed up a new Court of Judicature, but the time is to be conſidered with the occaſion; for it was made for the ſecuring of the Peace, in a turbulent time. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Law carrieth along with it two Reſtrictions, which puts the right of Cogniſance in the Privy Councell to the queſtion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it ſaveth the Juriſdiction of other Courts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth further, <hi>That no matter determinable by the Law of this Realme, ſhall be by this Act determined in other forme, then after the courſe of the ſame Law in the Kings Court, having determination of the ſame</hi>; which implieth, that ſome kindes of Riots, and Extortions are of ſo high a nature, that though determinable in the Kings Court, yet are they to be determined before the Lords.</p>
               <p>In the next place, this Law provideth that ſuch offences, as are determinable by the Law of the Realme, that is by Jury, ſhall ſtill be ſo tried.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">13 Hen. 4. cap. 7.</note>Secondly, if Conviction be upon Confeſſion, or by Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate, in caſe where (by reaſon of Parties, and partakings) Inquiſition by Jury can not be had, there the Lords ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately determine the ſame.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if the Certificate be traverſed, then the ſame ſhall be tried in the Kings Bench.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:52042:86"/>But there is another Reſtriction that undoeth all, in effect, in point of right, becauſe what this Law ſetleth therein, it ſetleth but for ſeven yeares, and leaveth the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to the limits of the Common Law for the future: In the mean time, the Privy Councell may be thought terrible, and very high, both by this Law, and the greatneſſe of the Lords. Kings Unkles, and Kings Brothers, are Subjects indeed, but of ſo high a Degree, that if a little goodneſſe of Nature, or publique Spirit ſhine in them, they ſoon become the Objects of Admiration from the Vulgar, and gain more from them, by their vicinity, then the King can doe at a diſtance. For the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> by the fair demeanour of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar great men, are ſoon won out of their very cloathes, and are never more in danger to part with their liberties, then when the Heaven is faire above their heads, and the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſerve the King, and flatter them. Nevertheleſſe, as I ſaid, the ſeaſon muſt alſo be conſidered of this power, thus by this Law contracted; for what the Lords gained not by their Popularity, the Queen did with her power; who now mindfull of her contemned beauty, and oppoſition from the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> againſt her marriage, removes him out of the way, gets the reines of Government into her hand, and like a Woman drives on in full careere.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and other Lords, not liking this gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, indeavour to ſtop her pace, but are all overborn, the Duke taken priſoner, and doubtleſſe had pledged the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> but that the Heire apparent of the Houſe of <hi>Yorke</hi> ſteps in to reſcue; and new troubles ariſe in <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> to put an end to which, the Queenes party gaines, and takes the Duke of <hi>Yorkes</hi> word for his good behaviour, gets this Law to paſſe, expecting hereby, if not a full ſettlement at Home, yet at leaſt a reſpite to prevent dangers from abroad, during the preſent exigency. And thus upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Lords and Privy Councell are mounted up by the Commons to their own miſcheif.</p>

               <p>IT was no new thing in the World, for Princes of a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Title, to goe to the Church-men for a plaiſter, and they are ready enough to ſing a <hi>Requiem,</hi> ſo as they may be the gainers: The Princes therefore of the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> had offended againſt common ſenſe, if they had not done the like themſelves, being not onely guilty in their Title, but alſo by a ſecret Providence, drawn into one intereſt together with the Church-men to ſupport each other. For <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and Arch-biſhop <hi>Arundell,</hi> meeting together under one condition of Baniſhment, become Conſorts in ſufferings, and Conſorts in Honour; for Society begotten in trouble, is nouriſhed in Proſperity, by remembrance of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall kindneſſes in a neceſſitous Eſtate, which commonly are the more hearty, and more ſenſible, by how much other Contentments are more ſcant. But the Arch-biſhop had yet a further advantage upon the heart of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, though he was no man of power, yet he was of great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; exceedingly beloved of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy, and the more for his Baniſhment ſake: Now whatſoever he is, or hath, is the Kings, and the King is his; the ſweet influence of the Arch-Biſhop, and the Clergy, enters into his very Soule; they are his dearly beloved, for the great Naturall Love (as he ſayes to the World) they beare to him; what he could, he got, what he got, he gave to the Church: Thus the Family of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> becomming a mighty ſupport unto the Clergy, <hi>Romane</hi> as it was; they alſo became as ſtout main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of the crackt Title of that younger Houſe: So was fulfilled the old Prophecy of the Oyle given to <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> wherewith <hi>Henry the Fourth was anointed, That Kings anointed with that Oyle, ſhould be the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52042:87"/>
Champions of the Church.</hi> Now for the more particular clearing of this, we are to conſider the Church abſolutely, or in relation to the Politicall Government of the People. Concerning the later, many things did befall, that were of a different peice to the reſt, in regard that the Lords, for the moſt part, were for the Clergy, and they for themſelves; but the Commons began to be ſo well ſavoured with <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>fs</hi> way, that they begin to bid defiance to the Clergies ſelf-ends, and aimes: and becauſe they could not reach their heads, they drive home blowes at their legs.</p>
               <p>A Parliament is called, and becauſe the King had heard ſomewhat, feared that the People were more learned then was meete for his purpoſe, and that the Parliament ſhould be too wiſe; he therefore will have a Parliament, wherein the People ſhould have no more Religion, then to beleive; nor Learning, then to underſtand his ſenſe, nor wiſedome then to take heed of a Negative Vote: But it befell otherwiſe, for though it was called the Lack-learning Parliament, yet had it well enough to diſcern the Clergies inſide, and Reſolution enough to enter a ſecond claime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Clergies Temporalties, and taught the King a Leſſon, <hi>That the leaſt underſtanding Parliaments, are not the beſt for his purpoſe</hi>: For though the wiſeſt Parliaments have the ſtrongeſt ſight, and can ſee further then the King would have them, yet they have alſo ſo much wiſedome, as to look to their own skins, and commonly are not ſo venterous, as to tell all the World what they know, or to act too much of that which they doe underſtand. But this Parliament, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſe, or unwiſe, ſpake loud of the Clergies ſuperfluous Riches, and the Kings wants are parallel'd therewith, and that the Church-men may well ſpare enough to maintaine fifteen Earles, fifteen hundred Knights, ſix thouſand two hundred Eſquires, and one hundred Hoſpitalls more then were in his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>This was a ſtrong temptation to a needy and couragious Prince, but the Arch-Biſhop was at his elbow; the King tells the Commons, that the <hi>Norman</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Cells were in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52042:88"/>
his Predeceſſors time ſeized under this colour, yet the Crowne was not the richer thereby; he therefore reſolves rather to add to, then diminiſh any thing from, the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>Thus, as the King ſaid, he did, though he made bold with the Keyes of Saint <hi>Peter</hi>; for he could diſtinguiſh between his owne Clergy, and the <hi>Romane.</hi> The People are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with put to ſilence, yet harbour ſad conceits of the Clergy againſt a future time, which like a hidden fire, are not onely preſerved, but increaſed by continuall occaſions, and more principally from the zeal of the Clergy, now growing fiery hot againſt the Lollards. For that not onely the People, but the Nobles, yea, ſome of the Royall blood, were not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether eſtranged from this new old way; whether it was ſucked from their Grand-Father Duke <hi>John,</hi> or from a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular ſtrain, of which that Houſe of <hi>Lancaster</hi> had much experience, I determine not. Theſe were the Dukes of <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter; Bedford</hi> was firſt at the Helme of Affaires at home, whiles the King acted the Souldiers part in <hi>France,</hi> as ill conceited of by the Clergy, as they ſleighted by him. At a Convocation once aſſembled againſt the Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards, the Duke ſent unto their Aſſembly his Dwarfe, as a great Lollard, though he was a little Man, and he returned as he went,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antiq.</hi> 278.</note> even as Catholique, as any of them all; <hi>Non tam diſpectus à Clero, quam ipſe Clerum deſpiciens atque eludens.</hi> This, and ſome other ſleights the Clergy liked not, they therefore finde a way to ſend him into <hi>France,</hi> to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to his Brother: And in his roome ſteps forth <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> that was no leſſe coole for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> way then he. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth was not more hearty in <hi>Romes</hi> behalf, for although he was loath to interrupt his Conqueſt abroad, with conteſts at home, yet he liked not of advancements from <hi>Rome</hi>; inſomuch, as perceiving the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> to aſpire to a Cardinals Hat, he ſaid, that he would as well lay aſide his own Crowne, as allow the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to take the Hat. Nor was he much truſted by the Clergy, who were willing he ſhould rather ingage in the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52042:88"/>
Wars with <hi>France,</hi> then minde the Propoſalls of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, concerning the Clergies Temporalties, which alſo was renued in the Parliament in his dayes. Above all, as the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Houſe loved to looke to its own, ſo eſpecially in relation to <hi>Rome,</hi> they were the more jealous, by how much it pretended upon them, for its favour done to their Houſe: And therefore <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, the moſt obleiged of all the reſt, looked to the Proviſors more ſtrictly then his Predeceſſors had; and not only confirmed all the Statutes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame already made,<note place="margin">9 H. 4. cap. 8.</note> but had alſo provided againſt Proviſors of any annuall Office, or Profit, or of Bulls, of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from payment of Tythes, or from Obedience,<note place="margin">2 H. 4. c. 3, 4. 7 H. 4. cap. 7, 8 4 H. 5. cap. 4.</note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular or Ordinary, and made them all puniſhable within the Statute; and further, made all Licenſes, and Pardons, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereto (granted by the King) void againſt the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, and gave damages to the Incumbent in ſuch vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for the former Lawes had ſaved the right to the true Patron, both againſt Pope, and King.</p>
               <p>And thus the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings were Servants to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at the charges of <hi>Rome,</hi> whiles the Popedome being now under a waſting and devouring Sciſme, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to help it ſelfe, and ſo continued untill the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; at which time, the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> got it ſelfe under the power and ſhadow of a Protector, a kinde of Creature, made up by a Pope and a King. This was the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> ſo great a Man, both for Birth, parts of Nature, Riches, Spirit, and Place, as none before him ever the like; for he was both Cardinall, Legate, and Chancellour of <hi>England</hi>; and had gotten to his aide, the Biſhop of <hi>Bathe,</hi> to be Lord Treaſurer of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: Now comes the matter concerning Proviſors once more to be revived.</p>
               <p>Firſt, more craftily by collogueing with the Nobility, who now had the ſway in the Kings minority, but they would none: An anſwer is given by the King, that he was too young to make alteration in matters of ſo high Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet he promiſed moderation. The Clergy are put to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52042:89"/>
ſilence herewith, and ſo continue till the King was ſix yeares elder, and then with Money in one hand, and a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition in the other, they renue their Suit, but in a more ſubtill way: For they would not pretend <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e,</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches liberties; they would not move againſt the Statutes of <hi>Praemuniri,</hi> but to have them explained; it was not much they complained of, for it was but that one word,<note place="margin">16 Rich. 2. cap. 5. <hi>Antiq. Brit.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Otherwhere,</hi> which, ſay they, the Judges of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law expound too largely, not onely againſt the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Holy Sea, but againſt the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelacy, which they never intended in the paſſing of thoſe Lawes: Their Concluſion is therefore a Prayer, <hi>That the King will pleaſe to allow the Jurisdiction of their Eccleſiaſticall Courts, and that Prohibitions in ſuch Caſes, may be ſtopped.</hi> But the King, either perceiving that the Authority of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelacy, was wholly dependent on the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and acted either under the ſhadow Legatine, or at the beſt, ſought an Independent power of their own: Or elſe the King doubting that the calling of one word of that Statute into queſtion, that had continued ſo long, might indanger the whole Law into uncertainty, declined the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaving in the moderation of Prohibitions. Thus the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy are put to a retreat, from their reſerve at <hi>Rome</hi>; all which they now well ſaw, yet it was hard to wean them: The Cardinall of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> was a great Man, and loath to lay down his power; but his own Tribe grew weary of him, and his Power: For the greater ſome Church-men are, unleſſe they be better then men, the inferiour, and better Church-men, are worſe then men; at length therefore the Cardinall is Un-Legated, and that Power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a Man former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well approved, but by this very influence from <hi>Rome,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſuſpected; which he perceiving, proteſted againſt the Exerciſe of the Juriſdiction Legatine, without the Kings allowance, and ſo mannerly crept into the Chaire.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings and Clergy, having thus attained the right diſcerning of each other, begin to take up a new way
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52042:89"/>
of Policy; which was to hold nothing of the Popedome, but the forme of Worſhip, and Diſcipline; but as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juriſdiction, they held it a high point of wiſedome, either to fetch it nigh at home, or to be ſilent in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; having now found a main difference between the Popes Will, and the Church Law; and therefore, as formerly,<note place="margin">Holl.</note> the Convocation and Parliament joyned in excluding of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers from Church-livings, under the Notion of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencers to Enemies abroade: So neither now will they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any Proviſions for <hi>Engliſh</hi> men; and upon this ground the Deane and Chapter of <hi>Yorke</hi> refuſed to admit the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> to the Sea of <hi>Yorke,</hi> although deſigned he was thereto by Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> and he the Darling of Nations, being by joynt conſent advanced to the Triple Crowne, that had been formerly tripled amongſt three Popes, and troubled all Europe: And whereas during the Tripapalty, much money had been Levied here in <hi>England,</hi> to ſerve for the recovery of the Popedome, to one of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Intereſt: Now by joynt conſent, the ſame is ſeized upon and ſtopped, as fewell from the fire, and ſpent by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, in the recovery of a Kingdome in <hi>France,</hi> that ſhould have beene imployed in recovery of a Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at <hi>Rome:</hi> theſe things concurred to give a wound to the Popedome, that was never cured to this day.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy was no looſer by all this, but gained in the whole ſumme: for as it made them more depending on the Crowne, ſo it made the Crowne more faſt to them, from which they had received more reall immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and power, then the Pope ever did, or was able to give them, and might expect to receive many more. What Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall reſpects theſe three Kings ſhewed them, hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready touched: <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth added one favour, which made all the reſt more conſiderable: hitherto they had uſed to meete in Convocation, as upon the intereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> and little notice was taken of them; now the Nation owns them, and in ſome reſpects their worke, and it is granted, That the Clerkes of Convocation called by the Kings Writ, and their

That they were many times not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding called together by the Kings Writ before theſe times,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Will: Prynne.</note> hath been alſo cleared by another Penn. That their worke at ſuch times was to adviſe concerning ſuch matters as ſhould be propounded to them by the King in Parliament, their ſummons do ſhew; the particulars whereof, for the moſt part, concerned ſupplies of Mony from the Churchmen, and yet ſomtimes matters of great moment were debated therein: as in a Convocation ſummoned by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth in his ninth year, the pre-eminence of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> above the Councill of <hi>Bazill</hi> was debated, and as much as they could, determined the ſame: the credit of their deciſions in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, I beleeve, was not much amongſt the People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the men were looked upon with an evil eye: Now that the Parliament ſeemeth to owne them in thier way, and to protect them; their determinations are ſomewhat: The Churchmen eſpy their opportunity, and whiles the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent influence of the State is in its firſt heat, they improve it in this manner. The times were now come about wherein light began to ſpring forth, conſcience to beſtirr it ſelfe, and men to ſtudy the Scriptures; This was imputed to the idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

and carleſneſſe of the Clergy, who ſuffered the mindes of young Schollers to luxuriate into errors of Divinity, for want of putting them on to other Learning, and gave no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to ſtudyes of human Literature, by preferring thoſe that were deſerving. The Convocation taking this into conſideration, do decree,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit.</note> that no perſon ſhould excerciſe any juriſdiction in any Office, as Vicar-generall, Commiſſary, or Officiall, or otherwiſe, unleſſe he ſhall have firſt in the Univerſity taken degrees in the civill or canon Law: A ſhrewd trick this was to ſtop the growth of the ſtudy of Divinity, and <hi>Wickleifs</hi> way: and to imbelliſh mens mindes with a kind of Learning that may gaine them preferment, or at leaſt an opinion of abilityes beyond the common ſtraine, and dangerous to be medled with, like ſome Gallants that weare Swords as badges of Honour, and to bid men beware, becauſe they poſſibly may ſtrike, though in their own perſons they may be very Cowards; and no leſs miſchei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly intended was this againſt the rugged common Law, a rule ſo nigh allyed to the Goſpel way, as it favoreth liberty, and ſo far eſtranged from the way of the civill and canon Law, as there is no hope of accommodation till Chriſt and Antichriſt have fought the feild.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in relation to the State, now as it is abſolutely conſidered in regard of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall degrees of Perſons therein. Although theſe three Kings were much indeered to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy; yet the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Laity and them growing high, the Kings principall care is now, to keep an even hand between them both, for he that will back two Horſes at once, muſt keep them even, or put his joints to the adventure: Firſt, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth granteth, that no more ſhall be payed to <hi>Rome</hi> for the firſt fruits of Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops,<note place="margin">6 H. 4. cap. 1.</note> then hath been anciently uſed. The occaſion hereof was to prevent the horrible miſcheif and damnable cuſtome of <hi>Rome</hi>; for ſuch are the very words of that Statute, unto which the Clergy gave their Vote, if not the firſt vote; and therefore certainly did neither beleeve, nor honor that infallible Chaire as their
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52042:91"/>
owne Mother; nor did they beare her yoake further then their owne benefit, and reaſon of State did require, for though the immediate benefit of this Law did deſcend upon the Prelacy; yet it alſo much concerned the intereſt, both of the honor and benefit of the Nation, that the Clergy ſhould not be at the Popes pleaſure to tax and aſſeſſe as he thought good.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 H. 5. cap. 1.</note>Secondly, <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth added unto the Prelacy ſome kinde of increaſe, both of Honour, and Power, <hi>Viz.</hi> To viſit Hoſpitalls that were not of the Kings owne foundation, and to reforme abuſes there; for the Patrons ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had no Power to puniſh, or will or care to reform them; and thus upon the point, although they loſt a right, yet they gained eaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3 H. 5. cap. 8.</note>Thirdly, the ſame King confirmed by a Statute unto Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, the Cogniſance of accompts of Executors, for their Teſtators Eſtates, which formerly was granted by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, but they wanted power to execute, and a right to have and receive: In all theſe the Clergy or Prelacy were the immediate gainers. In as many other things the People were made gainers, and yet the Clergy were no looſers, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then (like the Kite) that prey which was none of their owne.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they refuſed formerly to grant copies of Libells, either thereby to hinder the courſe of Prohibitions, or to make the copies the more dear, and Mony more Cheap with them. <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth finding this a greivance to the People, paſſeth a Law, that all Ordinaries ſhall grant the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of Libells at ſuch time as by Law they are grantable.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2 H. 5. Stat. 2. cap. 1.</note>Secondly, as the Probate of Wills had anciently belonged to the Ordinary, by the Canon Law, and formerly alſo confirmed to them by the Parliament, ſo it alſo regulated and ſetled the Fees for ſuch Service: But the Clergy having been ever under the nouriture of their Mother <hi>Rome,</hi> that loved to exceed, they likewiſe accounted it their liberty to take what they could get, but the nigher they come to ingage with Kings in their government according to Law,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52042:91"/>
the more reformed they grow: Formerly <hi>Edward</hi> the third had ſetled their Fees, but they would not hold to the rule, now the Law is redoubled by <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, with a penalty of treble dammages againſt delinquents.<note place="margin">3 H. 5. Stat. 2. cap. 8.</note> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the very Preiſts could not containe, their <hi>Paterno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Requiems, Maſſes,</hi> and ſuch wares, they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed, and ſet thereof what price they pleaſed: The Market was riſen to that height, that <hi>Edward</hi> the third undertooke to ſet a rate upon thoſe commodities, but that alſo would not hold long; <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth he ſets a certaine Stipend ſomewhat more then <hi>Edward</hi> the third had done,<note place="margin">2 H. 5. Stat. 2 cap. 2.</note> and yet leſſe then the Preiſts had formerly.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſome Lawes were made, wherein the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth gained, and the Church were looſers. Firſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Church-men formerly held all holy things proper and peculiar to their owne Cogniſance, eſpecially ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the worſhip of God, the Parliament now began to be bold with that, and never asked leave. It had now for a long time, even ſince the Saxon times, been the unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Church of <hi>England,</hi> amongſt others, to decay continually in Piety and right devotion, but through the light that now revived, and Gods goodneſſe, it in theſe times came to paſſe, that the People did entertain ſome ſenſe of their duty towards God, more then formerly, and begin to quarrell the abuſes done to the Lords day, in the manner of the keeping thereof: <hi>London</hi> hath the honor for begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this reformation by an Act of their Common Councell. The Parliament within ſeven yeares after that,<note place="margin">27 H. 6. cap. 5.</note> ingage the whole Kingdome in that ſervice (though therewith alſo are adjoyned other holy Feaſts then holden) And all Faires and Markets are injoyned to ceaſe on that day, under paine of forfeiture of Goods expoſed to ſale, excepting Victuall, and excepting the foure Sundayes in Harveſt. And thus though places had their conſecration allowed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and immunity from trading in Faires, and Markets, by the ſpace of 160. yeares before this time, yet that time which God by his owne Law had reſerved to his owne ſelfe,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52042:92"/>
never came under regard to be allowed till now, and yet not by the motion of the Clergy, nor by their furtherance; for by their thruſting in the holy dayes, they made them equal with the Lords day, and in Harveſt time ſuperiour, by preſerving them in force, when as the Lords dayes were ſet aſide: So God had ſomewhat of theſe men, but the Pope more. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as the Church-men loſt in the former, ſo the Prelacy in this that follows.</p>
               <p>The Prelates had long ſince obtained the triall of Baſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and therein could ſtraine themſelves ſo far, as to put the Caſe of inheritance into danger, where the point other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was cleare enough; and this grew to that height that it indangered the diſinheriting of the heires of the Earle of <hi>Kent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">9 H. 6. cap. 11.</note> It is therefore now provided, that before the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in ſuch Caſes Proceed to triall, Proclamations ſhall be made in Chancery, to ſummon all pretenders of Intereſts or Titles to come before the Ordinary, to make their Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all trials of Baſtardy otherwiſe made ſhall be voide; ſo as whatever the Canon did, the Parliament would not truſt to the Ordinaries Summons, nor allow of their power in any other manner, then the Parliament thought meet. One thing more remaineth, wherin the true Church of Chriſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to loſe and yet gained; and the Clergy joyning with the King ſeemed to gain and yet loſt; this was the point of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which had long ſtumbled the mindes of the People, and was now growne to that ſtrength, that nothing but an Act of Parliament can keep it under. This opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſhip, was at the firſt ſo young, that it was not yet baptized with any proper name, but called, Opinion contrary to the Church determinations, or Catholique faith. And againſt this the Clergy now ſtormed, more then ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, becauſe it was grown to ſuch a height as if it meaned to over-top theirs. To this end they procure an Act to paſſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 H. 4. cap. 15.</note>
                  <hi>That all Preachers, Teachers, Writers, Schoolemaſters, Favorers; or notoriouſly defamed Perſons, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſuch opinions, ſhall be (upon conviction before the

                  <hi>If upon Conviction, he ſhall not abjure, or ſhall relapſe, he ſhall be delivered unto the Seculer Power, and be burned.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>And that Preachers without Licence of the Dioceſſan, ſhould be reſtrained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning which Law, I ſhall firſt ſhew what change in the Lawes of this Kingdome was endeavoured, and what was really effected.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is an undeniable ground,<note place="margin">42 E. 3. cap. 3.</note> that no Free-man can be put to anſwer before any Judge, but upon Preſentment, or other matter of Record foregoing, and by due Proceſſe of Law; and yet it hath been ruled, that ſtrong preſumption, and complaint of credit after it is entered,<note place="margin">10 H. 7. fol. 17.</note> is ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, to ground proceedings in this Caſe; to attache the Party to anſwer. But by this Law a Triall is introduced, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſteth upon any peremptory accuſation, or proofe of witneſſe, but meerly upon Inquiſition, upon the Oath and Conſcience of the Party ſuſpected; which in the later dayes hath been called the triall upon the Oath, <hi>Ex Officio</hi>; for ſuch was the triall allowed by the Canon in theſe times;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Otho</hi> de Jur. Jur. Calumn.</note> as appeares in the Conſtitutions of <hi>Otho,</hi> and the Decrees of the Arch-Biſhop <hi>Boniface,</hi> by whom it was indeavoured to be obtruded upon the Laity, about the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, or <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt; but even the Clergy then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, as <hi>Lindwood</hi> confeſſeth.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lind.</hi> de Jure Juran. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> And <hi>Otho</hi> in his very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, doth hold this forth by that Clauſe of his, <hi>Nonob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante obtenta conſuetudine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this Law doth indeavour to introduce a new Judge, with a power to Fine and Impriſon according to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and a Priſon allowed to him as his own peculier, and yet the Writ <hi>De cautione admittenda,</hi> ſtill held its power, to regulate that diſcretion as formerly it had done; which by the way may render the power of this Law ſuſpitious.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Clergy are not content to have the Eſtates,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52042:93"/>
and Liberties of the bodies of the People at their diſcretion; but they muſt alſo have their lives, although no Free-mans life could by the Fundamentall Lawes of this Kingdome, come to queſtion, but by the judgement of his Peeres; nor could the Clergy by their owne Canons <hi>intereſſe ſanguine, Viz. They cannot put any man to death, but by this Law they may ſend any man to death by a Sentence, as ſure as death, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur poteſtati ſeculari:</hi> And ſuch a death, not as the Civill Magiſtrate is wont to execute by a ſpeedy parting of the Soul from the Body, by loſſe of blood, ſtop of breath, or ſuch like; but the Clergy muſt have blood, fleſh, bones, and life and all, even to the edge of nonentity it ſelf, or they are not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: And thus the Writ, <hi>De comburendo Haeretico,</hi> entered into the World. True it is, that ſome ſparks of this fire are found in former times, and <hi>Bracton</hi> toucheth upon ſuch a Law, in Caſe of a Clerk convict for Apoſtacy, <hi>Primo degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur, &amp; poſt per manum Laicalem Comburatur,</hi> which was indeed the Canon, and that by his own Confeſſion; for it is grounded upon one, <hi>Secundum quod accidit,</hi> in the Synod at <hi>Oxford,</hi> under Arch-Biſhop <hi>Becket</hi>: but that Caſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Clerk, who by his Profeſſion hath put himſelfe under the Law of the Canon, and it was onely in Caſe of Apoſtacy, himſelf being turned Jew; and this alſo done upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den pang of zeale and power of an Arch-Biſhop, that would know no Peere; nor doe we finde any ſecond to this Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the ſpace of two hundred yeares next enſuing; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Decree of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Peckham,</hi> who was not long after <hi>Becket,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lind.</hi> lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Apoſtat.</note> treating about Apoſtacy in Lay-men, mention any other puniſhment then that they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, <hi>Per cenſuras Eccleſiaſticas</hi>; nor yet that of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Arundell,</hi> amongſt the Conſtitutions at <hi>Oxford,</hi> not long before this Statute, who treating about the crime of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, he layes the Penalty upon the forfeiture of goods, with a <hi>Praeſertim,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lind.</hi> lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Heret. fol. <hi>159.</hi>
                  </note> as if it were the Grand puniſhment: And <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> in his gloſſe upon that place, ſetting down the Cenſures againſt Hereſie, <hi>Hodie ſunt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>damnandi ad mortem,</hi> as if it were otherwiſe but as yeſterday.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:52042:93"/>Fourthly, the next indeavour is to bring the Cognifance of all, wholly to the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Court,</hi> without further appeale; for ſo the words concerning Conviction of Hereſie are: <hi>Whereupon credence ſhall be given to the Dioceſſan of the ſame place, or his Ordinary in that behalfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe changes, I ſay, were indeavoured to be brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Government of this Kingdome; and yet the Law for all this, ſuffered no change, nor did the Houſe of Commons (however the name is thruſt into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ordinary Print) ever yeild unto the paſſing of the ſame, but in the Parliament next enſuing, complained thereof, and proteſted they would not be bound by ſuch Lawes, whereto the Houſe of Commons had not given their conſent; and this daſhed the Law quite out of countenance (although it holds the place ſtill amongſt the number) for within foure yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">8 H. 4.</note> the Clergy bring in another Bill of the ſame nature in generall, though varying in ſome particulars, but the ſame was again rejected.</p>
               <p>All the ſtrength therefore of this Law, reſteth upon the King, and Houſe of Lords, ingaged by the Clergy, to whom they truſted for their Religion (for Book-learning was with them of ſmall account) and no leſſe by the King, who knew no better way to give them content, that gave him ſo much as to ſet the Crowne upon his head; nor to diſcharge his Royall word, paſſed by the Earles of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. <hi>273.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> in his behalf unto the Convocation, <hi>Viz. That they were ſent to declare the Kings good will to the Clergy, and Church Liberties, and that he was reſolved to defend all the Liberties of the Church by his Kingly Power, and to puniſh Hereticks, and the Churches Enemies, in ſuch manner as the Clergy ſhould thinke meete; and therefore deſired their dayly Prayers, for his owne, and the Kingdomes ſafety.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Walſingham, <hi>Ypo. Neuſtr.</hi> 157.</note> And yet for all this, the People were not of this minde; no ſmall part of the Kingdome being overſpread with theſe Opinions.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, comes <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, and he alſo makes another aſſay; the former opinions then knowne onely by the generall name of Hereſie, are now baptized,

                  <hi>by the new name of Lollardry,</hi> and grown ſo overſpreading, that all the troubles of theſe times are ſtill imputed to them. It was indeed the Devills old and common trick, thus to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage earthly powers againſt theſe men, although he be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by but an inſtrument in the hand of the Cheif Builder, that in laying a ſure foundation, doth as well ramme downe, as raiſe up; for the malice of theſe men made the People of God to multiply: <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, alſo publiſhed a Law to this ſame:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 H. 5. cap. 7.</note>
                  <hi>That all Perſons in place of Government, ſhall ſweare to uſe their diligence, to deſtroy all Hereſies, and Errors, called</hi> Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lardries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That all</hi> Lollards <hi>convict by the Clergy, (left to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler power, according to the Lawes of Holy Church) ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their Lands, and Tenements to their Lords: And the King to have the yeare, and day, and waſte, and all his Goods and Chattels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Lord be the Ordinary, the King ſhall have all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No forfeiture to be, till the Delinquent be dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall be found by Indictment, before the Juſtices of the Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Indictment being found, ſhall be ſent to the Ordinary with the Priſoner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Indictment ſhall not be for Evidence, but onely for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the Principall things contained in this Law, which by the manner of the Compoſure, ſeemeth to be of an uncertain colour, neither made by the Clergy, nor Laity, but ſpoyled between them both. The intent thereof ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be principally to draw on the Houſe of Commons to paſſe the Law, under hope of gain by the forfeitures; for the penalty is like that of Fellony, though the Crime be not expreſly declared to be Fellony. But the intent fell ſhort in event.</p>
               <p>For firſt, the nature of the Crime is not defined, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by any Law, and therefore can no man by Indictment be found to be ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:52042:94"/>Secondly, no penalty of death, hath been by any former, or by this Law determined upon ſuch as are guilty, for its not enacted by any Law, that ſuch Perſon ſhall be delivered to the Seculer power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this Statute determining the forfeiture to be not till death, and neither that, nor any other Law of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome determining death; then is no forfeiture deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, though this Law taketh it for granted, That He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and Errors belong to Eccleſiaſticall Cogniſance, yet the ſame allowes of no further proceedings, then Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Cenſures.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, by this Law, there can be no proceeding, but in caſe of Indictment, (for otherwiſe, without Record, no forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be) therefore, where no Indictment is, there is no forfeiture. In all which regards, its evident that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy could by this Law, neither get fat nor blood;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fox Marturel.</hi> 589.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at their Convocation in the next yeare following, they tooke another courſe, and ordered that three in every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſhould make preſentment upon Oath, of ſuch Perſons as are defamed for Hereticks, and the truth ſo farre as they can learn; which puts me in minde of a Preſentment, that I have ſeene by ſome of Saint <hi>Mary-Overies</hi> in theſe times: <hi>Item, we ſaine, that</hi> John Stevens <hi>is a man we cannot tell what to make of him, and that he hath Bookes, we know not what they are</hi>: This new courſe ſhewes plainly, that the former held not force as they intended it. So God blaſted the practiſes of the Clergy at this time alſo, rendering this Law immateriall that had the form, as the other miſſed in the form, and had the matter.</p>

               <p>Secondly, it gained alſo upon the Admiralty, which by former Lawes had Juriſdiction in all Caſes incident upon the great Sea; but now either through neglect of the Admirall, or the evill of the times, occaſioning Piracies to grow Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall, the ill government upon the Sea became dangerous to the State, trenching upon the Truce made between this and other Nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 H 5. cap. 6.</note>For a remedy whereof, firſt Conſervators of the Truce were ſettled in every Port, who had power committed to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52042:95"/>
them to puniſh Delinquents againſt the Publick Truce, both by Indictment at the Kings ſuite, and according to the courſe of the Admiralty by complaint, ſaving matters of death to the Cogniſance of the Admirall. But this was ſoon found defective, for Juſtice done in the dark, is many times more reſpective, and leſſe reſpected, and therefore within a few yeares, it is provided, that Offenders againſt the Kings Truce upon the Sea, or in any of the Ports,<note place="margin">29 H. 6. c. 2.</note> ſhall be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt in the Chancery, before the Chancellour, who hath power given him, calling to his Aſſiſtance ſome of the Judges to execute the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. foregoing, by a handſome contrivance:<note place="margin">14 H. 6. cap. 8. 20 H. 6. cap. 11.</note> For that Statute was once and again ſuſpended for the rigour that was uſed by the former Conſervators, who being Borderers upon the Sea, for their own peace, ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as few as they could, which had ſo diſcouraged the Sea-men, that the Kingdome had been almoſt utterly bereaved of its ſtrength at Sea. Nevertheleſſe, all this while, theſe Lawes were but penall, and not remediall, for the Parties wronged: And therefore another Law is made,<note place="margin">31 H. 6. cap. 4.</note> to give the Chancellour and Judges power to make reſtitution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Chancery gained upon the Eccleſiaſticall Court; for whereas by the Canon, the Church-men were to be judged by their Superiours, according to Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Ordinary Juriſdiction; and the iniquity of the times, was again returned to that height, that Parents could not enjoy their own Children; but the little ones were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured, ſtolne away, and detained in Cloyſters; nor did the Church-men afford remedy in ſuch Caſes: A Law was made,<note place="margin">4 H. 4. cap. 17.</note> that upon complaint hereof made to the Chancellor, the Provinciall ſhould be by him ſent for, and puniſhed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Chancery incroached upon the Common Law: For whereas the ſtirs between the two Houſes of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> beganne to riſe, Men made their dwellings in places of ſecurity, and ſtrength; Women likewiſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons flying, thither for refuge; eſpecially, ſuch of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52042:96"/>
them as had moſt to loſe; theſe were contrary to the Law of common honeſty, urged to ingage their Eſtates unto the deſires of ſuch, to whom they had fled for refuge, and ſome times compelled to marry, before they could gain their liberty.<note place="margin">31 H. 6. cap. 9.</note> It was now provided, that all ſuch complaints ſhould be heard and determined by the Chancellor.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4 H. 4 cap. 8. 13 Hen. 4. cap. 7. 2 H. 5. cap. 9.</note>Secondly, as touching the Miniſteriall power of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, this likewiſe was inlarged in making of Proceſſe to compell appearance in caſes of forcible Entries, Murders, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughters, Robberies, Batteries, Aſſemblies, in nature of Inſurrections, Riots, and Plunder, committed by Servants upon their Maſters goods, before their Maſters death, and ſuch like Offences, now growne common, and in need of ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den remedy.</p>
               <p>Thus as the worke and power of the Chancery grew, ſo did the Place and Perſon of the Chancellor grow more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, raiſed now from being the Kings Secretary, (for no better was he in former times) to be the Kingdomes Judge, and of ſuch Truſt, that although the King might make election of his owne Secretary, yet the Parliament would firſt know, and allow him, that muſt be truſted with the power over the Eſtates of ſo many of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And therefore did in theſe times, both place, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place him as they ſaw expedient.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2 H. 4. cap. 11.</note>In a word, he is become the Kingdomes Darling, and might be more bold with the Common Law, then any of his Peeres.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. Of the Courts of Crowne Pleas, and Common Law.</head>
               <p>AS the Chancery on the one ſide did ſwell and increaſe, ſo was the Kings Bench in an Ebb; the Councill Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Star-Chamber on the one ſide, and the <hi>Itenerant</hi> Courts in the Countrey intercepted, and drew away much to their own ſhares: Making themſelves fat, the Kings Bench leane, and the Rurall Courts for Crown Pleas almoſt to ſtarve. The Crown Pleas formerly had been determinable in the Kings-Bench, Goale-Delivery, <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and many of them by Juſtices of the Peace, Coroners, and Sheriffe. The Goale-Delivery was afterwards united to the Judges of Aſſize, and if one of them were a Clergy man, then to the other, and cheif men of the County. This was uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Publique, but not beneficiall for ſome men; and therefore they laboured for Commiſſions, eſpecially dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to parties, that they thought would partake; but theſe were found ſoone to be dangerous, ſoone taken away,<note place="margin">2 E. 3. cap. 2.</note> and the Goale-Delivery reſtored to the Judges of Aſſize, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. The Commiſſions of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> were ſued forth upon extraordinary immergencies, and offences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the State was much concerned for ſpeedy Execution. In former times both theſe and Goale-Deliveries were but rarely had and then granted unto ſome, that perchance knew more of the Caſe, then before hand was meete to be known. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third amended this errour, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that no Commiſſions of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> ſhould iſſue forth, but unto Commiſſioners named by the Court,<note place="margin">34 E. 3. cap. 1.</note> and not by the party complaining. But the Judges of Aſſize are now in the growing hand, hoth for Honour, Uſe, and Power, the rather, becauſe their Perſons are of high repute in the Benches at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which are the Maſter-peices
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52042:97"/>
of Judicature, and their <hi>Iters</hi> are conſtant and ordinary: Nevertheleſſe, the Judges of Aſſize, though they have the Goale-Delivery annexed to them, yet have they not that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power of the Kings-Bench; but are ſtill under the rule of their Commiſſion, which is not alterable, but by Parliament, and which by it was altered, by way of adding of new powers, as new crimes aroſe, that required the eye of the State to provide, and ſo the Judges of Aſſize by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees grew to be the ordinary Adminiſtrators of Juſtice throughout the Kingdome, yet holding ſtill forth to them a limited power, to heare and determine in ſome Caſes; but in others onely,<note place="margin">11 H. 4. cap. 1.</note> to inquire and certifie, as in the Caſe of falſe returns by the Sheriffe, of perſons elected for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: And alſo in Caſes concerning the Statutes of Labourers,<note place="margin">2 H. 4. cap. 21. 13 H. 4. cap. 3.</note> and unlawfull games, and paſtimes; in which caſe the Certificate is to be made to the Chancellor: And alſo in Caſes concerning Liveries, contrary to the Statutes, wherein the Certificate is to be made to the Kings-Bench; which power in this laſt Caſe, continued in that manner by the ſpace of thirty yeares;<note place="margin">8 Hen. 6. c. 4. 4 Hen. 5. c. 7.</note> and then by another Statute, they had the power to determine ſuch caſes before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: In like manner they had power to heare and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine caſes of falſhood, in counterfeiting and corrupting of money, by waſhing, clipping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alſo defaults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Sheriffs,<note place="margin">8 Hen. 6. c. 9.</note> Bayliffs, and their Officers againſt the Statutes of forcible Entries, and of wearing of Liveries, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Theſe were ſignes of much confidence and truſt in them, and yet notwithſtanding, in theſe, nor none of theſe, were the Penalties by Fine left to the Arbitry of the Judges; no, nor to the Juſtices of the Kings-Bench, but were by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Letter of the Law determined.<note place="margin">13 Hen. 4. c. 2.</note> Nor would the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment truſt theſe men with doing Juſtice in the caſes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, in their own Counties where they dwelled, nor did it think expedient to allow the cheif Juſtice of the Kings Bench unto that Service in any of them all, but onely once in the County of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and then onely at the Kings pleaſure;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52042:97"/>
otherwiſe,<note place="margin">50 E. 3. n. 113 8 Rich. 2. cap. 2.</note> it was to be as was uſed by the ſpace of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered yeares foregoing; poſſibly becauſe his power was too great to be truſted amongſt the People.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Judges of <hi>Niſi prius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2. c. 30.</note> were anciently made by <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, by whom alſo the Aſſizes were ſetled at certain times of the yeare, and afterwards by the Statute at <hi>Yorke,</hi> the <hi>Niſi prius</hi> in ſmaller caſes was granted,<note place="margin">12 E. 2. cap. 3.</note> before one Juſtice of the Bench, where the Plea dependeth, and one ſubſtantiall man of the County; but thoſe of greater concernment were to be had before two Juſtices of that Bench, or in caſe they were wanting, then before Juſtices of the other Bench, or in default of them, before the cheif Baron, if he were a man of Law, and in default of that,<note place="margin">14 E. 3. c. 16.</note> before the Judges of Aſſize. Therefore in thoſe dayes, the Juſtices of the Benches in their <hi>Iters</hi> in the Counties, divided in their power; Some being for Aſſizes, others for <hi>Niſi prius</hi>; and in ſome times, and caſes, ſome were for both: For in thoſe times of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third,<note place="margin">4 E. 3. cap. 11.</note> Judges of Aſſize had power to inquire in ſome matters that concerned the Crowne, or to try <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> nor were theſe powers u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, till in <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixths time, Juſtices of <hi>Niſi prius</hi> had the power of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> annexed to them, in all caſes of Fellony, and Treaſon.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>HEnry</hi> the Fourth, after a ſmall reſt in his Throne, though he alwayes ſate looſe, ſought after the civill Peace, as the corner Stone of his ſubſiſtence; and that by a way of Juſtice, which found more acceptance with the Vulgar, then the common Education of the greater number in theſe times could promiſe; for the worſt of men cannot endure to ſuffer injuſtice, though themſelves will doe it. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where Kings are reputed to be the Fountain and Life of Juſtice, Sheriffs may be reputed to be the breath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and by their irregularities, doe render the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King, as loathſome, as unſavoury breath doth the Perſon whoſe it is: Therefore <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth choſe rather to be a looſer in his Farme-Rents of the Sheriffwicks, then to occaſion the Sheriffs to ſave their bargains by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion:<note place="margin">1 Hen. 4. c. 11.</note> And to this end he tooke away the courſe of forming of Sheriffwicks, and made the Sheriffs bare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countants for the Annuall profits;<note place="margin">4 Hen. 5. c. 2.</note> and as touching the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall profits, the Sheriffe diſcharged himſelfe upon Oath. This was a good ſecurity to the King, but yet the People was not herewith ſatisfied; For though the Sheriffs might not take to Farme, yet what they had, they might let to Farme; And then wherein are the People the better for theſe Lawes? Seeing its all one for them to be oppreſſed by the Sheriffe immediately, and by the Proxie.</p>
               <p>For preventing of this inconvenience, another Law is made;<note place="margin">4 H. 4. cap. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Sheriffe ſhall not let his Bailywicke to Farme, nor be Nonreſident, and to this he muſt binde himſelfe by Oathe</hi>: So as now the Sheriffe is double girt, and may be fairely ridden, without danger to the King or People. But men ride horſes for eaſe, and pleaſure, and he that muſt bend his minde alwayes to watch his horſes motion,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52042:98"/>
will chooſe rather to goe on foote; and therefore <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth renewed the Law of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">1 H. 5. cap. 4.</note> that Sheriffs ſhall be but for one yeare, and then not to be choſen again, nor ſerve for three yeares next following. This Order con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for the ſpace of eight yeares, within which time, Warre, and Peſtilence had conſumed ſo many of the richer ſort of People, that a Diſpenſation is granted,<note place="margin">9 H. 5. cap. 5.</note> that She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs may continue in their places for foure yeares. And it was above twenty yeares after, ere the Stocke was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruted againe; after which time, the ſubſtance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Statutes of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and 1. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth is revived againe,<note place="margin">23 H. 6. cap. 8.</note> with a penaltie upon the Sheriffe, his Deputy, or Clerke, that ſhall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that place above one yeare; ſo the cuſtome of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Office tenne or twelve yeares, by occaſion of the Diſpenſation for foure yeares was laid aſide: But the Cure would never be perfect, ſo long as Sheriffs held by Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: For it was eaſie to finde new Deputies, but not to lay downe old Cuſtomes, nor could it be laſting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the penalties alſo had beene annexed to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar crimes.</p>
               <p>For a Sheriffe before he is a yeare old, by experience formerly had, becomes too cunning for all theſe Lawes; and therefore Lawes are made alſo againſt the ordinary corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe places, ſuch as are extorting of Fees,<note place="margin">4 H. 6. cap. 1. 6. cap. 4. 15. c. 5. 18. c. 14. 23. cap. 10. 28 E. 3. c. <hi>ult.</hi>

               <p>THe faint title of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth to the Crowne, made him ever tender of the Civill Peace, without breach whereof, he was ſure to be quiet in the Throne; he undertooke not this worke by any ſuperlative power, from and by himſelfe, but uſeth the help of the Parliament, and Lawes, wherein he was induſtrious; pretending love of Unity amongſt his People, which nevertheleſſe he liked not, unleſſe in order to quiet between himſelfe and them. The former way of Juſtices of Peace he followed cloſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Perſons to their ancient qualifications.<note place="margin">1 H. 5. cap. 10.</note> The moſt ſufficient Perſons,<note place="margin">18 H. 6. c. 11.</note> Inhabitants in the County, worth at leaſt twenty pound yearly, unleſſe they be Lawyers, or ſuch as are Juſtices in Corporations;<note place="margin">2 H. 5.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52042:99"/>
ſo as it ſeemes, the Parliament was not very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious in their Houſe, what ever they were at Church. Further-more, the Juſtices of the Peace had power to puniſh deceit in Meaſures, Weights, forcible entries, and Detainers.<note place="margin">1 H. 5. cap. 10. 9 Stat. 2. ca. 8. 2 H. 6. cap. 11. 11 H. 6. cap. 8. 13 H. 4. cap. 7. &amp; 2. 4 H. 5. cap. 8.</note> In many of which Caſes, the Penalty being fine and imprſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, became a ſnare to many of the Juſtices, eſpecially ſuch as were of the greater and higher ranke, who having Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of their owne, under colour of juſtice, impriſoned Delinquents, in their owne Caſtles, and ranſomed them at their owne pleaſure; which proved a great oppreſſion to the People; and occaſioned a Law, that no Juſtice ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any Delinquent to other then the County Goale, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Franchiſes to the Lords.<note place="margin">5 H. 4. cap. 10.</note> Thoſe times are happy when juſtice waites not altogether at Court, but growes up in the feilds, and Juſtices of Peace, as the Kings armes upon the Royall Mace are terrible onely to the bad; and not as they are pictured before an Ale-houſe door to invite men to tranſgreſſe.</p>
               <p>The Lawes for the preſervation of the Peace concerne either puniſhment of Crimes committed, or prevention of them from being committed: There is a ſucceſſion of Crimes, as of men and ages, becauſe the Scripture tells us, that the hearts of all are faſhioned alike, yet it is with generations as with men, ſome incline to ſome Crimes more then other, and that is the reaſon that the title Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſometimes is ſet forth in Folio, ſometimes in a leſſer Volume. Its evident in Story, that the violent times of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, had raiſed the vallue of that, amongſt other offences, above meaſure; not long before his time, his Father had reduced that wilde Notion of Treaſon to a certaine rule, that formerly wandred in a Wilderneſſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. But <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, either to ſave his own Stake, or to take the People, or both,<note place="margin">1 H. 4. cap. 10.</note> reduced it againe to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute rule of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and made void that Statute of his Predeceſſors, which had made a former Act of Parliament, (and all the ſervice thereby done) Treaſon. The dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Treaſon thus clearly limmed and declared, taught
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52042:100"/>
ill diſpoſed mindes to keep out of the Letter, and yet to be bold with the ſenſe; counterfeit Money they durſt not, yet to diminiſh the ſame they thought came not within the circle,<note place="margin">3 H. 5. cap. 6.</note> and ſo it became a common greivance, till a Law was made, that all purpoſed impairing of Mony ſhall be Treaſon. And ſo the Parliament held forth to all men that they had a power to declare Treaſon, without the bounds of the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. The like power it held forth in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, for men knew that Burgla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and robbery were mortall crimes, they would no more of that, now they deviſe a way to ſpoile, and prey, for themſelves, and yet neither to rob, nor break houſe. To this end they would ſcatter little Scrolls in writing, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the party that they intended to prey upon, to leave ſo much Money upon ſuch a day, at ſuch a place, and this was,<note place="margin">8 H. 6. cap. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Sub paena,</hi> of burning the parties houſe, and goods; which many times did inſue upon default made, this practiſe was at once made Treaſon, to prevent the grouth of ſuch an evill.

                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:52042:100"/>In the next place, as touching forcible entries and riots, the remedies ſo often inculcated, and new dreſſed, ſhew plainly the nature of the times: Theſe kind of crimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are as the light Skirmiſhes in the beginning of a War, and follow in the concluſion alſo, as the faintings of a battell fought till both ſides be weary.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not enter into each particular Statute, diverſe of them being little other then as aſſeverations, annexed to a ſentence, to add credit and ſtirr up minding in men, that otherwiſe would ſoone forget what is ſayd or done: The remedies formerly propounded are now refined and made more effectuall.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in regard of ſpeed, which is as neceſſary in theſe forces as the ſtopping of the breaches of waters, in the firſt Act, and therefore one Juſtice of the Peace may proceed upon a holder by force, or breaker of the Peace, with a <hi>Continuando,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. Of the <hi>Militia</hi> during theſe times.</head>
               <p>THe Title of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth to the Crown, was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained principally by his Tenures, which the Courtiers call Knight-Service, but the Common People, force of Armes; and that which deſtroyed many a man, was the principall means of his ſubſiſtence. Otherwiſe its clear, that his Title was ſtaring naught; nor could he outface <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi> Title, without a naked Sword, which he uſed warily; for he had Enemies enough to keep his Sword in hand, and Freinds enough to keep it from ſtriking at randome: for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in by the Peoples favour, he was obleiged to be rather remiſſe, then rigorous, yet his manner of comming was by the Sword, and that occaſioneth men much to debate about his abſolute power in the <hi>Militia,</hi> as ſuppoſing that what power he had, other Kings may, <hi>De jure,</hi> challenge the ſame; and let that be taken for granted, though it will not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow in true reaſoning: And let it alſo be taken for good, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, entered the Throne by his Sword, yet is there not any Monument in Story or Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that favoureth any abſolute right in him over the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi> but the current is, I think, ſomwhat clear againſt it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, <hi>De Jure,</hi> could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell men to ſerve beyond the Seas, but raiſed them by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and therefore by Act of Parliament, he did confirme the Statute, 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Stat.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">4 H. 4. cap. 3.</note> which Statute was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely made to that end: And the ſame alſo is countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by another Statute made in theſe times,<note place="margin">18 H. 6. c. 19.</note> whereof we now Treat; by the words whereof appeareth, that the Souldiers for the Forrain Service were levied by Contract, between them and the Captain, who undertooke to Levy them by wage; ſo as none were then compelled to enter into Service by impreſt, or abſolute command; nor is there any
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52042:102"/>
authority amongſt all thoſe cited in <hi>Calvins</hi> Caſe, that doth mention any ſuch thing; but contrarily, that Opinion of <hi>Thirning</hi> is expreſſe,<note place="margin">7 H. 4. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herb. Protect.</hi> 100.</note> That the King cannot ſend men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Seas to Warres, without wages; and therefore no man is bound to any ſuch Service, by any abſolute Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as the Reporter would underſtand the point; but if he receiveth wages thereto, he by that Contract binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſeemeth alſo to be granted, that ſuch as went voluntarily in the Kings Service, ever had the Kings pay, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were out of their Counties, if the King ruled by his Lawes, for by the Statute formerly mentioned, the King did likewiſe confirm the Statute of 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Stat.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. which is expreſſe in that point, and the matter in Fact alſo is evident upon the Records.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, touching the Arming of thoſe that were thus Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, as their was a certain Law, by which all men were Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed to certain Armes, either by the Service and Tenure of their Lands, or by Parliament; for ſuch as were not bound to finde ſufficient Armes by their Tenure, according as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Statute,<note place="margin">4 Hen. 4.</note> 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Stat.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>cap.</hi> 8. So did <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, by the Statute formerly mentioned to be made in his time, Confirm that Law of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third. In the Argument of <hi>Calvins</hi> Caſe, it is much inſiſted upon, to prove the Legiance of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man to the King, to be abſolute, becauſe he hath power to ſend men to Warre at his pleaſure, and he hath onely power to make Warre; and if ſo, then hath he abſolute power in the <hi>Militia</hi>: As touching the power of ſending men to Warre, hath been already ſpoken; but as touching the power to make Warre, there is no doubt, but where a King hath made a League with another King, he onely can break that League, and ſo make Warre; and that Opinion of <hi>Brian</hi> muſt be agreed for good in that ſenſe.<note place="margin">19 E. 4. fol. 6.</note> But if a League be made by Act of Parliament, or if the King will have Warre, and the Parliament will make a League without him; no authority doth in ſuch caſe avouch, that it is the right of the King, or that he hath a Legall Power to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52042:102"/>
break that League as he pleaſeth: Neither in the next place, hath the King any right or Legall power to make War with his own Subjects as he pleaſeth, but is bound to maintain the Peace, not onely by his Oath at his Coronation, but alſo by the Lawes whereto he is bound, if he will reign in right of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King: For every man knoweth, that the grounds of the Statutes of wearing of Liveries, was for the maintaining of the Publique Peace. And <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth,<note place="margin">1 H. 4 cap. 7.</note> amongſt other proviſions made againſt that trick, hath this; <hi>That the King ſhall give onely his Honourable Livery to his Lords Temporall whom ſhall pleaſe him, and to his Knights and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquires meniall, and to his Knights and Eſquires which be of his retinue, and take of him their yearely Fee for Terme of Life, and that no Yeoman ſhall take or weare any Livery of the King, nor of none other Lord.</hi> And another Law was made within one yeare enſuing, confirming the former,<note place="margin">2 H. 4. cap. 21.</note> and providing, the Prince may give Liveries to ſuch Lords as he pleaſes, and to his meniall Gentlemen, and that they may weare the ſame as in the Kings Caſe. By both which, the King and Prince are both in one Caſe, as touching the power of giving Liveries, if the one hath abſolute power, then hath the other the like; If one be under the Directory of Law in that point, then is alſo the other: For it is clear, that the King is intended by the Statute to be bound from giving Liveries, and the people from wearing them, otherwiſe then in eſpeciall Caſes; and then the Concluſion will be, that if the King may not give Liveries to prejudice of the Peace, then may he much leſſe break the Peace at his pleaſure; or Levy Men, Armes and Warre when he ſhall think moſt meet. Take then away from the King abſolute Power to compell men to take up Armes, otherwiſe then in caſe of Forrain Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; power to compell men to goe out of their Counties to War; power to charge men for maintenance of the wars, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make them find Armes at his pleaſure; and laſtly, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to break the Peace, or doe ought that may tend thereto: Certainly the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> that remaineth, though never ſo ſurely ſetled in the Kings hand, can never bite this Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:52042:103"/>Nor can the noiſe of the Commiſſion of Array, Intitle the King unto any ſuch vaſt power, as is pretended: For though it be granted, that the Commiſſion of Array was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Parliament in theſe times; and ſecondly, that being ſo amended, it was to ſerve for a Preſident or Rule for the future; yet will it not follow, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth had, or any Succeſſours of his, hath any power of Array ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from themſelves, abſolutely in themſelves, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminatively to ſuch ends, as he, or they, ſhall thinke meete.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as touching the amendment of the Commiſſion, it was done upon complaint made by the Commons as a grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, that ſuch Commiſſions had iſſued forth, as had been greivous, hurtfull, and dangerous; And the King agrees to the amendments, upon advice had with the Lords, and Judges:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exact. Collec. p.</hi> 406.</note> and if it be true that the amendments were in the materiall Clauſes (as it is granted) then it ſeemeth that formerly a greater power was exerciſed then by Law ought to have been; and then hath not the King an abſolute power of Array, for the juſt power of a King, can be no greivance to the Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 407.</note>Secondly, if the Commiſſion of Array thus mended, was to ſerve as a rule of Array for the future, then there is a rule, beyond which, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and his Succeſſors may not goe; and then it will alſo follow, that the power of Array, is not Originally, nor abſolutely, in the King; but from, and under the Rule and Law of the Parliament: which rule was not made by the Kings own directions,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. fol.</hi> 406.</note> but (as we are told) beyond expectation, alterations were made in materiall parts of the Commiſſion, and the powers in execution there, whereof no complaint of greivance had been made. The iſſue then is, if the King had an Univerſall Power in the Array; the Parliament likewiſe had a generall Liberty, without any reſtriction to correct that power.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſuppoſe that this power of the Parliament is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and concluded, by the Commiſſion thus amended, and that thereby the Kings Power is eſtabliſhed, yet can it
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52042:103"/>
not be concluded, that this Power is Originally or abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the King: Its not abſolutely in him, becauſe it is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, its not continuall, becauſe its onely in caſe of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Its not generall upon all occaſions, but onely in caſe of a Forrain and ſudden invaſion and attempts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the powers are not undefined, but circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. 1. To Array ſuch as are Armed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Collect.</hi> 4.24.</note> ſo as they cannot aſſeſſe Armes upon ſuch. 2. To compell thoſe of able Bodies and Eſtates to be Armed, and thoſe of able Eſtates, and not able bodies, to Arme ſuch as are of able Bodies, and not Eſtates: but this muſt be <hi>Juxta facultates,</hi> and <hi>ſalvo Statu.</hi> 3. Whereas they ſtraine themſelves to make the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and the Commiſſion of Array, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the Statutes of 13 <hi>E.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they affirm ſo many more reſtrictions unto this power of Array, as thoſe Statutes are remediall in particular caſes; yet doe I not agree to their Gloſſes, but leave them to the debate already publiſhed concerning the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as this power was not abſolutely in the King, ſo was it not originally from themſelves, becauſe they had not the Legiſlative Power concerning the ſame; but the ſame was ever, and yet is, in the Parliament; hereof I ſhall note onely three particular inſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>Militia</hi> is a Poſture, that extendeth as well to Sea, as Land: That which concerneth the Sea, is the Law of <hi>Marque,</hi> and Repriſall, granted to ſuch of the People of this Nation, as are pillaged by Sea, by ſuch as have the Kings Conduct, or publique Truce. And by this Law,<note place="margin">4 H. 5. cap. 7.</note> the Party pillaged, had to recompence himſelf upon that man that had pillaged him, or upon any other Subject of that Nation, in caſe upon requeſt made of the Magiſtrate in that Nation, ſatisfaction be not given him for his wrong, it was a Law made by the Parliament, whereby the Chancellor had power to grant ſuch Letters or Commiſſion, upon complaint to him made.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:52042:104"/>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mag. Cart. cap.</hi> 32.</note>This was grounded upon the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> concerning Free Trade, which had been prejudiced by the rigour of the Conſervators of the Truce, againſt the Kings Subjects, although what was by them done was done in their own defence: And by which means, the Forrainers were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bold to tranſgreſs, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fearfull in their own Charge, and many laid aſide their Trade by Sea, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſtrength of the Kingdome was much impaired: Nor is the Equity of this Law to be queſtioned, for if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate upon complaint made, grants not releif, the offence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Publique, and the Nation chargeable, in nature of an Acceſſory after the Fact, and ſo the next man liable to give ſatisfaction, and to ſeek for releif at home.</p>
               <p>The King then hath a power to grant Letters of <hi>Marque,</hi> by Sea or Land, and this power is granted by Parliament, and this power is a limited power, onely in particular caſes, in regard that many times theſe prove in nature of the firſt, light skirmiſhes of a generall War.</p>
               <p>Two other Inſtances yet remain, concerning the Order and Government of the Souldiers in the Army; the one concerning the Souldiers Pay, <hi>Viz. That Captains ſhall not abate the Souldiers Wages,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">18 H. 6. c. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>but for their Cloathing, under peril of Fine to the King.</hi> The other concerning the Souldiers ſervice,<note place="margin">cap. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>That they ſhall not depart from their Colours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave, before the time of their Service be expired, unleſſe in caſe of ſickneſſe, or other good cauſe, teſtified and allowed by the Captain; and ſuch as ſhall doe otherwiſe, ſhall ſuffer as Fellons.</hi> Which Lawes could not have holden in force, had they not been made by Parliament, in reſpect that the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties concern the Eſtates and Lives of Men, which are not to be invaded but by the Law of the Land: ſo as both Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Souldiers, as touching the Legiſlative power, are not under the King in his Perſonall Capacity, but under the Law of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as the rule of War was under the Legiſlative power of the Parliament, ſo was the rule of Peace; for whiles <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Sixth was in <hi>France,</hi> which was in his tenth yeare,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52042:104"/>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. A Survey of the Reignes of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Third.</head>
               <p>THe reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, was for the moſt part, in the former parts of it, like fire buried up in the aſhes; and in the later parts breaking out into a flame: In the heat wherof, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> after Fealty given by him to <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and diſpenſation gotten from the Pope, to break his Faith, loſt his life; and left his Sonne the <hi>Mark-grave,</hi> to purſue his Title to the Crown, which he claimed by Inheritance, but more eſpecially by Act of Parliament made upon the agreement between <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and his Father. This was <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe reſerved himſelf to the Election of the Lords, and was by them received, and commended to the Commons in the Feild, by which meanes he gaining the Poſſeſſion, had alſo incouragement to maintain the ſame, yet never held himſelf a King of full age, ſo long as <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth lived, which was the one half of his reigne: Nor did he, though he held many Parliaments, ſcarce reach higher then at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of Trade, which was a Theame well pleaſing to the People, next unto their Peace, which alſo the King carefully regarded. For although he had been a Souldier of good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52042:105"/>
and therewith ſucceſsfull, yet as one loath to truſt too far, either the conſtancy of the People of his own domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or the fortune of War with his neighbouring Princes, he did much by brave countenance and diſcourſe: and yet gain'd repute to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for valour, after the diſhonorable times of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. He had much to do with a wiſe King of <hi>France,</hi> that knew how to lay out three or foure calme words at any time to ſave the adventure of his Peoples blood, and make a ſhew of Mony to purchaſe the peaceable holding of that which was his, only by force, untill the winde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more faire to bring all that continent under one head.</p>
               <p>In his Government at home he met with many croſſe gales, occaſioned principally by his owne raſhneſſe, and neglect of the Earl of <hi>Warwicks</hi> approved freindſhip, which he had turned into profeſſed enmity: And ſo weakned his own cauſe thereby,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Com. lib.</hi> 3. c. 4. &amp; 5. &amp;. 6.</note> that he was once under Water, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome diſpoſed of by a new intaile upon the Heires of Duke <hi>Clarence,</hi> and ſo the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> remained conſtant to the Houſe of <hi>York</hi> though this particular King was ſet aſide. Nor did he in all this, gaine any thing but a Wife, who though his ſubject, and none of the greateſt family, neither brought any intereſt unto her Lord and Husband amongſt forraine Princes, brought nevertheleſſe a Pearle, which was beyond all; which was the purchaſe of the Union between the two Houſes of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and a peaceable ſucceſſion in the Throne for a long while to come. It muſt be granted, that there fell therewith an unhappy inconvenience in the raiſing of a new Nobility of the Queenes kindred, of whom the ancient ſtock of Nobility thought ſcorn, and yet they were ſo conſiderable, as to be envied. A wound hard to be cured, and yet eaſily avoyded, by ſuch as know how to deny themſelves. And therefore can be no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice unto that concluſion: That for an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King to marry his own Subject, is more ſafe for the King, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall for the Kingdome, then to marry a Stranger.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth did not long lye underneath; upon the next faire Gale he comes from beyond the Sea, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52042:105"/>
(like his firſt predeceſſor of the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter</hi>) claimes only his Dutchy, which no man could in reaſon deny to be his right, and therfore were the ſooner ingaged with him in that accouſt. This was an Act that in the firſt undertaking ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed modeſt, but when it was done, appeared too bold to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it upon the Cenſure of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were not more ready to ingage then ſlack to disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, till they were ſecure in the Kings intereſt, which not long after enſued, by the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth. Thus <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the fourth recovered the Crowne to ſave his Dutchy.

To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his owne People, his carriage was not ſo much by Law as by Leave; for he could fetch a courſe out of the old way of rule, ſatisfie himſelfe, diſſatisfie others, and yet never was called to account: What was done by intreaty no man could blame, and where entreaties are countenanced by Power, no man durſt contradict. Thanks to his Fate that had brought him upon a People tyred by Warrs, ſcared by his ſucceſſe, and loath to adventure much for the Houſe of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> in which no courage was left to adventure for it ſelfe.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52042:106"/>
his minde generally led the way thereto, ſo as its the leſſe wonder if he called more for accommodations then the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Treaſury of the Crowne could ſupply: Hereto there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he uſed expedients, which in his former times, were more moderate; for whiles <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth lived, he did but borrow,<note place="margin">12 E. 4 cap. 2.</note> by privy Seale, and take tonnage and poundage by way of hire: Afterwards when no Starr appeared (but what was inlightned from his own Sun) he was more plaine, and tried a new trick, called <hi>Benevolence:</hi> unwelcome it was, not onely in regard of its owne nature, but much more in the end,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Comin. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> for it was to ſerve the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Warr againſt <hi>France</hi> in the firſt view, but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to ſerve his own purſe, both from freinds and foes: And yet this alſo paſſed without much controll, for when diſpleaſure was like to enſue, he could ſpeak faire, and feaſt, and if need was, kiſſe away all diſcontent. Towards his end, as ſtale drinke, he grew ſowre: For as in the firſt part of his reigne he had beene ſupplyed by good will againſt Law; ſo in his later times, he had gotten a trick of ſupply by Law againſt good will: This was by penall Laws, which are a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy if they be uſed, <hi>Ad terrorem,</hi> but if ſtrained beyond that, the remedy proveth worſe then the diſeaſe; in their firſt inſtitution they are formes of courteſie from the People to the King, but in the rigorous execution of them, are trialls of maſtery of the King over the People, and are uſually laid up againſt dayes of reckoning between the Prince and them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe penall Laws are beſt contrived, that with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt terrour to the Delinquent bring the leaſt profit to the Kings Coffers. Once for all, this Kings Acts were many, his enterpriſes more, but ſeldome attaining that end which they faced. He was a man of Warr, and did more by his Fame then his Sword, was no ſooner reſolved in good earneſt but he died, left a Kingdome unaſſured, his Children young, and many freinds in ſhew, but in truth very few.</p>

The manner of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſtrained, having once won the ſaddle, he is loath to be caſt; knowing himſelf guilty all over, and that nothing could abſolve his Fame but a Parliament, he calls it, Courts it, and where his wit could not reach to Apologize, hee makes whole by recompence, takes a way benevolences;<note place="margin">1 Rich. 3. c. 2.</note> he is ready to let them have their preſent deſires, what can they have more: He promiſeth good behaviour for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he might the better do, becauſe he had already attained his ends: Thus in one Parliament (for he could hold no more) he gave ſuch content, as even to wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he could as ſoone finde an army in the feild to fight for him, as the moſt meritorious of his Predeceſſors. His ill title made him very jealous, and thereby tought his beſt freinds, to keep at a diſtance, after which time few eſcaped that came within his reach, and ſo he ſerved Gods judgement againſt his adjutants, though he underſteod it not.

And ſo the King will now be contented to adventure himſelf into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Marriage with her, if his own Queen were not in the way, onely to ſecure the Peace of the Kingdome; which, he good King, was bound in Conſcience to maintain, though with the perill of his owne Soule; and in this zeale of his Conſcience, his Queen ſoon went out of the way, and ſo Love is made to the young Lady.

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. Of the Government in relation to the Parliament.</head>
               <p>THe ſeaſons now in Tract were of ſhort continuance, lives paſſed away more ſpeedily then years; and it may ſeem uſeleſſe to inquire what is the nature of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch a time, when as the greateſt work was to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain life and ſoul together; and when all is done, little elſe is done. For though the Title of the Houſe of <hi>Yorke</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo clear againſt that of <hi>Lancaſter</hi>; yet it had been ſo long darkned with a continuall Succeſſion of Kings of the Red-Roſe, that either by their merit had gained a Throne in the Peoples hearts, or by their facility had yeilded their Throne up to the Peoples will; as it proved not eaſie to Convince them that liked well their preſent Lot, and were doubtfull of change, or to make them tender of the right of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth above their own quiet. Above threeſcore years now had <hi>England</hi> made triall of the Government of the <hi>Lancastrian</hi> Princes, and thereof about thirty years expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience had they of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; they ſaw he was a gentle Prince. On the other ſide, <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, newly ſprung up out of a Root, watered with blood; himſelf alſo a Man for the Feild.</p>
               <p>This might well put the minds of the People to a ſtand, what to think of this Man, whoſe nature and ends are ſo doubtfull, and brought nothing to commend him to the good wills of the People, but his bare Title; which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort uſually judge of, according as they ſee it proſper, more or leſſe. Add hereunto that Divine Providence did not ſo clearly, nor ſuddenly, determine his ſecret purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this change, by any conſtant ſucceſſe to either part, by means whereof the one half of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourths reign was ſpent, while as yet <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was in veiw, and the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52042:108"/>
minds of men left unaſſured, neither truſting much to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth, nor he to them: and after that <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was gone out of the way, <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, could not readily change his poſture, uſed Arguments of force and power, and for the moſt part, looked like a Man in Armes, with his hand on his ſword, ready to draw upon the next man that ſtands in his way.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1 E 4. n. 30.</note>Thus are the People partly driven, and partly drawn, into an Oath of Allegiance unto <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of Attainder; and the Parliament aſſured unto him once more: For immediately upon the departure of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth beyond Sea, after tenne yeares of his Reign, the Parliament (never ſtaying for the iſſue of Providence) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Throne void of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth King. The Judges likewiſe of the Courts at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> determined the ſame thing, as may appear by the Law Reports of thoſe times in Print: wherein Re-attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were often granted by them upon diſcontinuance of proceſſe by this Demiſe of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth. And thus <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth is once more King for ſix moneths, <hi>Viz.</hi> from <hi>October</hi> to <hi>Aprill,</hi> at which time the ballance turns, <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth returns, gets into the Throne; <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth is again Dethroned, all things are as they were, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Act of Parliament. For that Body is ever wiſe enough to ſide with power, rather then to ſpend much time upon fruitleſs Orders and Votes, that will peirce no Armour; and therefore like the times, muſt needs be ſubject to fits of diſtemper at the comming in of every Tide, and did build, and pull down, Enact and diſenact, turn and return, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Crown, from <hi>Yorke</hi> to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and back again, and in concluſion, for ſome time did do little but undo. Nor can they be juſtly cenſured herein; for Councells of men are not ordained to hinder Divine Providence, or over-rule Fate, but to foreſee, and cloſe with occaſions, in the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous way for the Publique good, and when both winds and Currents are uncertain, to ride at flote, till they can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the moſt commodious Haven to Winter in. To impute
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52042:108"/>
therefore fault unto the Parliament in ſuch Caſes for want of Uniformity, and Immutability of Councells, is ſomewhat like the Notion that Batchelours conceit of Wives, they would have, but they do not know what other, then <hi>an Idea of their own Fancy</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if it be inquired which courſe prevailed, in order either to the Kings Royalty, or the Peoples Liberty, I ſhall anſwer neither of theſe; but the Houſe of <hi>Yorke</hi> prevailed to hold the Crown, and might have advanced the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, had they not falne out amongſt themſelves for the ſpoyle; and <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth was not altogether diſpoſed thereto: The ſucceſſe that he had in the Feild, and his Souldiery, made him look big like a King of the greater ſize; but Kings ſleep not ſecurely upon ſuch pillowes; when the <hi>Militia</hi> is on horſ-back, it is as ready to be a Guard upon the King, as for him, and when it is moſt ſober, not ſo eaſily governed as a Common-wealth. And therefore <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth, now in Armes, though he found it a hard Notion to maintain the Peoples Liberty, where no man is free from the Souldier, yet he inclined thereto: we reade of multitude of Taxations of all ſorts, and of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, the worſt of all thoſe ſorts: for Souldiers muſt have money, or if not, they will have it, but the King would not force things ſo far as his power could reach, he will have money, but it ſhall be by Order of the Parliament. He might have pretended much upon the Commiſſion of Array,<note place="margin">12 E. 4. n. 8.</note> yet did it not, but choſe rather to be Lord of the Seas: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was too great a Farm for his private purſe, he prayes aid of the Parliament by the way of Tonnage, and Poundage,<note place="margin">12 E. 4. cap. 3.</note> which was in demand nine yeares, before the Parliament granted it; and when it was granted, it was with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, that it is evident the King preferred the right of the Parliament therein, above his private Honour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Titles of Honour are but windy Notions, and every one knowes what claim is made by Kings, to have the ſole intereſt in conferring the ſame;<note place="margin">17 E. 4. n. 10, 16.</note> this <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth neglected ſo far, as he intereſted the Parliament, both in the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52042:109"/>
in the conferring of them, and reſuming of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the courſe of Trade was now more eſpecially looked to, not by the King and Privy Councell, but by the Parliament; and becauſe it was much decayed, partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ill Government thereof, and partly by the exceſſive laviſhneſſe of theſe times, many Lawes are made for remedy of both. And firſt, the Staple was ſettled ſometimes at <hi>Callis</hi> alone,<note place="margin">3 E. 4. cap. 1. 4 E. 4. cap. 2. 14 E. 4. cap. 3, 5.</note> ſometimes at it, and <hi>Middleburrough,</hi> and by this means <hi>England</hi> gained Trade from both Nations; but the principall thanks is to be given to the intereſt between the King and the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Then courſe is taken for the bringing of the Staple Commodities onely to thoſe places,<note place="margin">3 E. 4. cap. 1.</note> and the return to be made in money, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity by exchange. Then for the well making of Staple Manufactures,<note place="margin">1 R. 3. cap. 12. 4 E. 4. cap. 1, 2, 3. 17 E. 4. cap. 1.</note> and reſtraining Importation of Forrain Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of ſuch kinds. Then againſt tranſporting of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coyn, and Importing of Forrain Coyn, other then Bullion.</p>
               <p>And as touching the ſecond greivance, it ſeems gallantry, or vanity of Apparrel was a ſore diſeaſe of theſe times, which were become times of Faſhions, and wherein the King led the way by his own example; for he deſired to be brave, and that he might be more brave, he paſſed Lawes that the People ſhould be leſſe brave, aſſeſſing a ſort of Apparrell for every degree,<note place="margin">3 E. 4. cap. 5. 22 E. 4. cap. 1. 17 E. 4. cap. 1.</note> and therein ſtooped ſo low, as to define the faſhions of their very ſhooes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Parliament retained their ancient right of reducing the courſe of Judicature; for whereas Sheriffs had hitherto holden their courſe of triall of the meaner ſort of Fellonies, and Treſpaſſes, and Offences, determinable onely by Impriſonment, or Fines and Amerciaments; whereby mens Eſtates did lie under the continuall pillage of theſe covetous and extorting Officers: It was eſtabliſhed by the Parliament, that theſe men ſhould have for the future, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power of inquiry,<note place="margin">1 E. 4. cap. 2.</note> and to certifie at the next Seſſions, and there the Triall to be, and Fines and Amerciaments to be ſet, taxed; and eſtreated, unto the Exchequor, and from thence
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52042:109"/>
to be levied, and thereof the Sheriff to give account; this was a great ſecurity to the Peoples eſtates, but gave them not a full remedy: for though the Triall was now more fair, yet theſe Officers were Judges of ſuſpition, and had ſtill power upon ſuſpition to impriſon their perſons, and ſeize their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, under colour to ſave them for the King, in caſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction followed.</p>
               <p>For remedy hereof,<note place="margin">1 R. 3. cap. 3.</note> the Juſtices of the Peace have now power given them to Bail, in Caſes of light Suſpition, and it is further declared, that no mans Eſtate ſhall be firſt ſeized, till Conviction and Attainder firſt be had. And becauſe Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theators grew no leſſe burdenſome in their way; it was therefore Ordered, that no man ſhall be allowed in ſuch Office, unleſſe he hath Lands to the vallue of twenty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12 E. 4. cap. 9.</note> and that he ſhall be reſponſable for ſuch wrong done by himſelf, or by his Deputy and Farmer.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth quitted himſelf like a King in many regards, but ſoon ran himſelf out of breath, gave his Lamp to his Sonne, that was too weake to hold it; a Third ſnatches it away, and for two yeares carrying it exceeding well, yeilded up all incroached Royalty to the People,<note place="margin">1 R. 3. cap. 2.</note> and his Crown and Life to his Succeſſor.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. A ſhort ſumm of the Reignes of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</head>
               <p>THe courſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi> policy hitherto wandering in the different Currents, ſpringing from the double head of Monarchy, and Democracy, and in them likewiſe, often toſſed up and down, partly by the blaſts of windy Titles and Pretentions, and partly by the raging Tides from the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea, now begin to come to Anchor within veiw of Shore. Happy <hi>England,</hi> if the ſame prove good Harbarage for a fainting Nation. Two Kings now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Stearage; the worke of the firſt was to ſtill the Winds, the other the Seas, and ſo to bring the Adventure ſafe home. <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, hapned upon a good prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative for this work, in that he delivered the Kingdom from a Tyrant, whoſe irregular and bloody way was ſo odious to the People, that it ſet a foil upon his Succeſſors Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and made his Wiſdom, Vallour and Juſtice, appear grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then poſſibly it was. His Vallour made way for the other two, he had enough thereof to ſerve a wiſe Man in caſe of Extremitie; at other times he made more uſe of his Majeſty, then Manhood; being confident that the People knew not where to mend themſelves, but would be at his Devotion, ſo long as he was better then his Predeceſſor, though he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not how little. His Wiſdome was his greateſt part, of which, upon all occaſions he made the greateſt improvement he could, without reflecting upon Conſcience, or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof he had taſted no more then would render him a civill man, whereunto his Education did lead the way: thus, though his Vallour brought him to the Crown, yet it was
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52042:111"/>
his wiſdome that ſettled him in the Throne. For though he loved himſelf ſo well, that he was loath to pretend allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any acceſs of Forrain help to his own atcheivement in his Title, or that he was guilty in the leaſt manner in his Entry upon the Throne; yet to keep danger far off, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided one guard for his Perſon, and many for his Title.</p>
               <p>That of his Perſon he pretended onely as a Ceremony of State brought from the <hi>French</hi> Court, and yet its ſtrange that it went ſo well down with a Free People: For that Prince that will keep guards about his Perſon in the midſt of his own People, may as well double them into the pitch of an Army whenſoever he pleaſes to be fearfull; and ſo turn the Royall power of Law into force of Armes: but it was the <hi>French</hi> Faſhion, and the Kings good hope to have all taken in the beſt ſenſe.</p>
               <p>His Title (ſetting aſide the ſaying of <hi>Phillip</hi> the hardy,<note place="margin">Thevet. lib. 4. cap. 32.</note> That Kingdomes onely belong to them that can get them) would hardly endure the touch, till Pope <hi>Inocent</hi> by his Bull, confirmed the Crown to him to hold by a ſixfold right, <hi>Viz. Of Inheritance, of Warre, of Eſpouſals, of Election, of gift by Parliament,</hi> and laſtly, <hi>of Pontificiall Benediction</hi>; which the King liked marvellous well, and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Title by marriage was buried up in the middle, and ſo made the leſſe noyſe. For though it was his beſt guard, yet he liked not that it ſhould be ſo reputed, leaſt his Title ſhould ſeem rather conferred upon him, then gained by him, and ſo ſhould hold by a Woman, or at the beſt, by the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie of <hi>England,</hi> if the Peoples favour ſhould ſo far extend the Law in that Point, by both which he holds the Honour <hi>of a compleat Engliſh King diminiſhed</hi>: His Title by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is much diſputable, if the right Heires of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> be inquired after: and much more that of Warre, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that brought the Poſſeſſion, yet no right or Title, but by wrong; which may indeed be plaiſtred over by Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Act of Parliament, but then he muſt be Tenant to the People. As touching the Pontificiall Benediction, himſelfe tooke that but as a redundancy, that might ſway with the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52042:112"/>
Clergy, and do his Title no hurt. Nevertheleſſe what ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they cannot do, by joynt concurrence he accounts ſo fully done as if he were a King againſt all the world, and more,<note place="margin">Jovius Brit.</note> yet is he not ſure enough, but as one jealous is more tender, ſo is his eye ever upon his Title; there is his guard and regard, as if it were the outworks of his Crown, which once loſt, the Crown cannot hold out long. In this work he minded ſo much his greatneſſe, that he loſt the repute of his goodneſſe, then caſting his eye upon the government and finding it of a mixt temper, wherein if Royalty prevails not, popularity will; like a good Souldier whiles his ſtrength is full he ſallies upon the peoples liberties, in regard of their perſons with ſuch cunning conveyance, as he taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to dance more often and better to the tune of Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Allegiance, then all his Predeceſſors had done; nor did the People perceive it til they were over their ſhoos, and then they clearly ſaw their condition, and that it was in vaine for them to wrangle with their own acts, of which more particularly in the next Chapter. The Legiance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the People once gained, their Eſtates more eaſily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and therefore though in the former he wrought by <hi>Ambuſcado,</hi> in this he may be more brave, and charge them in the Van; yet this alſo he did by degrees, firſt by light Sker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes of borrowing ſmaller ſums of Money (poſſibly when he had no need) and paying them againe, thereby to gain credit for greater ſums, of which he intended not ſo ſuddain returne. Then he charges them home with <hi>Benevolences</hi> (a trick gained in right of his Wife from her Father) for he hoped that the Perſon of <hi>Richard</hi> the third was now become ſo abominable as his Laws would be the leſſe regarded. But in this courſe he gained nothing but winde; then (as <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth) he falls upon <hi>Malevolences of penall Lawes</hi>; things made, <hi>in terrorem,</hi> to ſcare men to obedience, rather then to compell them; but are now executed, <hi>Ad angorem,</hi> and the people find that he is but a word and a blow with them, and thus ſerving his Prerogative with Power, and his Purſe with his Prerogative,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jovius Brit.</hi> fol. 9.</note> he made all ſerve his owne turne, <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitatem omnem vicente periculo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:52042:112"/>In the feild he alwayes put his Wiſdome in the Van, for as he was parcimonious in expences of Money, ſo much rather of Blood, if he could prevaile by wit; Generally he was the firſt in armes, to make men beleeve he was more ready to fight then they: Thus he many times gained the advantage of his adverſaries, and ſometimes came off without blowes. In the Battell he did put on courage as he did his armor, and would dare to adventure juſt as far as a Generall ſhould, as if he had ever regard of his Crown, rather then of the honor of a forward Souldier, which nevertheleſſe was alſo ſo dear to him as he is ſeldome found in the reare, although his judgment commanded in cheife rather then his courage. In the Throne he is much more wiſe, becauſe he was willing it ſhould be known. In doing Juſtice he is ſeldome ſuſpected, unleſſe where himſelfe is party, and yet then he is alſo ſo ſhamfaced as he would ever either ſtalk behinde ſome Law that had a ſemblance to his ends, or when he meant to ſtep out of the way he would put his Miniſters before; not ſo much that his fineneſſe might be known, but his royalty. For the Lion hunts not his own prey, nor is it regall for a King to be ſeen in catching of mony, though he be underſtood; beſides it was needleſſe, he had Lords, Biſhops, Judges, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of malevolent aſpect, as ſo many furies, outwardly reſembling men for the Common-wealth, but working for the common miſcheife; like ſome pictures one way looking right, and another looking wrong; and thus the King comes lawfully by what he catched, though his inſtruments did not, and muſt be ſtill holden for a good King, though it be his hard hap to have ill Servants. Take him now amongſt the People he is alike to all, yea in ſome things that might ſeem to bruſh upon the Kings owne traine; for he had ſome of his ſuite that were not altogether of his minde, and theſe he would ſpare to the Courſe of Juſtice if need were; as it befell in the Caſe of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whom he ſuffered to be tried at the Kings Bench bar, for a murther done upon a meane perſon, and by ſuch meanes obtained the repute of a Zealous Juſticiar, as if Juſtice had been his principall vertue.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52042:113"/>
All this ſuited well with his maine end; for he that will milk his cattell muſt feed them well; and it incourages men to gather and lay up, when they have Law to hold by what they have.</p>
               <p>His religion I touch upon in the laſt place, as moſt proper to his temper, for it was the laſt in his thought, though many times the firſt in the acting; but where it ſtood in his way he turned it behinde him, he made Church-men his inſtruments, that the matter might better reliſh, for who wil expect ought ſave well from men of religion, and then if the worſt come, he was but miſled by ſuch, as in common reaſon ought to be truſted. And it is his unhappyneſſe to meet with Clergy men to ſerve a turn, and a Pope to give his benediction to a<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l. Nor was this Gratis, for there were as many mutuall ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments between the Clergy and him, as any of his Predeceſſors of the houſ of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> beſids. Laſtly, it may wel be ſuppoſed however wiſe this King ſeemed to be, that many ſaw through him, which procured him a troubleſome reigne; though many times occaſioned by his owne interpoſing in forraine Intereſts, wherein he ſuffered more from others then they from him. Amongſt the reſt the Dutches of <hi>Burgundy</hi> (though a Woman ſhee were) mated him with Phantomes and apparitions of dead bodyes of the Houſe of <hi>Yorke,</hi> the ſcare whereof put the King and all his people in allarme, and ſtriking at idle ſhadows ſlew one another. All which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the appearances of Collections, Taxes, and other accoutrements, to furniſh ſuch imployments, were enough to diſturb that eaſe and reſt that the King aimed to enjoy, make him burdenſome to his People, and both himſelfe and them weary of each other; and ſo he went down to the grave with but a dry funerall, leaving no better teſtimony behinde him then that he was a cunning man, rather then a wiſe <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> King: and though he died rich, yet is he ſince grown into debt to the Pen-men of his ſtory, that by their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency have rendred him a better King then he was.</p>

                  <hi>HEnry</hi> the Eight was a conception, in whom the two Bloods of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> did meete,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</note> both of them unconquered, both of them predominant; and therefore no wonder if he was a man beyond the Ordinary proportion of other men in ſtature of body, and in qualities of mind not diſproportionable. Its regularly true that great bodies move ſlowly, but it holds not where much ſpirit is, and it was the condition of this Prince to have a Spirit of the largeſt ſize that acted him into motion with no leſſe ſpeed then mighty Power. This himſelfe underſtood right well, and therefore might be haughty upon a double title both of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and inheritance; nor did he faile of expectation herein, for he could not endure that man that would owne his right in competition with the Kings aimes, and therefore would have his Kingdome be like his doublet to keep him warme, and yet ſit looſe about him that he might have elbow room; ſuitable hereunto were his undertakings, invited thereunto by the inordinate motions or rather commotions of his neighbouring Princes; for it was now full Sea in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and though <hi>England</hi> was inferiour to ſome of them, yet the King held it diſhonorable for him not to adventure as far as the braveſt of them, and in the end outwent them all: What he wanted in number, he ſupplyed in courage; wherein he ſo exceeded that he avoyded dangers, rather out of judgment then feare. His thoughts, reſolutions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, and actions, were all the birth of occaſion, and of each other; as if he had obtained a generall Paſſe from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, with warranty againſt all Counterguards whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>His Wiſdome ſerved him to eſpy preſent opportunities, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to foreſee them, and therefore was not ſo crafty as his Father in preventing occaſions, yet more dexterious in giving them the rout. For he could mannage his hand and foote better then his Father, ſtrike down-right blowes, and rather then he would faile of his ends would make one, as many times he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:52042:114"/>Another advantage he had of his Father, for conſidering the times, he was a learned King, which made his Actions carry more Majeſty, and like a well feathered Arrow from a ſtrong hand drive through the winde ſtedily to the marke, when as his Father like a weak Archer muſt raiſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and crave aid of the winde to help him to be right in the end.</p>
               <p>Its affirmed by ſome, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight was courteous and debonaire, if ſo, he muſt thanke his Education; but it may be rather ſuppoſed, that upon occaſion he uſed the Art of Inſinuation, which he might learn both from the Father ſide, and Mother ſide; but he neither practiſed it much, nor did he rely upon that skill, for his reſolution led him to cut the knot that he could not unty. His learning led him moſt to Divinity, and therein ſhewed him light enough to ſee much into the Myſtery of iniquity, which he did explain to the World paſſing well; but as touching Devotion, he left that to the care of the Church-men.</p>
               <p>He was very well accommodated with money; Firſt, from the full Coffers left by his Father, much whereof he ſpent in paſtimes and gallantry, as he was Heire to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and much alſo in his Devotion to the Pope, as he was Heire to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, in liew of all which, he was rewarded with a Title, <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi>; and ſo much ill gotten, was much ill ſpent. But a better ſupply he had when <hi>Rome</hi> and he parted aſunder, and the Current of the riches of the Clergy was ſtopped from running at waſte, and returned into the Kings own Treaſury, and ſo might have died the richeſt Prince in the World, but that he wanted the main Clauſe in the Conveyance, To have and to hold. The wiſdome of God ſo ordered it, for theſe felicities were too great and many for any moderate ſpirit to bear gently, much more for the Kings Spirit, that was ever on the Pinacle, and grown to that height, that like an emboſſed Stagge, none muſt cope with him, he muſt run and out-run all; none muſt croſſe him under extream perill, no good is to be done but by following afar of; nor is it a full wonder if in this
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52042:114"/>
his heat, he knowes neither faithfull Servant, Councellour, nor Wife, but ſtrikes at all that ſtands in his way. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, in his coole temper, and when he was intangled with ſome perplexed occaſion, he could uſe the advantage of good Councell, and the wits of others that were more crafty then himſelf, wherein it was his good hap to have ſome ever nigh him that were for his turn, and unto them committed much, that himſelf might be at eaſe to hear good newes of ſucceſſefull diſpatches.</p>
               <p>In his youth he was ſerved by the wiſe Councellors train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by his Father, and he then willing enough for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, was contented by their advice to ſerve his People for a time, that they might be his ſervants for ever. The two great Conduit Pipes of this Treaſury, which he had from his Father, he cut off at his Peoples requeſt, as if he loved his People above all his riches; and after that, he laid aſide his pleaſures, and youthfull company to apply himſelf more cloſely to the Affairs of his Kingdome, as if he loved that above all pleaſure: which nevertheleſſe ſtuck to him ſo long as he lived, and ſwayed too much in the greateſt Affairs of his Government.</p>
               <p>Thus the firſt heat of his courſe was run well; ſo long as the Privy Councell continued moderately poyſed: But no ſooner began one of them to put up beyond his place, and to bid adue to the advice of all the reſt; but he gets the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt ſeat in the Kings Head, makes a foot-ſtoole of the Kings Heart, and then its two to one that the People in ſuch caſes muſt bear the greater burden; for who ever firſt ſaid it, he ſaid moſt true, <hi>That Prerogative in the hand of a King, is a Scepter of Gold, but in the hand of a Subject, it is a rod of Iron.</hi> The reigne of this King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, ſerve us with much experience of this kinde, for if the conſideration of the Affairs of this Government ſhould be divided, the ſame would be double; the one under the Regiment of Cardinall <hi>Woolſy,</hi> the other of the King, by <hi>Cromwell, Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Gardner,</hi> and others interchangeably. I call that of <hi>Woolſy</hi> a Regiment, for he was in nature or condition of a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52042:115"/>
                  <hi>Pro Rex,</hi> during the Kings Juvenility. This Temporizer thus ſuper-induced upon a Cardinall raiſed from mean De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to be <hi>Legate è Latere,</hi>

He knew by experience, that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall could over-awe the People; why ſhould not the King doe as much, if the Lords ſtooped to the Cardinall, why not much rather to the King? The Cardinall pulled down, reared up, turned ſquare to round, why ſhould he be leſſe then his Subjects? Such conceits as theſe ſoon wounde up the Kings minde to that height, that its death to him to ſtoop one inch lower to more moderate advice, though he loved their perſons never ſo well; but all muſt be content with the weight of his Arme, though it were no ſmall one; and yet in point of Religion, Affaires tended to a kinde of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation all this while.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. Of the State of the Crowne.</head>
               <p>THat the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> now abounded more in Flowers then Croſſes, the face of Story doth hold forth to ordinary Obſervation; and yet few are ſatisfied, either in the true nature of the particular advantages, or in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52042:115"/>
how they were obtained, or in their continuance. I muſt therefore make a little ſtop upon them, becauſe in the true diſcerning of them, the diſcovery of the nature of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in later dayes doth much depend. Hitherto the Crown came ſhort of abſolute Power over the people, upon two grounds in obſervation; one relating to the Clergy, the other to the Laity.</p>
               <p>The Church-men were heretofore under a Forrain power, and a Forrain Law, againſt which, Kings durſt not deeply ingage; either not being aſſured of their own Title, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in purſuit of other game, or being of a weak Spirit, were ſcared with the Thunder-bolt of the Popes Curſe: But the Laity were under another Law, and ſuch an one, as by clear and unqueſtionable Cuſtome, had eſtabliſhed bounds, between the way of Kings, and the rights of the People: Neither did Kings directly invade thoſe Borders, either led thereto by a kind of Conſcience in ſuch of them as were Morally inclined, or in others by a kind of fear of raiſing up Earth-quakes from beneath, which commonly doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw high Towers ſooner then windes from above. But now ſuch intereſts are laid aſide faſt aſleep, by two Kings; whereof one cared not much for fear, and neither of them for Conſcience: For <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, having leiſure to ſtudy the Nature, and contemplate the Faſhion of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Crown, diſlikes the Modell in ſome particulars: It was not rich enough, nor well poyſed to his minde, which ever was not to be poore, but towards his later time to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich; as ſuppoſing that to be the onely way to be more deſirable to Freinds, formidable to Enemies, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute over his People. And this opinion of his miſſed in the main end, though it attained his immediate deſire; for by miſtaking the right way, it made a rich King, but not a rich Crown; he delighted more in the riches of his People, then in a rich People; and this bred no good blood, becauſe the People thought that the Law was not on his ſide in that matter. They ſuffered him to viſit their purſes, but are loath it ſhould prove Cuſtomary, leaſt they ſhould looſe their
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52042:116"/>
common right, they therefore chooſe rather to give him power by Act of Parliament, to revoke Letters Patents, and Grants, and make reſumptions of Offices, Fees, Annuities, and the like, that he might rather repoſſeſſe his owne, then poſſeſſe theirs; many penall Lawes likewiſe of a limited and Temporary regard are made; and as Cheeſe after a full dinner, they cloſe up all with Subſidies: For it was evident to all men, that the Royall mind of the King ſerved no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to take what was given; provided that the people would give what elſe would be taken. By this means <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh left rich Coffers to deſcend to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, but the Crown was ſtill the ſame in price.</p>
               <p>In this Act of the Play, the People carry away the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite: The ſecond Act was the Point of Allegiance, wherein both parts carry themſelves ſo cunningly, as its hard to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge the Garland, yet it may be thought, the King obſerved it rather, becauſe he offered all the play, whiles the People did onely lie at their cloſe guard. The whole Project con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in this, to gaine a more abſolute Allegiance from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to their King: and becauſe this is exemplified part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Warre, and partly in Peace, that part which concerneth Warre, will more properly fall under the conſideration of the <hi>Militia</hi>; and therefore I ſhall refer the ſame to that head in the 32. Chapter enſuing, and will come to the ſecond conſideration of Allegiance, in relation to Peace, and therein touch upon the Kings power in making of Lawes, and of Judicature according to thoſe Lawes. As touching the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lawes, the ingenuity of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, could not ſuffer him to make any claim thereto in any Poſitive way, yet his Actions declare that his heart was that way: For being beſet with troubles, he could often fancy dangers, and Arme himſelf; then call a Parliament, who were wiſe enough to grant as readily as he asked, rather then to be compelled thereto: ſo he had Lawes made according to his own will, though he made them not.</p>
               <p>The matter of Judicature comes next, and therein he made his Judges appear, and not himſelfe, though they did not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52042:116"/>
onely repreſent his Perſon, but his minde; ſo things were done according to his minde, though he did them not: And thus his Excellency ſeemed more eminent in finding and making inſtruments fitting to do his work, then in doing his own work. Nevertheleſſe, all this was but from hand to mouth; no fundamentall Law is altered all this while; if the Lawes were made by Parliament, the King made them not; if the Judges turned the Law to the Kings eare, the Law was ſtill the Crown, though the King wore it. But <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was no ſuch man, he had not this skill of undermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor deſired it; he was tender of the leaſt diminution of his Honour, induſtrious in finding out the occaſion, and a moſt reſolved man to remove it out of the way, though it reached as high as the Triple Crown; a man underneath many Paſſions, but above fear: What need <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

But the wheele once ſet a running would not ſtay; the King eſpies the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall in his way, and bears him down, then finding the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of the infallible Chair, he hearkens after other Doctors, followes their light; and being loath to hear what he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſtopped the way to all Importation of ſuch Merchandize, as might be any wayes prejudiciall to the Prerogative Royall, with the penalty of loſſe of Land, or Liberty and Fine, the two later being formerly warranted by Law: The firſt ſerved as a ſcare, for (though it were but by Proclamation) men might juſtly fear that he that was ſo ſtout againſt the Pope, would not ſtick to ſcourge his owne Subjects out of his way in the time of his heat.</p>

The Parliament eſpying the advantage; at once tooke all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales to <hi>Rome</hi> away,<note place="margin">24 H. 8. ca. 12.</note> and eſtabliſhed all ſentences made or to be made within this Land, notwithſtanding any Act from <hi>Rome</hi>; and enjoyned the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy to adminiſter the ſeverall acts of publique worſhip, notwithſtanding any inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition or excommunication from any forrain pretended Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: The grounds upon the preamble of the Law will appeare to be two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the King of <hi>England</hi> is ſupream head in rendring Juſtice within the Nation in all cauſes therein ariſing, which is more then the recogniſance of the Clergy two yeares before this Act did hold forth, yet this acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not abſolute, but in oppoſition to Forraine pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Clergy in <hi>England</hi> having Power, may in matters ſpirituall determine all doubts without forrain help, and adminiſter ſuch duties as to their place do belong; not hereby determining that the Church-men ever had ſuch Power by Law, nor that they ought originally to have ſuch Power. They never had it, for no ſooner were they disjoyned from the Laity in theſe affaires, but immediately they were under the Pope, and received their Power from him. And, <hi>De jure,</hi> they cannot challenge ſuch power, but by a poſitive Law, ſuch as this Law of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, which alſo giveth but a reſtrictive and limited power, <hi>Viz</hi>: In matters teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, of divorce, matrimony, tithes, oblations, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions. So as if they will challenge ſuch power, they muſt thanke the Parliament for it and uſe the ſame accordingly as perſons deputed therunto; and not in their owne right or right of their places. In all this the Kings ſupremacy is but obſcurely aſſerted, and rather by implication, ſhewing what in reaſon may be holden, then by declaration of what was, making way thereby,</p>
               <p>Firſt, into the opinions of men before they were enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to determine their actions, but within two yeares en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing or thereabout, the Law is made <hi>poſitive,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King ſhall be taken and accepted the onely ſupreame</hi>

                  <hi>head on earth of the Church of England; and have power to viſite, correct, repreſſe, redreſſe, reforme, reſtraine, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and amend, all ſuch errours, hereſies, abuſes, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſes, contempts, and enormities, as by any manner of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall authority, or juriſdiction, ought or may lawfully be reformed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which in the preamble is ſaide to be made to confirm what the Clergy in their Convocation formerly had recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized. The corps of his Act is to ſecure the Kings Title, the Kings Power, and the Kings Profit. As touching the Kings Title it is ſayde, that in right it did formerly belong to him, which is to be granted by all ſo far as the Power is rightly underſtood. But as touching the Kings Profit it cannot be ſaide that the whole lump thereof did belong to the King, becauſe much thereof was not ſo ancient, but, <hi>De novo,</hi> raiſed by the Popes extortion; and therefore the true and reall Profits are by particular Acts of Parliament enſuing in ſpeciall words devolved upon him. The nature of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is layd downe in this Statute under a three fold expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is a viſitatory, or a reforming Power which is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by inquiry of offences againſt Lawes eſtabliſhed, and by executing ſuch Lawes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is an ordinary juriſdiction, for it is ſuch as by any Spirituall authority maybe acted againſt irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities; and thus the Title of ſupreame Ordinary is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is ſuch a Power as muſt be regulatd by Law, and in ſuch manner as by any ſpirituall Authority may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be reformed. It is not therefore any abſolute arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power; for that belongs onely to the ſupreame Head in Heaven. Nor is it any legiſlative Power, for ſo the Law ſhould be the birth of this Power, and his Power could not then be regulated by the Law: nor could ever Ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute ſuch a Power, nor did <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth ever make claime to any ſuch Power, though he loved to be much truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:52042:118"/>Laſtly, this Power was ſuch a Power as was gained former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the King by forraine Uſurpation, which muſt be intended, <hi>De rebus licitis,</hi> and once in poſſeſſion of the Crown, or in right thereto belonging according to the Law, for the King hath no Power thereby to confer Church-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings by Proviſorſhip, or to carry the Keyes and turn the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Chaire into an infallible Throne. In breife, this Power was ſuch as the King hath in the Common-wealth; neither legiſlative, nor abſolute in the executive, but in order to the Unity and Peace of the Kingdome. This was the right of the Crowne which was ever claimed; but not enjoyed further then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scepter was able to match the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Keyes: And now the ſame being reſtored by Act of Parliament,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 10. 35 H. 8. c. 1.</note> is alſo confirmed by an Oath enjoyned to be taken by the People, binding them to acknowledge the King under God ſupreame head on earth of the Church of <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and the Kings Dominions,<note place="margin">35 H. 8. c. 3.</note> in oppoſition to all Forraine juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, by a Law which bound all the People to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Kings Title of Defender of the faith, and of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in earth the ſupream head, under the perill of Treaſon in every one that ſhall attempt to deprive the Crowne of that title.</p>
               <p>We muſt deſcend to particulars, for by this it will appeare that theſe generall Lawes concerning the Kings refined title, contained little more then matters of Notion, otherwiſe then a generall barr to the Popes future intereſts: And therefore the Wiſdome of the State (as if nothing had been already done) did by degrees parcell out by ſeverall Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the particular intereſts of the Popes uſurped Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in ſuch manner as to them ſeemed beſt.</p>
               <p>And Firſt, concerning the Legiſlative Power in Church government; It cannot be denied but the Pope; <hi>De facto</hi> had the Power of a negative vote in all Councels and unto that had alſo a binding Power in making Lawes, Decrees, and Decretalls out of his own breaſt; but this was gotten by plunder, he never had any right to headſhip of the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52042:119"/>
Church, nor to any ſuch Power in right of ſuch preferment, nor was this given to the King as head of the Church, but with ſuch limitations and qualifications, that its evident it never was in the Crowne, or rightly belonging thereto.</p>
               <p>Firſt, nigh three yeares after this recognition by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in their Convocation, it is urged upon them, and they paſſe their promiſe,<note place="margin">25. H. 8. ca. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>In verbo ſacerdotii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly it is confirmed by Act of Parliament, that they ſhall never make, publiſh, or execute any new Canon or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution provinciall or other unleſſe the Kings Aſſent and Licenſe be firſt had thereto; and the offences againſt this Law made puniſhable by fine and impriſonment: So as the Clergy are now holden under a double bond, one the honor of their Preiſthood which binds their Wills, and Conſciences; the other the Act of Parliament which bindes their Powers, ſo as they now neither will nor can ſtart. Nevertheleſſe there is nothing in this Law nor in the future practiſe of this King that doth either give or aſſert any power to the King and Convocation to binde or conclude the Clergy or the People, without an Act of Parliament concurring, and inforcing the ſame: And yet what is already done, is more then any of the Kings Predeceſſors ever had in their poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſecond Prerogative was a definitive power in point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and worſhip. For it is enacted, that all Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">32. H. 8. ca. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Declarations, Decrees, Definitions, Reſolutions, and Ordinances according to Gods word, and Chriſts Goſpell, by the Kings adviſe, and confirmation, by Letters Patents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great Seale, at any time hereafter made, and publiſhed by the Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, and Doctors, now appointed by the King or the whole Clergy of England, in matters of the Chriſtian faith, and lawfull rights and ceremonies of the ſame, ſhall be by the People fully beleeved and obeyed under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties therein comprized: Provided that nothing be done contrary to the Lawes, and Statutes of this Realme.</hi> A Law of a new birth, and not an old Law newly revived, or reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This the preſent occaſion, and the naturall conſtitution of the Law do fully manifeſt: The occaſion was the preſent
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52042:119"/>
Perplexity of the People, for in ſtead of the Statute, <hi>Ex offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> which was now taken away,<note place="margin">25 H. 8. ca. 14.</note> the ſix articles commonly called the ſix ſtringed whip was gotten into power by a more legall and effectuall originall. The Parliament had heard the cries of the People concerning this, and having two things to eye at once; one to provide for the Peoples liberty,<note place="margin">31 H. 8. ca. 14.</note> and further ſecurity againſt forrain pretentions; the other (which was more difficult) for the liberties of the conſciences of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of men of ſeverall opinions (which could not agree in one judgement, and by diſcord might make way for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> party to recover its firſt ground) and finding it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to hunt both games at once, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe themſelves were divided in opinion, and the bone once caſt amongſt them might put their own co-exiſtence to the queſtion, and partly becauſe the worke would be long, require much debate, and retard all other affaires of the Common-wealth, which were now both many, and weighty. In this troubled wave they therefore wiſely determine to hold on their courſe in that worke which was moſt properly theirs, and lay before them: And as touching this matter concerning doctrine, they agreed in that wherein they could agree, <hi>Viz.</hi> To refer the matter to the King and Perſons of skill in that miſtery of Religion, to ſettle the ſame for the preſent till the Parliament had better leiſure, the People more light, and the mindes of the People more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the way. Thus the Eſtates and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the People for the preſent muſt indure, <hi>In depoſito</hi> of the King and other Perſons, that a kind of <hi>Interim</hi> might be compoſed, and the Church for the preſent might enjoy a kind of twilight rather then lye under continuall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and by waiting for the Sun riſing be in a better prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereunto. For the words of the Statute are, that all muſt be done without any partiall reſpect or affection to the Papiſticall ſort or any other ſect or ſects whatſoever. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this agreement both parties were inclined by diverſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards. For the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> though having the poſſeſſion yet being doubtfull of their ſtrength to hold the ſame, if it came
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52042:120"/>
to the puſh of the Pike, in regard that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons wanted faith, as the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> was pleaſed to ſay, in the Houſe of Lords; and that liberty of conſcience was then a pleaſing Theame, as wel as libertie of Eſtates, to all the People. Theſe men might therefore truſt the King with their intereſts, having had long experience of his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: And therefore as ſupream Head, they held him moſt meete to have the care of this matter, for ſtill this title brings on the Vann of all theſe Acts of Parliament. On the other ſide, that party that ſtood for reformation, though they began to put up head, yet not aſſured of their owne Power, and being ſo exceedingly oppreſſed with the ſix Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as they could not expect a worſe condition, but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babililty might finde a better; they therefore alſo caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the King,<note place="margin">Sleyden, lib. <hi>9.</hi> Ann. <hi>1535.</hi>
                  </note> who had already been well baited by the <hi>German</hi> Princes, and Divines, and the outcries of his owne People, and poſſibly might entertain ſome prejudice at length at that manner of woſhip that had its originall from that Arch enemy of his Head-ſhip of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Nor did the iſſue fall out altogether unſutable to theſe expectations: For the King did ſomewhat to unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle what was already done, and abated in ſome meaſure the flame and heat of the Statute, although nothing was eſtabliſhed in the oppoſite thereto, but the whole reſted much upon the diſpoſition of a King ſubject to change.</p>
               <p>As touching the conſtitution of this Law; that alſo ſhewes that this was not derived from the ancient right of the Crowne now reſtored, but by the poſitive conceſſion of the People in their repreſentative, in regard it is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but qualified and limited diverſly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this power is given to this King, not to his ſucceſſors, for they are left out of the act, ſo as they truſted not the King; but <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and what they did was for his owne ſake.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they truſted the King, but he muſt be adviſed by Councell of men of Skill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they muſt not reſpect any ſect, or thoſe of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſticall ſort.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:52042:120"/>Fourthly, all muſt be according to Gods Word, and Chriſts Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, nothing muſt be done contrary to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm. And thus though they truſted much, yet not all, nor over long. For it was but a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Law, and during the preſent condition of affaires. Nor did the King or People reſt upon this Law, for within three yeares following, another Law is made to confirme what was then already done by the King; and a larger power granted to the King, to change, and alter,<note place="margin">34. &amp; 35. H. 8. cap. 1.</note> as to his Wiſdome ſhall ſeeme convenient. Thus the Kings injunctions already ſet forth were eſtabliſhed, all oppoſall to them inhibited, and the King hath a power of Lawing, and Unlawing in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdome, and to ſtab an Act of Parliament in matters of higheſt concernment: And the reaſon is, the King will have it ſo and who dares gain-ſay it, as <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſaid, the King loves his Queene well but his own opinion better,<note place="margin">Antiq. Britt.</note> for new things meeting with new love, if it be once interrupted in the firſt heat, turnes into a diſpleaſure as hot as the firſt love, nor had either party great cauſe to boaſt in their gainings; for none of them all had any ſecurity, but ſuch as kept cloſe to a good conſcience.</p>
               <p>All this, though much more then any of his Predeceſſors ever attained, was nevertheleſſe not enough till his Title was as compleat. The Pope had faſhioned him one now above twenty yeares old for his ſervice done againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and others of that way, and ſent it to him as a Trophee of the victory, this was <hi>Defender of the faith,</hi> which the King then took kindly, but laid it up till he thought he had deſerved it better; and therefore now he preſents it to the Parliament,<note place="margin">35 H. 8. c. 3.</note> who by a Statute annexed it to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver now made triple by the Royallizing of that of <hi>Ireland</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt.</p>
               <p>A third Prerogative concerned the Kings Power in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters, and now muſt <hi>England</hi> look to it ſelfe, for never had <hi>Engliſh</hi> King the like advantage over his people as this man had. His Title out-faced all queſtion: Left rich by
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52042:121"/>
his Father, trained up in the higheſt way of Prerogative, abſolute Lord of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy and of their Intereſt in the People, of a vaſt ſpirit, able to match both the <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>French</hi> abroad, and yet more buſie at home then all his Predeceſſors. A King that feared nothing but the falling of the Heavens; the People contrarily weary of civill Wars enamored with the firſt taſtes of Peace, and Pleaſure; whiles as yet it was but in the bluſhing child-hood, overaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſtrange Giant, a King with a Pope in his belly; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the temporall Sword in his Hand the ſpirituall Sword at his command. Of a mercileſſe ſavage nature, but a word and a blow; without regard even of his boſome companions, what can then the naked relation of a Subject do with ſuch an one, if providence ſteps not in and ſtops not the Lions mouth, all wil be ſoon ſwallowed up into the hungry maw of Prerogative. To ſet all on work comes <hi>Steven Gardiner</hi> from his Embaſſage to the Emperor, ſad apprehenſions are ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the motions abroad are exceeding violent and ſudden, that the Emperor and <hi>French</hi> King are faſt in nothing but in change according to occaſion, that like the Eagle they make many points before they ſtoop to the prey. That if the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at home do wait upon debates of Parliament, things muſt needs come ſhort in execution and the affaires of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extreamly ſuffer. A dangerous thing it is that the King ſhould be at diſadvantage either with the Emperour or <hi>French</hi> King for want of power in theſe caſes of ſuddaine exegencies, and for ſome ſmall time, during the juncture of theſe importent affaires, that ſeeing likewiſe at home the point concerning Religion is comming to the Teſt, the mindes of men are at a gaze; their affections, and paſſions are on their tiptoes. Its reaſon the King ſhould ſteare with a ſhorter Rudder, that this care might meete with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turne of providence, which otherwiſe might ſuddainly blow up the Peace, and good Government of this Nation. Theſe and the like repreſented a faire face to that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and made way for the King without ſhame to ask what no King before him ſuffered ever to enter into conceit,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:52042:121"/>
I meane a Legiſlative power to this effect, That Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by the greater part of the King for the time being and his Councell, whoſe names hereafter follow,<note place="margin">31 H. 8: ca. 8.</note> with ſuch penalties as by them ſhall be thought meet; ſhall be of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall force to an Act of Parliament, provided it ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to forfeiture of Eſtates, or Priviledges; nor to loſſe of Life (but in caſes particularly mentioned in the Law) provided no Proclamation ſhall croſſe any Statute or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or laudable Cuſtome of this Realme: All which at length comes to be demanded by a formall Bill with as ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored a preface as the matter it ſelf, which was much worſe ere it was well licked in the Houſe of Commons, and when all was done proved a Bare ſtill: Whatever it was it paſſed in manner above ſaid, neither much to the deſire of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that ſo much was given; nor to the good liking of the King that there was no more: For in ſtead of a Legiſlative power which he graſped at for himſelf, he received it in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with his Councell; and ſo becomes ingaged neither to alter nor deſtroy that Brother-hood, if he intended to reape any fruit of this Law, leaving the point in doubt whither his gaine or loſſe was the greater. For this Law thus made for this King, theſe Councellors, and theſe times, and occaſions, can be no preſident to the future, unleſſe to informe Kings that the Parliament hath a power to give more Authority and prerogative to Kings then they or the Crowne have by common right, and to give it with ſuch limitations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, as ſeemeth good to them.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, that even <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth acknowledged that the Legiſlative power was not in the Crown, nor was the Crowne capable thereof, otherwiſe then it was conferred by the Parliament. Onely <hi>Steven Gardiner</hi> might glory in this atcheivement, having for the preſent obtained much of his ends by perſwading the King that forrain Princes eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from him, not ſo much for his departure from the Pope, as for ſome apprehenſions they had of his departure from that way of Religion, and Worſhip, which they apprehend every Chriſtian ought to maintaine. And therefore if he
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52042:122"/>
meaned to gaine better correſpondency amongſt theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he muſt ingage more reſolvedly to the fundamentalls of the Worſhip, though he ſhook of ſome ſleighter ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſupremacy, for he knew that they were willing enough with the later, though the other could not go downe with them; thus did forraine correſpondency float above, when as the Church as then it ſtood was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and gave the tincture to every wave. And it was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den more ſafe by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> party to truſt the King (thus attempered) with the legiſlative power in the Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then the rough Parliament, whoſe Courſe ſteered quite wide from the <hi>Roman</hi> ſhore, as if they never meant to look that way any more, though <hi>Cranmer</hi> and the cheif Officers of State, and of the Houſhold, were by the Law Judges of the matter in fact as well as the King, yet in the concluſion the King only was of the <hi>Quorum</hi>; all this yet further appears in the penalty, for by a Proviſor it is moderated as to all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures of Life, Limb, or Eſtate; and in the concluſion extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to Fine and Impriſonment; unleſſe in ſome caſes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and excepting offences againſt Proclamations made by the King or his Succeſſors concerning Crimes of Hereſie. For it is the firſt clauſe of any poſitive Law that ever inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated any power in the King of ſuch Cogniſance and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Hereſie; too weake a principle it is to ſettle a prerogative in the King, and his Succeſſors, as ſupream head of the Church, thus by a ſide winde to carry the keyes of Life and Death at their girdle, and yet a better ground cannot I find for the martyrdome of diverſe brave Chriſtians in thoſe times, then this touch of a Law glancing by: All which paſſing, <hi>Sub ſilentio,</hi> and the Parliament taking no notice thereof, made way for the Statute 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. ca. 26. Formerly mentioned to come more boldly upon the Stage.</p>
               <p>This was one wound to the legiſlative power of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament thus to divide the ſame: Another enſues that in its conſequence was no leſſe fatall to that power which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and it was wrought by ſome Engine that well ſaw
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52042:122"/>
that the diſeaſe then ſo called grew to be epidemicall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the more conſiderable party in the Kingdome; that the Lady <hi>Jane Seymor</hi> (now Queene) was no freind to the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>; that ſhe was now with child, which if a Sonn (as it proved to be) was like to be Succeſſor in the Throne, and be of his Mothers Religion, and ſo undoe all, as in the iſſue all came ſo to paſſe: To prevent this, nevertheleſſe they fancy a new conceit, that Lawes made by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings in their minority are leſſe conſiderately done, then being made in riper yeares. And ſo by that one opinion countenanced a worſe, which was, that the Legiſlative power depended more upon the judgment of the King, then the debates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of the Parliament; a notion that would down excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well with Kings; eſpecially with ſuch an al-ſufficient Prince as <hi>Henry</hi> the eight conceived himſelf to be; upon this ground a Law is made to enable ſuch of the Kings Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, by him appointed, as ſhall be under the age of twenty and foure yeares, when Lawes by him are made,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 17.</note> to adnull the ſame by Letters, Patents, after ſuch Prince ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſaid age of twenty foure yeares. Thus the Armes of the Parliament are bound from ſettling any Reformation, let them intend it never ſo much; a Muſe is left open for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion ſtill to get in, when the Seaſon proves more faire. The Parliament was now in its minority, and gives occaſion to the Reader to bewaile the infirmities of the excellency of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A fourth advance of Prerogative concerned the executive Power in the Government of the Church. <hi>This had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly much reſted in the Prelacy, and that upon the cheife Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſſimo at Rome; now there is found in England a Prelater then he; the Pope was already heheaded, and his head ſet upon the Kings ſhoulders: To him it is given to nominate all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Arch-Biſhops within his dominions, by long deſire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>and that the party once elected ſhall ſweare fealty, and then ſhall be conſecrated by Commiſſion, and inveſted, but if upon the long deſire, no election be certified within twelve dayes the King ſhal by Commiſſion cauſe his own Clerke to be conſecrated and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:52042:123"/>
The occaſion that firſt brought in this Preſident, was the acceſſe of <hi>Cranmer</hi> to the See at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for though the head-ſhip had beene already by the ſpace of two yeares tranſlated from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and yet the courſe of <hi>Epiſcopizing</hi> continued the ſame as formerly it had beene. I mean as touching the point of Election: For though in their originall, Biſhops were meerely Donatives from the Crowne, being inveſted by delivery of the Ring and paſtoral ſtaffe, and untill King <hi>Johns</hi> time,<note place="margin">

St. <hi>Carl.</hi> 25 E. 3. <hi>De Provis.</hi> 13 R. 2. ca 2.</note> the Canonicall way of Election was diſallowed, yet King <hi>John</hi> by his Charter, <hi>De communi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſu Baronum</hi> granted that they ſhould be eligible, which alſo was confirmed by diverſe publique Acts of Parliament in after times; and now by this Law laſt recited, and with this way the King was contented for the ſpace of ſix yeares, for the Reformation intended by the King, was not done at once but by degrees; and therefore though this courſe of long deſire was brought into uſe, yet the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being of ſix yeares continuance (a neceſſary thing in times of ſo great change of policy) began this courſe of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. vit. Cranmer.</note> by giving the King Power to nominate, and allowing of the Pope Power to grant to ſuch his Bulls or Pall at his owne will; otherwiſe they ſhould be conſecrated by Commiſſion without his conſent, &amp; this at the firſt, the Popes concurrence was not excluded, though his Negative was. In this poſture of Affaires comes <hi>Cranmer</hi> to be conſecrated Arch-Biſhop: And being nominated therunto by the King, the wily Pope know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings aime, meaned not to withſtand, leaſt he ſhould looſe all, but granted the Pall as readily as it was deſired, ſo as <hi>Cranmer</hi> is thus far Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> without all exception: yet he muſt go one ſtep further, and take the old oath to the Pope which the King allowed him to do, <hi>Pro more,</hi> and which he did, <hi>Renitente conſcientia,</hi> ſay ſome, and with a <hi>ſalvo,</hi> ſay others, and all affirme, it was done, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functoriè,</hi> like ſome worne Ceremony, or civill Complement. Nevertheleſſe it was not ſo ſoone turned over, the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop loved not the Office, the King loved no partnorſhip in this matter; and it was evident to all that no man could
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52042:123"/>
ſerve theſe two Maſters any longer, an agreement is ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in Parliament to exclude the Popes Power quite out of this game, <hi>and all is left to be done by the King and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, by the Law formerly propounded. In all this the Pope is the looſer, the Engliſh Clergy the ſavers, for the Pall coſt Cranmer nine hundred markes.</hi> And the Crown is the great gainer; for hereby the King got the men ſure to him, not onely by their own acknowledgment and ſubmiſſion, but alſo by a Statute Law.</p>
               <p>And laſtly by Oath, which to make ſure was treble twined, once upon their firſt ſubmmiſſion in the Kings twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſecond yeare, when they had beene under <hi>Premuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, ſoone after the deceaſe of Queene <hi>Katherine Dowager,</hi> in the twenty ſixth yeare, which Oath was more compleat then the former; containing,</p>
               <p>Firſt, A Renunciation of all fealty to the Pope or any ſorraine Power.</p>
               <p>Secondly, an obligation to adheare to the cauſe of the King and his Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a diſavowing of the Pope, otherwiſe then as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhop or fellow Brother.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, an ingagement to obſerve all Lawes already e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed againſt the Popes Power.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, A diſavowing of all appeales to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, an ingagement to informe the King of all Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, or Bulls, ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, An ingagement not to ſend, or be privy to the ſending of any meſſage to <hi>Rome</hi> for any ſuch purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The third oath was that of fealty, which anciently was due to Kings, and now revived to be taken by all Biſhops upon their admiſſion. And thus the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelacy, having beene ſworn ſlaves to the Papacy ever ſince <hi>Beckets</hi> time, are now preferred to a more Royall ſervice, and the perſuit by Kings after their right being laid a ſide by the ſpace of 300. yeares, is now renued, and the prey ſeiſed upon by the Lion, we found it upon a better title, and in better condition
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52042:124"/>
by much then when at the firſt it was loſt, for it was upon ſom ſemblance of reaſon that the Arch-Biſhop and Clergy gained it, but being afterwards diſpoſſeſſed thereof by the Pope, and yet without any other ſhadow of Title, but the Power of his own gripe, for the preſent he is the occupant, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Proprietor by preſcription: Till now the felon appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, the ſtolne goods are the Kings in right, and by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter, whereunto the Parliament were by the Statute ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their conveiance, eſtabliſhes the ſame by an unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Title; nevertheleſſe their ſervice is no leſſe ſervile to this Crown then it had beene to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Miter; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they aſſerted the Popes infallibility, now the Kings ſupremacy. They are now called by the King, made by the King, ſent by the King, maintained by the King, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, whatſoever they have, all is the Kings: He makes Biſhops,<note place="margin">31 H. 8. c. 9.</note> he makes new Biſhop-ricks; and divides or compounds the old as he pleaſeth, by a power given to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth by Parliament, which oath was never in any Prince before or after him that I can finde; ſo as the Crown had it not, but the man, and it died with him.</p>
               <p>The King thus loaden with Power, and Honour, above all his Predeceſſors (if without proportionable maintenance to ſupport the one, and act the other) muſt needs conſume himſelf (as one in a Tympany) by growing great: For though he was left rich by his Fathers Treaſure, yet his Zeale to <hi>Rome</hi> in its now Poor captived condition under the Imperiall power, ſtirring up in him great underrakings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad (beſides his own pleaſures and gallantry at home) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted that, and doubtleſſe had ſtarved theſe his grand deſignes, had he not found the hidden Treaſures of the Cells and Monaſtries; the ſight whereof ſo rouzed up his Spirits, that he adventured upon the purchaſe, though he knew diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties enough to have ſtopped his undertakings, if he had not reſolved, both againſt feare and flattery. It was not done without deliberation, for the thing was felt as a greivance before the <hi>Norman</hi> times, and complained of in Parliament above a hundred and forty years ago, and diverſe times ſince,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52042:124"/>
but Kings either underſtood not, or beleeved not, or durſt not give remedy, or had much elſe to do. But now the King is beyond all his Predeceſſors, he knowes much, dares do more, and is at leiſure, he will go as far as Emperour or <hi>French</hi> King, and beyond them alſo, but would not try ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries with either, for they were all Cocks of the game.</p>
               <p>The firſt occaſion that diſcovered the wroke feaſible, was a preſident made by Cardinall <hi>Woolſie,</hi> whoſe Power was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſſolve ſome petty Cells, and no oppoſition made. The King might well expect the worke would be as lawfull for him, and not much more difficult, or if any ſtormes enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the People that had ſo long complained, and felt the burthen of theſe excreſcences of the Clergy, would ſoon find out a way to Calme them, the King need do no more then ſpeake, and the people will do. This opened the doore, but that which brought the King in, was the hold the Pope had in this Kingdome by theſe Cloyſtered People, who were perſons dead in Law, and dead to all Law but the Canon; and upon this account the Kings Anceſtors had poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Cells in the hands of Forrainers in times of War, and now a deadly feud is ſtirred betweene <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth and the Pope their holy Father; the Children cannot expect to thrive, when as their Father is caſt out of doores; and ſo all muſt out together: yet the manner is obſervable, they muſt not be caſt out, but muſt go out; the inferiour and greater part are dead perſons, have learnt obedience, they can neither bark nor bite, and therefore they may ſleep, and what is don muſt be don with ſuch of them as are alive. Upon a Viſitation theſe are brought under the Teſt, and found in ſuch a condition that they had better give way, and voluntarily ſurrender, then abide the triall:<note place="margin">27 H. 8. c. 27.</note> Once more the ſmalleſt are picked out whiles the greater ſtand by and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but either do not foreſee, or (in diſpaire of altering the Kings reſolution) do nothing but expect the ſad hour, which within four yeares comes upon them all;<note place="margin">31 H. 8. c. 13.</note> every one of them chooſing rather to ſurrender, and expect the Kings mercy for maintenance during life, then adventure againſt the dint
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52042:125"/>
of his Juſtice, and Power, and ſo looſe all; for they were ill befreinded amongſt all ſorts of the People. Thus came the perſonall Eſtate and Stock of theſe Houſes to the Kings im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Treaſury, and their yearly maintenance to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the Crowne, which might have advanced the ſame, well nigh to the value of two hundred thouſand pounds yearly, but that the King intended to let the People enjoy the fat as well as he, that they might be mutually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to maintain hold of the prey that they had joyntly gotten. Out of all which nevertheleſſe the Crowne had a ſmall rent, or ſervice annuall, for the acknowledgement of their tenure beſides, the firſt fruits of the ſpirituall dignities, and the tenths,<note place="margin">26 H. 8. c. 23.</note> both which he formerly had already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>The firſt whereof was but caſuall, and occaſionall in the payment, ariſing onely at the entrance of the party into his promotion; and which was gained by the Pope from <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the firſt,<note place="margin">Fox. Mart. fol. <hi>322.</hi>
                  </note> although at his Parliament at <hi>Carleile,</hi> in his thirty fourth yeare he withſtood the ſame: This was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three hundred and twenty thouſand pounds in the whole ſumm. The later was annuall, and amounted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty thouſand pounds: And thus the Popes Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are turned into duties to the Crowne, but were much leſſened in regard that theſe Cells and Monaſtries were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted amongſt theſe Eccleſiaſticall promotions, which by their diſſolution fell off in that account. Nevertheleſſe the advancement that might by a parcimonious King have beene made of the fall of this Ceder, was ſuch, that the Crowne might have been rendred of it ſelf abſolute and al-ſufficient. But <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth was not thus minded, the affairs of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> were gotten into a high pitch; Princes generally over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; <hi>Henry</hi> the eight inferior to none of them; what comes in goes out, and he is a rare example of that Divine proverb; <hi>As Riches increaſe, ſo doe the mouths of them that eate</hi>; he ſtill ſtands in need of his Peoples Love, Purſes, and Power; ſo Divine <hi>providence orders the matter,</hi> that Kings can never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine further end of their undertakings without the aide of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52042:125"/>
the people, then their labour, leaſt they ſhould be too big to be Chriſtians, and the people too mean.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII. Of the Condition of the Parliament in theſe Times.</head>
               <p>THey are no good Expoſitors that conſider their Text by peice-meale onely, nor they good Hiſtorians, that will tell you the bare journall of Action, without the <hi>Series</hi> of occaſion: ſuch as theſe will ſpeak much of the Actions of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, what advancement he brought to the Crown, and make it a compleat Monarchy, wherein the King may Act what he reſolveth; reſolve what he pleaſeth; and pleaſe what he luſteth; when as in truth, the thing is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo: for though many of his actions, in relation to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, cannot be juſtified by any Law; ſo in truth, did they never proceed from any Law, but meerly from the paſſion or will of the man, and connivance of the people, who could bear that from this King, that their Anceſtors would never endure under any other. And yet in all the Grand concernments of the Nation, the Law kept ſtill upon the top, nor did the King enter into any Competition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, or lead the way thereunto, other then by eſpeciall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>For firſt, its evident, though the King was Supream Head of the Church, yet this was not like the head of a mad man, led by phaney without the Law of reaſon, or reaſon of Law; But it was defined, circumſcribed, and formed thereby, with Qualifications and Limitations, as hath been already expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is no leſſe cleare that the Legiſlative Power reſted in the Parliament, and not in the King, when he was in his greateſt height; for as head of the Church, he had no
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52042:126"/>
ſuch power in Church matters, or if he had ſuch a right, it was taken away by the Acts of Parliament; nay, when the Pope was yet poſſeſſed of this Headſhip, the Parliament did determine the manner of the Worſhip of God, in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſes, as in the keeping of the Lords Day, the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth,<note place="margin">4 Edw. 4.</note> to the honour of God did provide for the obſerving thereof, and to the honour of God, it was taken away by a Statute in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,<note place="margin">15 H. 8. c. 9.</note> if the words of either Statute may be beleived. But more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,<note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 19.</note> after that this Headſhip was tranſlated to the King, the Parliament provided, that the Canons ſhould be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and allowed by the King, and thirty two Perſons, one part of the Clergy, the other of the Temporalty, choſen by the King. And thoſe that ſhall be aſſented unto and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the King, and the thirty two Perſons, or the major part of them ſhall be obeyed, and put in execution, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue ſhall be void: <hi>Provided nothing ſhall be done contrary to the Kings Prerogative, or the Lawes and Cuſtomes of this Realm</hi>: So as the King had much, but he had not all; and what he had, the Parliament gave him by a Law, that was Executory all the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,<note place="margin">27 H. 8. c. 15. 35 H. 8. c. 16.</note> by divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuances, and was not any power devolved to the Crowne, under the Title of Supremacy, nor by Vertue of the Act of Parliament concerning it, but by the continuall influence from the Parliament upon the Crown, as well before that Act as after, derived upon it. The King hath then this right of Law making, but it is with the thirty two he hath it, but not his Succeſsors.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, he hath it but by a derivative power from the Parliament, and as a Committee for that ſervice: and in a word, he hath the Power, but the Parliament hath ſtill the Law of that Power.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Priviledge of the Parliament hitherto, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth onely Lawes concerning Church-government. In the next place commeth to be conſidered the Legiſlative Power in point of Doctrine, which doubtleſs iſſueth from the ſame principle of Power with the former. For if the Church
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52042:126"/>
(which as a pillar and ground holdeth forth the truth) be the company of profeſſing Beleevers; then ought it not ſeem ſtrange if theſe in their repreſentative do intermeddle with this Power, or rather duty; and for the matter in fact, neither did the King challenge this power, nor did the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament make any difficulty of Conſcience in executing the ſame, and yet there were many Learned and Conſciencious men of that number.</p>
               <p>They therefore, as touching the doctrine, proceed in the ſame way, with that formerly mentioned concerning the diſcipline: And a Committee alſo is by them made of the King and Learned men, to ſet down rules for Faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and for the order of the publique Worſhip of God,<note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 26.</note> according to the word of God; and theſe rules are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a Statute, ſo as the King hath a power in the point of Doctrine, but it is a derivative power, it is a limited pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to himſelf and not to his Succeſſors, and to himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers joyned with him.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, nothing muſt be done contrary to the Lawes of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Parliament hath not onely a right to grant and limit this power unto others, but alſo to execute the ſame immediately by it ſelf; and therefore before they granted this power to this Committee, whereas formerly the Pope uſurped the power to be the <hi>Omega</hi> to the reſolves of all Councills, the Parliament intercepted that to their own ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in flat oppoſition to the infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chaire,<note place="margin">5 H. 8. cap. 14.</note> ſo farr as to Diſherize ſome opinons which by the ſentence of that infallible mouth, had beene marked with that black brand of Hereſie. And what they did before this Act of Delegation to the King and other Committees for this worke,<note place="margin">34 H. 8. cap. 1.</note> they did afterwards as not concluding their own power by any thing that they had ſo don as may appear by their Cenſure of the tranſlation of the Bible, made by <hi>Tindall</hi>: By their eſtabliſhing another tranſlation: By their ordering and appointing what perſons might read the ſame:<note place="margin">35 H. 8. cap. 5.</note> By their qualifying the ſix Articles, and the like. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52042:127"/>
then hath a power which they may grant, and yet grant nothing away; they may limit this power in others as they will, and yet not conclude themſelves. And the King by accepting this limited power, muſt diſclaime both the originall and abſolute right, and cannot claime the ſame by right of head-ſhip or ſupremacy. This was one great windfall which the Parliament had from the ruines of <hi>Rome,</hi> not by way of uſurpation but re-ſeiſure, for their poſſeſſion was ancient, and though they had beene diſpoſſeſt, yet that poſſeſſion was ever under a continuall claime, and ſo the right was ſaved.</p>
               <p>A ſecond that was no leſſe fatall unto that See; was the loſſe of all power over Eccleſiaſticall perſons in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: For whereas the Popedome had doubly rooted it ſelf in this Nation, one way by the <hi>Regulars,</hi> the other by the <hi>Seculars</hi>; the Parliament by the diſſolutions of Monaſtries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſumed one to aſhes, and by breaking the fealty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the other and the Pope, parted the other root and the ſtock aſunder, &amp; thence enſued the downfal of this tal Cedar in this Nation; and Prelacy now left alone muſt fawn elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where or lye along, a poſture wherein that rank of men can never thrive: Up againe they peepe, and eſpying a King that loved to towre aloft, they ſuddainely catch hold, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing their help to maintaine his flight, and ſo are carried up, and like a Cloud borne between Heaven and Earth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Commons beholding to them for the Kings Sunn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, and the King for their intereſts in the People, and for his ſuperlative advancement above them all. Now though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelates may thinke their Orbe above the winds, yet were they herein deceived. The Parliament had power in their Election, before the Pope uſurped that to himſelf; now that they are diſcharged, Kings are poſſeſſed of them by long deſire, but it is not by way of reſtitution, for Kings were never abſolutely poſſeſſed of any ſuch power, but as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees of Parliament and by delegation and conceſſion from them, and therefore muſt render an account to them, and abide their judgment when they are thereto called.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:52042:127"/>Thirdly, the Parliament had the diſpoſing and ordering, of all the Church Revenues, as the Lawes concerning Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries, Sanctuaries, Mortuaries, Firſt Fruits, Tenths, Annates, and ſuch like, ſufficiently manifeſteth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Parliament had the power of granting Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Diſpenſations, and Faculties, ſetting a rule thereunto,<note place="margin">21 H. 8. c. 13. 25 H. 8. c. 16. 28 H 8. c. 13.</note> as in caſe of Nonreſidency, and delegating the power to Committees, whereof ſee more in the Chapter following concerning ordinary juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the Parliament reſerved the Cogniſance of all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales for finall ſentence unto themſelves, and diſpoſed of all the ſteps thereunto, as unto them ſeemed moſt convenient:<note place="margin">24 H. 8. c. 12.</note> For though it be true in ſome caſes the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> had the definitive ſentence, and in other Caſes the Convocation, yet was this but by a temporary Law, and this alſo granted to them by the Parliament, which took it away from the Pope, and never intereſted the Crowne therein, but made the Arch-Biſhop and the Convocation their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Delegates ſo long as they ſaw good. Afterwards when they had done their work, <hi>Viz.</hi> The determining the appeal and Divorce of Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> and ſome other matters,<note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 19.</note> the ſame hand that gave that power tooke it away and gave it (not to the King or Crowne) but to Delegates from the Parliament from time to time to be nominated by the King, and may as wel alter the ſame &amp; ſettle the power elſewhere when they pleaſe. And therefore after the appeale of the <hi>Dowager</hi> thus determined, and the ſentence definitive thus ſettled upon Delegates: The Parliament nevertheleſſe determined the other cauſes of the Marriages of the Lady <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> the juriſdiction of the Crown never intermedling therein; ſo as upon the whole, it muſt be acknowledged, that however the King was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame head of cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, yet had not the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſentence in Appeales, nor abſolute Supremacy, but that the ſame was left to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, what attempts the Parliament had met with, partly from the deſignes of ſome great men that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52042:128"/>
ſought their own ends, and partly from the endeavors of theſe Kings that ſought their own heighth and greatneſſe, above their Peoples good, hath beene already related, and the utmoſt iſſue hath beene truly ſtated, <hi>Viz.</hi> That the gaines have come to the Kings Perſons and not to their Crowne, and that therein they have put their Seale to the Law, and made their ſubmiſſion to the Parliament, as touching both their Perſons, and Power. Add hereunto, that however <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth aimed much at himſelf in his ends in two other maine Intereſts that moſt nighly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him, yet the cheife gaine came to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The one concerned his owne Wife, which-however ſo nighly related to him as next to his owne Perſon, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the determination of the immediate Law of God, yet was ſo caſt upon their ſentence, as if he durſt adventure his owne Soule at their direction.</p>
               <p>The other concerned the Crowne, to which he ought rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above his owne perſon, which he laid downe at the feet of the Parliament, ſeeking to their power to fulfill his owne pleaſure: The ball is toſſed up and downe, ſomtimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the iſſue betweene the King and the Lady <hi>Ann Bullen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 22.</note> another while amongſt the iſſue betweene him and the Lady <hi>Jane Seymor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 27.</note> or ſuch as the King ſhould nominate by Letters Patents or laſt Will. After that, to the Ladyes <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">35 H. 8. c. 1.</note> to performe conditions declared by the Kings Letters Patents, or his laſt Will. The King then is truſted, but he hath his truſt from the Parliament, the Crowne is intailed (as it hath beene ever ſince <hi>Richard</hi> the ſeconds time) but it is done by the Parliament: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is in the the Clouds, but the right of inheritance much more. The Concluſion of all is this, the Parliament by ſerving theſe Kings turnes, turned their turnes into their owne.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIX. Of the power of the Clergy, in their Convocation.</head>
               <p>THe Convocation of the Clergy, like ſome froward Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, loves not new dreſſing, though it be a gainer thereby. Before the Pope and <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth were falne aſunder, their maſters, their minds, their work, all was dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; their Councels uncertain, their Concluſions ſlow in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, and ſleight in their Fruit and Conſequence; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſpleaſing to the Pope, ſometimes to the King, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to themſelves; who naturally lingering after their own intereſts, were compelled to feed that body that breathed in them, rather then that wherein themſelves brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed; and ſo like hunted Squirrells, from bough to bough, were ever well tired, yet hardly eſcaped with their owne skins in the concluſion. Now <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth tenders them better conditions, both for eaſe and Honour, and more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their own Intereſt; yet they are loath to accept, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had been ſlaves by preſcription.</p>
               <p>Formerly, they were troubled with multiplicity of <hi>Summons,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſomtimes from the King, ſometimes from the Pope, ſometimes from the Metropolitan, and alwayes overdripped by a Forrain Power, that they could propound nothing for the good of the Souls of themſelves or others, but muſt be blaſted from without; their labours loſt, their undertakings vain, and themſelves, in the concluſion, ſit downe hoaked in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and deſires. Now they are at no mans call,<note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 19.</note> but the Kings, and that <hi>by Writ, both Provinciall,</hi> and <hi>Legate è La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere,</hi> muſt meddle no more.</p>
               <p>Formerly, its taken for granted, that Kings have no Vote <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in matters Eccleſiaſticall, though themſelves be intereſted therein; and therefore if he will accept of a Diſme, he muſt accept it, <hi>Statu quo,</hi> it is granted;<note place="margin">21 E. 4. fol. 46</note> nor can he interpoſe his
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:52042:129"/>
Diſſent, nor do they much care for his Conſent: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King be concerned or not concerned, what they conclude, they muſt maintain, <hi>Vi &amp; Clavibus,</hi> although in right,<note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 19.</note> his Prerogative is above theirs. Now by the Statute, the Kings Vote is aſſerted, and a Negative Vote reſtored, and himſelf made as well Head of the Convocation, as the Church: nothing can paſſe there without his Concurrence, nor come to the Conſideration of the Parliament, without his pleaſure; and thus the King hath a double Vote in every Church Ordinance: One, as in the Parliament, to paſſe the ſame as an Act of Parliament, of which I conceive the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that Honourable Judge is to be underſtood; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſtit.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 323.</note> as a Member of the Convocation, to paſſe their advices to the Parliament; and therefore he might either ſit in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon amongſt them, or by his Vicar, as <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, did by the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi>: By the Firſt, the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was ingaged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By the Second, the Convocation onely, and that as a Court onely, and not the repreſentative of the Clergy, becauſe as they had a Spirituall relation, ſo alſo they had the Common right of Free-men, and therefore could not be bound without the Common conſent of the Free-men.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, as their power of Convention, and power in Vote, ſo their Originall right of Law making, ſuffered a change: formerly they depended wholly upon a Divine right, which ſome ſettled Originally in the Pope; others, in the Prelacy, and ſome in the Clergy: But now they ſit by a derivative power from the Act of Parliament, from which as from their Head, they receive life and power.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, they ſuffered ſome change in the very work of their Convention; for though formerly they claimed power to meddle onely with Eccleſiaſticall matters, yet that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ambiguous, and they could many times explicate it more largely, then naturally. It is not to be denied, but the matters concerning the Service and Worſhip of God, are of Spirituall conſideration, but that ſuch ſhould be ſo ſtrictly deemed, to lie in the way of Church-men onely, is
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52042:129"/>
to bring all Spirits within the Verge of Eccleſiaſticall Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and to leave the Civill power to rule onely dead Carkaſes; much leſſe can any other thing, which by preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath not been of Eccleſiaſticall Cogniſance, be called Spirituall.</p>
               <p>But to come to particulars, becauſe generalls edifie not: The Convocation claimed formerly power, as Originally from it ſelf, to impoſe rules for government upon Church-men, and Church-Officers, and upon the Laity, ſo far as extended to their Service of God: And alſo to charge the Eſtates of the Clergy; and concerning Matrimoniall, and Teſtamentary Cauſes: They claimed alſo a power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Doctrine and Hereſies. Yet <hi>De Facto,</hi> divers of theſe they never acted in that right, wherein they claimed to hold Cogniſance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as touching the charging of the Eſtates of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; If it was for the Kings Service, they were ever ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by the Kings Writt, yet was not their Act binding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the paſſing of the Vote, till the Parliament confirmed the ſame; and therefore the old form of granting of Diſmes, was, <hi>Per Clerum &amp; Communitatem,</hi> as by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Abbot of <hi>Walthams</hi> Caſe appears;<note place="margin">21 E. 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 45.</note> for without their concurrence, they had no power to charge any Free-man, nor to levy the ſame, but by their Church Cenſures, which would ſtand them in no ſtead. And in this, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation ſuffered no alteration, either in right or power, by the change thus wrought by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as touching impoſing Lawes upon the Laity,<note place="margin">20 H. 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 14. <hi>Per Neuton.</hi>
                  </note> in points of Worſhip and Doctrine, its evident, though they claimed ſuch power, they had it not; for when all is done, they were contented at length to get the Support of the Statute-Lawes of this Kingdome, as may appear in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Lawes concerning the Lords Day, and proceedings againſt Heretiques, ſetling the Popedome in the time of the great Sciſme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now all Title of claim is quite taken from them, and all is left in the Supream Legiſlative power of this Nation, as formerly hath been already manifeſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:52042:130"/>Thirdly, as touching Matrimoniall cauſes, their former power of making Lawes concerning them and Teſtamentary cauſes, is now abſolutely taken away; onely concerning Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall matters, they had ſo much of the Judicatory power concerning the ſame put upon them, as might well ſerve the Kings own turn; and that was for determining the matter between himſelf,<note place="margin">24 H. 8. c. 12.</note> and the Lady <hi>Katharine Dowager,</hi> depending before Arch-biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi>: For the King ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Pope, a party; and therefore meaned not that he ſhould be his Judge: And thus, though the Clergy had acknowledged the King to be their Supream Head, yet in this, he was content to acknowledge their Supremacy above him, to judge between himſelf and his Queen, and in other matters concerning himſelf: So as upon the whole matter, the Convocation were gainers in ſome things, in other things, they were onely looſers of that, which was none of their owne.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXX. Of the power of the Clergy, in their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Juriſdiction.</head>
               <p>THoſe Spirits are truely degenerate, that being ſenſible of miſery, cannot ſtir up deſires of change, although the way thereto lies open before them: and this ſhewes the nature of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> yoke, that it lay upon the Spirits of Men, did intoxicate, and make them drunk with their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; otherwiſe the Uſurpations, Oppreſſions, Extortions, and Incroachments of the Popedome, upon the Biſhops Sphear, and the People under their charge, could never have provoked ſuch complaynings amongſt all ſorts, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ages, from time to time. And now that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, undertakes to ſet them free, ſo as they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52042:130"/>
his Supremacy, they all are ſtruck dumb, till a <hi>Premuniri</hi> taught them to ſpeak; and ſo were ſcared into a better condition then they would have had, and into a more abſolute Eſtate of Juriſdiction, then they received from their Predeceſſors. The Pope had now uſurped a power, <hi>ſupra</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary over all Appeals, gained the definitive Sentence to the <hi>Roman See</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had holden this power by the ſpace of foure hundred years, and the King finding the root of all the miſcheif to his Crown from abroad, ſpringing from that Principle, meaned not to diſpute the point with the Caſuiſts, but by one Statute, took away all Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">24 H. 8. c. 12.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined Appeals from the Biſhops Court, in the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Court, and the Appeals from the Arch-Biſhops Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary, in the Court of Audience: So as though in the Kings own Caſe, the Convocation had the laſt blow; yet in matters concerning the Subjects, the Arch-Biſhop was either more worthy, or more willing with that truſt: For though the Convocation might have as well determined all, as well as the Pope; yet for diſpatch ſake of a multitude of Appeals, now depending at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to prevent long attendance on the Convocation, that now had much to doe in matters of more publick nature, the utmoſt Appeal in ſuch Caſes is made Provinciall. This, (whether priviledge or prejudice) the Eccleſiaſticall Cauſes gained above the Civill, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive Sentence was reſerved to the Parliament. And thus is the Arch-Biſhop made Heire to the Pope, in the greateſt priviledge of a Pope, to be chief Judge on Earth in matters Eccleſiaſticall, within his own Province. A trick that in my opinion much darkened the Glory of the Kings Title of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Head, which the Church-men had formerly offered up to the Honour of the Crown of this Realm. For be it ſo, that the Title is in the Crown by Remitter: yet cannot the ſame carry along with it any more then a lawfull power, and whether all the Popes former power allowed him by the Canon, or gained by Uſurpation and Cuſtome, ſhall be ſaid a lawfull power, or whether the power of Review by Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, ſhall be derived to the Crown, under the generall
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52042:131"/>
Notion of Supremacy upon the Clergies ſubmiſſion, is to me a doubt (albeit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſtit.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 344.</note> 
                  <hi>I muſt give Honour to the Judgement in Print)</hi> in regard that after the ſubmiſſion of the Clergy, the matter concerning the Divorce of the Lady <hi>Katharine Dowager,</hi> came before the Pope by Appeal, and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the King himſelf alſo, waiting upon that <hi>See</hi> for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and a definitive Sentence in that matter, and thereby acknowledged the Popes power, <hi>De facto</hi>: Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Clergies foregoing ſubmiſſion, and being occaſioned by the delay at <hi>Rome,</hi> he procured this Statute concerning Appeals to be made, whereby at one breath he took the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to <hi>Rome</hi> away, and ſettled them as formerly hath been mentioned; all which was done two years before the Title of Supremacy was annexed, or declared for to be to the Crown, by Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>And therfore, as to me it appears, the power of ſupream Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of appeals was not in actuall poſſeſſion of the Crown by the Clergies ſubmiſſion; ſo was it actually veſted in the Arch-Biſhop, before the Title of Supremacy was confirmed by Act of Parliament; and ſo it never was in the Crowne actually poſſeſſed, much leſſe had the Crown the ſame by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter: For the Kings turn once ſerved by the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the matter of the Divorce of Queen <hi>Katharine</hi> ſettled, the King perceiving the ſlow Progreſſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, the Members of the ſame not being yet ſufficiently tuned to the preſent Affairs: And moderate Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> likewiſe foreſeeing, that the <hi>Odium</hi> of theſe Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Sentences would be too great for him to bear; another Appeal is provided, more for the Honour of the Crown, to be from the Arch-Biſhop to <hi>Delegats,</hi> to be appointed by the King, his Heirs, and Succeſſors, ſo as though their Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the Kings, yet their power is deduced immediately from the Parliament, which took the ſame from the Arch-Biſhop, and conferred it upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 19.</note>A ſecond advantage not inferiour hereto, which the Arch-Biſhop gained out of the ruines of the Popedome, was the power of Licenſes, and Diſpenſations, or Faculties. In the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52042:131"/>
Pope, it was a tranſcendent power without any rule, but what was tuned to him by the Bird in his own breaſt; and was the ground of much licenſe, or rather licentiouſneſſe in the World: But in the Arch-Biſhop, they ſeem to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
               <p>To be Firſt,<note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 21.</note> in Cauſes not repugnant to the Law of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuch as are neceſſary for the Honour, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the King.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſuch as were formerly wont to be remedied at the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; yet in truth, left as much ſcope for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Arch-Biſhop to walk in, as the Pope had in former times; a large Teather, and greater priviledge then ever the Crown had; by which, although the King himſelf be like <hi>Saul,</hi> higher by the head, then all the People, yet in many things <hi>Samuel</hi> is higher then he. The moving cauſe hereof, is not difficult to find out: the King had but lately married the Lady <hi>Anne Bullen</hi>; a thing that many ſtartled at, and the King himſelf not extreamly reſolved in; he would therfore have his way like that of the Zodiack, broad enough for Planetary motion of any one that could not contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within the Eccliptick line of the Law, and ſo ſhipped over the Popes power to the Chair of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and had made a Pope, in ſtead of an Arch-Biſhop, but that the man was not made for that purpoſe. What the Ordinary Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction got, or loſt wee come in the next place to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they had ſtill their Courts and Judiciary power, but upon what right, may be doubted: Their firſt foundation was laid by the Civill power of a Law, in the time of <hi>William</hi> the firſt <hi>Norman</hi> King; yet the power of the Pope and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop growing up together, they came to hold the Power of the Keyes by a Divine right, and ſo continued, untill theſe times of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, wherein they have a <hi>Retroſpect</hi> to the Rock, from whence they were firſt hewen; and many ſeem to change their Tenure, and therewith therefore are in right to change the Style of their Courts, and Title of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52042:132"/>
but the times not being very curious and the worke of Reformation but in <hi>fieri</hi>; the more exact lineaments muſt be left to time to finiſh and beautifie. A greater blow did light upon the Lawe of theſe Courts, which was left as doubtfull as the Canons; all which are now put to the queſtion, and to this day never received full reſolution, but were left to the Parliament to determine them at leiſure; and in the meane time to the Judges of the common Law, to determine the ſame Lawfull or Unlawfull, as occaſion ſhould require: Nevertheleſſe the Courts ſtill hold on their courſe according to their old Lawes, and Cuſtomes, for their forme of proceedings, ſome ſay by preſcription, yet more rightly by permiſſion; it being a difficult matter to make preſcription hold againſt a Statute Law: As touching the matters within their Cogniſance the Law ſettled ſome, and unſettled others.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as touching <hi>Hereſie,</hi> the Church-men formerly thought ſcorne the Lay Magiſtrate ſhould intermeddle, but not being able to ſtop the growth thereof by their Church-Cenſures, prayed aid of the Civill Magiſtracy; ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees aroſe the penalties of Impriſonment, and burning, which brought the whole matter into Cogniſance before the Civill Magiſtrate, becauſe no Free-man might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt, for loſſe of Life or Liberty, but by the Lawes of the Nation;<note place="margin">Mag. Cart.</note> and for this cauſe the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate granted the Writ of <hi>Habeas corpus,</hi> and releived many times the party Impriſoned wrongfully or granted prohibition as they ſaw cauſe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſtit.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 42.</note> And therefore it cannot be ſaide rightly, that the ſole or ſupreame Cogniſance of this Crime of Hereſie belonged to the Clergy before theſe times. Nor did their proceedings upon the Writ of Burning War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant any ſuch thing, partly becauſe till theſe times the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law was the beſt ground that theſe proceedings had, and the courſe therein was not ſo Uniforme as to permit the Title of a Cuſtome to warrant the ſame: Conviction being ſometimes by jury, ſometimes according to the Canon, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before the Ordinary, ſometimes before the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52042:132"/>
ſometimes before the King, ſometimes before ſpeciall Delegates, as the Hiſtories of the Martyrs more particularly ſet forth, and no Act of Parliament poſitive in the point. But the time is now come when nigheſt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that the thing is ſettled more to the prejudice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation then all the endeavoures foregoing; like to the darkneſſe of the night, that is at the Superlative degree when nigheſt break of Day. A Statute is now made, that indeed quite blotted out the very name of the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>De haeretico comburendo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 14.</note> but made compleat that Statute of 5 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. and the other of 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. both which were formerly neither good in Law, nor effectuall, otherwiſe then by Power; and gave more ſettlement to the Ordinaries proceedings in ſuch Caſes: For the Delinquent might be convict before the Ordinary by Witneſſes, or might be indicted at the Common Law, and the indictment cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to the Ordinary as Evidence: yet did the Parliament carve them out their work; and in expreſſe words declared, That opinions againſt the Authority and Laws of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> were not Hereſie, and by the ſame reaſon might have done more of that kind, but that was enough to tell all the World that the Parliament could define what was not Hereſie, although they did not then determine what was Hereſie: And thus the judgment of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church is called into queſtion in one of their fundamentals, and the Clergy left in a Muſe, concerning the rule upon, which they were to proceed againſt this Crime.</p>
               <p>The Parliament within ſix yeares after, undertakes, though ſomewhat unhappily, to determine and define certain points of Controverſie, which had ſome relation to the Worſhip of God, and the publique Peace, and declared the contrary to theſe determinations to be Hereſie,<note place="margin">31 H. 8. c. 14.</note> and the puniſhment to be Death and Forfeiture, and the triall to be before Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners by Jury or teſtimony of two Witneſſes, or by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the Eccleſiaſticall Court, or inquiſition in the Leete, or Seſſions of the Peace. Upon the whole matter therefore the Ordinary had a particular Power to determine Hereſie;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52042:133"/>
but the Parliament determined ſuch Hereſies as were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable, with Death and Forfeiture, by enumeration in the ſix Articles. This was the Clergies Primmer, wherin they imployed their ſtudy, as making moſt for their deſigne, and laid aſide thoughts of all other Hereſies as drie Notions, or old faſhions laid aſide, and not worthy the ſetting forth to common ſale.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Leſſon concerning <hi>Marriage</hi> was no leſſe difficult for the Clergy to take out: They were put by their former Authority derived from abroad, and their ancient rule of the Canon Law; with the Kings leave they do what they do,<note place="margin">35 H. 8. <hi>Rat. Pat. p.</hi> 15.</note> and where they doubt they take his Commiſſion, ſo did the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> in the Caſe betweene <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Jane Fiſher</hi>; in the Kings Caſe the determining part is put to the Parliaments Concluſion; and for a rule in other Caſes,<note place="margin">15 H. 8. c. 8.</note> ſome perſons are enabled to Marry which formerly were not, <hi>Viz</hi>: Maſters of the Chancery, and Doctors of the Civill Law;<note place="margin">37 H. 8. c. 17.</note> and ſome forbidden Marriage, as all Preiſts by the Statute of the ſix Articles. And unto the reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning degrees of Conſanguinity,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 7. 32 H. 8. c. 38.</note> or Affinity, a particular enumeration is appointed to be obſerved; within which, Marriage is declared unlawfull, all other further off are made lawfull. In all which regards the Cogniſance of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall Cauſes is theirs onely by leave.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Reſidency,</hi> and <hi>Nonreſidency,</hi> was a Theame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly learned from the Canon Law, in which as alſo in the thing it ſelf the Clergy were the onely skilfull men. The rule of the Canon Law was ſtrict enough, conſidering the times, but it was not ſteel to the back. The Parliament now undertakes the cauſe; and though it gave, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, more liberty then the Canon, yet ſtood it better to its tackling, and kept a ſtricter hand upon the reines, then was formerly uſed, and by giving a generall rule for Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,<note place="margin">21 H. 8. c. 13. 25 H. 8. c. 16. 28 H. 8. c. 13.</note> took away all arbitrary Diſpenſations, and Licences, which were formerly granted beyond all rule, but that of Silver or Gold; and made all practiſes contrary to the rule damageable to the party. Thus far concerning the matters
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52042:133"/>
in Cogniſance; now touching the Power of the Keyes, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>

                     <hi>Inſtit.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 40.</note> and of Excommunication in all cauſes Eccleſiaſticall. The common Law would never yeeld this; ſome Statutes in ſome caſes did pretend:</p>
               <p>Firſt, as touching Impriſonment, the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth concerning Hereſie doth liſpe ſome ſuch Power; of what force the ſame Statute is hath been already obſerved,<note place="margin">1 H. 7. cap. 4.</note> in caſe of incontinency of Church-men, it is more directly given them by a Statute in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſevenths time, before which time the Statute it ſelf doth initimate, that an Action did lye againſt them for ſuch impriſonment, which Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb facs="tcp:52042:134"/>
was made uſeleſſe by another in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time, who gave away to Statutes for the puniſhing them at the common Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">31 H. 8. c. 14. 32 H. 8. c. 10.</note>Firſt, with Death, which continued for ſome Months, and that being found too heavy, it was puniſhed by another Law, with Forfeiture and Impriſonment. And the ſame King likewiſe gave way to a law for the like puniſhment in caſe of Hereſie. By that Law that revoked the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth formerly mentioned, although till triall, the ſame was bailable: And thus continued till the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth.</p>
               <p>But as touching Excommunication, it was to no purpoſe for them to ſtruggle, the common Law would never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to hold poſſeſſion quietly; but did examine their Authority,<note place="margin">14 H. 4.14. 30 E. 3. <hi>Aſs.</hi> 19. 22 E. 4. f. 29. <hi>Hil.</hi> 13. H. 7. <hi>pl.</hi> 15. 26 H. 8. c. 3.</note> granted prohibition, enjoyned the Ordinary to grant abſolution where it ſaw cauſe; nevertheleſſe in ſome caſes <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth gives way to ſome Statutes to allow them this power, as in the levying of Tenths. In the next place the Prelacy had not this Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction in themſelves ſo as to grant it to others but the Parliament did diſpoſe thereof, not only to Biſhops but to Chancellors, Vicars generall, Commiſsaries, being Doctors of the Law, and not within holy Orders,<note place="margin">37 H. 8. c. 17.</note> and limiting their juriſdiction in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes concerning the Papall juriſdiction; and their manner of ſending their proceſſe and Citations, to draw men from their proper Dioceſſe,<note place="margin">23 H. 8. c. 9.</note> and alſo their inordinate Fees in caſes Teſtamentary.<note place="margin">21 H. 8. c. 5.</note> The Prelates therefore might poſſibly make great claim hereof, for generally they were ſtill of the old ſtamp, loved to have all by Divine right and lived they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not by what wrong: But the Laity inclining too much to the new Religion, as then it was termed, refuſed to yeeld one foot unto their pretentions: And ſo like two Horſes tied together by their Bits, indeavor after ſeverall courſes, ever and anon kicking one at another, yet ſtill beſtrode by a King that was joynted for the purpoſe; and ſo good a horſe-man that neither of them could unhorſe, him till Death laid him on the ground. And thus was the <hi>Romane</hi> Eagle deplumed,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52042:134"/>
every Bird had its own feathers, the great men the Honours and Priviledges, the meaner men the profits, and ſo an end to Annates, <hi>Legatine levies, Peterpence, Mortuaries, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtries,</hi> and all that retinue, the vaſt expences by Bulls and Appeales to <hi>Rome,</hi> to all the cares, expences, and toile in attendance on the <hi>Romane</hi> Chaire: The beginning of all the happineſſe of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>THeſe two Kings were men of towreing Spirits, liked not to ſee others upon the wing, in which regard it was dangerous to be great, and more ſafe not to be worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: Eſpecially in the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, whoſe motion was more eager; and there was no comming nigh to him, but for ſuch as were of his own traine, and would follow as faſt as he would lead; and therefore generally the Commons had more cauſe to praiſe the King for his Juſtice then the Nobility had. Both the Kings loved the aire of profit paſſing well (but the later was not ſo well breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and therefore had more to do with Courts which had the face of Juſtice: But behinde were for the Kings Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue: Such were the Court of Requeſts, of meane originall, meane education, yet by continuance attained to a high growth: The Court of Tenths and firſt fruits: The Court of Surveyors: The Court of the Lord Steward of the houſhold: The Court of Commiſſion before the Admirall: The Court of Wards; The Court of the Preſident of the North: The Prerogative Court: The Court of Delegates: The Court of Commiſſion of Review: Others of more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate regard: and (that which might have given the name to all the reſt) the Court of Augmentation. Beſides theſe there were ſome in <hi>Wales</hi>; but that which concerned more the matter of Judicature, was the loſſe of that grand liberty of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52042:135"/>
that Countrey formerly a province belonging to this Nation and now by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth incorporated into the ſame,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 3.</note> and made a Member thereof, and brought under the ſame fundamentall Law; a work that had now been long a doing, and from the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the third brought on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by degrees.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by annexing the Tenure of the Marches to the Crowne: Then upon occaſion of their rebellion by loſſe of many of their wonted liberties. Afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth defaced the bounds of diverſe the ancient Counties and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them a new and the bounds of the Marches alſo, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Plees in Courts of Judicature to be holden in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all reunited them again to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, giving them vote in Parliament as other parcell of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Dominions had.<note place="margin">

Secondly, as Courts and Judicatories multiplied, ſo ſome alſo of thoſe that were ancient enlarged their Juriſdiction, eſpecially ſuch of them as moſt nighly related to Prerogative; amomgſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the privy Councell leads the way: Who now began to have too much to do, in a double capacity, one at the Councell Table, the other in the Star Chamber: For now their Power began to be diverſly conſidered. In their firſt capacity they had too much of the Affaires of the Common Pleas, in the later they had too much of the Crown Pleas; both of them ſerving rather to ſcare men from doing wrong, then to do any man right. And therefore though ſome men might ſeeme to have ſome recompence, yet the greateſt gain fell to the King and his Courtiers, and thus became Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, or State, or Prerogative, to be more feared then beloved. What the Power of the Councell was formerly hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy beene manifeſted, that which both theſe Kings conſpired in, and whereby they gained more Power over the People
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52042:135"/>
then all their Predeceſſors, was this, that other Kings ſtood too much upon their own leggs, theſe leaned much upon the Lords, and gained the Lords to ſtick cloſe to them; and in this they had both the Kings Love and the Peoples Leave, who now disjoynted upon ſeverall Intereſts, eſpecially that of Religion, muſt be contented to let go that which they had no heart to hold. And thus they obtained a judicatory Power over the people; like that of great men whoſe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are commonly above capacity, and not like to that of the Peers. This was begun in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſevenths time, who taking occaſion to complain of corruption and neglect in ordinary Trialls of the Common Law, gets the People to yeild to the Councell, or ſome of them, a Power of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> by examination upon Bill or information in matters concerning Maintenance, Liveries, Retainders, Embraceries corruption in Sheriffs, and Juries, Riots,<note place="margin">3 H. 7. cap. 1.</note> and unlawfull Aſſemblies, Crimes all of them of the ſame Blood with rebellion, which the King as much hated as the thought of his Title to the Crowne; and therefore would have it feared, as much as the puniſhment by ſuch a mighty Power; and a Triall of a dreadfull Nature could ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. A Triall I ſay, wherein both the guilty and the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe adventure their whole Eſtates, againſt the edge of the arbitrary wills of great men of unknown Intereſts, in an unknown way, at unknown places; having no other aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, how, or when to come off, but a Proclamation to tell the People, that the King above all things delighted in Juſtice. A bitter pill this was for the People to ſwallow, yet it was ſo artificially compoſed, that at the firſt taſte it gave a prety relliſh, the King delights in Juſtice,<note place="margin">4 H. 7. cap. 12.</note> the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor hath his Conſcience, the Arch-Biſhop brings Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Judges bring Law, ſo as its probable nothing will be done but according to Juſtice, Conſcience, Religion, and Law; a very faire mixture but that there was a Treaſurer in the Caſe, yet the ſucceſſe anſwered not expectation, the Perſons offended were many times inferiour and their eſtates not great, the Offenders more meane and of deſperate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52042:136"/>
for great men were too wiſe to try this new way, or to taſt of their entertainment. Therefore within nine yeares the Judges of Aſſize are betruſted with all, and that Court ſo continued for as many yeares more;<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 3.</note> and then the King marked out one Crime amongſt the reſt for his owne tooth, belonging to the great men onely, for they onely are able to commit the Crime, and to give recompence ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Kings Appetite: It is giving of Liveries, and Retainders, a ſore evill in the eyes of a jealous King, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to draw the inferiour ſort to honour and admire, and be of the ſuit of thoſe of the greater ſort, and then beware the Crown. Theſe therefore muſt be tried before the King himſelf and his Councell, that he may know whom he is to feare,<note place="margin">19 H. 7. c. 14.</note> and of whom to take heed. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with is a ſtrange power given, to ſummon upon a meere Suſpition: To proceed without information: To examine the Defendant upon Oath and make him his own Accuſer. To puniſh according to diſcretion, by fine and Impriſonment; and thus the King and his Councell have gotten a power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of Liveries and Retainders, to bring the whole Kingdome to be of their Livery, or elſe they can ſuſpect whom they pleaſe; apprehend whom they ſuſpect, put him preſently to the rack of confeſſion, and ſo into priſon till he hath ſatisfied both diſpleaſure, and jealouſie, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe it ſelf. Never was <hi>England</hi> before now in ſo low a degree of thraldome, bound under a double knot of ſelf-accuſing, and arbitrary Cenſure, and this out-reached, not onely in matters meerly civill, tending to the common Peace, but was intruded alſo into matters Eccleſiaſticall in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Peace of the Church. All bound unto the good behaviour both in Body and Soul, under perill of loſſe of all that a man hath deare to him in this World. The plot of all this was firſt laid by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, and was followed by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, who put that into practiſe (which his Father had in deſigne) being led thereto by ſuch a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Guid as Cardinall <hi>Woolſie</hi> was, who, though of meane Birth, yet of a Spirit above a King, and equall to

the Popedome, ſtrained the ſtring of Prerogative to its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt heighth, and then taught the King to play thereon; which he did after his blunt manner till his dying day. And thus though the Clergy are brought a Peg lower, and the Nobility advanced higher, yet was it the pollicy of theſe Kings to make them all of their own Livery and Retainder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to keep them in an upper region, looking on the poore Commons at a diſtance far below; and well it was for the Commons thus to be, till the influence of theſe blazing Stars grew cooler.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXII. Of the Militia.</head>
               <p>IT may fall within the verge of opinion, that the guilty Title of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh to the Crowne of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> galled his minde with jealouſie the greateſt part of his Reigne: Whether it were that he had not declared himſelf ſo fully upon his Title by his Wife, or that as yet he feared ſome unknown <hi>Plantagenet</hi> would ariſe and put his Crown to the queſtion: This made him skilfull in the point of Fortification (wherein he likewiſe ſpent the greateſt part of his Reigne) not ſo much by force of Armes (for he cared not much for that noiſe, well knowing that Peace is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer condition for a King that comes in by power) but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by way of gaining Conceſſions and acknowledgment from the Subjects, a Muſick that he much delighted to heare, well knowing it would conclude thoſe amongſt them that knew too much, and inſtruct them that knew too little; and ſo in time he ſhould paſſe for currant amongſt them all. It was no hard matter for the King to accompliſh this, the greater part of the Kingdome being pre-ingaged unto his Title, and of them many depending upon him for lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, if he failed they muſt look to looſe all. But the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:52042:137"/>
preſent occaſion urged more importantly; the Title to the Crown was already put to the queſtion, by the pretentions of one that named himſelf Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi>: And its now high time for the Law to declare it ſelf, to direct the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ſuch a Caſe: What ſhall the People do where Might overcomes Right, or if dayes come like thoſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, wherein the Subjects ſhould be between two millſtones, of one King in Title and another King in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, for whom muſt they take up Armes, if for <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, then are they Traitors to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth; if for <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, then are they Traitors to <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and ſo now if for <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh then they may be Traitors to the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> if for the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> then are they Traitors to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh. For though the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> was ſaid to be but a contrivance of the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy</hi>; yet a great part, both of the great men and others were of another opinion, and the King himſelf was not very certaine of his condition for the ſpace of ſix years thereby. This puts the Title of allegiance and that power of the Militia to the touch; at length both King and Parliament come to one Concluſion, conſiſting of three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the King for the time being (whether by right or wrong) ought to have the Subjects Allegiance, like to that of the wiſe Councellor, of that brave King of <hi>Iſraell, Whom the Lord and his People and all the men of Iſraell chuſe, his will I be.</hi> And this is not onely declared by the expreſſe words in the Preface of the Law, but alſo by the Kings own practiſe;<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 1.</note> for he diſcharged ſuch as aided him againſt <hi>Richard</hi> the third then King,<note place="margin">1 H. 7. cap. 6.</note> by pardon by Parliament, but ſuch as aided him being King by declaration of the Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this Allegiance draweth therewith ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the defence of that King and Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the diſcharge of this Service, whereto the Subjects are bound by allegiance, ought not to be imputed unto them as Treaſon: Nor ſhall any perſon be impeached or attainted; therefore the firſt and the laſt of theſe need no diſpute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:52042:137"/>The ſecond is more worthy of conſideration, in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular words ſet downe in the Statute, <hi>Viz. That the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are to ſerve their Prince in his Warres, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of him and the Land, againſt every rebellion, Power, and Might, reared againſt him, and with him, to enter and abide in Service in Battell.</hi> Wherein two things are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the Service, and the time or occaſion.</p>
               <p>The Service, is to ſerve the Prince in his Warrs, and with him to enter and abide in Service in Battell; which is the leſſe to be ſtood upon, becauſe there is a condition annexed, if the caſe ſo require, which muſt be determined by ſome Authority not particularly mentioned, albeit that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is therin ſet down is only by way of ſuppoſal in a Preface annexed to the Law, by the King, and permitted by the Commons, that were as willing the ſame ſhould be allowed, as the King himſelf, both of them being weary of warrs, and willing to admit this Concluſion for the better ſecurity of them both in theſe doubtfull times. But to lay all theſe aſide, for the Caſe is not ſtated till the Cauſe be conſidered. All this muſt be onely when and where the Kings Perſon and Kingdome is indangered by Rebellion, Power, or might, reared againſt him. So as the Kings Perſon muſt be preſent in the Warr for the defence of the Kingdome, or no man is bound by his allegiance to hazzard his own Life, and then this point of allegiance conſiſteth onely in defending the King in the defence of the Land, or more particularly in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Kings Perſon, he being then in the defence of the Land; and defending him in order to the defence of the Land. So as no man can rationally inferr from hence, that the King hath an univerſall power of Array when he pleaſes, becauſe the King when he pleaſes may not levy Warr, nor make other Warr then a defenſive Warr when the Land is indangered, or when need ſhall require,<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 18.</note> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Statute hath it. But who ſhall determine this need or danger, neither in theſe or any other Laws is mentioned; either out of want of occaſion or by reaſon of the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the times, wherein both Prince and People were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to decline the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:52042:138"/>Secondly, the Perſons that are to do this ſervice are to be conſidered of, and although they are indefinitely ſet down under the word Subjects, it may be ſuppoſed that the word is not to be taken in ſo large a ſenſe as to comprehend all of all ages, Sexes, Callings, and Conditions; in regard that even by the Common Law ſome of each of theſe ſorts are diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from ſuch ſervice. But it may ſeem the King was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfied with the oppreſſions of this firſt Law concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the occaſion or time of this Service; nor did he ſee ſufficient ground under the Notion of bare allegiance to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more: New wayes are by him found out, his Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees were not a few, and although few or none could ever boaſt much of any cheap purchaſes gained from him (for he was wont to be well payed before hand for his Patents either by Money or that which was as beneficiall to him) yet he was reſolved that their holding ſhould be no leſſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to him then their having, and therefore in plaine words he lets them know, that notwithſtanding former conſideration, upon which they had their Patents at the firſt, they muſt fight for him if they will live upon him; and either adventure their Lives or their Benefit,<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 18.</note> chooſe they which, and if they finde fault with their condition he touches them with the Law of their allegiance; and thus he makes way to intimate a claim of a more abſolute allegiance, for being to ſhew the Equity of the Law in regard of their Allegiance, he tells them that every Subject is bound by his Allegiance to ſerve and aſſiſt his Prince and Soveraigne Lord, at all ſeaſons when need ſhall require; generall words, that affirm nothing in certainty, yet do glance ſhrewdly upon an abſolute and univerſal aſſiſtance. Then comming to drive the naile home, it is ſaid that the Patentees are bound to give their attendance upon his Royall Perſon, to defend the ſame when he ſhall fortune to go in his perſon in Warrs for the defence of the Realme or againſt his Rebells and Enemies; (and as another Statute addeth) <hi>within the ſame Realme, or without, and according to their Allegiance, and not to depart without eſpeciall licenſe, or untill general Proclamation of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:52042:138"/>
In ſhew therefore here is a new Militia, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings Patentees they muſt attend the Kings Perſon whither ever the King will lead them, either within the Realme, or without; whether againſt ſuch as he will ſuppoſe to be his Enemies abroad, or if he will miſtake his Subjects for his Enemies at home: And this under the colour of Allegiance publiſhed in doubtfull expreſſions, as if it were not meet that <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh (that loved not to yoke himſelf to the Law ſhould yoke his Lawes under the Lawes of plaine language: Or rather that he held it a point of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to publiſh his Laws in a doubtfull ſtile, that ſuch as durſt queſtion his Lawes might have no poſitive charge againſt them; and ſuch as dared not to enter into the liſts with him, might not be bold to come nigh the breach of them. Nevertheleſs neither doth the glance of allegiance in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the former,<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 18.</note> nor in the body of the later Statute any whit confirm, that what is in them enacted is done upon the ground of Allegiance,<note place="margin">19 H. 7. c. 1.</note> but contrarily when as the firſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute commeth to the point, it Startles from the ground of Allegiance, and flies to the ground of a kinde of Equity or reaſon. And the ſecond reſorteth to the firſt as its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ground, as being a ſuppliment thereunto in caſes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and ſo omitted; though it may be rather thought that the King creeping up into his heighth by degrees, made the former onely as an eſſay to prepare the way for the later, like the point of the Wedge that maketh way for the bulk and body thereof. The truth of this aſſertion will be more manifeſt from the nature of both theſe Lawes, being limited, both in regard of time and perſon. In regard of time, for both theſe Lawes are but temporary and to continue onely during the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, in regard the advancements therein mentioned, as the moving cauſe, are onely the advancements made by himſelf. In regard of the perſon, for all perſons that received advancements from him are not bound thereby, namely thoſe that come in to ſuch advancement by purchaſe for Money: Neither are Judges and other Officers excepted perſons in the ſaide Statutes.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52042:139"/>
If therefore Allegiance had been the ground of theſe Lawes, it had equally bound all who are under that Bond, and no Equity could have given a generall rule of diſcharge unto ſuch condition of men: It had likewiſe bound as well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly and afterward as during this Kings Reigne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what ever ſemblance is made therein concerning Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, there had bin no need of ſuch Law if Allegiance could have done the Deed, or if the power of Array had been of that large extent as it hath lately been taken. In my conceit therefore theſe two Lawes do hold forth nothing that is new, but a minde that <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh had to fill his Coffers, though his minde would not ſo fill; he would have Souldiers but they muſt be his Patentees, not for any skill or valour in them above others, but he hoped they would compound with him for Licenſes to abſent, rather then to adventure themſelves, and ſo he might get the more Money that could finde pay for Souldiers more and better then they were or would be; for otherwiſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees might by the Statute have beene allowed to ſerve the King by their Deputies which would have done the King better Service in the Warrs then themſelves could have done, and for this very purpoſe much uſe was made of theſe Statutes, as well by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh as <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, both for Licenſes and Pardons, for compoſition in ſuch Caſes as their Records do plentifully ſhew.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let the Claime of Kings be what they will, yet the matter in fact ſhew plainly that they never had poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of what they claimed: Both theſe Kings pretended a Forraine-Warr, each of them once againſt one and the ſame Nation, and to that end advanced unto one place with their Armies; although the one went in good earneſt, the other in jeſt: Their Armies were not gathered by Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative but of Volunteirs, this not only the Records but alſo the Statutes do clearly ſet forth. Some ſouldiers ſerved under Captaines of their own choiſe, and therefore the Law infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth a penalty upon ſuch Captains as bring not their number compleat according to their undertaking,<note place="margin">7 H. 7. cap. 1.</note> other Souldiers are
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52042:139"/>
levied by Commiſſion by way of impreſt; which in thoſe dayes were Volunteirs alſo, and expecting favour from the publique, the rather becauſe they devoted themſelves thereto without relation to any private Captaine; willingly therefore received impreſt Money: And of this courſe the State ſaw a neceſſity, both for the better choiſe of men, and for the more publique owning of the worke: For ſuch as had been uſually levied by the Captaines were fit only to fill up room and make up the number, and yet many times there was a failing in that alſo; and this manner of raiſing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry was continued by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth,<note place="margin">3 H. 8. cap. 5.</note> as by the like Law in his time may appeare. As touching the levying of the Horſe, although diverſe Statutes were made for the maintenance of the breed of Horſes, and Perſons of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ability were aſſeſſed at the finding and maintaining of a certaine number of Horſes,<note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 13. 33 H. 8. c. 5.</note> yet do none of them tell us that they ſhall finde and maintaine them armed compleatly for the Warrs, nor ſhall ſend them forth upon their own charge, and therefore I ſuppoſe they were raiſed as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; theſe two Kings had the happineſſe to be admired, the one for his ſhrewd cunning Head, the other for a reſolute and couragious Heart: And it was no hard matter to finde men that loved to ingratiate themſelves, and indeavour to catch their favour, though with the adventure of their Lives, eſpecially if they looked after Honour and Glory, which as a Crowne they ſaw pitched at the Goale of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Concerning the pay of the Souldier, the Law was the ſame as formerly, the ſame was aſcertained by the Statute-Law;<note place="margin">7 H. 7. c. 1. 3 H. 8. c. 5.</note> the payment was to be made by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, under perill of impriſonment and forfeiture of Goods and Chattels, and the true number of his Souldiers to be maintained and liſted, under the like perill.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As touching the Souldiers ſervice, the ſame courſe alſo was taken as before; if they diſſert their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, they ſhall be puniſhed as Felons, and the manner of tryall to be at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:52042:140"/>Fifthly, For Fortifications, the power properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the ſupream Authority, to give order therein: For the people may not fortifie themſelves (otherwiſe then in their particular Houſes, which are reputed every mans Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) becauſe publique Forts are enemies to the publique peace, unleſſe in caſe of publique danger; concerning which, private perſons can make no determination. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, no Fortifications can be made and maintained, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abridgement of the Common liberty of the people, either by impairing their Freehold, or exacting their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or other Contribution, none of which ought to be done, but by publique Law; and therefore when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the County of <hi>Cornwall</hi> were to make defence againſt Invaſion and Piracy, from the Coaſt of <hi>Little Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> in regard they were a long ſlender County, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſudden ſurpriſals, people could not ſo readily flock to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for their joint defence, they obtained an act of Parliament to give them power to fortifie the Sea coaſts,<note place="margin">4 H. 8. cap. 1.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the direction of the Sheriff and Juſtices of the Peace.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Warrs once begun, muſt be maintained at the charge of the undertakers: If they be the Kings own Wars, he muſt maintaine them out of his owne Treaſury, till the benefit of them doe prove to the common good; and in ſuch caſes the charges have been ſometimes provided before the work, by Act of Parliament, and ſometimes after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, both of them at their ſeverall times went to <hi>Boloigne</hi> with their Armies: <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh with an intent to gaine profit to himſelfe by an advantagious peace, and had his ends therein, and was aſhamed to aske ayde of the people towards the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of that Warr.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth went upon his owne charge alſo with his Army, truſting to the Parliament for conſideration to be had of his imployment (wherein his expectation did not faile) and in his abſence, made Queen <hi>Katharine</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of all the Forces of <hi>England</hi> in his abſence, and gave
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52042:140"/>
her power, with other five Noble Perſonages, to take up Money upon Loane, as occaſion ſhould require, and to give ſecurity for the ſame, for the maintaining and raiſing of Forces, if need ſhould require, as is more particularly ſet forth in the Patent Rolls of theſe times. Nevertheleſſe the Warr at Sea, <hi>Infra quatuor maria,</hi> was ever reputed Defenſive as to the Nation, and under the publique charge, becauſe no Warr could be there, but an Enemy muſt be at hand, and ſo the Nation in eminent danger; and therefore the maintenance of the Navy Roiall in ſuch caſes, was from the publique Treaſury.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore, If the Parliament and Common Law in all theſe caſes of Levies of men for Warr,<note place="margin">7 H. 8. cap. 2. 23. cap. 7. 32. cap. 14.</note> payment of Souldiers, and their deportment, in caſes of Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of maintenance of Warrs at Sea, and the deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch as are imployed therein; I ſay, if they give the Law, and carry the ſupream directory, then certainely the Law rules in that which ſeemes moſt Lawleſſe; and though Kings may be cheife Commanders, yet they are not the cheife Rulers.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="33" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XXXIII. Of the Peace.</head>
               <p>PEace and Warr originally depend upon the ſame power, becauſe they relate each to other, as the end to the meanes, and receive motion from one and the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Law, that ruleth both in Peace and Warr: It is very true, that ſeverall Ages hitherto have been troubled with arbitrary exhalations; and theſe very times whereof we now treat are not altogether cleare from ſuch an ayre. Two Kings we have at once in view, both of them of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſpirit; one working more cloſely by cunning, the other
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52042:141"/>
more openly by Command, yet neither of them pretending ſo high as to doe all, or be all in all. Peace ſuited more with <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh then with his Son, who delighted to be accounted terrible rather then good; yet both of them were glad enough to be at peace at home, and were induſtrious to that end, though by ſeverall meanes. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh pretended Juſtice and Peace (a welcome news to a people that formerly accounted nothing theirs, but by the leave of the Souldier) and therefore ſets upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Sheriffs Courts,<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 15. 19 H. 7. c. 16.</note> in the entring of Plaints, and making of Juries ſuitable to that preſent time, wherein men of Eſtates were very ſcarce, and much of the riches of the Nation evaporated into the Warrs, both Civill and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine; although the continuance of that order concerning Juries in the ſucceeding times of opulency, hath brought theſe Courts into contempt, and made way thereby for the Kings Courts to ſwell in glory, and to advance Prerogative, even above it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He reformes Goales, as well in their number as their uſe: During the Civill Warrs, every ſmall party of men that could get a ſtrong place, made the ſame, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Caſtle, but a Goale, and uſually impriſoned and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed at their owne pleaſure: For remedy whereof, <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh reſtores all Goales to the Sheriffs,<note place="margin">19 H. 7. c. 10.</note> ſaving ſuch as hold hy Inheritance; and gives power to two Juſtices of the Peace,<note place="margin">3 H. 7. cap. 3.</note> one being of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> to take Baile in caſes bailable,<note place="margin">3 H. 7. cap. 1.</note> and Recogniſances of the Peace, to be certified at the next Seſſions, or Goal-Delivery.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Both Kings concurr in providing againſt ſuch diſorders, as more immediately did trench upon the publique Peace, and reached at the Crowne it ſelfe, by labouring to prevent by ſevere puniſhing; and laſtly, by regulating the proceedings of Judicature in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p>Theſe diſorders were two; Inordinate wearing of Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and unlawfull Aſſemblies: The firſt being in nature of unlawfull aſſembly of minds and ſpirits of men, the ſecond of their bodies and perſons: Both theſe had formerly been
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52042:141"/>
provided againſt, but the Judges of the Common Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe Cogniſance theſe Crimes were holden, did reſtrain their puniſhments to the rule of the Common Law, then thought to be too facile and mean for diſorders that did flye at ſo high a pitch; and therefore they are reduced before a higher tribunall, as matter of State,<note place="margin">3 H. 7. cap. 1. 19 H. 7. c. 14.</note> as hath been already mentioned. The ſeverity of puniſhment conſiſted not ſo much in aggravating the paine, as the Crime, matters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury being made Felonies, and thoſe Treaſon.</p>
               <p>This crime of Treaſon, at firſt it concerned matters acted againſt the Nation, afterwards it reached to matters acted againſt the King; now it reacheth even to the very thoughts and imaginations of the heart, not onely of bodily harme to the King, but of the Queen or their heires apparent,<note place="margin">26 H. 8. c. 13.</note> or tending to deprive them of their Title or Name of Royall Eſtate:<note place="margin">3 H. 7. c. 13.</note> This crime was formerly made but Felony by <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the ſeventh, and then onely extended to ſuch offence committed by one of the Kings houſhold againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King, or a Lord, or any of the Councell, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Treaſurer, or Controller; ſo as the perſon of the Queene was not then in the Caſe, and yet then newly Crowned, and at that inſtant bearing in her womb that roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſeed which was then the onely earneſt of the ſtability and glory of <hi>England</hi>; and therefore is it a ſubject of wonderment, unleſſe it were out of extremity of Jealouſie, leaſt he ſhould ſeem to make too great account of her title, and thereby diſparage his owne; and then is it a peice of wit, but not without weakneſſe; for he that is jealous of the ſlightings of other men, ſhews himſelfe unreſolved in his owne pretentions. Now <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, not onely raiſeth the price, but addeth to the thing, and not onely putteth the Queen, but the Prince or Heire apparent into the Caſe, making the ſame Treaſon: So as it implyeth, that Engliſh Allegiance tyeth the Subject, not onely to the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Perſon of the King, but alſo of the Queen and Heire apparent; otherwiſe the offence is made and declared Treaſon againſt the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:52042:142"/>Secondly, the Election of the object is to be conſidered, for whether the one or other Statute be obſerved, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that although the King was the next object expreſſed, yet a further was intended, and that the Crime is not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in regard of his naturall Capacity as a man, but of his politique Capacity, and in relation to the Common good of the Nation, and this is evident, not onely from the ſeverall Prefaces of the Lawes, but alſo from the manner of Election, whereby the Title of Heire apparent is taken up, and not the eldeſt Sonn or Daughter, or theſe, and not the other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, all which are equally dearly beloved in Naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, though at the Common Law Treaſon be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Crime againſt Allegiance, yet as in caſes of Felony Crimes may be by the Statute made as Treaſon, which at the Common Law are not againſt the legiance of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, for this remaineth ever one and the ſame, but one and the ſame fact may be made Treaſon and unmade by the Statute-Law, as befell this Law of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, by a Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twenty yeares after; like as alſo in former times one and the ſame fact hath many times received the like meaſure. Other Treaſons beſides theſe already mentioned were by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth created,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 18.</note> as Marriage with any of the Kings Siſters, Daughters, or Aunts of the Fathers ſide, or the Daughters of his Brethren or Siſters, without conſent firſt had of the King:<note place="margin">4 H. 7. c. 18.</note> Counterfeiting of currant Money, not of the Kings Coynage, was likewiſe made Treaſon by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh,<note place="margin">27 H. 8. c. 2.</note> who was well ſeen in that Miſtery of Money-Trade, and the like alſo became of Counterfeitures of the Kings Privy Signet and ſigne manuell.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">22 H. 8. c. 9.</note>And Laſtly, that horrid trick of poyſoning was reduced to this Category, rather that the Penalty might be more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible in the Death (which was by boyling) then for any Tincture in the Nature of the Crime, or in any Forfeiture of Eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">33 H. 8. c. 8.</note>The policy of theſe times thus irritated againſt Treaſon had proved very irreguler, if the ſame had not been as rigid
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52042:142"/>
in caſes of Felony: diverſe new ones of that kind are alſo dubbed, amongſt which Conjuration or Witchcraft comes firſt; an old Felony in the Saxons time, but ſince had gotten its Clergy, now well nigh for the ſpace of five hundred years, and they it, ſo as it never walked abroad amongſt the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but under the favour of the Cloyſtered People, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came before the Civill Power till now <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth brought it forth into its own ancient and proper regiment. Other Crimes being thoſe of the ſeaſon are made into the the ſame degree: Such as were taking of women into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; unlawfull huntings with diſguiſes;<note place="margin">3 H. 7. c. 2. 1 H. 7. c. 1. 22 H. 8. c. 11. 21 H. 8. c. 7.</note> malicious brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Dikes and Bankes in <hi>Marſhland</hi>; Servants em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzelling their Maſters Goods to the value of forty ſhillings or upward, which (beſides that of Hereſie, whereof for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) though of a new ſtamp, yet of ſo good a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that they remaine unto this day under the ſame brand.</p>
               <p>But let the Lawes be never ſo ſevere, if they have not free liberty to walk at large they are ſoone ghoſtleſſe, and therefore theſe two Kings, eſpecially the later, gained that Honour above their Predeceſſors that they gave the Law a free and full ſcope over all perſons but themſelves and their Aſſignees, and in all places. Firſt, Concerning places, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knowes the Notion but few conſidered the extent of Sanctuary ground in <hi>England,</hi> that could ſanctifie any Crime or Criminall perſon in ſuch manner, that though the eye of Juſtice could ſee yet the hand of Juſtice could never reach them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till <hi>Henry</hi> the eight plundered them of all their ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and made all places common, ſo as no Treaſon could hide it ſelf but where the Act of Parliament did appoint,<note place="margin">26. H. 8. c. 13. 27 H. 8. c. 19. 32 H. 8. c. 12.</note> and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their names from Sanctuaries to priviledged places. The ſanctity of the perſon was yet more miſchivious and hard to be reformed, it had been often attempted before, theſe times with little ſucceſſe. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh gained ſome ground herein beyond his Anceſtors; the Delinquent might have his Clergy once,<note place="margin">4 H. 7. c. 13.</note> but not the ſecond time (though he fled to the hornes of the Alter) and was ever after known by a
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52042:143"/>
brand in the hand. Thus far did <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh go, and would have done more even as far as unto thoſe in holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth comming on, in point of Treaſon made all perſons common without reſpect of their orders or profeſſion.<note place="margin">23 H. 8. c. 1.</note> Death makes an equall end of all.

               <p>Two difficulties yet remaine which hindred the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lawes againſt Treaſon. One concerning the place, the other the perſon.</p>
               <p>The place many times of the plotting and beginning of the Treaſon befalleth to be without the walk of the Kings Writ, in which caſe by the Common Law it cannot be inquired or tried, or it may be that the men of the place be generally diſaffected, and then no hope of finding out the matter. In ſuch caſes therefore it is provided,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 15. 33 H. 8. c. 22.</note> that be the Crime where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Delinquent will, it ſhall nevertheleſſe be inquired and tried where the King will.</p>
               <p>The Perſon of the Delinquent alſo many times changed its condition; it might be ſober at the time of the Delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and afterwards upon diſcovery, prove lunatick, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by avoide the Triall, this whether in jeſt or earneſt, by a Statute is made all one,<note place="margin">35 H. 8. c. 2.</note> and it is ordained that in caſe the fact be confeſſed by the Delinquent before the Lords of the Councell, at ſuch time as the party accuſed was of ſound minde, and the ſame be atteſted under the hands of foure of thoſe Lords, the ſame ſhall be a good ground to proceed to inquiſition before Commiſſioners, and the ſame being
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52042:143"/>
found, to try the Delinquent without anſwer or appearence, ſaving unto Barons their Triall by their Peeres. And thus however in their Fits, the Will of the Perſons of theſe Kings was too hardy for the Kings to mannage according to rule, yet the Law ſtill in Title kept the ſaddle, held the Reines, and remaineth the cheife Arbitrator unto every man.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXIV. Of the generall Government of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WEE are at length come within ſight of the ſhore, where finding the Currents various and ſwift, and the Waves rough, I ſhall firſt make my courſe through them ſeverally, and then ſhall bring up the generall account of the Reignes of one King and three Governours.</p>
               <p>The King was a Youth of about ten yeares old, yet was older then he ſeemed by eleven yeares; for he had all the Amunition of a wiſe King, and in one reſpect, beyond all his Predeceſſors, that made him King indeed, <hi>By the grace of God.</hi> He was the onely Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, yet that was not all his title, he being the firſt Preſident in the point of a young Son and two elder Daughters by ſeverall venters; the eldeſt of whom was now thirty yeares old, able enough to ſettle the Government of a diſtracted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the Son ſo young, as by an Act of Parliament, he was diſabled to ſettle any Government at all, till he ſhould paſſe the fifteenth yeare of his Reigne: But the thing was ſettled in the life time of his Father, whoſe laſt Will, though it ſpeake the choiſe, yet the Parliament made the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52042:144"/>
election, and declared it. The condition of this Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 7. 35 H. 8. c. 1.</note> was every way tender; borne, and ſuſtained, by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary meanes; which could never make his dayes many, or Reigne long: His ſpirit was ſoft and tractable, a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temper in an ill aire, but being fixed by a higher prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple then nature yeelded him, and the ſame, beautified with excellent indowments of nature, and Arts, and Tongues, he outwent all the Kings in his time of the Chriſtian World. His Predeceſſors provided Apparell and Victuall to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but he Education, and thereby fitted it to overcome a firy tryall, which ſoon followed his departure. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of his Government was as tender as himſelfe, ſcarce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during to ſee his Funerall; ready for every change, ſubject to tumults and Rebellions, an old trick that ever attends the beginning of Reformation, like the winde the Sun riſing. The diverſity of Intereſts in the Great Men, eſpecially in point of Religion, for the moſt part firſt ſet theſe into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for ſome of them had been ſo long maintained by the Romiſh Law, that they could never endure the Goſpell: and yet the different Intereſts in matters of State, made the greater noiſe. All was under a Protector fitly compoſed to the Kings minde, but ill matched with rugged humorous aſpiring mindes; whereof one that ſhould have been the Protectors great Freind, became his fatall Enemy, and though he were his Brother, to prejudice his Intereſt, pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his owne blood: The other which was the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> had his will, but miſſed his end; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving removed the Protector out of the way, and gotten the cheife power about the King, yet could he not hold long what he had gotten; for the King himſelfe, after ſixteen moneths decaying, went into another World, and left the Duke to ſtand or fall before ſome other power, which came to paſſe upon the entry of the next Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>The greateſt trouble of his Government aroſe from the proſecution of a deſigne of his Grand-Fathers, <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, for the uniting of the two Crownes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> by marriage, and ſettling an induring peace
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52042:144"/>
within this Iſle; and unto this worke all were ayders in both Nations, but the Enemies of both: But Gods wayes are not as Mans; its a rare example to finde out one Marriage that did ever thrive to this end. <hi>England</hi> meaned well in profering Love, but the wooing was ill favoredly carried on by ſo much Blood.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, As the Government was now tender; ſo was it carried with much compliance with the People, which ever gives occaſion to ſuch of them that are irregular, to be more, and ſuch as are wel governed to be leſs, becauſe though pleaſing it be, yet it is with leſſe awe and ſpirit, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders their obedience at the beſt but careleſſe and idle, unleſſe ſuch as are very conſciencious be the more carefull over their owne wayes, by how much their ſuperiours are the leſſe.</p>
               <p>NOt thus was Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Q. Mary.</note> but (like a <hi>Spaniard</hi>) ſhee overruled all relations and ingagements by deſigne; ſhe was about forty yeares old, and yet unmarried when ſhee came to the Throne, it may ſeeme ſhee wanted a minde to that courſe of Life from naturall abſtinency,<note place="margin">Thuan. vol. <hi>1.</hi> lib. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> or was loath to adventure her feature (which was not excellent) to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of any Prince of as high degree as ſhee held her ſelf to be; or her value was unknown, ſo as to perſons of meaner Intereſts ſhee might ſeeme too much above, and to thoſe of greater too much beneath: Or poſſibly her Father was loath to let the World know her Title to the Crowne till needs muſt, or to raiſe up a Title for an other man ſo long as he had hope of a Son of his own to ſucceed him, and yet had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned her for a wife to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth,<note place="margin">Thuan. vol. <hi>1.</hi> lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> and afterwards to the Dauphine of <hi>France</hi>: Or it may be her ſelf had ſet a command upon her ſelf, not to change her Eſtate till ſhee ſaw the courſe of the Crown, either to or fro;<note place="margin">Fox.</note> however the time is now come that ſhee muſt marry, or adventure her Woman-hood upon an uncertaine and troubleſome ſtate of Affaires: Shee liked the Lord <hi>Courtnoe</hi> above the Prince of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but feared he would not deſigne with her: Shee held
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52042:145"/>
him not unmeet for her degree, for ſhee feared he was good enough for her Siſter, that then alſo had the Title of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome waiting ſo nigh her perſon, as ſhee was an object of hope to her Freinds, and feare to her Enemies. And yet Queene <hi>Mary</hi> married the Prince of <hi>Spaine</hi>: It may be it ran in the blood to marry into their owne blood, or rather ſhee was thereto led by reaſon of ſtate, partly to inable her with greater ſecurity in the reſeiſure of her Kingdome in the Popiſh Religion, wherein ſhee knew ſhee had to do with a People not eaſie to be reduced, where Conſcience preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reluctancy; and partly to aſſure her Dominion againſt the outworks of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> deſignes. And ſo ſhee yeilded up the Supremacy of her Perſon to the Prince of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but (thanks to the Nobility) the Supremacy of the Kingdome was reſerved to her own uſe, for it was once in her purpoſe to have given up all to the man, rather then to miſſe of the man. And yet their condition was not much comfortable to either: the peoples diſlike of the match ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo loud abroad, that when the Prince was to come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Emperour his Father demanded fifty Pledges for his Sons ſafty during his abode in this Land, which was alſo denied,<note place="margin">Bodin. Rep. lib. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> when he was come over, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Feare the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Tiranny, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> the old Saxon entertainment of the Danes; ſo both ly at their cloſe guards, as after ſome time the King and Queen did no leſſe, for the Queen was either never earneſt in her affection, or now much leſſe, finding his Body diſeaſed and his Minde lingring after un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull game. On the other ſide, the King not finding that content in her Perſon (eſpecially after her ſuppoſed Concepcion) that he expected, looked to his owne Intereſt apart from hers, and thereby taught her to do the like; and this ſhe thought coſt <hi>England</hi> the loſſe of <hi>Callis</hi> and he <hi>Spaine</hi> the loſſe of many advantages that might have been obtained, and was expected from this conjunction. Thus by the ſeverall intereſts betweene the King Regnant and the Queen Regent, the Government of <hi>England</hi> became like a knot diſſolving, neither faſt nor looſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:52042:145"/>Towards the People ſhe might well be reſerved, if not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, for ſhe knew her entry was not very acceptable though accepted; and that her deſigne was contrary to her ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and therefore it was vaine to think to pleaſe her ſelf and pleaſure them. Nor did ſhe much buſie her thoughts therewith, that abominated trick of Impoſt upon Merchandiſe ſhe brought into faſhion,<note place="margin">C. <hi>2.</hi> Inſtit. fol. <hi>61.</hi>
                  </note> which had by many publique acts been damned for the ſpace of two hundred years; this was done without either ſhame or fear, for if the People turned head, ſhe knew ſhe had a good reſerve from <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the People might very well conſider of that, though for her part ſhe deſired not much to improve that Forraine Intereſt; becauſe ſhe might well ſee that <hi>Spaine</hi> deſigned to keep <hi>England</hi> ſo far beneath, that <hi>France</hi> might not get above: And that <hi>Phillip</hi> neither loved the double Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> no nor the triple Crowne at <hi>Rome,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then in order to that of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This diſtance between her and her King, wrought her to a more nigh dependency upon her Councell and <hi>Engliſh</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and ſo became leſſe diſcerned in her Government; although queſtionleſſe ſhe did much, and wanted not Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or courage to have done more, but that ſhe was not wholly her owne Woman: All men do agree that ſhe was devout in her kind of profeſſion, and therin as deeply ingaged as her Brother <hi>Edward</hi> had beene in his; though it may be out of tenderneſſe of Conſcience, but ſhe out of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> kind of gravity that indures not change: and whereunto ſhe was well aided by her Clergy who were her beloved for her Mothers ſake, and now alſo ſo much the more ſowre, by how much the nigher to the bottome: Its the leſſe wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the zeale of theſe times burnt into a flame, that at length conſumed even thoſe that kindled it. In one thing more above all the reſt ſhe acted the part of her Sect, rather then her Place, and the ſame contrary to the advice of her Ghoſtly Fathers and all rules of policy, and the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between her King and ſelf upon Marriage; which was the ingageing of <hi>England</hi> in the Warr at Saint <hi>Qui ntins,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52042:146"/>
the <hi>French,</hi> contrary to the Nationall league former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made: Nevertheleſſe the iſſue was but ſutable, for though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> obtained their part of the honour of that day, yet in the conſequence they loſt <hi>Callis,</hi> the laſt foot that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had in <hi>France</hi>; henceforth <hi>England</hi> muſt be content with a bare Title: As this was deſerved, ſo was it alſo reſerved by the Queen, to make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that ſhe died for greif therefore as a Mother of her Countrey; although her bodily diſeaſe, contracted by a falſe Conception, wherein ſhe beguiled both her ſelf and the World, concurred thereto. In ſum, the worſt that can be ſaid of her, is this, That ſhe was ill principled, and the beſt, that ſhe acted according to her principles, and ſo lived an uncomfortable Life, ſhaped a bloudy Reigne, and had but a dim Concluſion.</p>
               <p>The Night was now ſpent, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> like the morning Star riſing into the Throne, ſent forth the benignant Influence of both her Predeceſſors, and many waies excelled them both, ſhe was begotten in a heat againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein alſo ſhe was borne and trained up by her Father and Brother <hi>Edwards</hi> Order, and ſaw enough in her Siſters courſe to confirme her therein. For Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was not very Catholique in her Throne, though ſhe was in her O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory. Nevertheleſs, Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Courſe hereunto was very ſtrange, and might ſeem in outward reſpects to lead her quite wide, for her youth was under a continuall yoke, her Mother dead whiles ſhe was at the breaſt; her Father owning her no further then as his Child born of a rebellious Woman, never intending her for the Crown, ſo long as any hope was left of any other; with her age the yoke grew more heavy, her Brother <hi>Edward</hi> being but of the half blood, except in point of Religion, might repect her at a diſtance beyond his Mothers family, but this laſted not long, her Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> comes next, of a ſtranger blood to her then her Brother was; looking ever back upon her as one too nigh her heele, and more ready to tread upon her Traine then ſupport it, the difference in Religion between
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52042:146"/>
them two added yet further Leven, and this occaſioned from her Siſter, to her many ſowre reflections, bitter words, harſh uſage, concluding with Impriſonment, and not without danger of Death: All which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſaw well, made the leſſe noiſe in Religion, walked warily, and reſolved with patience to indure the brunt; for ſhe might perceive by her Fathers Will that her way to the Crown, if ever ſhe arived at the end, muſt be through a feild of blood, and though ſhe knew her change of Religion might make the way more plain, yet God kept her in a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent waiting, untill the ſet time was come. Thus paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her Minority with little experience of youthfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſhe had the happineſs to have the leſſe ſenſe of youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full luſts, which meeting with naturall Endowments of the larger ſize, rendred her the goodlieſt mirror of a Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent that ever the Sun ſhone upon, God adding thereto both Honour and continuance, above all that ever ſate in that Throne: Her entrance was with more joy to others then her ſelf, for ſhe kept her pace as treading amongſt thornes, and was ſtill ſomwhat reſerved, even in matters of Religion, though ſhe was known to be devout. She had obſerved that the haſty pace both of her Brother and Siſter brought early troubles before either of them were well ſetled in their Throne. And therefore whereas her Siſter firſt ſet up the Maſſe, and then indeavoured to ſettle it by diſputes, ſhe contrarily firſt cauſed the point to be debated, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gained liking to lay it aſide. Its true the moderatorſhip in that diſpute was impoſed upon a Lay man (as their term is) but his work being to hold the Diſputants to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in debate, and not to determine the point in Controverſie (which thing was left to the Auditory) might therefore more rationally be done by him, then cenſured by any Hiſtorian that ſhall undertake to judg them all.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſtep thus made, one made way for another, till the whole became levened; her proceedings againſt Oppoſers were with much lenity, rather overlooking, then looking on; and ſuch as ſtood more directly in her path ſhe would rather
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52042:147"/>
ſet a ſide then trample down: And be faire to all (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to difference of Religion) that would be faire to her. Much of her happineſſe depended upon Election of her Councell,<note place="margin">Forcat. de Gal. imp. lib. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> more in obſerving their advice, that whether ſhe did rule, or were ruled, or did rule by being ruled, might deſerve ſome conſideration: This ſhe did to give ſatisfaction to ſuch as took prejudice at her Sex, rather then out of any ſenſe of imbecility in her own intellectuals, for therein ſhe equalled the beſt of her Predeceſſors, and in learned Endowments exceeded them all. Generally ſhe was of a publique minde, if not populer, ſhe loved to be ſeen of the People,<note place="margin">Quint. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. ult.</note> and yet kept her diſtance: Her Sex taught her to uſe her tongue much, and her education to uſe it well and wiſely: That, with a reſerved carriage was her Scepter, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby applauſe from the inferiour ſort, and awe from the greater· A wiſe man that was an eye witneſſe of many of her Actions and of thoſe that ſucceeded her, many times hath ſaid, That a Courtier might make a better meale of one good look from her then of a good gift from ſome other King. Anothet felicity She had beyond others of her place, She loved not to be tied but would be knit unto her People. To them She committed her confidence under God, and they to her their cheifeſt Treaſure on Earth, <hi>Viz.</hi> Their hearts to her Parliament which was the moſt conſiderable party that She had to deale with, She could perſonate Majeſty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to any Emperour, and adviſe, commend, yea and chide if She ſaw occaſion: And yet ever had a trick to come off with a kinde concluſion without blur of Honour. So as of thirteen Parliaments called during her Reigne, not one became abortive by unkindneſs; and yet not any one of them paſſed without Subſidy granted by the People, but one wherein none was deſired: And ſometimes the aid was ſo liberall that She refuſed the one half, and thanked the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the remnant;<note place="margin">Bodin. rep. l. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> a courteſie that rang loud abroad to the ſhame of other Princes. She would often mention her Prerogative, and yet not hold her ſelf wiſe enough, either to interrupt the Judges in their way, nor the Biſhops in theirs:
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:52042:147"/>
Abeit She ſpared not alſo, as She ſaw occaſion, to check the beſt of them for their irregularities; She had no Beloved, yet entertained Favorites at a cheaper rate and in better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then Kings uſe to do, for She had a preferment within her power beyond the reach of them all, and paſſion alſo ſoon at command, or rather ſomtimes beyond command: Yet if calmely taken, it ever proved good for that party (that ſuffered) in the concluſion. However, her love She held under her own power, and therein excelled her Forefathers; She had the Preſident of her Siſter (that adventured upon a Prince for her Bed, and miſſed what ſhe expected, and loſt what She had) and thereby learned to call into queſtion the poſſibility for her to gaine the private contentments of a married Life, and therewith maintain her publique Intereſt in the Kingdome; and therefore reſolved rather to ſit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone then to ſit below, and to refuſe the help of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, rather then to part with any one jot of her Intereſt in the people: So She remained above the People and her ſelf, and thereby enjoyed both. But Cuſtom in Government growing, together with infirmities of age, made her Regency taſte ſomwhat ſtale and ſpiritleſs, and gave occaſion to mens Mindes to wander after the next Succeſſor; before She had been nine years Queen this ſcrutiny was once begun; but it received a faire anſwer of delay, becauſe it was then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as don in love, now the apprehenſions hereof according to her age are more ſad; She thinks them weary of her, and therupon She is weary of her ſelf and them: She ſuppoſes She can no longer give them content; the Lords have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they will not be ruled; and ſuch like dark thoughts working upon an aged body, weakned with other infirmities, waſted her ſpirits and haſtned a concluſion unto a weary life, her ſelf not unwilling herewith, and her Courtiers leſſe, who expecting more from Succeſſors then they find, lived to diſdeſire and unwiſh their former choiſe by late repentance; thus making the ending of her dayes the renewing of her Reign in the hearts of all that obſerved her alive, or conſider her (now dead) in the written Regiſters of her Fame.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXV. Of the Supreme Power during theſe Times.</head>
               <p>THe Supreme Power, but ere while monſtrous in the two former Kings times for Greatneſs, now ſuffers as great a diminution, over-ſhadowed by infancy, woman-hood, and Coverture; and gives the People breath to beware for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Ne potentes ſi nocere velint non poſſent</hi>; nevertheleſs the loſs was only of the Hydropical humor, and the Government came forth more clearly like it ſelf. In the point of Infancy, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth bears it forth, being the ſeventh Preſident of Infancy, ruling under Protectorſhip, ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> times; yet beyond all the reſt in managing his Supremacy in Church matters, which none of them all did ever ingage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prerogative and Supremacy are Notions of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Nature, and commonly looked upon as the holy Mount at the Delivery of the Law, at a great diſtance, for fear of death or undoing; and yet it is ſuch a thing as a childe may handle without hurt done, either to the Eſtates, Perſons, or Conſciences of any Man; becauſe its preſuppoſed he does nothing but what the Law firſt dictates by his Councel unto him. There is then no infancy in the Crown, though in the Perſon, becauſe the wiſedom of the Crown is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to reſt in one Perſon, but in the Councels of many, who are equally wiſe, whether the Perſon of the King be old or young.<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 17.</note> And that Statute made by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, by which this King had power by his Letters Patents, after the age of 24 years, to adnull any Act of Parliament made by him before that time, was not grounded either upon Principles of Law or general Reaſon of State, but upon ſome particular Circumſtances of the ſtate of the Affairs as then they ſtood; and therefore is this power limited onely to ſuch Heirs or Aſſignees of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, to whom the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:52042:148"/>
Crown ſhall come by his appointment. Nor did it ever thrive to that deſired end whereto it was intended: for upon the entry of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, the Councels changed,<note place="margin">1 E. 6. cap. 11.</note> and the Parliament took this Statute away, as ſcandalous to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Government of the Nation, and in ſtead of the power of Adnulling, allowed of the power of Repealing; yet ſo as untill ſuch time of Repeal the ſaid Statutes, and all Acts thereupon done, ſhall for ever be deemed warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and good. This was too much, but that the Times were yet in <hi>Equi lubrio,</hi> and men were loath to part with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, which they did hang upon that Power of Reſerve, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings Letters Patents: yet in that the Power is limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not onely in regard of the manner and time, but of the perſons, and alſo of the Statutes that are to be repealed: it is ſufficient to vindicate the nature of this Prerogative (if ſuch it were) to be no ways inherent, but acquired by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. But as touching the Legiſlative Power, they would not truſt it in the leaſt manner to any other King. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had crowned Proclamations at the inſtance of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the eighth, with that royal Title of Laws,<note place="margin">31 H. 8. ca. 8.</note> in manner as formerly hath been noted. Now all Intereſts, both of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and of the Reformed parties of this Nation, are againſt it; the former becauſe they ſaw the Kings preſent way to be againſt them, and both it and the later becauſe the thing it ſelf was abominable unto the Liberties of the People, and therefore it is ſoon taken away by Repeal, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power is wholly re-aſſumed to themſelves,<note place="margin">1 E. 6. cap. 12.</note> as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: for though in matters Eccleſiaſtical the Power of the Crown might ſeem to be more pre-eminent in regard of the Supremacy,<note place="margin">1 E. 6. cap. 2.</note> and ſome particular Powers in making Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops by Election without <hi>Conge deſtire,</hi> yet did the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment neither yeild or acknowledge any Legiſlative Power to be in the Crown thereby, but proceeded on in that way of the thirty and two Commiſſioners formerly agreed upon by them, in the time of the Kings father. Thus the King,<note place="margin">3 &amp; 4 E. 6. c. 11.</note> though an Infant, was a Gainer, and the Crown nevertheleſs ſtill the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:52042:149"/>Secondly, that Crown that may be worn by an Infant may much rather be worn by a Woman, whoſe natural Indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do far exceed the other, and are not inferior unto the moſt of men: of this we have two Examples in theſe Times, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of ſeverall profeſſions in matters of Religion, and liable to Exceptions, in regard of their Sex, by men of the counter-profeſſion on both ſides; yet both upheld the honor of the Crown, though therein the one more eſpecially, being neither ingaged in the <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſe, nor in the Eſtate of Marriage, as the other was. This was Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in perſon a Woman, but in minde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with all the perfections of a man; ſhe could not indure to abate one hairs breadth of her State; and yet upon the ſole regard of her Sex ſhe ſubmitted her Title of Supremacy to a more moderate name of Supreme Governour, whereas her father would be called Supreme Head, as if it were not onely hazardous, but hideous for a Woman to be Supreme Head of the Church;<note place="margin">26 H. 8. cap. 1.</note> and for this cauſe would ſhe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive that Statute made by her Father, and continued by her Brother <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and repealed by her Siſter Queen <hi>Mary</hi>:<note place="margin">1 Eliz. cap. 1.</note> nevertheleſs ſuch as ſhe was, ſhe had all ſuch Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, Priviledges, Superiorities, and Pre-eminencies, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or Eccleſiaſtical, as by any Eccleſiaſtical Power or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority formerly had been, or might be lawfully exerciſed, for Viſitation of the Eccleſiaſtical State and Perſons, and for Reformation, Order, and Correction of the ſame, and of all manner of Errours, Hereſies, Schiſmes, Abuſes, Offences, Contempts, and Enormities; ſhe had therefore neither abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Empire, nor abſolute Juriſdiction over the Churches; neither Power to make, declare, alter, or repeal any Law; neither did ſhe ever exerciſe any ſuch Power, but onely by Act of Parliament:<note place="margin">1 Eliz. cap. 3.</note> ſhe had a Power over Ceremonies in the Worſhip of God, which was given her by the Parliament to execute by advice, and therefore was limited, as alſo was all the remainder of her. Power in Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical; for ſhe could do nothing in her own Perſon, but by Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and theſe Commiſſioners muſt be Natives and Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:52042:149"/>
not Forrainers; and the ſame to be but in certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and with certain Proceſs. Some Caſes of Eccleſiaſtical Cogniſance were referred to Triall at the Common Law,<note place="margin">13 El. ca. 12. 23 El. cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Such as concerned the publique Worſhip of God in Caſes of Forfeiture and Impriſonment.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, neither had the Queen, nor her Commiſſioners, nor Biſhops, abſolute Power over the Church-Cenſures; no Cenſure was regarded but Excommunication, and that no further then in order to the Writ, <hi>De Excommunicato capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo,</hi> and in all Caſes the ſame was to be regulated according to the Statute in that Caſe provided,<note place="margin">5 Eliz. ca. 23.</note> or by the Common Law in Caſe of Action: in all which we finde no Juriſdiction in Caſes Eccleſiaſtical that is abſolutely ſettled in the Crown: In matters Temporal the thing is yet more clear; ſhe never altered, continued, repealed, nor explained any Law, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by Act of Parliament, whereof there are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Examples in the Statutes of her Reign; and what ſhe did by her Judges was ever under Correction. A Woman ſhe was, and therefore could be no Judge, much leſs in the Caſes of Difference concerning her ſelf and her Crown.<note place="margin">18 Eliz. ca. 8.</note> A Queen ſhe was, and might make Judges, but ſhe muſt go according to the Law; new Judicatories ſhe could make none; nor ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially make, declare, alter, or determine the Power of any Court or Judge in Caſe of Difficulty, but by her Parliament;<note place="margin">5 Eliz. ca. 18. 13 Eliz. ca. 9. 39 Eliz. ca. 6. 18 Eliz c. 12. 43 Eliz. ca. 4.</note> as in the Caſes concerning the Power of the Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> the Powers of the Commiſſioners of <hi>Sewers,</hi> and charitable uſes, the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the County Courts, in the ſeverall Statutes concerning the ſame may more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. And which is yet of a meaner ſize, her Power extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to redreſs any inconvenience in proceſs of Errour, or Delay, in Courts of Law, nor to remedy Errours in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Fines, Recoveries, Attainders, or other matters of Record, or Triall, whereof the Statutes of her time are full, and alſo the opinions and judgements of the Judges of the Common Law concurring therewith: I mention not the power of life and member, which without all contradiction hath ever been under the protection of the known Law; ſo
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52042:150"/>
as upon the whole Account it will be evident, that this Queen had no abſolute Pre-eminence in all Caſes, but either in contra-diſtinction to forrain Power, or the power of any particular perſon, and not in oppoſition to the joint intereſt of the Repreſentative of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> comes next, although a Woman as well as ſhe, yea her elder ſiſter and predeceſſor, yet came ſhort of her in the point of Supremacy, by a double ſubmiſſion, both unto the Law of a Husband, and of a forrain power in caſes Eccleſiaſtical; although the ſame was with ſuch quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications as it was much more in Title and pretence then in reality; and ſo in the concluſion, neither approved her ſelf to be good Wife, good Catholique, nor good Queen. She could be no good Wife, becauſe ſhe was too great for her Husband within the Realm, and reſolved not to be without. A Catholique ſhe was, but the worſt that ever held her place: her Father appeared what he was, ſpake plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and was eaſily diſcerned. But ſhe told the Pope a fair Tale of diſclaiming Supremacy, and reconciling her Kingdom; yet none of her Predeceſſors did go beyond her in irregularity of her proceedings. Before ever ſhe called Parliament, ſhe ſettled the great Work of Reformation, or rather Deformation in the Worſhip of God, by ſingle Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation; and not onely took away the partition-wall of Doctrine by the like power, but gave way, and power to Perſecution thereupon, to ariſe before any power or Order from the holy Sea, then ſo called, inabled her thereunto. And after that ſhe declared her ſelf convinced, that ſhe ought not to exerciſe Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and by her Inſtructions forbade the Biſhops to uſe in their Proceſs that Clauſe of <hi>Regia Autoritate fulcitus,</hi> yet even theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions had no other Authority then her own; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſhe ſtill inforced the Execution of all matters concerning the publique Worſhip of God, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, when as yet the Pope had no admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto his ancient claim. It is very true, that the Pope long ere now had made a fair offer, and the Queen had lent
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52042:150"/>
her ear, but her Train was too great to move as faſt as was pretended, ſo as no meeting could be had till the Queens Marriage with <hi>Spain</hi> was paſt, and ſuch as were diſ-affected, found it was bootleſs to ſtop the Current of two ſuch mighty ſtreams of Power, now joyned into one; and ſo that unclean ſpirit returned ſeven times worſe then when he went out, and took <hi>Seiſin,</hi> meerly upon Repeal of the Laws made by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in the Negative, without further Grant or Livery: for though an expreſs Embaſſage was ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to perform the ſolemnity of the ſubmiſſion, yet the Pope died before the arivall of the Embaſſie, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity failing, left the Title of the Crown much blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet was it not wholly defaced; for if the Statutes in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth and <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixths time, did but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the poſſeſſion, its evident that the repealing of thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes took away no right from the Crown, nor gave legal poſſeſſion to the Pope, that had formerly neither poſſeſſion nor right, but left him to his Remitter, as in his ancient right, or rather in his ancient wrong. Yet right or wrong, <hi>de facto,</hi> he both did win and wear the Keys ſo long as the Queen lived, and ſo far as ſhe pleaſed; for her devotion would not allow of abſolute obedience in that kinde, nor all for Goſpel that the Pope ſaid or did; but by her ſelf and Councel executed the powers of Supremacy of Juriſdiction in Church matters, not onely in purſuance of the Papall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but in croſſing the ſame where the Popes way croſſed her opinion, as in the caſes of the War between her Husband and <hi>France,</hi> and the Power Legatine of Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> her condemning of Doctrines and Books to be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical by Proclamation, eſtabliſhing both Prayers and Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and other Orders of publique Worſhip, whereof more fully in the publique Hiſtories of thoſe Times,<note place="margin">Fox Martyrol.</note> and in the Queens Injunction upon occaſion of the Death of Pope <hi>Julio,</hi> is to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſhe was no good Queen, not onely becauſe ſhe gave up the Peoples Liberties in Eccleſiaſticall matters to the forrain Juriſdiction of <hi>Rome,</hi> but undertook too much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52042:151"/>
by far upon her own account, and in Civil Affairs, though <hi>De jure,</hi> She was not inferior to any of her Progenitors; yet She would have it declared by the Parliament, as if the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of her Sex or birth, had made ſom heſitation in her minde,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Marl. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 1</note> and when ſhe had made all clear, ſhe commending her ſelf thereby to the Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> with her ſelf, indangered likewiſe that truſt of the Nation which ſhe had received, and caſt ſuch a ſhadow upon her own Supremacy, as in many things it is hard to be diſcerned.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, In her whole courſe uneven, ſometimes appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring like the eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, at other times like a Fem covert, led by the will of her Lord and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that wanting Supremacy himſelf, rendred her thereby beneath her ſelf.</p>
               <p>For Firſt, She married by Act of Parliament, as if She were not at her own diſpoſing, profeſſing as much in her ſpeech to the <hi>Londoners,</hi> upon the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> rebellion; ſo a difference was made between the two Siſters, the marriage of the one being by advice of Parliament, and the abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of the other againſt the ſame. Nor is the ſame alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether irrationall, for by the one the Government of the Nation is indangered, and by the other otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By her marriage She became doubly married, one way relating to her Perſon unto her King; the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latintog her truſt unto her Councell: For where a Forraine mighty King is ſo nigh the Helme, its dangerous to truſt the ſame to his Wife without the joynt concurrence of the Lords. The matter in fact declared no leſs, for many times She had ſteered quite wide, had not the Lords been more ſtiff to their principles then She.</p>
               <p>The firſt yeare of her marriage was Hony-moon with her, She thought nothing too dear for the King, and that her ſelf was but meanly married unleſs her Husband were as compleat a King in her Nation as any of her Predeceſſors, although contrarily the higher he was advanced the meaner She became.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By her marriage She adventured her Title of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52042:151"/>
Supremacy of juriſdiction: For <hi>Phillip</hi> as King had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſtile, and Kingly name, and ſo had the precedency; he had to do alſo with the juriſdiction, for by the Articles of the marriage he was to aid the Queen in her adminiſtration of the Kingdome and maintenance of the Lawes, Writs, and Commiſſions, paſſed under his name: He alſo ſate in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, voted therein and joyned in the Royall Aſſent.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Joyned in the publication, and execution of all Lawes. To him alſo was Allegiance due, and therefore the Crime of Treaſon was equally againſt his as the Queens Crown and Dignity, ſaving that it was reſerved to be as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him onely during the time of Coverture, and yet had the Queen left iſſue by him it would have been a hard ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture for the Lawers to have given their opinion in that caſe,<note place="margin">1 &amp; 2. <hi>Phil.</hi> &amp; <hi>Mary</hi> cap. 10.</note> ſeeing the King had been Guardian to his Children during their minority.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The whole power and juriſdiction reſting in them both joyntly, could not inable them to make or diſſolve Courts at will nor conclude orders and directions in caſes of Plea and conveyance, nor proceſs concerning the ſame.<note place="margin">1 Mar. Seſs. 2. cap. 11. &amp; cap. 5. &amp; 7. &amp; ca. 12.</note> I ſhall ſum up all in this on econcluſion, if neither of theſe three had an abſolute Legiſlative power, either in matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church or Common-Wealth, if no abſolute juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in caſe, either of Life, Member, or Eſtate. If they neither can create, unite, or alter any Court, either concerning the Triall and determining the Eſtates of the People or their own Revenue. If not alter, or make any new proceſs in Courts of Law: If not order common aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Lands or Eſtates.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, If they have no power in determining the laſt appeal and definitive ſentence in matters of controverſy, but all muſt reſt upon the ſentence by Parliament, there muſt certainly be found out a further ſenſe of that grand Title of Supremacy of juriſdiction, power, ſuperiority, pre-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence and Authority, then by the common vogue hath bin made. The Title of ſupremacy was firſt formed in the behalf of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths Claime in matters Eccleſiaſticall, which
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52042:152"/>
by the Statute, is explained under theſe words of power, To viſit,<note place="margin">26 H. 8. ca. 1.</note> correct, repreſs, redreſs, Offences and Enormities: This Power and no other did Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> claime, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the words of the Statute in her own time.<note place="margin">5 Eliz. ca. 1.</note> But in the framing of the Oath of Supremacy in her time, not only in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical but temporal (which never came within the Statutes and publique Acts in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſevenths time) are inſerted; and if any thing more was intended it muſt come under the word <hi>Things,</hi> which alſo was inſerted in the ſaid Oath, and yet if the words of the Statute of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> formerly mentioned be credited, the word <hi>Things</hi> ought to comprehend no more then the word <hi>Cauſes,</hi> and then the Power of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the Common-Wealth will be comprehended in theſe words of Supremacy, to viſit, correct, repreſs, redreſs, Offences and Enormities, for the Supremacy in the Church and Common-Wealth, is the ſame in Meaſure, and what more then this, I cannot underſtand out of any publique Act of this Nation. Now in regard Offences and Enormities are properly againſt Lawes, the power to viſit and correct muſt alſo be regulated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Laws, either of War or Peace, nor do theſe five words Juriſdiction, Power, Superiority, Pre-eminence, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, contain any more Supremacy, or other ſenſe; for two of them ſpeakes only the rank or degree of the Queen in government, <hi>Viz.</hi> Superiority and Pre-eminence belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only to her, and not to any other Forrain power: And two other words do note her Right and Title thereto, by Power and Authority committed to her: And the other word denotates the thing wherein She hath Superiority and power, <hi>Viz.</hi> In juriſdiction: the nature of which word <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> (ſpeaking of the nature of a mixt government) explaineth thus, <hi>Quando ſervata dictione juris judiciorum fit animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſio,</hi> ſo as this ſupreame Authority in juriſdiction is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſupream power to viſit, correct, redreſs, Offences, or determine matters in doubt by deputing fit perſons to that end and purpoſe according to the Law, and this is all the Supremacy that appeareth to me belonging to the Crown in theſe times</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVI. Of the Power of the Parliament during theſe times.</head>
               <p>WHen the Throne is full of a King, and he as full of opinion of his own ſufficiency and Power, a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is looked upon as an old faſhion out of faſhion, and ſerve for little other, then for preſent ſhift, when Kings have run themſelves over Head and Eares. A conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thoſe of that high degree are extremly ſubject unto, but where the Crown is too heavy for the wearer by reaſon of infirmity, the Parliament is looked upon as the cheif ſupporters in the maintaining both the Honour and Power of that Authority, that otherwiſe would fall under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: A work that muſt be done with a curious touch; or a cleare hand; or they muſt look for the like Cenſure to that of a King to a great Lord that Crowned him. My Lord, I like your work very well but you have left the print of your fingers upon my Crown: Such was the condition of theſe times, wherein a Child and two Women are the cheifs, but ever under the correction and direction of the Common Councel in matters of common concernment. Two things declare the point, the courſe of the Title of the Crown, and the order of the powers thereof.</p>
               <p>The Title ever had a Law which was at the Helm, although diverſly expounded. Kings ever loved the rule of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and therefore uſually ſtrained their Pedegree hard to make both ends meet, though in truth they were guilty of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to themſelves that they were not within the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees The People ever loved the Title of Election,<note place="margin">Bodin. rep. l. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> and though ever they joyned it to the Royall blood, and many times to the right Heire to make the ſame paſs more currant without interruption of the firſt love between them and their Princes; yet more often had they Kings that could not boaſt much of their birth-right, in their firſt entry into
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:52042:153"/>
their Throne: Of three and twenty Kings from the Saxons time, foure of the former had no Title by inheritance; the two <hi>Willams, Henry</hi> the firſt and King <hi>Steven</hi>; of two others, <hi>Viz. Henry</hi> the ſecond and <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt had right of birth, yet came in by compact. The ſeventh which was King <hi>John</hi> had no title but election. The eight, <hi>Viz. Henry</hi> the third came in a Child, and contrary to compact between the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and the <hi>French Lewes</hi>; the ninth and tenth ſucceeded, as by unqueſtionable Title of diſcent, yet the Nobles were preingaged: The eleventh which was <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in his entry eldeſt Son but not Heire, for his Father was alive, but his Succeſſor, was his Heire; its true there were other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Edward</hi> the third alive that were more worthy of the Crown, but they were too many to agree in any but a Child that might be ruled by themſelves. Three next of the enſuing Kings were of a collatterall line. Their two Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, <hi>Viz. Edward</hi> the fourth and <hi>Edward</hi> the fifth were of the right line, yet <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth came in by diſſeſin, and <hi>Edward,</hi> the fifth by permiſſion; <hi>Richard</hi> the third and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh were collatterall to one another, and to the right blood, <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, though when he was King might claime from his Mother, yet came in as Heire to his Father. And if <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth was right Heire to the Houſe of <hi>Yorke</hi> by his Grand-Mother, yet cannot the Crown be ſaid to deſcend upon the two Siſters, neither as Heires to him, nor <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, nor to one another, ſo long as the Statute of their illigittimation remained,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. ca. 7. 1 Mar. Seſſ. 2. cap. 1.</note> which as touching Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was till three Months after her entry upon the Throne, and as touching Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for ever; for that <hi>Virago</hi> provided for her ſelf not by way of repeale (as her Siſter had done) but more tenderly regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Honour of her Father and the Parliament, then to mention their blemiſhes in Government by doing and undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: She overlooked that Act of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth and the Notion of Inheritance and contented her ſelf with her Title by the Statute made by her Father in his thirty fifth yeare which to her was a meere purchaſe,<note place="margin">35 H. 8. cap.</note> and was not aſhamed to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52042:153"/>
declare to all the World, that She did have and hold therby, and that it was high Treaſon for any Subject to deny, that the courſe of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is to be ordered by Act of Parliament.<note place="margin">13 Eliz. ca. 1.</note> And this power did the Parliament exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, not onely in ordering the courſe of the Crown to Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but during the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſo far as to diſ-inherit, and diſ-able any perſon who ſhould pretend Right to the Crown, in oppoſition to the Right of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; and upon this point onely did the whole proceedings againſt <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> depend, who claimed to be,<note place="margin">Thuan. vol. <hi>1.</hi> lib. <hi>20.</hi>
                  </note> and doubtleſs was Heir unto <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, after the determination of his right Line, and yet She was put to death for pretending Right by the Common Law, in oppoſition to the Act of Parliament. True it is, that this Doctrine doth not down well with thoſe that do pretend to Prerogative, aided (as they ſay) by the Act of Recognition, made to King <hi>James,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Jac. cap. 1.</note> and the Oaths of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Allegiance, which do make much parly concerning Inheritance and Heirs: nevertheleſs it is as true, that the Act of Recognition made no Law for the future, nor doth the ſame croſs the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> nor doth it take away the power of the Parliament from over-ruling the courſe of the Common Law for after Ages. Nor do the Oaths of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy and Allegiance hold forth any ſuch Obligation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heirs, otherwiſe then as ſuppoſing them to be Succeſſors, and in that relation onely. And therefore was no ſuch Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance due to <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> untill they were actually poſſeſſed of the Crown, as may appear by the Oath formed by the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth touching their Succeſſion.<note place="margin">35 H. 8. cap. 1.</note> Nor did the Law ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any Treaſon could be acted againſt the Heirs of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> untill thoſe Heirs were actually poſſeſſed of the Crown,<note place="margin">1 E. 6. cap. 12.5 &amp; 6 E. 6. cap. 11.1 &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 10. 1 Eliz. cap. 6.</note> and ſo were Kings and Queens, as by expreſs words in the ſeverall Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes do appear. Nor did the Recognition by the Parliament made to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> declare any ingagement of the People to aſſiſt and defend her, and the Heirs of her Body,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52042:154"/>
otherwiſe then with this Limitation, <hi>Being Kings and Queens of this Realm,</hi> as by the Statute in that behalf made doth appear.<note place="margin">1 Eliz. cap. 3.</note>

               <p>And laſtly, (had theſe Oaths bin otherwiſe underſtood) the Crown had by the vertue of them been pre-ingaged, ſo as it could never have deſcended to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> or King <hi>James,</hi> but muſt have remained to the Heirs of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſame power that the Parliament exerciſed in ordering the courſe of ſucceſſion in the Crown, they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed likewiſe in determining and diſtributing the Powers and Priviledges belonging to the ſame: for theſe Times were full of Novelties. The Crown had formerly fitted a childes head more then once, but it never tried to fit a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans head ſince the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times, till now, that it muſt make triall of two. <hi>France</hi> might afford us a trick of the Salique Law, if it might finde acceptance. And the unſettled eſtate of the People, eſpecially in matter of Religion, might require the wiſeſt man living to ſit at the Helm, and yet himſelf not ſufficient to ſteer a right courſe to the Harbour. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Parliament having the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to lead the way, choſe rather to purſue a Rule then to make one, and ſoon determined the point, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Crown of <hi>England</hi> with all the Priviledges thereof equally belong to a Woman in poſſeſſion as to a Man or Childe. A bold Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I ſay it was;<note place="margin">1 Mar. Parl. 2. cap. 1.</note> but that <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth was a bold Leader, and yet the bolder it was, if the conſequence be conſidered: for Queen <hi>Mary</hi> as a Woman, brought in one new Preſident, but in her Marriage a worſe, for ſhe aimed not onely at a forrain blood, but at a Prince in Power and Majeſty exceeding her own, and thereby ſeeking advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both to her ſelf and her Realm, indangered both. The matter was long in debate between the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and now had buſied their wits above ten years,<note place="margin">Sleiden.</note> at length a Supremacy is formed ſutable to the Lord and Husband of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> that could not be content to be one inch lower then her ſelf. <hi>Philip</hi> had the name of a King, and precedency,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52042:154"/>
and in many caſes not without the Allegiance of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Their offences againſt his perſon equally Treaſon with thoſe againſt the Queens own perſon; and Indictments run,<note place="margin">1 Ph. &amp; Mar. Parl. 2. ca. 10.</note>

Now if the King had broken this Agreement, either the Parliament muſt over-rule the whole, or all that is done muſt be undone, and <hi>England</hi> muſt bear the burthen. A Queen Regent is doubtleſs a dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for <hi>England,</hi> above that of an Infant King, unleſs ſhe be married onely to her People.</p>
               <p>This was obſerved by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who therefore kept her ſelf unmarried: nor did the People otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire her Marriage, then in relation to Poſterity. Few of them liking any one of their own Nation ſo well, as to prefer him ſo highly above themſelves, and fewer any Forrainer. This was ſoon eſpied by forrain Princes; and the Queen her ſelf perceiving that ſhe was like to receive prejudice hereby in her intereſt amongſt them, ſignified by her Embaſſadours, that ſhe never meaned to ſtoop ſo low as to match with any of her Subjects,<note place="margin">Bodin de Rep. lib. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> but intended to make her choiſe of ſome forrain Prince, who neither by Power or Riches ſhould be able to prejudice the intereſt of any of her neighbouring Princes. A pretty Complement this was to gain expectation from thoſe abroad, and better correſpondency thereunto. Upon this ground divers Princes conceived hopes of more intereſt then by triall they could finde. And the Arch-duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> began a Treaty, which ſeemingly was entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her, but her Propoſals were ſuch as ſilenced all thoſe of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Intereſt for ever after, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>To theſe two Powers of Determining and Diſtributing, I ſhall add a third of Deputing, which the Parliament exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed as formerly it had done. <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth had in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical matters exerciſed a Power beyond the reach of Law, and yet by Parliament had provided poſitive Laws, by which the ſame ought to have been ordered; theſe were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo confirmed in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixths time, with ſome Additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.<note place="margin">3 &amp; 4 E. 6. cap. 11. 1 El. c. 1 &amp; 2. 1 E. 6. cap. 1. 1 E. 6. cap. 2. 5 &amp; 6 E. 6. cap. 1. 5 Eliz. ca. 20.</note> By theſe, particular Commiſſioners were appointed for the making of Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions; and the King himſelf had a power Epiſcofactory, without <hi>Conge deſlire.</hi> They likewiſe limited the power of Eccleſiaſtical Courts, altered their Proceſs, reformed their Cenſures, even that grand Cenſure of Excommunication it ſelf.

               <head>CHAP. XXXVII. Of Juriſdiction Eccleſiastical in theſe last Times.</head>
               <p>IN the general, and in relation to the forrain Juriſdiction of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was like a Childe in an Ague, under Fits of Heat and Cold; but in it ſelf under the Prelacy, ſtill growing in ſtature, though not in ſtrength. <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth came in like a ſtorm that tore up Epiſcopacy by the Roots, yet a Top-Root remained intire with the ſtock, bearing ſhew of a kinde of Divinity, that though bared of the old Soile of the Papacy, yet tranſplanted into the new Mould of Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſoon conveyed a new life, which made the ſtock ſtill flouriſh, and grow into a better condition then formerly it had. Their Legiſlative power in matters concerning their own intereſt, though in outward view ſeeming their own, yet was doubly diſturbed from the Pope and the King, who though many times oppoſed one another, yet evermore were both of them in oppoſition to the Church, &amp; with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52042:156"/>
bitterneſs by their own mutual Emulations. But now the Church is come under the controll, of onely one that joyned with it for their mutual intereſt, as being both of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued in one and the ſame Ship.</p>
               <p>Two things concurred to the furtherance hereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Times were tender, and ſcarce able to digeſt the change of Worſhip (now patronized by <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth) much leſs able to digeſt the change of Government, if the ſame had been undertaken in a different way from what it was formerly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Times were alſo dark, and few ſaw the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of Prelacy, but lodged all the prejudice in the perſons that managed that calling; and certainly they had the leſs occaſion to doubt of their own judgement therein; becauſe <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth had the good providence of God to lead him to make uſe of ſuch men in that place, that were meek, and holy, and themſelves attempered in the fire of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore more tenderly affected to others in that condition; and theſe carrying themſelves like tender nurſing Fathers in their places, wrought in the people a good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their places, and that Form of Government for their ſakes; yet even in thoſe firſt Times of Reformation, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what appeared in that very quinteſſence of Epiſcopacy; in matters about Ceremony and Conformity, that might have taught wiſe men to beware. Upon ſuch grounds as theſe it went well with Epiſcopacy in theſe firſt Times of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ill with the Church in the iſſue. That Prelacy was a Gainer by the change in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready appeared; and that it ſtill gained, may further appear, in theſe enſuing Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, whereas formerly Biſhops were regardant both to the Crown and Presbytery (for ſo may the Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be accounted) in the point of Election by <hi>Conge deſlire</hi>; now they are made the birth of the Kings own breath,<note place="margin">1 E. 6. c. 2.</note> which thing was never deduced from the ancient Right of the Crown (ſaving due honour to the aire of the Preface of that Statute) for in the beſt Times it never had more then a
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52042:156"/>
power of inveſture: but from the neceſſity of the times ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted that Deanes and Chapters generally were of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſpirit, and gave little hope of good Elections by themſelves, beſides the ſtate of Learning, and Holineſs, was now at the low water mark, ſo as little ſupply being looked for to begin the work of Reformation from beneath, they began above, and ſo it proved but a weak building, for the longer time. And thus a leſſon is left to future Parliaments, that in Caſes of Reformation they are not to be ſtrictly holden to rules of Law or Preſident.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Prelates hereby had their Authority confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Act of Parliament, and ſo were now built upon a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation that formerly did hang onely upon a pin of power from <hi>Rome</hi>: For juriſdiction without Authority is but a dropſie that brings inevitable conſumption in the concluſion. And thus the Prelacy are inabled to hold Courts without contradiction, and directed in their proceſs who formerly had no good Title to either, in that courſe that they held the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though their juriſdiction was defined by the Statutes, yet in larger bounds then ever the Statute-Lawes formerly noted; and in what they claimed power, they did it not altogether upon Civill Right, but ſtill kept an awfull regard to their Perſons and Powers, as under the ſway of a Divine donation, and therefore as in thoſe matters to them, by the Statute allowed, they did proceed in the Name and under the Seale of the King, ſo in other things of collation, inſtitution, induction, orders, excommunication, and ſuch like, they proceeded in and under their own Name and Seal; and which was a Crown to all the reſt, power is ſtill given to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in caſes of faculty and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, to proceed under his own Seal, and not the Kings, as if it were a power independent upon the Crown, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto the man, neither by Statute, nor Commiſſion, but comming by ſome ſecret Influence from the very place it ſelf; although in the cleare ſenſe it is no more then a power of <hi>Non obſtante,</hi> in the point of obedience to the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:52042:157"/>
Canon Law, which by a Statute in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths time is declared no Law: But let this paſs as a mole in this faire face of Church Government. The Prelates are now become of the Vicinage, <hi>Probi &amp; legales homines,</hi> they have their juriſdiction by Law eſtabliſhed, what they looſe in breadth they gain in heigth and goodneſs of their foundation: Yet their Attire looks ill favoredly in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> eye, ſhe will have it of the old cut again, and though Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> was well ſeen in the <hi>Roman</hi> faſhion, yet when he had done all, he did no more then ſhape a garment to ſerve the preſent Interlude, neither fit to the body nor eaſie to be worne, and therefore after foure or five turnes upon the ſtage it is thrown away. Nevertheleſſe during the time that <hi>England</hi> was thus dancing the <hi>Italian</hi> meaſure, Prelacy in <hi>England</hi> held its own domeſtique garb ſo well, that neither <hi>Poole</hi> (being of <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood, not much diſtant from the Crowne, and then alſo holding the Chaire legatine, as little inferiour to the Throne) would not impoſe too much, nor Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> a Woman of a ſtout Spirit, yeeld further then ſhe liked: By meanes whereof the Prelacy looking no more to <hi>Rome</hi> then the power in appeales; and therein little more then the bare Title, plaied <hi>Rex</hi> all the while with the People, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Hereſie and the Canon Law: Which now was again made their rule; and thus as touching their Election, and Juriſdiction, they were as before. For Queen <hi>Mary</hi> did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by ſingle repeale. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being true <hi>Engliſh,</hi> both by Father and Mother, liking not this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, faced about, routed the <hi>Roman</hi> faſhion out of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; put Prelacy to its cloſe gaurd, and received it upon ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation, not only to mercy but favour, and ſo became her Vicar to exerciſe her Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, <hi>Per ſaltum</hi>: For it is hard to finde by what ſteps they gained this pitch; <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was ſupream head by ſubmiſſion of the Clergy, by reſumption, and by Act of Parliament; and as ſuch, the Power of Biſhops formerly derived from <hi>Rome</hi> ceaſed, and <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth after reſtored it anew, and ſetled the ſame by ſeverall Acts of Parliament; which <hi>Edward</hi> the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:52042:157"/>
ſixth confirmed with divers additionall Acts of further be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to them, as hath been already noted. But Queen <hi>Mary</hi> altered all by repeale of the former Lawes, and ſo left all in Remitter as before the alteration by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and did neither give or grant any juriſdiction to the Pope. Laſt of all com<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and by repeale and reſumption poſſeſſed her ſelf of juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical, and granted E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Biſhops by <hi>Conge deſlire,</hi> but never granted to the Biſhops ordinary juriſdiction by any expreſs act, other then permiſſion of them to continue in their former courſe, notwithſtanding that the foundation of their juriſdiction had been altered twice, and ſo it will be difficult for it to hold by preſcription or cuſtome, or any other way then by a kinde of Divine right which began to be pretended; yet to this day could never be made evident to the World. Whatever the ground was, the thing is plain, that Prelacy in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time had this Honour allowed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that it was upholden by Election from Eccleſiaſticall men, and held its juriſdiction as from it ſelf, and in the name of the Biſhop as Ordinary; and the power of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a ſaving in the Statute-Law, and not by expreſs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; notwithſtanding the late Preſident in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The rule of this juriſdiction was no leſſe at large, for the Canon Law was determined by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth and <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and was not revived by any Act of Parliament by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purſued the <hi>Medium</hi> of the thirty two Commiſſioners, nor ſetled other rule, but a few Canons, which (after ſome time) by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Clergy were agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but never confirmed by Act of Parliament: And ſo could never bind the Subject, and which in generall ſet forth a kind of forme of Church policy, yet no faſhion of juriſdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion or rule of proceedings in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts, but in ſuch Caſes left them to the Canon Law which was hidden in their own breaſts, and could be made ſtrait or wide as they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:52042:158"/>Thirdly, their Cenſures now grew more ſharp; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as at the utmoſt formerly they could do no more but impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or deliver over to the Secular power, and that onely in caſe of Hereſie, and yet had ſcarce ground of Law for what they did;<note place="margin">1 Eliz. cap. 1.</note> now they have an additional power, to fine and impriſon in caſes of inferior nature, and ſo can reach all that a man hath, even to his skin; nevertheleſs this was not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed unto the ordinary Juriſdiction, but given by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Commiſſion, called the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> wherein, though many others were named, yet the Clergy and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts did the work, the reſt being but in nature of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to them, in caſe they were put to the Rout. The power of theſe Commiſſioners was to execute the Queens Juriſdiction in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, ſo as the Biſhops are doubly intereſted in this work; one way, by ſuppoſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God, as Ordinaries within their own Dioceſs onely, and ſo may proceed to Excommunication or Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; the other way, by Commiſſion from the Queen, as Members of the High Commiſſion (for ſo many of them were ſuch as the Crown would pleaſe) and ſo they might fine and impriſon. They might and did, I ſay, by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but not by the Statute that gives Authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and therefore cannot be ſaid to be done legally.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, beſides the contracted power of making Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons in the Convocation by the power of the Royall Aſſent; the Queen had a power of making Laws by their conſent, in matters of the criminal part of the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>This might be tolerable for the Life of one Queen, who might be preſumed, would (if ſhe lived a few years) ſettle all things; but to ſubject the conſciences of all the people to the opinion of one Metropolitan, that might opinionate ſtrange things, and that the Succeſſors of the Queen ſhould uſurp this as a flower of the Crown, to determine what is for Gods glory in ſuch caſes, and to be always altering and patching up a Form, as he and his Metropolitan, or one of them alone ſhall think meet,<note place="margin">1 Eliz. cap. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:52042:158"/>Now amidſt the flouriſhing Eſtate of Prelacy, its no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Churches be no Gainers, but like Plants ſpending their Natures in luxurient branches, either are over-turned by the next blaſt of winde, or do wither upon the leaſt change of Sky: That the whole ordering of the Church Affairs reſted originally in the Parliament, no man can que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, conſidering what ever the Queen did, or had therein, was from the power of Acts of Parliament. And that the power of Excommunication it ſelf, notwithſtanding that the Church held it by way of reſervation or ſaving, and not by donation from the Parliament by any expreſs Act, yet was that ſaving with ſuch Limitations, as that it releived but a lame power in compariſon of what it claimed, and exerciſed in former Times; for whereas formerly the Church-men had the Writ, <hi>De Excommunicato Capiendo,</hi> at their own beck; now it will not come but upon Articles and certain Conditions.</p>

               <p>In other matters the Spirtual Sword muſt finde or make their own way, or elſe be quiet.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Church was now no leſs under the Chair and Throne, then under power of the Parliament; nor is it a wonder if it could not thrive when it was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropped: for Prelacy by the Kings arms is lifted up ſo high above the other Clergy, that the reſt of the Clergy are as much underlings to the Prelacy, as the Prelates are to the King: they dare not offend the Crown, leaſt they ſhould looſe their honors, nor the inferiour Clergy them, leaſt they ſhould looſe their Livings and Liberties; and ſo the Prelates
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:52042:159"/>
ſpeak the ſenſe of the Clergy, and make the Crown their Oracle. Thus in the Church matters the Crown is all in all.</p>

The Title of the Supreme Power in all this work hath been of late put to the queſtion, and brought us to this ſad condition of triall by Battail, and by fighting, to finde out who hath the chief power to fight: a Leſſon that might have been learned from former Generations fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, at a far cheaper rate, when <hi>England</hi> is well in its wits. Where the Law of Peace is ſettled, there alſo is the Law of War; and in what condition the Crown ſtandeth, in relation to the Legiſlative power, in time of Peace, may be ſeen in the foregoing Diſcourſe. In war he is the Peoples General by his place; yet if any impediment do befall, either by natural Diſabilities, or civil, to render the perſon incapable of the managing of the Service, there is no queſtion but the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may order the matter as they pleaſe. Examples hereof theſe Times are full, wherein we have a Childe, a Virgin, and a married Woman to ſway the Work, all of them in a very unmeet condition for ſuch a Truſt, and yet by the help they had, they managed it well enough. The power of him as King or General in the Army, is all one; but before it is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:52042:159"/>
imbodied, as a King onely, he may do ſome things in order thereto, according to the Law and Cuſtome of the Nation; yet this fals under a double conſideration of the time and occaſion. In the receſs of the Parliament, he is the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ought to move by the advice of his Councel, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion do provoke to Arms; but if the ſame befall the Parlai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then ſitting, no Hiſtory or Record do mention that ever he moved but by their concurrent advice and direction. The occaſion either provoketh offenſive or defenſive War with other Nations, or with the People of his own Nation, in the caſe of Inſurrection. Examples of War with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that may be called offenſive Wars: we have but two, one in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixths time with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which was but in purſuance of a War begun by his Father, and wherein the Kingdom ſtood ingaged, in a caſe that concerned the publique good and ſafety, <hi>viz.</hi> the Marriage of their King refuſed after promiſe made. The other was in the time of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> with the <hi>French,</hi> which ſomewhat reflected alſo upon the publique ſafety, but more upon the diſhonor of the ſame. In none of theſe did either of the Supreme Powers array or raiſe men by Prerogative, but onely ſuch as were Volunteir in that Work. And becauſe the People were ill principled in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixths time, in regard of the change of Religion, he was induced to hire forrain aid out of <hi>Germany.</hi> The Wars in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were in order to the Defence of this Nation, being ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a malignant Aſpect from abroad, eſpecially from <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Ireland, France,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries</hi>; yet were theſe Wars ſerved onely by Volunteirs, nor did any Commiſſion give power of impreſting men to ſerve againſt their wils, in any Expedition made to any of thoſe places, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions upon Record do teſtifie. If any Levies of Men were otherwiſe made, or compulſory means uſed for ſuch ends, they are to be reckoned up amongſt the <hi>errata,</hi> whereof the Parliament took no notice, in regard it ſaw the ends and iſſues of ſuch reflexions in Government to be ſuccesfull and honorable, and that all was done by Councel, and a
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:52042:160"/>
Woman popularly affected, and therefore leſs feared invaſion upon their Liberties; or otherwiſe they are to be imputed to the condition of thoſe places, being Members of the Common-wealth; as the cautionary Townes in the Low Countries, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plantations were, and ſo befall under another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of a defenſive War in caſe of invaſion and common danger therby, or by inteſtine broils, during which condition, as it is the Kings duty to levy and array men, ſo is it the duty of the People to be ready to aſſiſt one another in all ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egencies, and to defend the publique Liberty, nevertheleſs theſe Arrays are not left wholly at the Will of the King, but to diſcretion of the Councell, how far the ſame ſhall extend: For never were generall Arrayes made, where but one Coaſt was in danger, and where no conqueſt is in pretence, but only piracy or plunder. But if the diſeaſe were generall, as it was in the yeare 88. the Array was generall, and yet it was of none, but thoſe that were of the Trained bands, beſides ſuch as were Volunteir.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The arming of theſe men was alſo diverſly, there was no generall rule or Law for the arming of men ſince the times of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt to the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> but the Statute at <hi>Winton</hi>; the courſe of Tenures, I mean of ſuch men as were of the Militia of this Kingdom: So as when they were raiſed, they were raiſed in their own armes: But for ſuch men as paſſed the Seas for forrain Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as they were Volunteirs, or ſent over by the Parliament theſe were armed acccording to ſpeciall contract. But Queen <hi>Mary</hi> having gotten a ſafe reſerve from <hi>Spaine</hi> upon all adventures, and a ſtrong Intereſt amongſt the People, by upholding the Catholique party, made no bones to innovate in the point of arming of the Militia, although it coſt the People much more then was impoſed upon their Anceſtors. The pattern hereof was taken from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cabinet, the Q. being loth to be inferior to her own Husband, in bringing as much ſtrength to him as he to her, and both of them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling enough to appeare potent in the eyes of <hi>France</hi> that then ſtood in competition with them both: A yoke it was,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:52042:160"/>
yet neither the King nor Queens Will, but the Parliament put it on and ere an age expired was caſt off again: For the better underſtanding, ſee it in this Scheme.</p>

The Hackbuts with Sallets; all which was to be over and beſides ſuch Armes as men were bound unto by Tenure, or Covenant with the Landlord, or by vertue of the Statute 33 H. 8. ca. 5. beſides town-ſhips which were charged with joint Armes; Annuities and Coppy-holds were charged as goods. If the Armes were loſt in the Service the owner muſt make them good again: The defaults were puniſhable with fine by the Juſtices of the Peace, who had the view, and might preſent them at the Seſſions to be procceded upon as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſes. Here is proviſion enough, yet not as the Armes of the Militia of the Kingdom, but as a Magazine in the hands of every particular man, and as his proper goods, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the publique Service, either upon ſudden invaſion in a defenſive Warr, or when the Parliament ſhall ſend them abroad. And yet it is alſo a rule unto the Crown againſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Aſſeſſments upon diſcretion, from which it cannot recede if it mean to do right. It might now very well ſtand with the Juſtice of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to grant Commiſſions of Array, <hi>Secundum formam Statutorum,</hi> and do hurt to no man; its true, her Commiſſions of Lord <hi>Lievtenancy</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that limitation in words, yet they carried the ſenſe, for if the Crown were bound by the Law, the Lord <hi>Leivtenants</hi> were much rather, but the danger aroſe after the death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; for when King <hi>James</hi> came to the Crown, under colour of pleaſing the People, and eaſing them of a burthen, he pleaſed himſelf more, and made the yoke upon the People much more heavy in the concluſion; for where no declared Law is, there the diſcretion of them that have the care lying upon them muſt be the rule; &amp; thus came the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> blood to have pretentions to a greater Prerogative then all their Predeceſſors had, upon this ſuppoſal that the Statute of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> took away all former Lawes of that kinde, and then the taking away of the Statute of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> takes away all declared Law as to that point: But more truly it
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:52042:161"/>
may be inferred, that if all Statute-Laws be taken away, then the rule of Tenures at the Common Law muſt remain in force and no other. Nevertheleſs this Statute of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> though in force for the preſent, was not a generall rule for Armes in all places of this Nation; for the Marches of <hi>Scotland</hi> were a peculier juriſdiction as to this point. They ſtood in more conſtant need of Armes then any other part of this Nation, in regard of their uncertain condition, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their Neighbouring juriſdiction, and therfore were the Farmes of theſe parts generally contracted for, upon a ſpeciall reſervation of Armes for each particular, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now decaied are, again reduced by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to their ancient condition in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth.<note place="margin">23 Eliz. c. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond thing which may come under this generall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of arming, is, the arming of places, by making of Forts and Caſtles; which was not in the immediate determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate will of the Crown to order as it pleaſed, for though they may ſeem to be meanes of Peace and preſent ſafety, yet they are Symptomes of Warr, and in the beſt times are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon with a jealous eye, eſpecially ſuch as are not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon the Coaſts: Becauſe that Prince that buildeth Caſtles within the Land is ſuppoſed to feare the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. This was more eſpecially regarded in the dayes of <hi>Phillip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>: For when that marriage was to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized, it was one of the Articles to provide for the ſafety of ſuch Forts and Caſtles, as then were maintained, to the end they might be preſerved free from uſurpation, for the Uſe, Profit, Strength, and Defence of the Realme;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Mar. Parl.</hi> 2. cap. 2.</note> onely by the naturall borne of the ſame. And afterwards when occaſion was offered, for the building of more of that nature; a new power is given to King <hi>Phillip</hi>;<note place="margin">2 &amp; 3 Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 1.</note> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> to re-edifie or make Forts and Caſtles, which muſt be executed by Commiſſion to the Legies for ten years, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within the Counties bordering upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> and theſe perticularly named in the Statute, ſo as the Crown had not power to build in all places, nor to any end they pleaſed, nor to place therein, or betruſt the ſame to whom it would.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52042:162"/>
Nor yet had <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth that abſolute power, although not ingaged in forrain intereſts, as his ſiſter <hi>Mary</hi> was; and therefore whereas <hi>Caſtellanes</hi> had been made for life, by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,<note place="margin">2 <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 6. cap. 16.</note> and ſo the abſolute power of the Crown was barred in the free diſpoſal of the ſame during ſuch time. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gave the King power to remove ſuch as were not liked, or thought faithfull to the publique intereſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they gave no cauſe of Seiſure by any diſloyal act. The like alſo may be obſerved of the Ships and Ordnance; for they alſo do belong to the State, as the Jewels of the Crown, and therefore upon the Marriage of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> they alſo are by Articles preſerved and ſaved, for the uſe, profit, ſtrength, and defence of the Realm, by the natural born of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as touching the ordering of the Souldiery, the matter is not much to be inſiſted upon, for little doubt is to be made, but that power that raiſeth them alſo ordereth them to the ſame ends that they are raiſed: and therefore as the ſole power of the Crown doth not the one, ſo neither doth it the other, but in caſes formerly mentioned; and yet in no caſe, though the War b be never ſo abſolutely defenſive, and the Souldiers raiſed by the Kings own and onely power; yet hath not the King abſolute Authority, and arbitrary power, in the ordering of them when they are raiſed, but he muſt ſo behave himſelf to them, as to Free-men, according to Laws made by themſelves in their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative in Parliament, and therefore are particular Laws made to that end,<note place="margin">4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 3.</note> againſt undue levying and diſcharging of Souldiers, and Defaults in paying of them; as alſo againſt the Souldiers departing from their Service without Licence,<note place="margin">2 &amp; 3 E. 6. cap. 2.</note> or waſting their Arms, and ſuch as wilfully abſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Muſters;<note place="margin">4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 3. 5 E. 6. cap. 11. 14 Eliz. ca. 1.</note> as alſo for the preſerving the Caſtles Forts, Ships, and Munition for War, from being with-holden from their due uſe, or from burning or deſtroying.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as touching the charge of the War, and pay of the Souldies. Its evident, that in all offenſive Wars the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier was paid by the Crown, although they might be ſaid in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52042:162"/>
ſome manner to be in order to the Defence and Safety of the Nation; nevertheleſs where the ſame was ſo apparent to the people, it was the common courſe in theſe Times to have often Parliaments, and often Subſidies, which were no leſs in a good meaſure ſatisfactory to the Crown for the Charges of the War, then Teſtimonies of the Peoples good Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Government of Affairs, and ſo accepted at their hands: The particular Records will warrant all this. For of all the Wars in theſe Times (that of 88. excepted) not any of them were ever managed at the Peoples charge by Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by Retribution. So happy were theſe Times, wherein the People looking upon the Crown, as under a kinde of infirmity of Childhood or Womanhood, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bear a kinde of compaſſionate regard thereunto, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out jealouſie at Prerogative, could condiſcend and allow the Crown its full Grains, and ſomewhat more, yea more then was meet for ſome other Princes to deſire, or the People to give up; and yet more happy were they, wherein the Crown knew no intereſt but in dependence upon the People good, and ſo underſtanding were rightly underſtood.</p>

               <p>IT is but little that can be ſaid of Peace in theſe Times, wherein ſo little freedom was found from forrain preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and inteſtine irregularities, or both; and yet the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were never more reſolved againſt the former, nor ſecure againſt the later, and had God to Friend in all. But moſt apparently was this obſervable in the Times of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> whoſe Government took up four parts of five of theſe Times, whereof we now treat. She was a compleat Conquerour of War and Treaſon, and therein the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritor of the Fate of her Grand-father <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52042:163"/>
with advantage, for ſhe out-faced all Dangers by her onely preſence, having therof had more experience then any Princes that ever poſſeſſed her Throne; yet ſhe was wiſe enough to beware againſt the future; conſidering her condition to be the laſt of her Line; that the next behinde her was rather likely to trip up her heels then ſupport her Train; that the Pope narrowly watched every opportunity; the diſtance between him and the Throne, being no greater then the breadth of her onely Perſon. It may well therefore admit of excuſe, if the Statute of the 15. of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, concerning Treaſons did not give ſatisfaction, although therein if ſhe were ſolicitous, her Subjects were more. Some kindes of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences were made Treaſon by Statute-Laws, which formerly appeared not ſuch, becauſe they appeared not at all; and yet in the opinion of her People the Queen was too ſlack in the making, and more ſlack in the execution of them. The People had ingaged themſelves deeply againſt the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and it was not ſafe for them to go back; they go yet deeper, and without any poſitive Authority, leading the way, they enter into an Aſſociation amongſt themſelves, for the Queens ſafety; and it was well liked by the Queen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe knew it was well meant, although by ſome it was miſtaken;<note place="margin">27 Eliz. cap. 1.</note> nevertheleſs to take away all Exception, a Law is made in purſuance thereof, and ſo the Work is reduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an ordinary rate, though the publique Danger was ſuch, as might well have digeſted an extraordinary undertaking.</p>
               <p>I intend not to enter into the particulars of theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the new ſtamp, becauſe they are but temporary, and in their ultimate reach tend onely to the ſafeguard of the Queens perſon, in order to the intentionary ſenſe of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. although not within the explicit words of that Law. Onely this is obſervable, that though the Times were full of malice, yet was not all malice looked upon as fatal, nor every Expreſſion thereof Treaſon, or privity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Treaſon (although the Crown it ſelf was not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein) but reduced to an inferiour degree, called <hi>Miſpriſion,</hi> as if they were willing rather to conſtrue under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:52042:163"/>
for miſtakings, and thereby overlook much of the malignity of thoſe Times, then to make ſtrict inquiſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every <hi>Punctilio</hi> of Offence.</p>
               <p>As touching Felony, the Rules were various; ſome were of a new original, as that of <hi>Gipſies</hi>; others formerly ſuch,<note place="margin">5 Eliz. ca. 20.</note> afterwards ſaid aſide, are now revived with advantage, as Conjuration, and Buggery:<note place="margin">cap. 16, 17.</note> but Imbeſſellings by Servants of their Maſters Goods, made Felony for a time by <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, is by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> made perpetual.<note place="margin">2 E. 6. cap. 29. 5 Eliz. ca. 10.</note> Some Felonies are made ſuch within a certain precinct, as Men-ſtealers, and other Crimes upon the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Borders. Others formerly made Felony are now unmade,<note place="margin">cap. 15.</note> as that concerning Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and divers formerly protected under the refuge of Clergy, are now barred of that reſerve. Such as are thoſe that command Councel, or hire others to commit Pettie Treaſon, Murder, or Robbery, 4 <hi>&amp;</hi> 5 <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar. cap.</hi> 4. Stealers of Horſes, Geldings, or Mares, 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. Robbers of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Booth, or Tent, by Day or Night, 5 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. Pick-pockets, or Cut-purſes, 8 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. And Women-ſtealers, 39 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 9. And ſome Crimes made Felony impeachable, onely within a certain time, and not upon a cool ſuite; ſo as upon the whole heap of the Account, the zeal of the Times will appear to be more hot, by how much iniquity appeared more hainous, and that wicked men waxed worſe as the Times waxed better. More particulars of this nature, and of other Offences of inferior note might be ſuperadded; as alſo of Laws, of alteration and amendment of Proceſs and Triall, and of Common Aſſurance and Conveyance of Eſtates, of particular Revenue; all which might be inſiſted upon, if need were, to clear out yet further the concluſion of the whole matter, which I haſten to accompliſh, led on by a natural motion, that grows in ſpeed the nigher it comes to its end.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XL. A ſummary Concluſion upon the whole matter.</head>
               <p>IN the ſtating of this whole account; I ſhall firſt glance upon the naturall conſtitution of the People of <hi>England,</hi> and then gather up the ſcattered Notions into one form, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one doth not a little illuſtrate the other, and ſhew the ſame to be radicall and not by any forced inoculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The People are of a middle temper according to their Climate: The <hi>Northern</hi> Melancholly, and the <hi>Southern</hi> Choller, meeting in their generall Conſtitution doth render them ingenious and active; which nouriſhed alſo under the wings of Liberty, inſpires a courage generous and not ſoon out of breath. Active they are, and ſo nigh to pure act that nothing hurts them more then much quiet; of which they had little experience, from their firſt tranſmigration till the time of King <hi>James</hi>; but ever were at work either in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (as before the <hi>Norman</hi> times) or after in repairing their ruines, occaſioned by tempeſtous pretentions from <hi>Rome,</hi> and Forrain Princes, or by earth-quakes of Civill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about the Title between the two Houſes of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> or intrenchments of the Crown upon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the People. But King <hi>James</hi> conquering all enmity, ſpake Peace abroad and ſang Lullaby at home: Yet like a dead calm in a hot ſpring, treaſured up in ſtore ſad diſtempers againſt a back Winter. Their Ingenuity will not allow them to be excellent at the cheat; but are rather ſubject in that kinde to take then give: and ſuppoſing others as open hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as themſelves, are many times in Treaties overmatched by them whom they overmatch in Armes. Upon the ſame account they are neither imperous over thoſe beneath, nor
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:52042:164"/>
ſtubborn againſt them above; but can wel diſcern both perſon and time. Man, Woman, or Child, all is one with them, they will honor Majeſty where ever they ſee it. And of the twain tender it more when they ſee it ſet upon infirmity: as if they knew how to command themſelves only in order to the publique good.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs they love much to be free, when they were under awe of the Popes Curſe, they bore off deſignes by the Head and Shoulders; but afterwards, by watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, and fore-ſight; and having attained a light in Religion that will own their Liberties, of them both they make up one Garland not to be touched by any rude hand, but as if it were the bird of the eye the whole body ſtartles forthwith, the allarme is ſoon given and taken, and whether high or low none are ſpared that ſtand in their way. This they do owe to the <hi>Eaſterne</hi> People, from whom they fetch their Pedegree. So as the only way to conquer them is to let them have their Liberties, for like ſome Horſes, they are good for carriage, ſo long as their burthens are eaſy and ſit looſe upon them, but if too cloſe girt they will break all, or caſt their load, or dy. And therfore Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> gained much to the Crown by faire carriage, good words, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyance, which was not ſoon diſcoverd nor eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with. But <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth by heighth of Spirit and great noiſe, and therefore was no ſooner off the ſtage but what was gotten by the ſnatch was loſt by the catch, and things ſoon returned into their ancient poſture again.</p>
               <p>The firſt Government of the People before their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of <hi>Germany,</hi> was in the two States of Lords and Commons. The Clergy came not into pomp, and power, till <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, and ſoon came to the heighth of a third ſtate appendent to the former, and ſo continued till <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time; then they began to decay in power, and in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time utterly loſt the ſame, and ſo they can no longer be called a State although they ſtill keep ſtate.</p>
               <p>The two States of Lords and Commons in their tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, being then in the nature of an army of Souldiers, had
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:52042:165"/>
a Generall by their Election, under whom after they had obtained a Peaceable ſetling, they named anew by the name of <hi>Konning,</hi> or the Wiſe man, for then was Wiſdome more neceſſary then Valour. But after the Clergy had won the day, and this <hi>Konning</hi> had ſubmitted himſelf and his people to their Ghoſtly Father, they baptized him by a new name of <hi>Rex,</hi> and ſo he is ſtiled in all written Monuments which we owe only to Eccleſiaſticks; although the vulgar held their appellation ſtill, which by contraction, or rather corruption, did at length arive into the word <hi>King</hi>; a notion which as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten changeth the ſenſe as the aire: ſome making the perſon all in all, others ſome in all, and ſome nothing at al but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of State. The Clergy gave him his Title in the firſt ſenſe, and are willing he ſhould have a power over the Eſtates in order to their deſigne, which then was to rule the King and by him all his People, he doing what be liſteth with them, and the Clergy the like with him. The Saxons take the word in the ſecond ſenſe, for though they had put upon the Common-Wealth one Head, and on that Head one Crown, yet unto that Head did belong many eyes and many braines, and nothing being done but by the common ſenſe; a power is left to him much like to that of the outward Members, Executory.</p>
               <p>In time of War, how unruly ſoever the humors be, yet muſt the Law be his rule; he cannot ingage the People either to make, continue, or determin, any offenſive War, without their conſent; nor compell them to arme themſelves, nor command them out of their Counties for War, nor impoſe Military charge upon them againſt their free conſent, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the known Law.</p>
               <p>In calmer times much rather, he can neither make new Law nor alter the old; form new Judicatories, Writs, Proceſs, Judgments, or new executions, nor inable or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able any conveyances of Eſtates. He may ſeem poſſeſſed of more power in Church government, yet <hi>De jure,</hi> can neither make nor alter Doctrine, or Worſhip, or Government in the Church: nor grant diſpenſations, or Licences Eccleſiaſtical; nor
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:52042:165"/>
Commiſſions of juriſdiction other then according to the Law. And as a cloſe to all, by one oath taken at the Coronation he not onely giveth to the People ſecurity of the Peace and good behaviour, but beareth witneſs that he oweth Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance both to the Law and the people, different from that of the Peoples in this, that the Kings Allegiance is due to the Law, that is originally from the Peoples Election, but the peoples to the King, under a Law of their own framing.</p>
               <p>This leadeth on the conſideration of a higher degree of power then that of Kings: For though Law as touching morallity in the generall be of Heavenly birth; yet the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Lawes ariſing from common Prudence concerning the Honour, Peace, and profit, of every Nation; are formed by humane conſtitution, and are therefore called <hi>Honeſta,</hi> or <hi>juſta,</hi> becauſe by common vote they are ſo eſteemed, and not becauſe any one man ſuppoſeth them to be ſuch. The words of the Summons to the Parliament doth hold for this, <hi>Quae de communi conſilio ordinari contigerint,</hi> and the words in the Coronation Oath, <hi>Quos vulgus elegerit,</hi> do ſpeak no leſs, whether they be taken in the Preterperfect tence or Future tence, the concluſion will be the ſame: True it is that in all, Kings are ſuppoſed as preſent; yet is not that valuable in the point of Councell, which is the foundation of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law. For as the beſt things under Heaven are ſubject to infirmity; ſo Kings either ſhort or beyond in Age, or Wit, or poſſibly given over to their luſts, or ſick, or abſent, (in all which the name of a King adds little more to the Law then a ſound) yet all the while the Government is maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with as much Honour and Power as under the moſt wiſe and well diſpoſed King that ever bleſſed the Throne.</p>
               <p>This is done in the convention of States, which in the firſt times conſiſted rather of Individuals rather then Specificalls. The great men doubtleſs did many things even before they ſaw the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhore; that <hi>Tacitus</hi> noteth, yet in the publike convention of all, did nothing alone til of one Houſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came two. The particular time of the ſeperation is uncertain, and the occaſion more: It may be the great Lords thought the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:52042:166"/>
myſteries of State too ſacred to be debated before the vulgar, leaſt they ſhould grow into curioſity: Poſſibly alſo might the Commons in their debates wiſh the great men abſent that themſelves might more freely vote without angering their great Lords: Nevertheleſs the Royall aſſent is ever given in the joynt convention of all, but how a double negative ſhould reſt in the Houſe of Lords, one originally in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the other in the ſole Perſon of the King, when as in no caſe is any negative found upon Record, but a modeſt waving to anſwer of ſuch things as the King likes not, is to me a myſtery, if it be not cleared by uſurpation: For it is beyond reach, why that which is once by the repreſentative of the People determined to be <hi>Honeſtum,</hi> ſhould de diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined by one or a few, whoſe Councells are for the moſt part but Notionary, and grounded upon private incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and not upon experimentalls of moſt publique concernment; or that the vent or <hi>Soit fait,</hi> which formerly held the roome onely of a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> of the regall will to execute the Law then made (as his Coronation Oath to execute all Lawes formerly eſtabliſhed) ſhould now be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be a determination of the juſtneſſe or honeſty of the thing: When as this Royall aſſent is many times given by a King that knowes no difference between good and evill, and is never competent Judge in matters that in his opinion do fall into contradiſtinction between his own private intereſt and the benefit of the People.</p>
               <p>However unequall it may ſeem, yet both that and other advantages were gained by the Houſe of Lords after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration was once made, as many of the ancient Statutes (by them only made) do ſufficiently hold forth, which although in the generall do concern matters of Judicature, wherin the Lords originally had the greateſt ſhare, yet other things alſo eſcaped the Commons Vote which in after ages they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into their conſideration again. And the condition of the People in thoſe times did principally conduce hereunto: For untill the <hi>Norman</hi> times were ſomwhat ſettled, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages had ever been uncertain, in the changes between
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:52042:166"/>
War and Peace, which maintained the diſtance between the Lords and their Tenants, and the Authority of the one over the other, ſavouring of the more abſolute command in War. And after that the Sword was turned into the plough-ſhare, the diſtance is eſtabliſhed by compact of Tenure by Service, under perill of default, although in a different degree; for the Service of a Knight, as more eminent in War, ſo in Peace it raiſed the minde to regard of publique Peace: but the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the plough ſupporting all, is underneath all, yet ſtill under the common Condition of free men equally as the Knight. Peace now had ſcarcely exceeded its minority before it brought forth the unhappy birth of Ambition; Kings would be more abſolute, and Lords more Lordly; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons left far behinde ſeldom come into mention amongſt the publique Acts of State, and as uſeleſſe ſet aſide; this was the loweſt ebb that ever the Commonage of <hi>England</hi> indured, which continued till Ambition brought on contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the great men, and thence the <hi>Barons</hi> Warrs, wherein the Commons parting aſunder, ſome holding for the King, who promiſed them Liberty from their Lords; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſiding with the Lords, who promiſied them Liberty from the King; they became ſo minded of their Liberties, that in the concluſion they come off upon better advantage for their Liberties then either King or Lords, who all were Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before their reckoning was fully made. Theſe Wars had by experience made the King ſenſible of the ſmart of the Lords great Intereſt with the People, and pointed him to the pin upon which the ſame did hang; to take which away, a Deſigne is contrived to advance the value of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to levell the Peerage, that they both may draw in one equall yoke the Chariot of Prerogative. The power of the Commons in publique Councells was of ſome efficacy but not much Honour, for their meetings were tumultuary; time brought forth a cure hereof, the flowers of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are by Election ſent to the Repreſentative; and ſo the Lords are matched if not over-matched, the People leſſe admiring the Lords, and more regarding themſelves. This
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52042:167"/>
was but a dazle, an eclips enſues; for Kings having duely ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Nature of Tenures between the Lords and Commons, look upon it as an out-work or block-houſe in their way of approach: Their next endeavour is therefore to gain the Knighthood of <hi>England</hi> within the compaſs of their own Fee, and ſo by priority to have their Service as often as need ſhould require, by a trick in Law; as well for their own ſafety in time of War, as for their benefit in time of Peace: This was a work of a continuing Nature, and commended to Succeſſors to accompliſh by degrees, that the whole Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>England</hi> is become no more the Lords till Kings be firſt ſerved; and thus the power of the People is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved into the Kings Command, and the Lords muſt now ſtand alone, having no other foundation then the affections of the People gained by beneficenſe of Neighbourhood, and ordinary ſociety, which commonly ingratiates the inferiour rank of men to thoſe of higher degree, eſpecially ſuch of them as affect to be popular. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh found out this ſore, and taught his Succeſſors the way to avoid that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of jealouſy, by calling up ſuch conſiderable men to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Court, without other wage but fruitleſſe hopes; or under colour of Honour to be had by Kings from the preſence of ſuch great men, in their great Traines; or of other Service of ſpeciall note to be done onely by men of ſo high accompliſhment. And by this meanes Lordſhip, once bringing therewith both Authority and Power unto Kings, before Kings grew jealous of their greatneſs, in theſe later dayes is become a meer jelly, and neither able to ſerve the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Kings (if the People ſhould beſtir themſelves) nor their own any longer: henceforth the Commons of <hi>England</hi> are no mean Perſons, and their repreſentative of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, as if Kings will have them to obſerve him, he muſt ſerve them with their Liberties and Lawes; and every one the publique good of the People: No mans work is beneath, no mans above it, the beſt Honour of the Kings work is to be,<note place="margin">Ae<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
