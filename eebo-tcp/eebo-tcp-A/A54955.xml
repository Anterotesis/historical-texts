            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

GRACE
THE
Dutchess of BOLTON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen the Curious hand of Nature draws
Perfection, when Beauty like yours ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
all are inspired with Wonder and
Delight, every Heart is filled with Pleasure, because
every Heart is full of you; Pardon my Ambition,
Pardon the daring of a Pen, too weak to Coppy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable
Graces; but if none may aim at your love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Picture, unless they have Power to do you Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
your Praises must be left unsung, and you for
ever adored in Silence.</p>
            <p>I own the following Play claims not the least
Merrit to such a Glorious Protection, but that is all
I have to boast, all the reward my Towring Fancy
covets, is centred in my Illustrious Patronesses; this
will to after Ages make my Trifle Sacred, when
they behold prefix'd such Names, whose Virtues
Historians, Poets, and never dying Fame shall join
with me to Eternize.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103326:3"/>
The Play is partly a Translation from the <hi>French;</hi>
what I added, if it had not the power to please, had
no Immodesty to offend, which I hope will be an
attonement with your Grace, for other Defects in my
Younger Brother; I wou'd have perswaded the
World to prize Desert, before the Gifts of Fortune,
but the major part are too sordid to like the Example,
few are so truly Noble to fix without Intrest, which
makes so very few truly happy in their Choice.</p>
            <p>I wou'd have deferr'd Addressing to Your Grace,
till I had aimed at an Offering more Worthy, but
my Charmed Eyes being lately bless'd with the sight
of You, have let into my mind such a Beautiful Idea,
that I liv'd in pain till I express'd my Admiration.</p>
            <p>To be Great and Good, and Exquisitly Fair,
are the happiest Epethets Fate bestows on Mortals;
that they are justly Your Graces due<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will, I am sure,
be confirmed by an Universal Voice; and that you
may Live long to adorn the Titles, whose Lustre
receive addition from that Beauteous Fame, is the
Eternal wish off</p>

            <l>YOur Servant Ladies fair—And how I pray,</l>
            <l>Like you my Dress and Garniture to Day.</l>
            <l>'Faith I've survay'd my self from Top to Toe,</l>
            <l>And find I make a most Accomplish'd Beau.</l>
            <l>If all these Charms, to win a Fortune fail,</l>
            <l>I'le leave Champagne, and drown my shape in Ale;</l>
            <l>What care I if I'm bigger than a Whale?</l>
            <l>But why should I despair of being Blest.</l>
            <l>Can Female Heart withstand a Man thus Drest?</l>
            <l>As I was lately Walking in the Mall,</l>
            <l>Heav'ns! how the Ladies flock'd about me all.</l>
            <l>I'le vow they came so Termagantly Fierce on,</l>
            <l>I fear'd some strange designs upon my Person.</l>
            <l>Says one, and faith the Nymph was well enough,</l>
            <l>Mind, with what Air and Grace he takes his Snuff,</l>
            <l>The second cry'd, and pray observe his Muff.</l>

My Sword-Knot charm'd the fancy of the third,</l>
            <l>Poor simple thing she scarce cou'd speak a Word.</l>
            <l>And, I replies the fourth, Alass! am Slain,</l>
            <l>With the Celestial motion of his Cane.</l>
            <l>The Fifth was strangely smitten with my shape;</l>
            <l>Nay hold, I cried, you wont commit a Rape?</l>
            <l>For mine, and for your own dear sakes be quiet,</l>
            <l>Or Ladies I'le endite you for a Riot.</l>
            <l>But hold—there's something I was begg'd to say,</l>
            <l>In favour of our modest Authors Play.</l>
            <l>He hop'd you'd like—but Ha! the Bird is Flown,</l>

            <l>No matter, I'le say something of my own.</l>
            <l>Know then, our Comedy first came from <hi>France,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Which here perhaps, its Fortune may advance.</l>
            <l>Ladies, be you as kind as you are pretty,</l>
            <l>And you Gallants as merciful as Witty:</l>

                  <p>But too true, my poor <hi>Betty.</hi> Oh! I shall dye. To disrespect me in

                  <speaker>Betty.</speaker>

                  <p>A Dutchess; who had the confidence to thrust my Coac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <speaker>Betty.</speaker>
                  <p>A very impertinent Dutchess. What! Madam, your person shining all
o're with Jewels, your new gilt Coach, your dappl'd Flanders with long Tails,
your Coachman with cocking Whiskers like a Swiss Guard, your six Footman co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Lace more than any on a Lord-Mayor's day? I say, could not all this
imprint some respect in the Dutchess?</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Not at all. And this beggarly Dutchess, at the end of an old Coach,
drawn by two miserable starv'd Jades, made her tatter'd Footmen insult me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I spoke to her with a meen and tone proportionable to my Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page;
but she, with a scornful smile, cry'd, hold thy peace, Citizen, struck me
quite dumb.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I swear to thee, that I had not the force to answer to this deadly
Injury; but order'd my Coachman to turn, and drive me home a full gallop.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Betty.</speaker>
                  <p>But, Madam, pray consider things rightly, and take this as it was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
for, I conceive, it was not against your Person, but your Name, that this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
was design'd; and why do you not make haste to change it?</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. <hi>Rich.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>That I have resolv'd; but I quarrel daily with my Destiny, that I
was not at first a Woman of Quality.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Betty.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, well, Madam, you have no great reason to complain; and tho'
you are not as yet a Woman of Quality, you are at least very rich; and you know,
that with money you may buy Quality, but Birth very often brings no Estate.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>That's nothing; there is something very charming in Quality, and
a great Name.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Betty.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet sure you'd think your self in a worse condition, Madam, were you,
as many great Ladies in the World are, who want every thing; and, in spight of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103326:5"/>
their great Name, are known, but by the great number of Creditors, that are
bawling at their Doors from morning till night.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Betty.</speaker>
                  <p>Methinks, Madam, 'tis a great satisfaction, to dare to go out at the great
Gate, without being in danger of having your Coach and Horses seiz'd by a troop
of Serjeants: What wou'd you say, if you were oblig'd to return home in a filthy
Hack, as several of Quality have done?</p>

                  <p>Yes, yes, I do imagine, and I had rather be the beggarliest Countess
in the Town, than the Widow of the richest Banker in <hi>Europe.</hi> Well, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd;
and, I will be a Countess, cost what it will; and to that intent, I'll abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

Fool, Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> is now no more Kin to me than my Footman; nevertheless the

                  <p>Ha, ha, ha, her pride, ill nature, and Self-opinion, makes her Follies
unpitty'd. I'de fain be rid of the nauseous conversation this House abounds with.</p>

                  <speaker>Betty.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed my City Lady turning Courtier, has a hopeful stock of Teachers;
Mistresses grown old, and then forsaken, who, in the tatters of their Prosperity,
pass upon her for decay'd Quality, Female Gamsters, and Fools in abundance.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Lands.</speaker>
                  <p>They are affected without beauty, or good cloths, tho' that alone's
enough to spoil one that had both; their mirth is insipid, and their raillery abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and yet not poinant. For my part, I've almost lost my gay humour for fear
of being like 'em; if I continue here one Week longer I shall 'en exchange the
Town, where I expected such pleasure, for my old <hi>Yorkshire</hi> retirement.</p>

                  <p>Cou'd you but get Mrs. <hi>Clerimont</hi> to ye, Madam, she'd immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
you to the Beau Monde, where Wit, Gallantry, and good Breeding, are

                  <p>She is so at a distance, but you see all mysending will not prevail with

                  <speaker>Betty.</speaker>
                  <p>I know not, unless 'tis being here; for truly I fancy, tho' my Mistress is
fled to <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> she is as much despis'd by the real Quality, as she is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jol'd
by the Pretenders to it. You say you are not acquainted with Mrs. <hi>Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
tho' related to her: So perhaps she guesses you of our Stamp, and avoids
yee. For Heavens sake, Madam, how came yee hither?</p>

                  <speaker>L. Lands.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, I'll tell thee, <hi>Betty,</hi> I was married a meer Baby to a very old
Man, who, in his Youth, having been a Debauchee, and dealing only with the
worst of our Sex, had an ill Opinion of all, kept me like a Nun, broke off all
commerce to <hi>London,</hi> or indeed with any body, not excepting Relations.</p>

                     <hi>Lady</hi> Landsworth,</speaker>
                  <p>Most patiently; never found fault with his Woollen Shirts
or Night Caps, lay all Night to the Musick of his Cough, or the ratling of his
Ptisick, writ nothing but Receipts, scarce ever open'd my Mouth, but out came,
how do ye do, my dear; did the Sirrup I made last please ye?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <speaker>Betty.</speaker>

and Jewels. This Mrs. <hi>Rich</hi>'s Husband was my old Man's Banker, and once I
saw her in the Country, besides she had money of mine in her hands, so to her,
and this dear Town I came; resolving to perticipate all the innocent Liberty my
Youth, my Wealth, and Sex desires.</p>

should have griev'd enough for thee, for thy unspeakable loss, without additional
Calamities: What will become of me; must I wait at proud Men's doors, and
cring for an admittance? Can I flatter the puft up Lord, and fawn for a vile
Office? Debase my immortal Soul to feed this moulding Clay? 'Tis impossible,
'tis more than Man can bear!</p>

                  <p>I'l tell ye, with a truth equal to the freedom I use; (for sincerity is
all the Virtue I pretend to.) It was my first Fate to be kept by an Alderman, but
he was formal, stiff, and too suspicious for my humor; so I fled from him into
the Arms of a brisk, airy, young Collonel; then the Days were spent in Revels.
When he went to <hi>Flanders,</hi> I Campaign'd it too; but, ah! as I had dress'd my
fluttering Hero up, like any Bridegroom, a saucy Bullet came and spoil'd the
work of Tailers, Milleners, and fifty Trades besides: Down dropt the Beau.</p>

                  <p>Alass! grieving for the Dead wou'd spoil us for the Living. Now,
I'am a Perquisite of a Country Gentleman; a Man of Gravity, and one of the
pious Senators; a great Stickler against Wenching and Prophaneness. He allows
me Wealth enough, and Liberty enough. Besides him, I have two or three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlopers,
each fancying himself my Particular, when, for my part, I care nor a
straw for any of 'em. But, ah! amongst my numerous Lovers, I know not how,
<hi>Myrtillo</hi> has crept too near my Heart;—That's meaning you, Sir.</p>

Fires; the first, the very earliest Product of the Year, Dainties sit for Queen's
Tables, still load the Board; far fetch'd Wines, such as unbend the Soul from
Cares, and lock up every Thought that wou'd disturb us;—yet amidst this
flowing plenty; amidst this Crowd of Flatterers, my aukward Fancy sickens at
their offer'd Loves; loaths their soft Indearments, and builds its sole happiness
in manly roughness like Yours.</p>

to behold you with Indifference; those Eyes were made to Conquer! Oh pity,
that they scatter Contagion only! I could crawl low as the Earth to touch that
beauteous hand; but when I reflect, a sensless Fop, for some vain Present, may riffle

have guess'd in the Country: This Damsel is worth Thousands, and she'd fain
throw away some upon my Master: he, modest Fool, (begging his pardon) he'le
none on't, forsooth. So I, being cunning, have found out her Humour by her
Appurtenance, her Waiting Gentlewoman, and Lyed my Master into her good
Graces; told her he was a meer Debauche; she partly believ'd me, but comes
to you to be confirm'd; if you can lye, Landlady.</p>

the kind Words which she will hear no more. What can secure me from
