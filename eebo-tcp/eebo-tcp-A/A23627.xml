            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT this Treatise waited
for a share in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of receiving your Lordship
<pb facs="tcp:59240:3"/>
from <hi>Venice,</hi> Arguments are not
wanting; for besides the Interest
that I bear by living within your
Influence, There is a common
Obligation to appear in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Train of those that grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
attend your Return from
your Embassy, from a just Sense
of the Blessings these Kingdoms
receive from your Employment,
and your Country by your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and Presence. But that I
inscribe it to your Lordship's
Name, I am more necessarily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
in that it is not easie to
find so fit a Patron and so great
a Judge: Your Greatness that
impowers you to countenance a
Book, hath a Brightness more
than common to your own Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and hath all the Worth and
<pb facs="tcp:59240:3"/>
Beauty, that Integrity, Virtue
and Goodness can give it. As
a Judge how you are Qualify'd,
I shall not attempt; but only
observe your Lordships excellent
Temper to be so great a Help,
as that just Notions of things
are not to be had without. As
a Character is better waved, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
being seldom done in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications;
so I am happy that
it is not the least part of your
Character, that your Excellencies
have a Foundation above that of
common Applause. However
you need it not, I had the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to observe your Lordships
first Years, possess'd of the Esteem
of one who had a Fame for
Learning, among those that are
acknowledged to be the greatest
<pb facs="tcp:59240:4"/>
Masters of it in <hi>Europe;</hi> and now
your Riper ones in the nearest
Imployment of the greatest of
Princes.</p>
            <p>The Subject, My Lord, gives
you a Right to it; who accounts
the noblest Subject is to know a
Man's self, and who makes the
Practise of doing Good your Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
And the Touches I have
given at Humane Nature, your
Lordship's several Travels abroad
have given you a particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
for. I have offer'd somewhat
at the two grand Problems, the
Mechanism of Life, and Use of
Respiration, and at the Distinct
Notion of Humane Nature. But
I own the Thoughts are shatter'd,
and not exact, What your Good
<pb facs="tcp:59240:4"/>
Opinion Supports, I shall set
above the Rate of common Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Knowledge of the Specifick Seat, and
Nature of the Disease, and Energy of the
Remedy, as it gave the Rise and Increase to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
so is what the Art of Physick consists in,
and its Excellency depends on. This is evident in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and appears in every Disease and every
Remedy; The Jaundies are known to Physicians
to admit of a various Cure, as Trouble, Obstruction
of the Catamenia, Feavers; or an Indisposition of the
Intestines may produce them. The Exactness requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to this, is further seen in the ill Success that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
the empirical Vse of the Cortex in Pthises
and Feavers, without distinction of the Nature of
the Symptom, and Propriety of the Medicine. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far
the best Methodists fall short, that sit down
short of this Inquiry, is experienced in Feavers,
wherein, the taking Indications indiscriminately,
without respect to the Nature of the Cause, could
never be made consistent with success, by the most
judicious and happy Practicer which that Method
hath yet produced.</p>
            <p>The present Subject is one of the noblest in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
not only for its Generosity and Vniversality,
but for their extraordinary Virtue in some, and
those very many and various Diseases, wherein
they are the most constant and sole Remedy: And
that these Waters are liable to the same Inconvenience,
<pb facs="tcp:59240:6"/>
I have been induced to believe, by their
frequently ineffectual and improper Vse, and the
Neglect of so certain a Remedy, which I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in some Diseases, wherein the Patients must
be supposed to have drop'd for want of them: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of which I shall have occasion to glance at
presently. I shall therefore make no Apology for my
advancing somewhat towards so great a <hi>Deside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum.</hi>
As to what hath been done on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
by the Inquiries which some of our greatest
Naturalists who have engaged themselves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it
have made, I need only say, that neither their
Principles have been discover'd, nor the Nature
of the Salt or Spirit of each Water have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
examin'd, whereby as they have been wide
from either, so they advanced only loose Conjectures
at some unknown Principle; the most particular
Inquiry by the very accomplish'd Physician and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
Naturalist Dr. <hi>Martin Lister,</hi> to whom
the World is obliged for what he hath publish'd, and
my self what he was pleas'd civilly to communicate
to me, of the Condition of the <hi>Scarburgh</hi> Spring,
takes notice of the Condition of the Wells so far, as
to observe the Efflorescence of their Earth, and their
ferreous Stone, which he observes to be an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
on all our Mineral Springs and Baths, as I
remember without distinction, and tho' rightly judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Salt a Native of the Soyl where it is found,
yet on the same Account neither arriv'd at the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Principles of this Salt, nor its differences,
nor traced its reason and Derivation. The Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat
Waters which were reducible to a few general
<pb facs="tcp:59240:6"/>
Heads, I have given only Samples of, to both I have
preserved their experienced Virtues, and to the
Purging ones, suggested some from their Nature;
and in this Account I find one Benefit that results,
that besides helping to the distinct Nature of each
Water, I have discover'd, or at least made useful,
some Waters of the same Virtues with the justly
celebrated ones, whose distance made them still want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to other parts of the Kingdom, as those of <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow</hi>
and <hi>Knaresborow</hi> are. My account of the
reason of the Operation of the Waters, is so wild and
imperfect, as to be nauseous to my self, and afford
me no other satisfaction, than that I have hinted
what ought to be done; yet because an insight into
this, promotes the understanding of the Nature of
the Diseases, and in what their Cure must consist,
and so the true place of the Vse of the Waters; the
Hints I give being somewhat informing, instead of
troubling the Reader with the Reasons of so great
Negligence, I shall choose to induce him to forgive
it, by giving them a little light here, that may a
little clear my sense in this matter. Both the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat
and Purging Waters have some Virtues in
common to restore the Appetite, remove nauseous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Stomach, Pains of that and the Head,
to cool, to allay Flatulencies, and the Cramps and
disorderly Motions in the Body, and flatness of the
Spirits that attends them: And this the Nature of
the Principles well accounts, which are thus far the
same; for as Water, the common Vehicle in both,
demands Consideration, as being most unfermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and so a great assistant in suppressing Flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
<pb facs="tcp:59240:7"/>

from ill Concoction, and other Failings of the
parts occasion'd by fermented Liquors; so the main
Principle of the Purging Waters, I have detected to
be a Chalybeat Juyce. These Waters, where they can
reach and pass, and suit by their grossness, seem to
answer the Specifick Nature of the Chalybeat in
some measure. On this account these sometimes
succeed in the Cure of a Diabetes, as my honoured
Friend, and learned and compleat Physician, Dr.
<hi>Clopton Havers</hi> inform'd me, upon a Case I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
him in; and as the Learned Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> hath
recommended them; which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> peculiar Province
of the light Chalybeat ones, as being a Disease of the
Glands, which else these are unserviceable in. The
Purging Waters by their grossness, have therefore
their Effect chiefly on the <hi>Viscera</hi> and first ways,
which their Salt qualifies them to cleanse and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate.
Thus they are found to cure Head-achs,
Vertigo's, Cramps, Colicks, and the Jaundies, when
their Cause or Fomes is in the Stomach or Bowels, or
is Hypochondriacal. They are suited to the Diseases
likewise that attend the grand Climacterick, as I
call that of 49, by joyning, correcting and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
the Faeces of the Chyle, which then is grosser
and more Alkalisate and wants discharge: As to
differences of the Salts of these Waters, as well of
the heavy Chalybeats, experience made them of
weight with me; having, beside what I mention in
its place, observed the Jaundies cur'd more generally
by those whose Salt was affine to common Salt, and
that elder Persons receiv'd most Benefit from those
that were Chalybeat, and that the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
<pb facs="tcp:59240:8"/>
requir'd a distinct regard to the Salt: Of
what power unheeded differences of Salts are in our
Bodies, besides experience, I found it so reasonable,
in that Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rioline, and common Salt, and Niters,
precipitate each other, that it farther proved it
self by the successful use this directed me to make of
it in Fluxes of Blood, immoderate Flux of the
Catamenia, and some other Diseases of this Year,
which by many reasons I judged to be Nitrous,
wherein I found Chalybeat Preparations to be the
only effectual Remedies, which were so unlikely, as
commonly in the Chlor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sis promoting such a Flux,
that I found it pretty hard to perswade some to the
use of it. And the proper use of the more Acid
Chalybeat Waters in Fluxes of Blood make them a
peculiar. The Virtues of those and the Atramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
appear in their place. The last of these are least
efficacious and most numerous, the Instances of that
at <hi>Leez Place,</hi> and at the much honoured Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Southcot</hi> Bar. his Seat, are sufficient for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.
The light Chalybeats are the most abstracted
of this kind, and so fit to the Recesses of Nature
which the others cannot reach, and to shew the power
of the Mineral. The Virtues of these in various
affects of Body and Mind, and Hypochondriacism
which produceth them are constant: The Diseases
are so odd which these and only these do cure, that
they ought to be specified, and shall be done under
these Heads; The first drawn from the part affected,
which is the Glands, and this Rule is so extensive,
as to hold in all Diseases of the Kidneys, and
Glands of the Joynts. Their happy use in the first, I

Dr. <hi>Havers,</hi> which I found confirmed by this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
Effect upon their very first taking, that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of passing, they stop'd their Vrin, which was
little to be expected from so powerful a Diuretick
as they else are found to be: And the perfect Cures
of the Gout by these Waters are frequent, and have
been well attested to me. A second Mark or Head,
The Diseases they are Specifick in, is characterised
by the Nature of the Waters, and Diseases they
Cure, as the Waters clear, depurate and suppress
exorbitant Fermentations, and as Diseases are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the Luxury of the Feculency of the Chyle,
and effort of fermented Liquors, among which are
the Diabetes and the Gout, which are often produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the use of fermented Liquors, which by how
much the staler the Beer is, the more sure the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and are incurable, without altering the
Drink in great measure: To which I may add, that
the Gout is said never to have assaulted any
Drinker of Water; and many Indispositions are
under this Head, which are thus pointed at by the
Cause. A third Consideration that points at the
Cases these Waters are proper in, is the Occasion
and time of the Disease, and brings us all the
Diseases at the Climactericks. A fourth regards
the Spring and part of its Origine, which is the
Brain and Mind, and indicates all Diseases of
any kind, produced by Trouble and Grief. The
Cure of the Fistula and Feavers may make other
Heads, and give a rise to greatly improveable
Thoughts. Now in order to the just and ready use
<pb facs="tcp:59240:9"/>
of these Waters, that promptuary of Experience can
only be certain that nicely digests Observations, and
specifies the Cases; this only can readily point out the
Remedy, and hinder their improper Administration,
and discover Cases wherein they are effectual, which
may be so remote to our sense of them, as never
would encourage our attempting the Application of
the only proper Remedy. And this I insist on the
more, because I have had reason to believe, this
escape to have been even from the generality of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians.
This may be particularly instanced in a
Dropsie, wherein the Waters are very improper, and
often hasten the end of the Patient; and yet in the
same Disease, when it proceeds from grief of Mind,
they are a reasonably certain, and the only Remedy;
I say in this I have more than once known a Patient
dye under the fruitless Application of a regular
Course of Physick; for a Dropsie, when the success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
use of the Waters in the same case oblig'd me to
conclude the ill Success to be owing to the want of
distinguishing the Disease, and knowing the proper
Remedy, next under that Providence that disposed
the Concealment: Besides Diseases from this Cause
are irregular and various, and not bear any other
method of Discovery or Cure. Distempers of the
Climactericks are as numerous, and their Cure seems
to depend as much on the same Discovery; and I
have often seen Consumptions at 21 and 49 cur'd
by the dexterous Application of Chalybeats, the
Waters chiefly in the Cure of which by common
Methods and Intentions their Physicians had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
unsuccessfully: And as this helps us to the
<pb facs="tcp:59240:10"/>
Knowledge and Cure of many Diseases that else lye
conceal'd from us, so it assists our Judgment in
making due and true Prognosticks: And I have
been pleas'd with the evidence of Art, when I could
not readily cure a Disease, <hi>viz.</hi> an Epilepsie that
came on at 27 in the true Prediction of its declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and departure at 30; and of the Diseases that
assaulted at 14, superceded at 18.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apoplexy</hi> which is cured by the more acid
Chalybeats, and reliev'd by the light ones, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
the common Notions of the other glandular
Diseases, as it is an Affection of the very Root of
Life it self, and requires a particular Consideration
in order to inform us how and where this Remedy is
proper; for although it is evident, that it is an
Affection of the medullary part of the Brain, whence
Sense and Life is distributed; yet with submission
to better Judgment, I conceive the Accounts of
this Disease are at a loss about the Production of
it, when they come to the immediate Cause, and the
long Excursion this Enquiry demands, as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable,
so is so seasonable also, by reason of the
Increase and Frequency of this Disease here espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the Country, where this Year it has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
more than ever, that I question not but the
Acceptableness of the Disquisition will excuse it.
I shall distinctly view the Nature of an Apoplexy,
and Disposition it consists in; The Causes of it;
The Differences; and lastly, The suitable Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Indications. The general <hi>Phaenomenon</hi>
upon Dissection of those that dye of this Distemper,
being an Effusion of Blood upon the Brain, Authors
<pb facs="tcp:59240:10"/>
do generally agree in placing the Production of this
Disease, in an Obstruction made at the Brain, and
must be allow'd to be produced in the Cortical part,
and conceive this to be made by some Congestion in
the Blood-Vessels, and which the Learned Dr. <hi>Cole</hi>
supposes may be of viscous or serous Matter, as it
is either in quantity, or freshly excited, or else Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypous
Concretions, or any other obstructing Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to admit which, the Brain is pre-dispos'd by
its Laxity or Openness; in which likewise, the bare
Distention of the Arteries may suffice to produce it.
I shall with all Deference to those great Authors,
and particularly the last, humbly offer my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
though more grosly, yet as it appears to me,
and best explains the Benefit of the Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in this Case, thus, That an <hi>Apoplexy</hi> is a
Disease of the <hi>Cortex cerebri,</hi> not founded in any
Obstruction, though often attended by them, but
consisting in the Ruin of its mechanical Crasis and
Temper, which is such as Steel restores, and Niters
destroy, the Causes and Nature of which, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to other Glands, and produceth a Paroxysm,
by a Hamorrhage or Admission of Flatulent Parts
consequential to this; which Distemper the <hi>Suicus
nutritius</hi> may arrive at, either by Age or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
contracted upon Congestion, and grossness of
the Chyle, or receive by Particles communicated
from the Air, or all joyntly; besides violent Causes,
and so may truly be said to be seated not in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary
Vessels, but Glandular Ducts. But as they
wrongfully charge the Blood-Vessels with the cause,
in that an Apoplexy may be produced without any
<pb facs="tcp:59240:11"/>
of this, as is clear from Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s Instance; so
they seem incumbred in the explaining the Reason
of the Abolition of Sense and Motion; and in the
place and nature of this Congestion; the Mistakes
in the Nature of this Distemper, seem to me to be
owing to the ill Notion of Animal Mechanism, and
use of the Brain, wherein they suppose a Circulation
or passage of Animal Spirits, so necessary to Life,
as that the Interruption of them sufficeth to abolish
it. The Difficulties of which way of Solution, are
taken notice of by all the Writers on this Subject,
rather than explain'd. My Sense in this Matter
I shall give, by considering, first, the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
the Brain can suffer without this Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>2ly,</hi> The Vital Mechanism of the Brain:
And <hi>3ly,</hi> The necessary Cause or Reason of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
as appears in the Brain. And to be brief,
first, it appears from the Dissections in <hi>Wepfer,
Willis,</hi> and others, that all the passes of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits, at once, cannot be obstructed; nor a
Compression of the Brain and Cerebel, nor an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation
of the Brain, or its Meninges, produce
it; there are as just Exceptions lye against plenty
of Blood; nor is it from Stones generated. Abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Serum may be without it, and Water beap'd
within the Cranium and Ventricles. And <hi>Plater</hi>'s
Instance proves, that a Carnous, Schirrhous and
Fungous Tumour on the <hi>Corpus Callosum,</hi> produced
Stupidity and Death without an Apoplexy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> I shall consider the grand Design of the
Brain, and its vital Mechanism, of which, though
it be inextricable in its private and more recluse
<pb facs="tcp:59240:11"/>
Motions, yet thus much appear. Although Animal
Mechanism is compound, and Respiration is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the Motion of the Blood, to which the Lungs
are accordingly framed, and upon which Motion
Life depends; yet as the Pulse of the Heart is
perform'd by the Nerves, so the Air Atmospherical,
upon whose obstructing or fixing, so as to hinder its
Elasticity, Life so suddenly ceaseth in some Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
seems to act only on the Nerves, as in those
that have membranous Lungs, where no more Blood
circulates in their Lungs, than is necessary for the
supply of the part; whereby the Air seems to serve
the Circulation in other Animals, for greater force
and greater Heat; for those Animals first nam'd,
are colder, and live long without Food, and so
both Air; and the Niter of it, is useful with equal
Pace, and in equal Degree, to the Motion neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
at the Lungs, to the fury of the Circulation
of the Blood, and to the Nourishment to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd;
and it is observable, that the <hi>Par vagum</hi>
and intercostal Nerves, which are the Instruments
of involuntary Motion, serve both Lungs and
Ventricle. The use then of this Heat in the Blood,
seems to prepare a due Elasticity in the Chyle,
that is, to serve the Brain or parts of it, be it
the Spirituous part in what sense soever, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to some Disposition of the Brain; for
in the external Air there is, besides all this (but
answerable to this) a due degree of Elasticity, or
quantity of elastick parts, or compressure of them
necessary to Life, which is proportion'd to the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Animal perhaps, but certainly adapted
<pb facs="tcp:59240:12"/>
to the Spring of Life in the Brain, as is seen in
Fish which live by the Air, yet dye in the open
Air; and is confirm'd in Whitings which swim
deep in the Water, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d so with us are not liable
to be taken by Nets, and dye instantly upon being
taken out of it. The Brains of Animals are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
adapted to this use, those who use the
greatest force of the Air, as Birds, have the
Cortical part vastly larger in proportion than men,
no doubt to separate the Air, and perhaps corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
the Brain, and their Lungs fix'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
and Fish have least Brain and Cortex too.
The Nature of Life, and use of the Brain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus stated to consist in the justice of a Spring;
it is easie to conceive, that the enlarging of the
Elasticity in the Brain, as well as without, is
enough to destroy the Mechanism of Life. Now
though we know not the work of this within the
Brain, yet it is difficult to believe, and not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Experience, to allow any other cause that
deprives Life so suddenly as some elastick parts,
that can communicate too large a Degree or Scope
to it, which the Blood conveighing so much Air
may easily do, which the difficulty of Respiration
thereon depending evidences. By this alone may
we understand, to account for the appearances of
the disorders of the Brain upon Dissection, which
now come to be consider'd: As this will reach and
account for those Apoplexies that shew no Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
nor Irruption at the Brain, as those of old
Age, and gives a reason why they attend the Old
and not the Young: So we shall find those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb facs="tcp:59240:12"/>
wherein the Brain is forced by the Blood,
confirm this account. It is observable from the
Dissections of all, that the confirm'd Apoplexy is
produced by the Effusion of Blood at the Basis of
the Brain out of the Carotid Artery, especially
the anteriour Branches of it, and at which place
all that have time complain: And though gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the Effusion of Blood is large on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
yet it is observable to my purpose, that the
breaking in of the Blood only on one side should
take away Life; and which is more, that the
quantity of two spoonfuls of Blood at the Base of the
Brain should as well effect it; in both which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
or cases, the Effusion supposing a Stoppage
of the Spirits, could not so soon have produced it.
And as the last named Case of <hi>Fernelius</hi> came
upon a stroke on the Eye, so the like hath happen'd
on a stroke on the Neck by a fall, in that History
of Wepfer.</p>
            <p>And although this Consideration of the Vital
Spring in the Brain, doth not exclude other ways
by which it may suffer, beside the giving it too
much Scope, which I here assign, yet I see no
reason to entertain any other, since other Causes
are either impossible, or not constantly produce this
Disease; and since (excepting the Case of old
Age, which requires a distinct Explication) it is
ever produced by a Rupture of the Vessels, as an
imperfect one by admission only of unfit and rapid
but small parts. Again, to proceed further in the
Inquiry into the Nature of this Disease, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
our selves how this Rupture comes to pass,
<pb facs="tcp:59240:13"/>
we are to consider, that it appears that the Condition
the Blood-vessels receive, by the Stoppage of the Canal
by the grumous Blood, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccidental hardness or cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of it barely consider'd by nature, are render'd
ineffectual to be the occasion of this Disorder; the
reason therefore of it, is to be had without, as the
Vessels may be joyntly respected or affected where
they are more minute. The Nature of this is to
be sought from what the Compages and Affection
of the part afford: Now how truly the Brain,
understood as a Gland, accounts for this, must be
prov'd by the Disorders those Bodies suffer, and
the Analogy they bear to each other. That the
Affections are common, it evident from the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi,</hi>
Varicous Knots and Hydatides, found in
Apoplectick Brains at the Secretions, as at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Plexus Choroides.</hi> The justness and genuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this account, appears farther in the part
and cause of this Disease, in that the Rupture it
made principally at the anteriour Branches of the
Carotid Arteries nearer the Origin of the Brain,
where accordingly those that are seiz'd complain;
and that the ruptur'd Vessels are those that have
gone a Compass, and descend from the <hi>Anfractus</hi>
of the Brain. The reason of this last, is to be
understood by the Observations of <hi>Bellini</hi> and
<hi>Malpighius,</hi> who inform <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that the Winding
of Glandular Vessels, and so of the <hi>Anfractus</hi>
of the Brain, is to give the Blood time to stop and
separate through the Glandular Pores. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his solves the Reason partly, why the Rupture is
not, where the Blood comes, with greater force;
<pb facs="tcp:59240:13"/>
so the Imbecility of the part hath hence a Reason,
and points at the occasion of it, in that it is where
the greater part in proportion of the Chyle, or nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious
Iuyce, must therefore be deposited, which
when weigh'd together, with the Consideration
that the Error of the Chyle induceth all Diseases,
and allows the Effects of the Air, and that the
Fit so often seizes after full Meals, and that
this Disease keeps pace with the <hi>Affectio Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriaca,</hi>
if not increas'd in time together
with it; and that its so often being induced by
trouble of Mind, evidences the same analogous
Cause and Reason, are natural, and to me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Arguments. How this Rupture of the
Arteries comes upon an Obstruction or heaping of
Chylous parts in the Glands, comes next to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd:
It is observ'd by <hi>Wepfer,</hi> in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Dissection, that the Brain there was much
intenerated, where the Effusion of Blood was
made; but whether the Laxity of the Brain, or
Openness of the Pores, of the <hi>Tabuli,</hi> or <hi>Siphons,</hi>
that receive the Chylous part of the Blood, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the Brain liable to this Irruption, is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
and not to be answered; so provided we
know the Nature of the Parts that occasion this,
is not material. I own the Vses of the Blood in
joynt-service with the Nervous parts to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inquiry. The Delatoryness of the Glands,
when obstructed in producing a Rupture of the
Blood-vessels, be it in the Iaundies, Asthma, or
Dropsie, and the liableness of the Glands to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
especially upon exclusion of new saline
<pb facs="tcp:59240:14"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb facs="tcp:59240:15"/>
parts from the Blood, to preserve as well as supply
them, induce me to believe much herein to be
owing to some Quality they may conceive, if not
sufficient to corrode the Artery, at least to destroy
their own Crasis. Accordingly I shall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Cause without us, that induceth this
Disposition to this Disease, as sufficient to direct
us, which is the Air. Though I have some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that draw me to an Opinion, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
which compose, or are bore in our Atmosphere
which variously affect our Bodies, are so gross,
as to allow a Conception of their operating, on
the score that they are Effluvia, either of the
constant or new produced Bodies in the Earth,
but owe their Energy to some Quality depending
on the various Figure or Disposition, or other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
they are liable to receive in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere:
Yet not to argue from so questionable
Principles, I shall rather indeavour to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the Nature of the parts of it by their effect,
and as they appear the occasion of this Disease.
And this Distemper making so extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
at particular times, it is reasonable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the Disposition of the Air, whereon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
the Increase of the Disease, and wherein
it consists. The grand increase of it upon the
great Frost 1683, appearing sufficiently by the
Bills of Mortality, lead the Learned Dr. <hi>Cole</hi>
to do so good Service to this Inquiry as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, and makes it a <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of which is no small Direction. But as I
think the Constipation or Obstruction made by
<pb facs="tcp:59240:15"/>
admission of the Nitrous Particles not satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
without accounting for the new Capacity
they have obtain'd beyond what they have in
other Frosts, and the Difficulties of admitting
them; so it seems evident to me, that the rise of
this Disease or first increase is of a longer date.
And to offer my sense of this matter, the Apoplexy
seems to me to be one of the fix'd temporary Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
which as they result not from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Changes of Season and Weather, so are
rooted in some more subtile parts of the Air,
which Weather and Season may assist by giving
them a liberty of exerting themselves, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a supply. And because I never yet observ'd
any sudden leaps ordinarily, though I nicely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the Air as I could, made in the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of new Diseases; I was ready to judge from
the rise of this at the declension of the Rickets,
that the actors of both were parts of equal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
and not much differing in Nature. And
I confess the Experiment of the Marbles seem to
favour a Notion, that there is differing degrees
of Subtilty in our Atmosphere it self, and so in the
parts lodg'd in it. I shall not attempt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining,
though there is great reason to believe
the matter to be Nitrous by its Effect, and its
Cure. The Reason of this Disease, and Nature
of the Condition of the Air producing it, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
more clearly to be seen in the Observation
of the particular times of the grand Efforts of
the Air in producing it; in which we ought to
<pb facs="tcp:59240:16"/>
observe the general Effects of the Air on all
Bodies, and carry on the Inquiry by the Effects
and Power it exerts on Animal ones. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this evidence or detection of the parts affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is liable to exception, that differing Diseases
are produced often at once by differing parts or
distinct qualities in the operating Body, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in so mix'd a one: And again, as the
more subtile cause is unknown, so if we discover
the Particles of the Air, or disposition of it, that
conveighs the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ss, we have small advantage.
I must observe, that I am of Opinion, that the
Nature of the Air, and the Disposition of it, to
which Diseases owe their rise, are more discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
than they at first thought give hopes of, and
that in so great a measure, as to make the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
serviceable in the known Diseases. And any
Man, I think, will be reconcil'd to my Opinion,
that will take the trouble of tracing Diseases in
conjunction with the Air and Seasons; for the
Difficulties are in great measure solv'd, by barely
distinguishing between the Diseases produced by
single Seasons, and observing the constant tenour
of the Humour or diseasy matter, and how it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
alterations from variety of Seasons, and
that as the place of the Disease is partly or chiefly
owing to the first, so the Nature to the last of
these.</p>
            <p>That the present case depends on these evident
Causes, may reasonably be concluded, not only
from the increase of it joyntly with these, but also
<pb facs="tcp:59240:16"/>
that it traced in its containing and procatarctick
Causes, which require no more to explain, than
what the common effects of the Air in other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
exhibit, and the nature of the Air thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
accounts for. The first time to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
and which assists us in the discovery of the
Cause of this Distemper from the occasion of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
extraordinary, is the great Frost. To avoid
prolixness, I shall only observe, that as that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
determine the matter to the Brain, nor account
for the increase of this Disease at so great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and is contradicted by experience; so the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence
of such a Season may give a lift to this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
on other Considerations than the conveighing
of the Frosty and grosser nitrous parts, and that
may be of more subtile or distinct Parts, that may
be contain'd or mix'd with them, that may better
account for this <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> which must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to be vastly supply'd by so great a Frost, which
may be allow'd either to feed the more subtile, or
increase them by the Precipitation and Congestion
of the Parts they bring, and separate and leave.
Indeed the grand Continuation of the Increase, makes
this Deduction necessary, both of its Subtilty and
Nature. The last of these must most disclose it self
at the time of its abounding in the highest degree,
and this must be fix'd at this present Year 1698,
the reason of which I shall now examine; that I
rightly fix the Inundation and Exorbitancy of the
invading Matter on this, or this and the last Year,
I need not indeavour to evince, being so extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
<pb facs="tcp:59240:17"/>
as that the like number of Apoplecticks
were never yet observ'd in this or past Ages; and
indeed by the generality of the Vertigo's that have
invaded, which must be referr'd to the same assault,
may be said truly to be Epidemical. That the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
concern'd in this is nothing obscure, or besides
what is evident and obvious appears, in that first
the other Distempers raging at the same time were
uniform, and differ'd only in place, the matter of
which is plainly enough Nitrous, but particularly
(because the Nature of that differs) its Qualities
consist in Acidity, such as will not preserve from but
promote Putridness, Subtilty to penetrate, and Liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to flow with the Juyces; which Qualities appear
easily in the Effects in both the Chronical and Acute
Diseases of those Years last past: It much illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
this account, to observe the steps made in
the producing this general Disposition in the Air,
which I must here but touch at, without explaining.
It is very notable that a Glandular Acidity at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the Diseases in 94; Epilepsies in Children,
and Nervous Rhumatisms in the Grown, advanced
with the great Mealdews in 95, both seated in the
Membranes and at the Head. In 96 remarkable
for sudden Changes of Heat and Cold, rag'd Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsies,
Vertigo's, and lax Tumours and Vlcers of
the Throat, that came as Colds. Through the
Subtilty and Increase of this matter, which seem'd
fitted to weaken the containing parts (the unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of the preceding Year reasonably assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
it obtain'd admittance at the latter end of the
<pb facs="tcp:59240:17"/>
Year (which was wet and windy) to the Interior
Glands, as I call those that serve Life it self.
And now appears an odd Distemper, that seiz'd
with Faintness, and Inquietude, and <hi>Deliquiums,</hi>
and a yellowness of the Skin, and dry Cough. Vpon
Dissection of one of these Bodies, I discover'd a
recluse Abscess in the Lungs, invested with a tough
Coat, and containing thick Pus, without any open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
external, or into the <hi>Bronchiae,</hi> but was fed
by a small Duct from the largest Gland of the
Lungs, which Gland was grumous, and look'd and
felt like powder'd Chalk. The Pancreas was in the
same state, which occasion'd the yell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ess as I
conceive, and the <hi>Thymus</hi> emaciated. And by
this insight I cured others of the same Disease by
Emulsions of Alkalys, first to remove the Acidity,
and then by a Sudorifick <hi>Decoctum amarum,</hi> and
closing the Course with Chalybeats. At the very
same time Apoplexies insulted in a strange degree,
and Colds affecting the Head: These all held
in 97, which ending in a long and gentle Frost,
upon this in 98. This Disease became Epidemick,
in that it seiz'd so frequent, and was the issue of
other Diseases, and from the general invasion of
Vertiginous cases. Acute Diseases of this Year
proved to me the Matter to be an Acid Nitre dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to corrupt and exulcerate, by which the
Diseases seiz'd usually with a Catarrh, and ended
with some Abscess. Putrid Feavers began with
the Spring and Catarrhal, yet reigning from the
declining Summer; great fluor of the Blood ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
<pb facs="tcp:59240:18"/>
at the same time, with Dysenteries, Gripes,
and ill-natured putrid Pains in the sides: To all
which the Cures happily succeeded that were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by this reason of them, and confirm'd to
me, that the matter in the Air was advanced to
that Nature, as to be more dispos'd to Putridness
and Corrosiveness, which I therefore assert to be
the Nature of the Air in the present case; in
many these Vertigo's and Pains in the Head blinded
the sight almost; my opinion that in this the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Niter consisted, and that it flow'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with grosser parts of the Air, was favour'd
by the Observation of the Retinue of his Excellency
the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi> in their return from <hi>Venice</hi>
this Spring; who upon their passing the <hi>Sene,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
from the Wind which blew in their face, an
unusual effect of common Cold, which was a Tumor
of the whole Face, and universal Scabbiness agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the before observ'd Qualities of it. I shall
only add one Particular more, which is, that I
have observ'd that those places that have been most
troubled with Apoplexies, have been level and
moist, so as in one Village so situate, these that
dy'd went off mostly on a sudden.</p>
            <p>Having thus asserted the containing Cause of
this Disease, and shewn the Procatarctick to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a Congestion of Chyle in this as in other
Glands, and to consist in the spoiling of its due
Temper and Crasis, by inducing a Corrosive and
Nitrous Quality: The Disposition to this Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb facs="tcp:59240:18"/>
appears likewise to be contracted by <hi>Replentia</hi>
and <hi>Otium,</hi> and which ruins the Tone and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Glands the same way, but soonest thick
Fermented Liquors, especially the stalest: The
dexterous Effect of these in all Diseases of the
whole Glandular kind, is sufficiently known. How
much by this Observation we may hope to have
this Disease within our power, though we cannot
mend the Air, may be understood by considering
that the Air hath no power to change our Bodies,
but as it hath a Delinquent Chyle to work on, as
I note afterwards. But as this plainly exhibits
the best method to prevent, so also that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat
Waters are the best Cure. Their power in
Diseases of the Glands, to remove Obstruction,
and restore the due Crasis and Temper of them,
I have shewn; and as the Steel is the only proper
Body to do this, which mechonically serves our
Life, at least in preserving this Tone and Crasis,
which Alkalys and Niters destroy: So it seems to
affect the Glands only, since in a Chlorosis it is not
easie to conceive the so sudden raising the Blood
by so small quantity of even a Tincture of Steel
otherwise, but to keep to experience as it appears
that in these Distempers of the Glands, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat
Waters are the only Remedy; and as the
light sort deobstruct best, so the more Acid sort
are peculiar in this Disease, more powerfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
and correcting the Nature of the Chyle,
and rendring it more fluxile and suppressing Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage,
and to strengthen and make firm the
<pb facs="tcp:59240:19"/>
Brain, which is observable in their Virtues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.
But to remove a Disposition to this Dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ease,
the Time, or State, or cause of it, may
either make the use of these Waters exceptionable,
or require a particular regard either before, or in
Conjunction with them, I shall consider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
thence arising, and the distinct regard they
claim; that these may be distinguish'd with some
certainty, and may be of use to direct us, there is
the highest reason to believe, that since in all the
Cures recited by Authors, the Nature of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
is ever found answerable. Now considering
that an Apoplexy consists in the Admission of parts
to the Brain, that either are Aerial, as is what
the Blood conveighs, or Elastick and Flatulent,
as is the Matter in the Aged; and that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of both is owing to the Crasis and Temper
of the Brain, as of the other Glands destroy'd or
degenerated; which is perform'd in the Chyle by
the Air, or degeneracy of the Juyce by other means,
as may abundantly be prov'd to be the Case of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhages
in general; we are hereby help'd to
understand the reason of the variety of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
that have been observed to set aside Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectick
Fits. And although in a Case of such
danger, Applications are justly made of universal
Intention, yet they usually succeed as they attend
the State and Nature of it, as well as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the strength of the part; and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are thus best urg'd, that respect the Matter
as confirm'd when Old: <hi>2ly,</hi> When capable of
<pb facs="tcp:59240:19"/>
Revulsion by Bleeding, when that confines it, as
in the Plethorick, by Vomits in full Feeders:
<hi>3ly,</hi> By promoting the Secretion by Catharticks,
as in the Phlegmatick Blisters, <hi>&amp;c. 4ly,</hi> By
thinning and lessening the Flatulency of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and driving it forward either into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory
Vessels, or at worst through the Brain,
on which strong Apoplectick Waters are observ'd
to effect, when the Fit is without a Procatarxis,
or changes into a Hemiplegia, being small in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.
Again, Bleeding may be the only Remedy
which ought to be urg'd, from the Nature of the
Disease impelling, joyning and indicating, as a
Disposition to Haemorrhages, or stopping of one;
and thus I have more than once, by Bleeding
chiefly, made an Apoplexy remove, and change it
self into a Gout in the Foot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Some Cures have been perform'd by
Medicines that regard only the Nature of the
Matter, by resisting the Flatulency and Coldness
of it, and perhaps by strengthning the Brain
withal. And that is to be further and more
nicely considered; for beside the general Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which the State of the Matter requires to be
particularly insisted upon, with reference to the
Fit, either to be remov'd or prevented; There
are also some Conditions of this Disease, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to be respected in curing a Disposition to it,
which it receives from the Constitution of the
Part, Confirmedness of the Matter, Quality of
<pb facs="tcp:59240:20"/>
the Matter, and lastly, the Causes original or
concurring of this Distemper: For although these
Waters are experienced a compleat if not sole
Remedy in the two common Cases of Apoplectick
Persons, a Haemorrhagious Disposition, and a
Sanguinary Plethora, as likewise in a total In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperature
producing them; yet a preparatory
Course, or Medicines conjunctly applied, may be
necessary: First, In old Age, by warming Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Medicines, or moisture of the Brain, in
which astringent Chalybeats, as <hi>Crocus Martis
astringens,</hi> recommended by Dr. <hi>Cole,</hi> or <hi>Ens
Veneris,</hi> which I more use. Secondly, If inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate,
or from confirm'd Hypochondriacism,
where the Brain may be calculous by a previous
course of the Light Chalybeat Waters. Thirdly,
The Matter may be Cold and Flatulent, as the
Case recited by <hi>Sennertus,</hi> in which <hi>rotulae</hi> of
<hi>Ol. Carui</hi> and <hi>nuc. moschat.</hi> succeeded, if we
consult the genius of the Humour in the advanced
degree of it of this present Time, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to take off the Acidity by Alkalys, in which
Coral ought to have a share joyn'd with Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives
and Discussers of <hi>Flatus;</hi> and to back
these with Astringents and Purgers interpos'd.
Which I may confirm by an Observation I have
made in some that I have cured; that upon the
first removal of the Fit, the Humour remov'd
into some other part as the Feet, and appear'd
in a puffy cold Humour. And in others I have
found an Apoplexy to proceed from the bare tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
<pb facs="tcp:59240:20"/>
Matter of the Rheumatick Pains, and
thus in most of those that are taken; and as
this accounts well why Cold should increase them,
so that the Cause is the same, appears in that
this Catarrhal Matter, when it falls on the
Lungs or Bowels, hath usually produced Blood,
as I find daily. And this I observe the rather,
because it clears my proof of the Matter to be
Natural, and that the increase of this Disease
is owing to an increase of the same Matter in
the Air, its Subtilly Coldness, Flatulency, and
Corrosiveness, which the Coldness and Moisture
of this and the preceding Years favour. The
last regard is to the Causes concurring to the
Production of it, as the Chlorosis, stopping of
wonted Flux or Haemorrhages.</p>
            <p>The Course to be applied in all these appears in
Authors, and need here only to be intimated.
Where none of these are coincident, besides ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Evacuation to be premitted, only good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersives
may be recommended; the most successful
of which, that I have observ'd, I have nam'd
afterwards.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Affectio Hypochondriaca,</hi> which I have
observ'd to be reliev'd by them all, but when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
to be cured by the light Chalybeats, and
secur'd by the more acid, to which the Purging
Waters elected according to the requisite Qualities
ought to precede, needs no Address to shew their
place beside the reciting their Symptoms. What
<pb facs="tcp:59240:21"/>
is necessary to contribute to the Cure or Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of it, being a change of the Course of Living
to a more natural one, instead of particularizing
I choose to illustrate, by shewing the antecedent
Causes of it, and that it is a Disorder of the
Recrements of the Chyle. As this is a Cardinal
Distemper, of them, I have enlarg'd the thought
not unusefully to the other turns these receive at
the several grand Points of Man's Life, and the
Diseases thereon depending: And though I could
not be particular in the Explication of this, yet
the mistakes about Humane Nature are such,
even of seemingly sound Persons, but are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
in the Hypochondriacal; I have offer'd
somewhat notwithstanding at the general Reason
of the Distemperature of Body and Mind, and
the universal Efficacy of this congested Matter.
I am of Opinion that by this thought, more of a
just Notion of our Nature may be retrieved, and
of the Efficacy of Mineral Acids in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinction
from others, how they confirm our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and particularly why Steel, and how and on
what Account, and what the Temper of the Glands,
and so of the Brain, consists in. The Nature
and Qualities of the Air, prov'd by its Effects,
both ought and might be, I fancy, better clear'd,
and the Truth and Excellency of this Method be
prov'd in the Acute Diseases likewise, wherein. I
have found it of happy Vse; which I hint, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Prosecution of it, because I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
Feavers themselves to have enough of their
<pb facs="tcp:59240:21"/>
reasons appear to distinguish the Success of the
Observer of them; but as these either want place
or room here, so instead I am oblig'd to excuse the
whole discoursive part of this Book, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the Impertinencies and Imperfections of it,
being only casual, and written <hi>raptim,</hi> and much
of it never read over by me till printed; and were
design'd but as Hints, and beside the design of the
History; so that the great Precipitation with the
Impediments, made much or all of it so far from
being exact, as to be thoughtless almost: In which
part I reckon the Enumeration of the Sentiments
of Authors of Apoplexies, and the distinction of
soms Symptoms: And in what I offer to the Learned
Dr. <hi>Cole,</hi> of the Seat of the Disease, it is <hi>Osci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanter,</hi>
and is submitted to his Judgment; my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
being to explain and carry on the Inquiry,
not to oppose. In my examining the Waters I
was exact to the best of my Skill, and had it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
at the Springs, trusting only to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<hi>Barnet, Stretham</hi> and <hi>Upminster,</hi> the last
of which was sent me by the unquestion'd hand of
Mr. <hi>Jefferys</hi> of <hi>Brentwood.</hi> And least an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
should lye against the cleanness of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Pyrites found in the Purging Wells,
in that the common Copperas stone should be found
mix'd with them at <hi>Harwich</hi> at the base of the
Loamy Cliff, I must observe that they are only
found among the gravelly lays that fall from the
top, and that be it, however it sufficeth to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that these Stones are only a common Base of
<pb facs="tcp:59240:22"/>
this sort of Earth, as well where are no Purging
Springs, as where there are, and so not of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Original.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Why I publish any thing so loose and
unaccurate, I can only say, that the Discourses
which were written off hand, had not the leisure for
Thought, that the experimental part had (which
was in good measure done before I left <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
and so before I enter'd on Practise) neither had I
a prospect of an Opportunity to perfect. And all
my Thoughts I offer no otherwise, than with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to better Judgment to correct.</p>

Mineral Waters, and their more distinct appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siteness

that lye against the use of the <hi>German
Spa</hi> with us, which it is not amiss to advise the
Reader of. For not only the Waters suffer so
much by their long passage, as at best to retain
but a diminish'd Proportion of their Virtue
equal to their Tincture of Steel; but also
that Water, which by reason of its long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Tincture, is sent abroad, and is
medicinally drank with us, if it did retain its
Chalybeat Power (which it seldom doth till
it is used) is of the heavy and less effectual
sort in the more nice Cases, and its Salt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to an Alkaly, and scarcely curdles
with Soap or liquid Salt of Tartar, not so
much as our gravelly Pump-water, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbs
a Solution of fine Silver in Spirit of

               <head>The Introduction.</head>
               <p>THE Method which I thought reasonable
to take, to get an Account of these
Waters, and which affords the Minutes
of this History, was the examining the several
Wells and particular Matter of them, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their Earths and Springs by the help of
their proper Signs, and then to add to these the
Essays of the Waters: And the Universality and
Accuracy of this Inquiry have distinguish'd it,
by the Success of a clear Discovery of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
I am not ignorant that this History, as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59240:24"/>
it is an exact Examination of the Nature and
Origin of Waters so much in use, and as it may
advance and he helpful to a General History of
Mineral Waters, needs nothing to recommend
it; yet Use being the Design of this Treatise,
and because to give the Reader a View of the
Benefits proposed by it may facilitate the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of it, I shall shew that the Usefulness
of this Inquiry is fully proportioned to the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of attaining it. For besides the Satisfaction
to the Drinkers of them, which ariseth from the
Knowledge of their Principles, the Effects of the
Chalybeat and Purging Waters of <hi>England</hi> are
so great, and the Cures perform'd by them in
Obstinate and the less understood Distempers
are so very extraordinary, that (were their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
better understood) we must expect no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
Advantage from the proper Use of
so Noble a REmedy: Since this would direct us
not only to the more certain Use of them, but
advance our Understanding to the Discovery of
other Distempers, in which they might succeed
and help us to avoid all that ill Success that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
their improper Administration. How ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
such Exactness is to the understanding
their Natures, will appear sufficiently if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what vastly different Qualities are found to
be in the Waters reputed of the same Species,
which yet may be owing only to the Variety of
the Salts with which they may be impregnate;
of which Variety I shall give some particular
Instances, because it is of great Consequence,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59240:24"/>
and hath hitherto been unheeded. The Vertues
of the Chalybeat Waters have been as yet so
much attributed to the Metalline parts or Steel,
that (setting aside the Vehicle of Water, the
Benefit of which is taken notice of by some) in
the Choice of these nothing usually is consulted
but the Quantity of Steele evidenc'd in the depth
of its Tinging with Galls, and yet in this so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
a Species, it is easie to discern that Variety
of Nature and Effects, that will oblige him who
observes it, to allow so much to the Menstruum
of it, or the Salt that is added (either in its Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
or Quality) as is sufficient to constitute Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
of a quite different Nature. Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal
Cases (in which the Intention seems most
General) the Light sort claim as their Province
to relieve; and I never knew the Heavy ones
used in, but with the ill success of aggravating
the Distemper with an uneasie Heat, and with
very little of the good Effects that attend the
light ones. The Propriety of these Waters in
some other Distempers, as Obstructions of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Parts, upon the account of their lightness
and thinness, and particular sort of Spirit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
likewise in the Chapter of their Vertues.
The heavy Waters that have more of the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of Iron, but clogg'd with Salt, have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
references according to the differing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Salt, and quantity of Mineral they
bear, whereof the Nitrous (for such some prove
to be) regard properly that heavy and black
Crasis of the Blood of the Melancholick; for I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59240:25"/>
distinguish the Melancholy, properly so call'd,
which hath its Root in the Constitution, from
the <hi>affectio Hypochondriaca:</hi> The other, which
have a Salt of the same Vitriolick Nature with
the Spirit, are a peculiar in those cases which I
call Climacteric of elder Persons and some others,
which require the enriching of the Blood, and
the help of a Salt more effectual, gross, and
lasting, than is the light Spirit. And as some
cases may require the same Vitriolick Salt to
help the Appetite and restrain Flatulencies, where
the Blood as it needs not, so bears not much of the
body of the Steele, [For such is the case in some
Persons past Fifty, of a florid Complexion, and
who breed Blood fast] so a Water that is thus
qualified, of which I have given an instance,
may be reputed another Species, and for its
real use deserves well to be distinguish'd. The
Salts which these weighty Waters extract from
the Soil, it is likely may vary very much, yet
having not found any of them to contain Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre,
and the difference of their Virtues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
chiefly on their being more or less Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalisat,

Qualifications, so they have some Effects in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
from their common, or general, or more
Essential ones. That which I shall take notice
of here, is the Prevention of the Generation of
the Stone; because their Pretention that makes
them here Competitors, is a Propriety of this
Kind of Mineral Waters, which is explain'd in
this History, and confirms it, and was never
before discover'd or understood. The Purging
Waters owing their Virtues wholly to their
Salts, are much more various in their Nature,
and the Ignorance of the different Nature of
these Salts, has made their different Effects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>question'd,
and so hitherto to escape Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and though the Subtilty and Fluxilness of
some of these Salts, and not of others, may seem
to most Men too slight to deserve Consideration,
and has neither been observ'd nor inquir'd into;
yet it is most certain, that those very Qualities
give the Waters a different Capacity. <hi>Epsom</hi>
and <hi>Acton</hi> (which both bear only this kind of
Salt, that neither admits of Christallizing, nor
abides the Warmth of a Temperate Hand) on
this Account, as they are more Effectual in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59240:26"/>
Grosser Bodies, so in Leaner in the very same
Cases prevail not, nor agree: And on the same
Score, I have found them Effectual in some old
Cholicks and Cramps, where the Passages and
Vessels that wanted cleansing were very small,
or the Matter glutinous or viscous. The same
Qualifications which these Waters have for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terging,
and are conspicuous in the Galling of
the Arcus and Urinary Passage, that attends often
the Operation of these Waters, above what is
usually observ'd in drinking the others, may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
enough have an advantageous Use like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in Ulcers of the Kidneys in a cautious and
judicious Hand; and they often have been by
me observed to be successful in some Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of them; which together with the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of an Ischuria, that sometimes attends
their improper or unseasonable Use, makes this
Consideration to merit our Attention, and besides,
the Softness of the Salt I am speaking of, may
give rise to a Thought, that some emollient or
relaxing Quality may be communicated in some
cases, as in Melancholy for example, above what
other Waters can be expected to exert. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Qualities now consider'd, this History
will inform us of Differences of the Salts of these
Purging Waters in more essential Qualities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
that these are almost as many as the Waters;
whereof some few stand at such a distance, as
Alkalys and Sea-salt; and their Virtues are so
proportionably distant, that till I consider'd, that
the Knowledge of the first, assisted me in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59240:26"/>
Observation of the latter, I was apt to wonder
how so frequent Instances should slip the regard
of even the most considerable Men, it is familiar
for Scorbutick Indispositions, to be relievd by
one Water and aggravated by another. I have
known Instances of a Scorbutick Scabies, and a
Leprous Disease, each increas'd by drinking the
Water of <hi>Brentwood-weal,</hi> which abated upon
the use of <hi>Woodham Ferrys.</hi> And this is the clearer
and fairer Example, because both these Diseases
have been effectually cured by <hi>Lambeth</hi> Water.
And I may observe, that this makes much for the
Validity of this Account, that the discoverable
Qualities of the Salts of these Waters, so justly
correspond with their experimented Virtues; for
which reason in treating of those Waters now
nam'd, I have oppos'd or compar'd the Qualities
of them to each other. Indeed, though the clear
and convincing Detection of their Differences, and
of the Salts they bear relation to, be only subject
to nice Essays; yet they confess to the bare Taste
wide differences, some being Bitter, more Saline
some, some Sweet, some Insipid, or near the Taste
of common Water, some have a Vitriolick Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
some are Austere, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which hitherto has
escap'd Observation: So that Mineral Waters
seem one of the greatest as well as the most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Branches of the <hi>Materia Medica.</hi> In sum, It is
by the understanding their Origine and Nature,
that we can ascertain Rules and distinguish Errors
in taking them, readily discover their proper Uses,
and by directing to other Cases and Distempers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59240:27"/>
in which they may be applicable on the same
Reason and Account, may improve and advance
their Virtues: And besides, the least piece of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
this does in the recording their Uses, and
giving those Signs, that may direct the Discovery
of other Wells, with the advantage of an Example
to direct the proving them, is not inconsiderable.
The Benefit of all this, that I may not seem to
abound in my own Sense, I shall give in the words
of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
Society. <q>All which being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,<note place="margin">Numb. 51.</note>

                  <head>Of the Nature of Common Water.</head>
                  <p>THere are many Questions, which seem to
lye in my way to be discuss'd, as of the
Origine of Springs, Nature and Origine of Mineral
Juyces and Vitriols; Of the Causes of the Heat
of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the following History
makes to disappear. I shall therefore avoid the
Prolixity caused by such Disputes, and only make
some Remarks on the Affections and Nature of
Simple or Common Water, which may help us to
the better conceiving of the Nature of Mineral
ones.</p>
                  <p>1. Waters receive their Salts of the Earths
they wash.</p>
                  <p>2. Common Water holds no Metalline parts,
nor will receive any; Mineral Acids being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for Vitriols: And though gravelly Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
just at their Eruption, will take so much of
an Iron as with Galls will make Ink, yet that the
Acidity belch'd up at those places is a distinct
thing, and not of the same Original, is evident,
in that the Water looses that Quality a few Yards
from the Spring, and then ceases to take any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
Parts or Qualities from either Iron,
or Copper, or Brass.</p>
                  <p>3. All Waters flow on a Loam, or fat heavy
Earth, such as Tiles are made of, and there is a
dead heavy sort of it, known by its Blackness,
Weight and Stonyness, which is the common
Floor of Springs, and is therefore call'd in <hi>Norfolk</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59240:28"/>
the Pan of the Earth, beyond which no Pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
expects to find Water, or attempts to dig
for it: All the Earth above this approaches to a
Nitre, being so much the more Nitrous, by how
much more it is wrought on by the Sun and Air:
Nitre being receiv'd as a Name for any Native
Salt of the Superficial Earth, by the Sun and Air
produced or separated, which is void of Metalline
Parts and Nature, and in differing Climates is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
toward an Alkalisat or Urinous Salt, in
proportion to the Heat of the Country, and Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Soil. And I never found any Metalline
Bodies or Juyces yet, but what were embrac'd
in Stone or Loam, and not in Clays.</p>
                  <p>4. Hence Waters that wash this upper Soil, or
Rivers and Springs that lye in Clays, are Saline;
Gravelly Waters yield little besides some stony
parts, unless they have wash'd off some Salt from
Neighbouring Soils; which discovers its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
in the Essays.</p>
                  <p>5. Not to take notice of the Qualities of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecting
or Moistning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the most considerable
Affection of Water is, that it is void of Elasticity
and igneous Particles, and unapt to Fermentation.</p>
                  <p>Yet these Observations of mine, I offer not
otherwise, than to submit them for better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Experience to inquire into.</p>
                  <p>The Waters under Examination are the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
namely, The Purging ones, and the Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulae
or Chalybeat ones: Of these first.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Chalybeat Waters of England.</head>
               <p>THE Chalybeat Waters are preferable
not only for Antiquity of Discovery,
but also for Virtue, being an effectual
Refuge for many deplorable Diseases that no
other Remedy prevails in: They are quick
Springs, ever flowing in a Sand or Gravel. I
shall first state their Characteristicks, or Signs
by which they are distinguish'd from other Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and then explain those Circumstantial
Signs, and their Reasons, in an account of their
Nature.</p>
               <p>Their Characteristicks are,</p>
               <p>1. To shew the Mineral they bear (which is
Steele) in their Taste, and with Galls, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it in the blew or purplish black Colour
proper to Vitriols of Iron, as also by dropping a
Ferrugineous Ocre at the Spring.</p>
               <p>2. The second is, The Lightness of the Spirit
that holds the Tincture, which vanishes upon
exposing to the Air, and leaves the Water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Mineral Tincture. The lightness of this
Spirit so affects those Waters of this kind that
are more void of Salt, as to render them lighter
than Rain-water distill'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59240:29"/>
3. The Spring ever proceeds from a Rock
usually consisting of gravelly Stones cemented
together.</p>
               <p>4. If it joyn any other common Water imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
near the Fountain, it thence incrusts the
Stones and Sticks, which it washe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, with a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-like

                  <note place="margin">Part 2. Obj. 16.</note> errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to entertain an ill Opinion of the
Water, because (as he observed in
that four Miles from <hi>Rome, extra Portam hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensem
vulgo S. Pauli)</hi> of the stony Matter the
Water leaves where it passes, and this through
the Mistake that this Matter is in the Water
at the Spring.</p>
               <p>5. To bear an Oyly or Bituminous Film on it
like a Scum.</p>
               <p>6. To give a Green upon the Mixture of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
of Violets.</p>
               <p>These Waters differ on account of the Salt of
the Water, in the Quantity or Quality of it, or
proportion of the Steel they bear; and so may
not have the second Qualification which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the simple ones. For the Nature and
Reason of these Waters, we must examine these
particulars, not only since most of them are the
Indexes, but also are effected by the Essential
Properties of these Waters; and shew the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline
parts, and the Nature of the Menstruum
or Spirit. The Metal is evident from the blew
black they take with Galls, from the Taste,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59240:29"/>
and lastly the Okar which it casts out at the
opening of the Spring, which calcin'd with Salt,
and expos'd to the Air, shews none of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digreese
Colour that Hungarian Vitriol gives
upon the same Trial. The Menstruum, or
Spirit, is a distinct thing from the Salt of them,
and of a differing Original, being contrary in
Nature, not held by it, and being found in those
Waters that want the Salt, for the Salt of those
that have any, is wash'd from the Earth by the
Water, and the Spirit is only a Steam that comes
along with the Gravel. The Spirit, or Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum,
that bears this Tincture, is Volatile,
and continues not with the Water many hours,
(scarce well one in the light sort) though well
cork'd up. What effect Hermetick Seal might
have, I never had encouragement to attempt, as
never believing that a fair Trial, where the
power of the Fire came so near and so naked,
and the Chalybeat Waters that abound with
Salt are often Nitrous, and so may mortifie the
Spirituous Acid, which may make it in vain
look'd for in the Receiver: This I mention for
caution sake; for that this Spirit is Volatile, yet
that it can be detain'd by a cover of Oyl for
ten days, I lately try'd with a Light Chalybeat
at <hi>Felstead.</hi> The Original of this Vapour is
pointed out to be low, and to proceed with all
Gravel; as is evident in free Springs, that upon
laying Iron at the Eruption of them, will Tinge
with Galls, which power the Water loses at a
Rods distance; but in these it is less in Quantity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59240:30"/>
The Nature of this Spirit is Vitriolick: They
disturb not a Solution of Sublimate in fair Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and with <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> thicken a
little with a Cloud, but do not the least change
yellowish as Pump-water and Nitrous, but
near that of a Solution of Vitriol, or its Spirit
upon the same, though scarce so clear, because
all these Waters have a touch of the Salt of the
Soyl, as appears in the green with Syrup of
Violets. They all likewise render a Solution of
<hi>Sal Saturni</hi> in fair Water milky, by which the
Spirit is distinguish'd from <hi>Saltpetre</hi> or its Spirit.
Note, That though these Tryals are fairly
made, only in the lighter simpler Waters, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to make a Judgment of them, yet they hold
in the heavier Waters, except that Tryal with
<hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> in which they discover
their Salt, by the yellow colour they give.
Now the Nature of Salt of Vitriol appears upon
examination, to differ very little from common
Salt (if any thing) more than in the Qualities
impress'd in it by the Metal; and it is worth
our notice, that Vitriols and Nitres precipitate
each other, being the Product of two several
Regions; which will enlighten to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the next Particulars observ'd to attend
these Waters.</p>
               <p>The Earth and Soyl of these Springs, is ever
a Sand or Gravel, and the Water issues from,
or rather makes, a Rock of cemented Stones,
which are never to be found, but where the
Water is Vitriolick. This sort of Rock is open
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59240:30"/>
to view at <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and has never yet fail'd,
where the Ground in which these Springs are
found has been open'd, as at <hi>Notly, Felstead,</hi>
and other lesser Springs. I am apt to think that
Iron may have a particular Qualification for the
cementing of Earth and Stone, but that I may
follow my subject more closely, I shall only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it as the next Particular illustrates it.</p>
               <p>These Waters, when they joyn another Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
at least a gravelly one, e'er they have ran
so far as to lose their Spirit, precipitate a Mortar-like
substance, wherewith they incrust the
Stones and Sticks they pass over. That this
stony Matter is precipitated out of other Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which flow into it by the Virtue of this
Water, and proceeds not from the Chalybear
Water it self, beside the Argument that may be
drawn from the Lightness in weight of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat,
appears fully demonstrated at many
Springs, indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at all, where the rill of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water runs along the side of the Soyl
whence the Chalybeat issues, especially when it
is in a Meadow (as it was at <hi>Felstead</hi> where I
first observ'd it) no Incrustation or Precipitation
of stony Matter being to be found either in the
Meadow where the Chalybeat lyes, or above
before the other Water joyns it. The Water
I now nam'd, is one of the light sort, being near
ten Grains in seven Ounces lighter than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water, and the Water that joyns it a hard
gravelly one, which with Tincture of Logwood
gave a Rasberry red as Acids, which is not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59240:31"/>
amiss to mention. The Reason which I inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
above, to be from the differing Natures
of Nitres and Vitriols, may help make this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.
The Lightness in weight of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat
Waters, that as they are void of Salt,
may properly enough be said to be more simple,
is owing to the same Cause, and proves the
same thing, being not from difference of the
Season, as is usually judg'd, which can never
make it lighter than even that Rain-water di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still'd,
that must render it so; but from the
Depuration it has receiv'd by the Precipitation
of the Earthy parts: And the Property is the
same by which these Waters even in Human or
Animal Bodies Cure the Stone, by removing the
Disposition to it, as well as early Precipitation
of the Matter; and this Virtue in the Waters is
so constant, as to have made them Famous in
this particular. The last considerable Sign and
Attendant of these Waters, is the Bituminous
Scum appearing on them, how far the fatness
of the Earth of these Waters is assisting in
separating this Spirit, or whether it is the Effect
of it, is not plain, nor very material to learn:
That it is of the Nature of common Salt, to
assist in the Separation of Oyly parts, is evident
in pickling Roses, and distilling Oyls, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be from this, or the Putridness of the
Soyl and Earth, I shall submit, and leave.</p>
               <p>These Waters differ not only in Degrees
of Hardness and Coldness, which is best
taken notice of in the Examination of each
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59240:31"/>
Water, but may be distinguish'd into these two
Heads.</p>
               <p>1. The Light ones, which have more of the
Spirituous Parts of the Vitrioline Spirit, and
more Simply.</p>
               <p>2. The Heavy ones, that contain a Salt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to a Nitre, or is Nitrous.</p>
               <p>Of the Heavy ones first, and then I ascend to
the Lighter, which thereby may be illustrated.</p>

Salt, and equal at least common Water
in weight.</head>
                  <p>THE Salt of these Waters I conclude to be
owing to the Soyle, because it is found to
be of the same Nature, and has some Differences,
but those being small, I omit, and forbear insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon them.</p>
                  <p>In the general Design of the use of Chalybeats,
these Nitrous Waters are not so Effectual, and
the more Nitrous the worse, by which I mean,
the more Alkalisat; which is easily prov'd, by the
early Precipitation of the Black, and the change
towards a Green, which is the Effect of Alkalys
with Ink, though at first they change the Blew
Black into a Purple. The Characteristick Notes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59240:32"/>
of these Waters, beside the weight, are, to drop
the Inky colour they receive with Gall, to take
a high colour with <hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> and
when the Water has stood to be effete, it will
not precipitate Silver out of Spirit of Nitre. I
have not found any of this kind so fully Nitrous
or Alkalisat, as to trouble a Solution of Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
much less to precipitate it Yellow, (both
which indeed are inconsistent with Vitriols) nor
any that bear a Salt of the Nature of Saltpetre.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>KNarsborough</hi> Water, as Dr. <hi>French</hi> relates,
is of a Vitrioline Taste and Odour; The
Water riseth in a moorish boggy Ground (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59240:33"/>
less than half a Mile from which, there is no
considerable Ascent) and springeth directly up
from the Sandy bottom. It is of the same
weight with common Spring Water: The col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
with Syrup of Violets is much the same as
in the Chalybeat Waters at <hi>Islington</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead;</hi>
not so intense as in <hi>Tunbridge</hi> or the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Spa,</hi> as the Learned Dr. <hi>Tancred Robinson,</hi>
my Informer, prov'd it at the Spring. And as
this colour is not so deep as that made by
Vitriols, so the residuous dark colour'd Earth,
after Evaporation, was insipid. The pitch of
the Volatility of the Spirituous part of this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is observable, in that it tinctur'd with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Galls at two days end, and suffer'd not
by Warming, yet lost that Quality wholly in
Distilling. Neither does this Water coagulate
Milk: The Redness that this Water takes with
Galls, is effected by spirituous or distill'd Acids,
unmix'd with gross Salt, of the Soyle of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Nature, which would disturb the Colour;
and the larger Proportion of the Acid to the
Steel, or the very small quantity of the last may
effect it. But the Quantity of the Acid Spirit
must be judg'd here to be considerable. For the
Nature of the Acidity, I have before distinguish'd
it by the Effects, and so need here only observe
it to be Vitrioline, or of the Nature of Spirit of
Vitriol; which is Essential to the Precipitations.</p>

                  <head>Marks-Hall Water in Essex.</head>
                  <p>THIS Water joyning another in crusts, as
do the rest, it is much the same with the
preceding, containing little Steel, but a large
share of an Acid not so Fugitive, as where it is
in less quantity or ill coupled with a Salt: It
gave a bright Red a very little purplish, not so
deep as the preceding. The Colour it advanc'd
with Gall, it lost again two days after, without
Precipitation of any Ferrugineous parts, in which
it differs from other Chalybeats. It rendred a
Solution of <hi>Sal Saturni</hi> troubled, but not very
milky, much as the rest; and it tinctur'd a high
Yellow with <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> as do Nitres,
and a little clouded: It weigh'd likewise as the
other, just the weight of common Water.</p>

                  <head>Ilmington Water in Warwickshire.</head>
                  <p>THIS Water of <hi>Ilmington</hi> being of the same
heavy kind, and which (as I observe
above) require less Accuracy, I shall give the
Examination of it, out of Dr. <hi>Derham</hi>'s Account
of it: With Syrup of Violets it turned Green;
with Galls Purple, like Martial Vitrioline Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
It exceeded common Water in weight
near half a Dram in a Pint, being weigh'd in a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59240:34"/>
dry Season. Indeed it is much the heaviest of
this kind in <hi>England,</hi> (for it purges not as he
informs us p. 53. but by Urine.) However,
That it cannot vie with the lighter Chalybeats
in Virtue, I shall explain in treating of their
Virtues.</p>
                  <p>The Water in an open Bottle drop'd its Ocre,
and with that its power of Tinging with Galls
in twelve hours time (that is) a great part of it,
which it did not begin to do in a Bottle well stop'd
under a Fortnight, p. 88.</p>
                  <p>It yielded a Salt of an irregular shape, upon
the residue after distilling Acid Spirits, wrought
with great Effervescence, and not Alkalysat,
p. 82.</p>
                  <p>The Salt was pale, and would not flagrate,
p. 60. nor coagulate Milk, p. 77. The Earth
like Red Ocar, and is contain'd in great quantity,
a Quart yielding near a Spoonsul.</p>
                  <p>It appears hence, that the Salt of this Water
is of an Alkalisat Nature, and that it differs
from the Salt of Fat, Mellow or Loamy Earths,
which Purge, as we shall find in the latter part
of this History.</p>

                  <head>Aylesham Water in the County of Norfolk.</head>
                  <p>THIS Water is in a Gravel, it has prevail'd
in Fame and Resort over <hi>Oulton</hi> Water
in the same County, which is a lighter and far
more effectual Water, partly from the more
convenient Situation of the place, and partly
from the wrong Estimate that is made of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat
Waters, by those that jndge of their
Goodness by the depth of their Tinging with
Galls. It is heavier a little than ordinary Gravel
Water; with Galls or Oken leaves takes a
blew black, and makes a direct Ink; as do those
Waters whose Salt has somewhat of the Nature
of common Salt.</p>
                  <p>That the Metalline parts of these Waters are
purely Chalybeat, I inform'd my self not in all
but in some, as that at <hi>Leez,</hi> and some other
smaller ones, by exposing to the Air the subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Okar, lightly calcin'd with Sea-salt, which
would discover Copper if any were in it; and
besides by the colour they give upon Tryals
with Gall, the blew black colour being proper
to Vitriol of Iron.</p>
                  <p>The lesser Springs of this kind are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
in Gravelly Countries scarce a Village
without one; upon the preceding Instances of
them, I shall make Observation of their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
and the Classes they must be reduc'd
into, whereinto yet I did not adventure to digest
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59240:35"/>
them, lest in the Sense of others the difference
should appear only gradual.</p>
                  <p>These weighty Waters are either, 1. the
more pure and simple Acidulae, which bear less
of the Steel; retain their Acidity longer, and
have not their colour with Gall dark or disturb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d,
as the other sort, nor contain any Salt collectible;
of this sort seems <hi>Knaresborough,</hi> and (which
is yet the higher of this kind) <hi>Marks hall</hi> Water,
which gives a thin and bright Red with Gall,
scarce beyond a Rasberry, and loseeh its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Tinging without Precipitation of Okar,
is of a pleasing acid Taste, as it were winy, and
yet gives not the proof with <hi>Lignum Nephriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>
that Vitriols do, or Spirit of Salt, but thickish
reddish and cloudy, as the Seminitrous Salt shot
in Cellars.</p>
                  <p>Or 2ly Atramentous, which give a full Black
with Gall, and with respect to the colour they
give, they are either blewish or reddish; the
reddish, as that at <hi>Wittham,</hi> kept a Week, will
be thickish and turbid with Gall, but disturb not
a Solution of fine Silver in Spirit of Nitre, which
the <hi>Leez</hi> Water (which gives a blew black) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more related to common Salt, did in a great
measure precipitate.</p>
                  <p>Another difference that is considerable in these
Waters, is the bulk or quantity of Salt they
contain, as the <hi>Illmington</hi> Water proves, which
is not only much heavier than other Waters,
but varies in its Effects, and equally to the
grossness of the Salt, neither reaches the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59240:35"/>
of Nature so far, nor passes so well.</p>
                  <p>To obviate some Objections, I shall observe,
that the Reason why these Waters, which are
equally with the other sort capacitated to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate
the earthly parts out of gravelly Water,
are not likewise equally qualified with Lightness
by the same Vitrioline Spirit, is, because the
Salt of these Waters is so far Vitrioline, as to
be apt to joyn a Chalybeat Acid and consist with
it; but yet to be separated by Heat; and is in
some small measure of Nature, the same with
that which is an Ingredient in Vitriols; for the
Liquor of Vitriols, if boyl'd with too great a
Fire, will precipitate their Ferrugineous parts,
which the Boylers cure by adding more Iron to
it: And these Waters, after they have drop'd
the Okar, and cease to tinge Galls, with Iron
will become Atramentous again, the first Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being chiefly perform'd by the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Esurine Salt by the Nitrous: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Argument drawn from the not abiding
of the Steel in these Waters, the Nitrous Nature
of the Salt is conspicuous in its high colour it
takes with <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> which Vitriols
give not; nor do the light Chalybeat Waters,
that proceed from a Ground where the Soyl is
Fat and Bituminous, as I observ'd that at <hi>Felstead</hi>
to be, and which yields little or no Salt.</p>

Chalybeat.</head>
                  <p>I Have clear'd the Reason of the Lightness of
these Waters, and with that have asserted
the Nature of the Spirit to be Vitrioline; since
all those Waters are found to be so, where these
Incrustations are found. And as the weighty
Waters take a full high yellow Tincture from
<hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> so this light sort take no
slain with the same Wood, but retain their col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
only disturb'd with a light white Cloud
flying in it. <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> makes no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in a Solution of Vitriol, nor in Water
sharpened with Oyl of Vitriol. These Waters
do not well conserve their Virtue two hours,
which yet will scarce be lost in ten days, if
headed with Oyl. They all give a purplish Red
with Galls, which, upon standing a while, turns
to a purplish Black.</p>

                  <head>Of the Virtues of the Chalybeat VVaters.</head>
                  <p>THE Virtues of Steel are so very great and
large, and in many cases so contrary, as
not to be explain'd by what are grosly call'd the
first, second or third Qualities; but to help us to
a Notion of them, we must consider the Essence
of this Mineral in its Affections, that are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59240:37"/>
And thus we may conceive of it, as a hard
body of the Mineral Kingdom, and so qualifi'd
with Firmness, which is apt to enrich the Blood,
being easily convertible into Fat or Sulphur, the
nature of whose Sulphur, is to preserve Fluid
Bodies, and the Temper of whose Acid Spirit,
is such as raises, and yet restrains or rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justs
the Fermentation of our Stomach, Soluble,
Friendly to our Nature, and some-how Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent
to the Mechanism of the Air we live in
by its Magnetism; and then we may intelligibly
add the more Simple, and other evident Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
as cooling, potential Heat, Drying, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samick
or Healing Quality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I shall
take notice of under these Heads, in these
Waters.</p>
                  <p>1. They Invigorate the Blood and Juyces as
a Chalybeat.</p>
                  <p>2. They Astringe.</p>
                  <p>3. They Incide and Attenuate by their Acidity.</p>
                  <p>4. The Acidity is Connatural, and agreeable
to the Ferment of the Stomach, and other Offices,
which these Waters promote.</p>
                  <p>5. On the same account, and partly in that it
is Sulphurous, it is a Fraenum, or Curb, to Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
and Flatulencies, and performs more
effectually what Oxycrate does in the Vapours
in Women, and Spirit of Sulphur or Vitriol in
Men, whence the Acid seems adjusted to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of our Bodies, which can preserve the just
Fermentations, as it destroys or reduces Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
ones.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59240:38"/>
6. They depurate the Juyces of forreign or
grosser parts, lodg'd with the Nourishment in
the Body, as is evident in the Stone; which is
but the same thing which they effect in gravelly
Waters at their Springs.</p>
                  <p>7. The Acid being Spirituous, passes where
other Medicines cannot, and so are Diuretick
and Exterminate, and discharge the offensive
Matter by Urine; and the rest it Volatilizes.</p>
                  <p>8. The Vehicle of this Mineral and Spirit,
is not apt to Elasticity or Fermentation.</p>
                  <p>And on the account of these Qualifications,
the Chalybeat Waters warm, strengthen, heal,
open Obstructions, absterge, invigorate, and
thus are capacitated to stop Fluxes of all sorts,
and remove many Diseases, among which the
<hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Affectio Hypochondriaca</hi> stand at the
Head.</p>
                  <p>But although all the sorts of Chalybeat Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have some Qualifications in common, as to
invigorate the Blood, and cleanse the <hi>Viscera;</hi>
yet as they differ in their Salt, so likewise
in their Virtues; which I shall particularly
treat of.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Which Name I would make proper to those Waters
that are lightly Chalybeat.</head>
                  <p>THese have a fine Acidity, not collectible
into a Salt, the residue upon Distilling,
being an Insipid Ferrugineous Earth; and as I
said before, give only a Claret red with Gall.
That which is proper to this sort of the Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat
Waters, is, That they are free of any
gross Salt, and have plenty of a Vitrioline Acid,
with little of the body of the Steel, and that
Acid more fix'd than in the light Chalybeats.
In order to understand the Benefit of this, I shall
observe that there are Cases that require a
Water so qualifi'd, either on the Score of the
Distemper, or Constitution of the Patient, such
as we commonly call Complexion; in which a
quantity of Steel may do more harm, than the
Vitrioline Spirit can do good. And this must
be allow'd me, to be in all Cases and Persons,
where the Blood offends in quantity, Floridness
and Fluxilness, by every one that observes the
power Steel has to heat and invigorate the Blood
in the Chlorosis. And when I consider the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Nature of Chalybeat Acids, and Nitrous
Salts, as I observed before, I fansie I have a
clear Reason for all this. One Case that the
Body of Steel agrees not in, is that Indisposition
of fresh-colour'd florid-complexion'd Persons,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59240:39"/>
about the last grand Climacterick, as I call that
of 49, who are liable to Fluxes of Blood, or
great Tumultuations of it. It is very easie to
discover the Alkalisat state of the Blood in aged
Persons, by only tasting the Urine, which in
those grows almost Caustick. The Diseases
that this sort of Water is a peculiar in, are
Apoplexies, Phrensies and Fluxes of Blood; and
because the first of these is a Distemper that has
strangely rag'd of late, and extraordinarily this
last Winter, beyond what has been observ'd
perhaps ever before, to explain the reason of it,
so much as to give light to the Effect of these
Waters, may be no unacceptable a Digression.</p>

proceeds upon is, That the Animal Spirit
is made out of the Vital, and that this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the Carotid Arteries to the Basis of
the Brain; and then that the Ventricles are aptly
situate to this end, to receive and conveigh the
Spirits into the fourth Ventricle as a Cistern,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59240:40"/>
that thence they may be distributed into the
Nerves. And so he carries it on, <hi>At Nervorum

                  <p>The Arguments are fairly laid down at large
in <hi>Wepferus;</hi> and are nevertheless valid; though
I see no reason altogether to be satisfied in the
Uses here and generally assign'd the Ventricles,
since as it is observ'd by that Curious Anatomist
Dr. <hi>Ridley,</hi> no Water can be express'd from the
<hi>Glandula Pituitaria,</hi> nor has it any aperture dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
into the Palate, which confirms this,
that he never found Water in the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi>
either in the Sound or Unsound. For besides
that, there is a Parity in the Reasons of the Use
of them by him assign'd, or that well can be
assign'd, the <hi>Vesicae</hi> found in the Ventricles of
vertiginous Cattle, and the great quantity of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59240:41"/>
Water, <hi>In puero integrè mentis munia obeunte,</hi>
mention'd by <hi>Tulpius,</hi> and cited by the foresaid
Author, evacuate the Nobility of their Office.
And <hi>Galen,</hi> whose Notion in this Matter is not
consistent, yet relates, <hi>Adolescentem Smyrnensem
ad alterutrum ventriculorum usque vulneratum,
semet oculato teste, superstitem permansissie.</hi> And
again observes, <hi>In soporibus &amp; Epilepsia ventres

clear'd in the Formation of Brains of Brutes.
<hi>Wepferus,</hi> by the help of Dissections, detects
the Seat of this Disease in the Brain it self, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the whole Compage in Contradistinction
only to the ventricles, and asserts a true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy
to be generated, <hi>Ab effuxu Spirituum to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali

                        </gap>les, Apoplexia sequitur.</hi> And this Stoppage,
according to him, may be either at the Pores of
the <hi>Medulla</hi> that admit the Arteries, or are open
to them; or those through which they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
into the Nerves. This Hypothesis
labours under many Difficulties, suggested both
from Reason and Experience; for as it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that the Seat of the Animal Spirits should
be exempt from any forreign Intrusion, so Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
seems to have secur'd it, like the Palace of
Princes, by previous passes. Neither does the
Brain appear lyable to the Inconveniencies that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59240:42"/>
other Secretory Glands are from their own Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
or Admission of less prepar'd or grosser
Juyces, which procure their Obstructions. And
accordingly we do not find, that a <hi>Colluvies</hi> of
<hi>Serum,</hi> or a Scrumous Brain to have induc'd
this Distemper: And even in that plainer case,
which is allow'd, where an Apoplexy proceeds
from a Plethora, and a Weakness of the Brain,
I have always found some farther Explication
necessary; as to account why so sudden, why
not in all Ages and Seasons, and the like. And
on the other hand, that the Brain cannot want a
sufficient Afflux of Blood, Nature, as in other
parts, so here, hath made provision, as by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
appears. Our great Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> hath in
my Judgment clear'd this Point, by two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
one of an Obstructed Artery, without
an Impediment to the Course, or at least a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Afflux of the Blood; The other of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy,
without any appearance of Obstruction
or disorder in the Brain: And more closely tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cerebri.</hi> And besides that, there is the
Spring of Life, there is good reason to excuse
the Cortical part, since Instances are frequent,
in Authors unquestionable, of Portions of it
taken out at Wounds of the Head, without
any pernicious Consequence. And therefore
whereas Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> is pleas'd to suppose, that
the Seat of the Distemper, as where the Cause
that influentially occasions the Defection of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59240:42"/>
due Actings first fixes it self; I do not see
it essential to this Distemper, to be an Affection
of this part; but with deference to that very
Learned and Excellent Physician, must observe
that the Enemy sometimes escapes this Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without leaving any marks of its footing;
and therefore am inclin'd with Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> to
place it <hi>In aut prope cerebri Meditullium,</hi> upon
the entrance of which it exerts its power. But
if he pleases to consider the Cortical part as it
is Secretory, and as it is first affected in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
or habitual Apoplexy, I think that must be
allow'd. Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> then proceeds to induce a
Profligation of the Spirits, to solve the sudden
and light assault of this Distemper. An Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy
he distinguisheth into Accidental and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual,
which he considers <hi>sine Procatarxi,</hi> or
with an Antecedent Cause. The <hi>Causa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncta

above-mentioned Dr. <hi>Cole,</hi> in his Treatise occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
by the late Frequency of Apoplexies, by
his Inquiry into the <hi>Materiae Morbificae indoles,</hi>
hath not a little illustrated the Cause of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper.
His Sense, as I understand it, is this,
From Observation made of the Weekly Bills of
Mortality, he dates the Aera of their Increase
from 1683. Upon which <hi>Substratum</hi> he naturally
deduces the Cause of this Distemper from Cold,
and observes that to account for it very well.
In order to the understanding the Nature of
Cold, he reduces the Notion of it to these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.</p>
                  <p>1. That Sensible Qualities, though they are
not among the general Affections of Matter, as
Motion, Rest, Bulk, Figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
to it, but determin'd by these, and asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
to somewhat that has Perception.</p>
                  <p>2. As Cold makes an Impression on our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sories,
so it requires Motion; and it is not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
simply, but consider'd with some adjunct,
<hi>viz.</hi> Motion in such or such a Degree, and with
relation to Sensitive Beings that constitutes Heat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59240:43"/>
3. The Transmission of these Impressions to
the Soul, requires a Motion in our Organs, but
such a one as may keep up a due Crasis in both
the Fluid and Consistent Substances, that make
up the Organ for the performing the Functions
appointed.</p>
                  <p>4. That these Congenial Motions seem not
properly Objects of our Perception, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Instruments of Transmission of those others
from without, which recede from these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
or are otherwise Circumstantiated:
Though these deflecting from their due Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may, by affecting the Soul differently from
what they use to do, excite her to take notice of
them too.</p>
                  <p>5. That these mean Motions are to us a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
of all others.</p>
                  <p>From all which, our Author deduces Cold to
be a Check of that degree, which belongs to
the Parts of, and Fluid Substances in our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sories
of Touching; and Heat to be an Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration;
and the Bulk and Figure of the Bodies
that cause either to be considerable. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardation
which makes the Nature of Cold, may
be occasion'd by increase of bulk and change of
Figure, by Adhesion. 2 By altering the due
Contexture of the Vessels. 3. If the affecting
Bodies be of such a Figure and Texture as to
be flexible. 4. By Interposing they may fill
the Spaces, and may be the present Case. Now
as Conical or Pyramidal Figures solve this
Phaenomenon best, so he gives the Nitrous parts
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59240:44"/>
of the Air those Figures, from <hi>des Carte's</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and <hi>Lewenhook</hi>'s Microscopical Autopsy.
To enquire how our Bodies and Brain are
affected by these, he observes the Air to affect
as Liquors.</p>
                  <p>1. The Blood, into which it is admitted by
the Stomach, by the Lungs and Pores of the
Skin; and on which it operates partly by the
Insinuation of its Elastical and other Irregular
Particles, partly by the Interposition as well as
Lancination of the Nitrous Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ous Parts, which
promotes the Comminution of it, whereby the
Crasis of it may be alter'd, if such Air be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
as shall over-check this Agitation.</p>
                  <p>2. The Nervous Juyce, which he supposes
lyable to Impressions, in some degree analogous
to what are made on the Blood from Substances
mix'd with it. He supposeth some of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Substances of the Air may be deposited
into the Nerves at their Original; or that it must
communicate with the Blood, in receiving some
of the Viscous parts produced in it by the Air;
and that some more subtile Particles must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
through the Pores. To which the same
worthy Author adds, That he conceives them
in some due Proportion necessary to the due
Spiritualization of this Juyce. Again, The solid
parts are lyable to the same Inconvenience, and
to retain them longer.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, The Brain may be affected not only
by the Mediation of the Blood, but also by the
Airs affecting the Mammillary Processes, or the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59240:44"/>
Ears, or the Extremities of the Nerves in all
parts of the Skin. And this pressure of the Air
may be unequal, some part of it being mov'd
with greater Violence, where is greater Dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or a part kept warmer: And this Injury
of Air, Tenderness and ill Digestion, through
want of Exercise, makes the Body obnoxious
too. And thus the Brain may suffer in that
Continuity, due Confirmation and Repletion of
its parts, wherein this Author supposes the tone
of the parts to consist. So that in the Author's
own words, as well as Sense, The part affected
may either be the whole Brain, or any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
part of it, and either the Cortical or
Medullar, but especially (or at least first) the
Cortical, from whence the disaffected Matter is
transmitted to the parts of it which lye deeper,
where the Animal Spirits principally exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
the Nature of the Distemper to consist
in the sudden Abolition of the due Excrasie and
Distribution of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> thence; the immediate
Cause, most usually (when unavoidably fatal)
an Effusion of Blood out of its Vessels upon the
Substance of the Brain. Though I conceive (says
he) a bare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the Arteries there may
occasion it, as also may perhaps a Congestion of
Viscous or Serous Matter, when it comes to a
considerable degree, and becomes freshly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited;
or else Polypous Concretions, or (if we
can suppose it) any other obstructing Matter
deposited in it, may at last produce it; and the
Pre disposition of the Brain to it, to consist
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59240:45"/>
usually in the more than ordinary Laxity or
Openness of it. And whatsoever either first
causes a Congestion of Blood, or 2ly, otherwise
so Indisposes it, that it cannot readily and duly
circulate through its usual Vessels in the Brain;
or 3ly, disaffects the Brain, whether by weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
its Tone, or altering the Figures of its
passages, or straitning them too much, may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
Apoplexies: And the greater Urgency or
Violence of such antecedent Causes, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
a greater Frequency of them than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given the Notions of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
distinctly, for these Reasons;</p>
                  <p>1. It sets the Distemper, as we do a Picture,
in all Lights, to try which way we may see it
best. And,</p>
                  <p>2. As it prepares to the understanding of
Apoplexies, so in my further Inquiry, in many
particulars, Repetition will be sav'd, and less
intelligible Parentheses avoided.</p>
                  <p>3. We may, by this means, observe the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
Symptoms of this Distemper, and what
hints they gave these Authors.</p>
                  <p>Information being not to be gain'd by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
I shall not inspect the Particulars of
these Accounts, in which they are not Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,
as why, after that Frost, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
ones, why the Aera should be then fix'd,
and yet the Increase began long before. Why
the Head should be affected, and not other parts
rather; it being necessary to account for the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59240:45"/>
Reason, why Air afflicts one part particularly,
as we see the Fauces and Throat at the <hi>Alps,</hi>
the Lungs at <hi>Rome.</hi> So likewise of the Changes
of the Distempers which are temporary, and
many other things; but shall offer some Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
which I submit to the Judgment of the
last cited Author and others, which, if approv'd,
give a more natural account, and may carry on
the Inquiries; and they are such as answer two
Questions or Inquiries.</p>
                  <p>1. Of the Reason of the sudden and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Death.</p>
                  <p>2. That may inform us of the Indoles of the
Morbifick Matter, and how much is observable
in the Air that can answer for this.</p>
                  <p>My Notion, as to the first of these, is deduced
from these Considerations.</p>
                  <p>1. That the Motion of the Blood is necessary
to Life.</p>
                  <p>2. That this is owing to Respiration.</p>
                  <p>3. That Respiration is necessary to Life.</p>
                  <p>4. Both Motion of the Blood, and Necessity
of Respiration, consist in the Elasticity of the
Air.</p>
                  <p>5. I observe, that besides the Atmospherical
Air, that is exhausted by a Pneumatick Engine,
there is a finer Elastick Air or Matter contain'd
in this Atmospheric Air, which in an exhausted
Receiver hindred the parting of the Marbles,
which is Elastick too, the pressure being <hi>ad
modum,</hi> or in Proportion to the force that is
capable to separate the cohering Bodies,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59240:46"/>
and may be surmounted by a force superi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

to it.</p>
                  <p>6. There seems to be a Nitre in the Air,
necessary to maintain and share in produci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Elasticity of the grosser Atmosphere, which
being consum'd, an Animal dies.</p>
                  <p>7. There are certain <hi>Termini &amp; fines</hi> of the

for the Respitation of Animals. Thus Fish
that die in an open Air, yet are choak'd for
want of it, if a Pond Freeze; and accordingly
are provided with Pipes, that strain the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
Matter, and are stronger, and not lyable to the
Inconvenience from the force and weight of
the Water. And lastly, as the Matter drawn
is finer, so there is no need of the Contraction
and Opening, or Conquassation of the Air, to
get the Matter out they want, which is strain'd
by the Water.</p>
                  <p>8. I observe, that Animals which have a
Crasis of Blood, to which less Nitre is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
as they can be long without Food, so can
live a considerable time without Air, as <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toises,
Adders,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore have mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
Lungs, in which no more Blood circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
than is required for their Nourishment,
and so not the whole Blood, as in those that have
fleshy Lungs.</p>
                  <p>9. This Elasticity is requisite to Life, as it
keeps in a Springy Motion, and so Life ceases,
either upon a Stoppage of the Air Externally,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59240:46"/>
as in a Glass, or Internally, as we see is the
Effect of Damps, which by some, and those
great Men, have, by mistake, been conceiv'd
to contain Poysonous Matter, and to perform
it on that account, but the contrary is evident,
since in Pump-wells the Water is wholsome, and
a new built House, from the Lime and Mortar,
shall have the same.</p>
                  <p>10. On the same Reason, Animals dye in
the exhausted Receiver, upon the unbending
the Spring, by Exhaustion. And it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
remark, that Animals taken out before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring,
are not recover'd by admission of the
Air, which affects not soon enough the lesser
or remoter Springyness. <hi>Acad. del cimento.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. That the Parts and Juyces of Animals
are Elastick, appears to me asserted in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
of the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. That Air is admitted to the Blood, I
need no other Argument, but that the Blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to follow upon Bleeding.</p>
                  <p>13. That the Air is not admitted to the Brain
and Nerves, or to any of the Specifick Juyce
of the Animal, I argue again from the like
reason.</p>
                  <p>From all which I deduce, that an Apoplexy
is produced by the admission of Air, or Elastick
Parts, to the <hi>Medulla</hi> or <hi>Corpus Callosum</hi> of the
Brain And that this Air and Lethiserous parts
are admitted by the Mouth, and so by the way
of the Stomach, appears plainly, in that the Fits
usually seize immediately upon plentiful Feeding.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59240:47"/>
For the Glutinous parts of the Chyle are a fit
Vehicle, as being, if ill concocted, Flatulent
and Elastick, as I shall farther demonstrate,
when I come to the <hi>Affectio Hypochondriaca.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I must take notice of the Consistency
of this Notion, which is confirm'd by that Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
so often passing into this Distemper.</p>
                  <p>That this sudden Death comes not from the
other Causes I named, is evident from many
Reasons, which I have not room here for:
The most difficult Phoenomenon to be solv'd,
that appears to me, is the Apoplexy seizing
<hi>Faemellae</hi> upon the difficulty of Eruption of the
<hi>Catamenia,</hi> at the second Septenary. To which
we can only say, that the <hi>Plethora</hi> is apparent,
and the Weakness of the Brain, though we see
not how the Brain, and <hi>Genus Nervosum,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in this, nor know its Motion; for I
allow the antecedent Causes of a Turgid Blood,
and a weak Brain, to have place in this Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
This my Hypothesis, I think, naturally
consequent to the just Notions of the Air and
Brain, and well accounts for the <hi>Spuma</hi> at the
Nostrils and Mouth, and for the Difficulty of
Breathing, or Cessation of Respiration attended
with an entire Pulse, which thus may be carried
on, and the main Design of Respiration cease.
This gives the reason of the Distention of the
Lungs in the Apoplectick that is mention'd by
<hi>Wepferus,</hi> if the Elasticity of the Internal parts
of the Lungs, can but be supposed to do the
same that the removing of the Incumbent
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59240:47"/>
Atmosphere in an exhausted Receiver did on
some Animals, in which the Academy <hi>del Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi>
observ'd the Lungs to swell, and to Forth
at the Mouth: And thus we may solve the
Difficulty observ'd by the Ancients, why this
Distemper affects only the Chest or Breast.
The only thing that we want to be satisfied
of is, secondly, what that is in the Air that
induces this Distemper now to be so rise,
whence we may come at the <hi>Indoles materiae
morbisicae.</hi> And that I may not enter into that
vast Field, of the Cause of Seasons, and the
like Effects, which are taken into the Hand
of God's particular Providence to manage, I
shall confine my self to be guided by these few
Remarks:</p>
                  <p>1. That no Affections of the Air, or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
in it, depend on any Mixture of Mineral
Vapours, because they precipitate immediately;
neither do we find the places where are large
Eruptions of them, any whit Sicklier, or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
otherwise than other places: And then,
all Distempers are otherwise Solvable.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Qualities of the Air, that affect
our Bodies, consist not in, nor always with;
those that may be supposed to belong to the
grosser Air of our Atmosphere. I have known
Animals frequent some Years in a hard Frost,
which would be suppos'd to be pernicious to
them; and not only my self, but that most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Naturalist, and universally great
Man, and my honoured Friend, Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> hath
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59240:48"/>
observed, that some Years the hardest Frost hath
not hindred the Papilio's from coming out of
their Chrysitis, which in some mild Springs,
shall not be found abroad so soon. This is
the more fit Instance to prove what I say, must
be acknowledged by any that have observed the
necessity of Heat, and how much it contributes
to the Production of this Change.</p>
                  <p>3. That there are some Qualities in the Air
always, which are owing to the parts more
intimately mix'd with it, than is the Nitre,
that affects us with Cold, and which passeth
where the grosser is not admitted. This is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
in the Effects it has on Liquors, which
the Managers of them are forced to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to, for the reason of the Disposition to
ferment, or fret, or Incapacity of either, Acidity
and the like. All which some Years, Liquors,
especially Cyder, is propense to, be the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what it will.</p>
                  <p>4. That Heat and Cold, Wetness or Dryness
of Seasons, assist in inflicting a Disease, as they
may help admit these Particles.</p>
                  <p>5. That I have observ'd these Qualities of
the Air to be Temporary, and the Diseases
effected by the Air to be so too, and that in
their Continuation and Variation they usually
observe the Direction of both Causes, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Humour in succeeding Distempers
being usually traceable, as the Variation of it is
likewise accountable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59240:48"/>
Now although I can by no means maintain,
that the Hypothesis of that Learned and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Man, agrees with the Rise and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of this Distemper, or is sufficient to
explicate it, nor can answer for the Non-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of the Distemper before upon the
same occasion. Yet that it was a fair offer at
the Truth, and affords a good hint, is remarkably
to be taken notice of, in that this Winter, in
which more have died Apoplectick, and that
in the Country, than ever was taken notice in
Man's Memory, or deliver'd to have been in
any Age; I say that this Winter should be,
though not the hardest, yet remarkably long,
does seem to make the Nitrous Air a sharer in
the Cause. But as I except against the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this Distemper, by bare Obstruction
or Stagnation from Cold, as not sufficient, so I
come now to inquire, what farther knowledge
of this the Air will afford us, assisted by the
preceding Considerations, and to see how they
answer here, and how far the Footsteps and
Changes are discoverable. And as Truth is
not surely to be laid hold on, but when pursued
by a natural Method, so I wave all Hypothesis,
and only propose this Maxim or Rule to direct
me, which I take to be too necessary a Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to be deem'd a begging of the Principle.
The Air that is productive of a Distemper,
must produce some other Effects in differing or
less prepar'd Constitutions, and not hit only
where it can fully execute; and the Disposition,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59240:49"/>
Particles, or Qualities of the Air may reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
be inquir'd of these Effects, as Prints of its
footing.</p>
                  <p>The Diseases then that have been inflicted by
the Air this Winter, have been Feavers [which
I shall say nothing more of, than that the Heat
was gentle, that they were Putrid, and had
putrid Pains in the Sides and Limbs, and that
they affected the Head] or ulcerating Colds, so
I name them, being of two sorts, the first vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Fluxes of the <hi>Alvus,</hi> and <hi>Catamenia,</hi> the
other <hi>Ophthalmys,</hi> which wore off in three weeks
time by Suppuration. And lastly, The Small
Pox, which appears here a mixture of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Distempers, or Qualities in the Air; for
the Air here gives these remarkable Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
1. to Corrode, 2. to attenuating, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the parts seem to pierce to the Eyes and
Bowels. 3. To Flatulency, all which include
a tendency to flow. Which Qualities, as with
many reasons I concluded to be Nitrous, so
Vitriols mortified or resisted; and even those
Fluxes of the <hi>Catamenia,</hi> which in another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
Steel is observ'd to raise and increase, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
only to the force of the same Mineral;
which I was directed to by some further Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Air, which is too long for this
Discourse: Though the increase of some Fluxes
of this kind, upon the taking <hi>Sal Prunellae,</hi> which
usually gives a present check, is enough to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
such a Hint. The last Year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1697.
entred attended with a particular sort of Colds,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59240:49"/>
that induc'd an irregular Feaverishness; with
milinary Pimples spreading upon some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
places of the Body, so close and so small,
as to resemble a stain of Claret or other Scarlet
Liquor; which superceded by Tumour of other
parts, and Sickness, in some prov'd Mortal.
At the same time another Distemper was found
invading, though Sparsim only, which began
about the <hi>Michaelmas</hi> preceding, and continued
to the middle of the last Year, which first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
the Patient with want of Rest only, and
unaptness of the Brain for it, wherein the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
that was entirely well up, and had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
but upon lying down and disposure to
slumber, was sensible of such Distraction and
Uneasiness of the Head, as oblig'd him to fly
up immediately. This Distemper continuing,
brought a Cough without raising, and a sort of
an <hi>Icteritia,</hi> with Shortness of Breath, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and sudden Apprehensions of a <hi>Deliquium.</hi>
The Year 1696 enter'd with the same sort of
Colds, and with the Spring brought Epileptick
Distempers, which wore off with Scabbiness;
and many People, Young and Old, were sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
with Vertigo's; and others with Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in the Throats, and corroding Ulcers,
curable by Astringents only that were Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.
In 1695 <hi>Deliriums</hi> were frequent. In
1694 Feavers that seem'd to have their Seat in
the Glands, and were attended with great Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of the <hi>Saliva</hi> or Liquor of the <hi>Tonsillae.</hi> And
from three Years before reign'd Nervous Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matisms,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59240:50"/>
a Distemper very unusual, from the
acuteness of the Pain; the mortal Consequence
of them, and the puffiness of the Tumours,
very remarkable: This Disease hath continued
hitherto, but abating.</p>
                  <p>I engage not my self to solve or account for
all these Changes of Diseases, or the reason of
them; it is sufficient that none of these Cases
were attended with any apparent Feaver, the
Matter was in all seated in the Membranes, the
part affected in all was puffy, the Distempers
frequently chang'd one into another, affected
the Head and Nerves, cur'd by the same means,
which were Vitriolick, and were admitted by a
wet Constitution of the Air. So without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
inquiry into the Origine and Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Disposition, and Reason of it, it is
sufficient that I illustrate the Seat and Nature
of this Distemper, and I think I must be allow'd
that these Diseases proceeded from the same
common Cause and Humour, and were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrible
into each other, and have liberty to
conclude first, That this Peccant Humour was
seated in the Membranes. 2. That it was fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulent,
and had a flatulent Acidity. 3. That
the Matter was Nitrous. Neither think I my
self oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, to account for the Determination
of the Seat of this Humour, or the reason of
taking Cold, but shall from the evident Causes,
Matter and Seat of it, inferr,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59240:50"/>
That an Apoplexy is a sudden Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Life, by admission of Airy
Elastick Parts into the <hi>Caudex Cerebri,</hi>
together with Thick and Turgid Chyle,
and is owing to a Corrosive Nitrosity
and Fluor of the Blood, and Weakness
of the Vessels, or containing Parts of
the <hi>Caudex</hi> effected by Cold, the way
being firs forced in the anterior part of
the <hi>Cortex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I think this a sufficient Notion of it as a
Disease, but contradict not the difference that
must be made of Apoplexies inflicted by Force,
as Drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or gradual ones.</p>
                  <p>Having thus fix'd the Nature of the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
the Intentions of Cure are drawn from the
Morbid Dispositions, which are,</p>
                  <p>1. Nitrosity of the Blood, which indeed is
the Reason it is so very Florid in Apoplexies;
and to this is owing its Fluidity.</p>
                  <p>2. The Weakness of the Vessels from Cold
received by them, and by this I understand a
Clog of a disabled Serum, considering the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Cold in gross, as separating the Juyces,
and so mortifying them, as to put them past Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
                  <p>3. The Exorbitancy of Chyle, that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and conveighs Elastick Flatulent Parts.</p>
                  <p>All which indicate the Astriction, and other
Qualities I observ'd before to be in Vitrioline
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59240:51"/>
Waters, and the Requisites that capacitate
them for all this, are in full Virtue only found
in this <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pecies; where the Astriction is strongest,
and the quantity of Steel not so considerable,
as to increase the Heat or Turgency of the
Blood, in both which this kind exceed the other
two; though I cannot but judge, that a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the thin light sort, may in some cases
assist in more effectual preparatory Cleansing
the Brain, and be very properly directed to
precede. Indeed the <hi>Hypochondriaca Affectio</hi>
does so often dispose to this Distemper, that
as it will confirm much this Account, so will
much recommend this Method. It does not
belong to this History, to deliver an entire Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
or Method of Cure, nor am I so opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of my own Ability, as to prescribe it to
others of my Faculty; yet because this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
may come into other Mens hands, that
may judge this Digression Fruitless, without
some Improvement of it, I shall, for the sake
of the Fury and Suddenness of this Distemper,
give some Observations of mine, that may help
to occurr or prevent it, or assist, at least, in
shortning the Process, and fit it for an Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porany
Occasion. And though as Cases may
much differ, so a <hi>Plethora Sanguinis, Colluvies
Serosa,</hi> or Viscous Phlegm, Obstruction of the
<hi>Catamenia,</hi> and the like, is to be consulted when
they are in the Cause; yet the checking the
Fury of the Blood, as well as clearing the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
to the Brain, is best performsd by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeats,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59240:51"/>
and to more good Effect, than by Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and differ not so much in the Cure, as
they seem to do in the Cause; and my Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I shall deliver briefly thus.</p>
                  <p>1. That for Prevention (besides the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any known Cause or Occasion) the best
Deobstruents are such as joyn and mix with the
Matter they are to exterminate; of this sort
is <hi>Sapo venet,</hi> and <hi>Vrines humane,</hi> or perhaps
of other Animals; and these to be promoted to
the use of Chalybeat Astringents, where these
Waters claim their place. Only I must mind
the Reader, that if such a Relaxation of the
Vessels of the Brain attend it, as appears by
preceding vertiginous Warnings, I must after
the use of the Waters, dismiss the Patient to
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s <hi>Ens,</hi> which in the preceding Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
of the Membranes of the Brain, I have
experienc'd to be most Effectual.</p>
                  <p>2. As the other Method is to prevent and
restore, so for the present Relief in the Assault,
Emeticks and Catharticks usually distinguish
themselves: The other general and particular
Evacuations fall not under my Cognizance, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a System being not my design, yet Sternu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatories
must not escape my Reflection, which
I have ever observed to hasten the approaching
Death, to which the Nature, as well as the
Violence of the Motion made by Sneezing, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them; and are fit only to put the Patient
past Remedy with speed. And as this Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is necessary here, so a due Caution about
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59240:52"/>
Diet, which forbids eating Pork, or Eggs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
Meat of thick, high and flatulent Nourishment,
is necessary to be observ'd with respect to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.
Other Particulars that regard the
Constitution of the Patient, or Predisposition to
this Distemper that the Physician is to judge of,
lye not here before me. Thus much as to the
Apoplexy.</p>
                  <p>There are many other Distempers, wherein
a Water of this kind is peculiarly proper to
master and remove flatulent and viscous Matter,
and to curb the Turgescence of a florid Blood,
as in the Cephalick Disorders of Elder Women,

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the right understanding and due use of
all which, I shall observe, That the Cure of
the Foul Disease can be suppos'd to be put par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial;
unless that Distemper be taken in a less
strict Sense; and passing the Notion of Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the Stone, which I had rather express
by the preventing the increase of its growth,
I shall for the fixing Experience right, make
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59240:55"/>
this Remark, which may be usefully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to all the Waters,<note place="margin">☞</note> which is, That
in some Distempers (as Dropsie, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Jaundies and Gout) constant Success and
entire Cure is not to be expected, without regard
to the State of the Disease, the Age and Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it, the Cause of it, and the Distempers
complicated with it. Thus a Dropsie may not
submit to this Remedy, not only from the
Firmness of the Obstruction, but also from the
Constitution and Laxity of the Patient, from
the nature of the Disease, (which I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
sometimes to be from a Weakness of
the Membranes, by Flatulent Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in them) or from the Disease inducing
it. Convulsions here have remedy only ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated
to the Cause, be it a flatulent putrid
Matter (which usually gives the Distemper the
Denomination of Worms, from the effect of
it,) or be it from Melancholy Hypoch. and
Vapours Hysterical: But if seated in the Brain,
or supervening an Ague, or in a cold Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I think here can scarce have a proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
So the Jaundies I acknowledge have
been often cur'd by these Waters, and some of
the Purging ones, when it ow'd its Rise to an
Obstruction of the <hi>Catamenia,</hi> a Clog of Phlegm,
or uncocted Chyle, or Melancholy, but I must
not allow these, or any Waters, to cure this
Disease <hi>de Essentia.</hi> I think this Caution ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the understanding the proper Use of
these and all Waters, which by the help of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59240:55"/>
this may be distinctly known, and is of the
greater Importance, since upon many accounts
Empirical Use of these, and all other Remedies,
is found to be of Fatal Consequence.</p>

                  <head>The Virtues of the Atramentous Waters.</head>
                  <p>THese Waters, though they have the same
Virtues with other Chalybeat Waters in
some degree, and create an Appetite, and wash
the <hi>Viscera,</hi> yet penetrate not so far, open not
Obstructions so well, but are apt to raise a
Heat in the Blood, disagreeing to the design'd
Effect, have not that Acidity, nor calm Astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
These inrich the Blood, and where
that is necessary, and Obstructions remote
do not contraindicate, may happily be us'd;
and in the Stone are Competitors with others.
<hi>Agricola</hi> concludes these Effects, as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with other Vitrioline Waters. To cure
Corroding Ulcers, Ulcers of the Bladder and
Kidneys, in the Mouth, Weakness of the
Nerves, a weak Stomach they help: And
they may be used Internally and Externally.
But in Gout, Stone, or in Obstruction of the
Glands, and smaller Vessels, are not to be
used without Danger or Inconvenience, so not
in Hypochondriacal Cases. These are valuable
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59240:56"/>
in proportion, as they are rich of Steel, keep
it long, and have little bulk of Salt.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Virtues of the Light Chalybeat Waters.</head>
                  <p>THE Extraordinary Virtue of this sort
consists in, that as the Chalybeat Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
are in these most clean, so the Spirit
most thin, and the Water both light and thin.
And so we have their Virtues not only most
full here, but somewhat differing: They invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate
the Blood without Heating, penetrate
farther without Inconvenience, Volatilize, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
more, and their Acidity goes off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leaving impression behind it preternatural.
Thus as the heavy Waters that contain less
of the Steel, and whose Acidity is of a more
fix'd Nature, have a peculiarity of Astringing
without Heating; so this sort are extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
qualify'd for opening Obstructions, but
seem not to have the same power of Astringing
in an equal degree: And on this account they
do not mortifie a Scorbutick, Leprous Humour
or Itch so well, nor are so powerful to stop
Fluxes of Blood. I think fit to observe these
different Effects, which being remark'd, I refer
the Reader for the reputed Virtues of these
Chalybeats, to the Virtues of the <hi>Knaresborow</hi>
Water. I shall therefore pass on to examine
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59240:56"/>
what Obstructions they remove, which I shall
do, by exhibiting only Histories of my own
Observation; and from thence further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
the use of them.</p>
                  <p>Among the Cures of this kind, none is more
familiar than that of the Stone, by removing
the Disposition to the Generation of it, and
restoring a good habit, as well to the whole
Body, as to the parts immediately concern'd.
And although this Cure is perform'd by a
timely Precipitation of the earthy parts out
of the <hi>Latex</hi> and Juyces of the parts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
their natures; and so is owing to the
Qualities that these Chalybeat Waters seem
to enjoy in common; yet the fineness and
penetration of this sort of them, must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
an extraordinary Qualification.</p>
                  <p>But the Obstructions that I principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
here, are such as yield to no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
so constantly at least; and whose fatal
Consequence gives these Waters an inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
value. Of this sort, I reckon first an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Glands of the Mesentery;
wherein, beside the sign of Chylous Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and rejection of Food an hour or two
after eating, the Patient complains not of
want of Appetite, discernable Feaver, or pain,
or other disorder, till Feaver, Cough, and
want of Rest (which last often precedes) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with the Emaciation upon the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of this Disease. Of this I have found
<hi>Tunbridge</hi> Water an effectual Remedy, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59240:57"/>
most canstant, never failing those that I have
known to have try'd it, who have been not a
few. And the small Spring at <hi>Felstead,</hi> I find
avail with equal success.</p>
                  <p>An Obstruction of the <hi>Thymus,</hi> which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
it self by pain at the Breast, chiefly
upon the Foods arrival at the place of its
seat; which upon the increase of the Tumour
of this Gland, resists the passing of the Food
into the Stomach, and makes the Patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it, at least as soon as the <hi>Oesophagus</hi> is a
little fill'd, is a Disease of equal consequence
with the other, and which I have known these
Waters speedily cure.</p>
                  <p>Another Disease from Glandular Obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
cured by these Waters, is the Dropsie, a
Cure of which is taken notice of by Mr. <hi>Boyle;</hi>
but the Design of these Observations, being to
form an Experience, that may be distinct,
clear, and not fallacious, I must add, That
the Effects of the Waters in this Distemper,
fall not under so single a consideration as in the
other, but that there are so many requisites
in the Cases where these are proper, as make
a good Judgment necessary in the use of them,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orbid the drinking of them without
good Advice. For although I have reason to
believe them to be constantly effectual, timely
taken, by those whose Constitution was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by trouble, and perhaps to be the only
Remedy; and likewise in a Phlegmatick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;
yet not only the seasonable and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59240:57"/>
timely taking of them is to be consulted, but
a Crasis of Blood, that needs not invigorating,
does sometimes receive damage by them. And
this I speak not by rote, but have known some
<hi>Quin Faeminae quinquagenariae,</hi> florid and lively,
that the drinking of these Waters have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with a beginning Dropsie, the nature
of these Waters (being to invigorate the
Blood, and produce the <hi>Catamenia)</hi> was so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in effect. And in a Dropsie that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
upon an Asthma, in a person of a florid
sanguine Complexion, either a Chalybeat Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of greater astringency, as the <hi>Knaresborow,</hi>
and that has least Steel; or else a Chalybeat
that Purges, as <hi>Scarborow</hi> Water, is much more
proper.</p>
                  <p>I proceed to remark next, the like extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
effect of these light Waters in Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the Stomach, the pain by which they
discover themselves is most exquisite. A pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tumour of many Months at the pit of the
Stomach, and reputed Scirrhous, I knew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
and quite remov'd by <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Waters.
I might instance in other Flatulent Distenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Stomach, and question not but they
might be used with success in Ulcers of the
Stomach, though in them I have not known
these Waters made tryal of. But the most
common Distemper, or rather Symptom of
the Stomach diseased, is known only by the
name of Pain. It is necessary to distinguish
the kinds of this more nicely than is usual,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59240:58"/>
and I shall not inquire here into the particular
seats of it, but mind the Reader in general,
that by the name of this Distemper, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
an affection of the Stomach or Ventricle,
from Matter lodg'd in or near it, excepting
those Affections of it, <hi>per consensum,</hi> from the
Head, or in acute Diseases; and so it includes
the primary Distempers of that Region, that
produce pain in the Ventricle. I fansie a <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labus</hi>
of all the Affections and Symptoms of this
kind, would be useful, and might be instituted
after this manner.</p>
                  <p>Though the pit of the Stomach has the
greatest sense of the Pain, yet this Pain may
be all over the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>So an obtuse Pain with Faintness and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and an <hi>Hemicrania,</hi> signifies a watry va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
state of the Blood, as in a <hi>Chlorosis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same with Sickness attends a full
Dropsie.</p>
                  <p>A rending Pain with weakness, follows great
Evacuations in weakly Bodies, as Suckling.</p>
                  <p>Shooting to the Back, denote the matter to
be windy, be it in the Cavity or elsewhere,
and Cholicks vary. To say nothing here of
Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>Moving a Rheumatism there fix'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
immediately upon eating.</p>
                  <p>Pain moving and fixing in Spots, with most
exquisite Pain, Coldness, and Convulsive Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings,
and working off with a Loosness, and
coming some six or seven hours after, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59240:58"/>
a nervous Rheumatism, or rather Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous.</p>
                  <p>This last again increases or assaults upon
Cold taking, and is sometimes seated in the
Coats of the Stomach, and sometimes in the
Membranes adjoyning, or both; so in some
I have observ'd it to strike from the Stomach
in a Vein, as they call it, upward, side-ways, or
the like; and not to bear a Position of the
Body that pents it, for the part afflicted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
seems pent.</p>
                  <p>An obtuse Pain contracting the Stomach,
such as is usually express'd by knitting, attends
Hysterick Fits.</p>
                  <p>An obtuse Pain without this, an Obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Catamenia;</hi> or a <hi>Plethora sanguinis</hi> in
hot Weather chiefly.</p>
                  <p>The Ventricle may be affected near its up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Orifice at the Pit of the Stomach only,
with a nipping Pain, or a knitting Pain, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the Hypochondriacal; and an obtuse
Pain, with a Sense of weight in Trouble and
Melancholly.</p>
                  <p>The sense of Pentness accompanies Wind,
the sense of Fullness, Water or Humour. So
I might proceed to Soreness, Coldness and
Acuteness, Faintness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are other Pains near the Stomach,
as in the Jaundies, about the bottom toward
the right side, so in a distemper'd Spleen or
Liver, or Pancreas, may be known by their
Situation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:59240:59"/>
Thus Judgment is to be made of the proper
use of these Waters, from the Cause or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Disease; and of what means may
reasonably be used together with them. For
an Obstruction of the <hi>Catamenia</hi> may make
that Remedy necessary that a <hi>Plethora</hi> forbids.
A <hi>Chlorosis</hi> in a Phlegmatick Constitution is
better cured with other Chaiybeats, and a Pain
from Weakness requires another Intention.
So that the use of these Waters is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
chiefly to Pains Convulsive in the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
and Hypochondriacal, and to other
Collections of Wind or Phlegm from any
Obstructions. And although these chiefly
arise from the <hi>Affectio Hypochondriaca;</hi> and so
are curable in the general Intention, yet
greater Accuracy is necessary both to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Distemper, and assigning a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
and without which, sure Observation
can never be made.</p>
                  <p>Another Disorder of the Stomach, is want
or loss of Appetite, which though it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
by other Waters and means, yet not
only is more fully recover'd by these, but its
cause more perfectly remov'd.</p>
                  <p>But there are other Distempers cur'd by
these Waters, which are less understood, and
over which these reign alone. I shall instance
in two. The one is a Fistula, which though
of many Years standing, I have known effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
cur'd in six Weeks, by the sole drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Water. The other which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59240:59"/>
appear'd to me as extraordinary, was a Perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
Feaver and Cough, which I knew a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
cur'd of by the same Waters, who
for many Years had never escaped an Assault
about <hi>October,</hi> before she was freed by this
Remedy. Obstructions of the Pancreas I should
have named before.</p>
                  <p>The Virtue these have of Chearing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and relieving a Heart oppress'd with
Trouble, or tumultuated with any Passions, is
as extraordinary as any of the former; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed the Cause and Producer of the
Glandular Obstructions, which together with
Cephalick Distempers, as Giddiness, Pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
come under the <hi>Affectio Hypochondriaca,</hi> which
therefore I shall consider now distinctly in all
its Symptoms.</p>

of this Distemper to understand, is, that it
not only affects and distempers the Brain, but
likewise the Mind it self is a sufferer in it;
which it chiefly or first afflicts with Fear and
Despair; and freeing the Passions from the
government of Reason, makes way to all the
extravagant Actings, that an abused Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
can give colour to; and every Object
receives its weight from the Standard of the
ruling Passion. The extravagant Dotages of
this kind are numerous in History, and either
are ruled by the Impressions of the last Stage,
or Age of Life, or drown us in the present;
or which is most common, distract between
the Sense of both; and make us lose the use
of our Judgment, if not of our Reason. Now
this Distemper is effectually cured in all its
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59240:61"/>
Symptoms, by these Light Chalybeat Waters,
and to inquire into the Nature of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
and on what account they do it,
may not only be agreeable to enlighten the
Disease, but teach us the full Scope of the
Virtue of the Remedy. If we seek into the
Cause and Seat of this Distemper, we may
observe it to be induced by despiriting, and
may have its Original either in the Mind, or
the Body; and as it naturally is produced in
our Bodies, I observe,</p>
                  <p>1. That it is a Flatus, as gross, crude, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concocted,
and vapid.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Fit usually comes six hours after
eating, or as soon as the Chyle is digested, and
the Spirit of it spent.</p>
                  <p>3. It is occasion'd by Diet, yielding a thick
and plentiful Nourishment, and Flatulent, and
by thick fermented Liquors as Ale.</p>
                  <p>4. A working active Life that preserves the
Concoction, and duly forceth on the Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and cleanseth the Body, joyn'd with a
spare and more simple Diet, is little affected
with this Distemper.</p>
                  <p>5. Sower Belchings, not Signs of Acid in
the Body, as is commonly judg'd erroniously,
but only the effect of rich Liquors despirited,
and effete or changed.</p>
                  <p>6. The time of its Accession is remarkable,
which is at the Turn of Life to its declive, or
at 27 Years, though may be put off longer in
some, but begins then, when the Body begins
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59240:61"/>
to be despirited, when whereas before we see
every thing through the eyes of hope, we now
are apt to view with despair.</p>
                  <p>7. It joyns hand with the Scurvy.</p>
                  <p>8. Is cured by Acids, as Spirit of Vitriol or
Sulphur in some measure, and kept off by
drinking common Water, which is void of
Fermentation, or elastick Turgescence.</p>
                  <p>All which marks inform us, That this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
is seated in the Chyle, which when
effete and tumultuating, produceth these effects;
and as it may be discharg'd and slung, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
more terrible ones in earnest, which as
it is moving, it only represents by lighter
touches: And as the grand Cardo of our Life
at the Climocteric before named, gives op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
for this Insult; so the strength of
these Turgid parts of our Nourishment, is
discernable in other States of Life, though the
Violence is most apparent at the meeting of
differing habits. For that all these Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
are owing to our Nourishment, and that
we admit our Dispositions to Passion and Vice
by our Throat, and only then when we take
more than is necessary or requir'd by Nature,
we are taught not only in Men where we see
the effects of Ease and Luxury, only when it
is in an high degree; but the power of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nourishment and manner of living, is
most conspicuous in other Animals, especially
the more tender. These Animals that live
hard (that is) use great labour to get their
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59240:62"/>
Food; and that mild and unfermented, are
free from three Dispositions that Domestick
Animals, as those that dwell near Towns, or
have opportunity of living easie, are lyable
to. The first is, change of colour in Coat or
Feathers. 2. Inconstancy to their Mate, and
Intemperance in Passions. The last is, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemperature
of Body, and lyableness to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.
No wild Animal was ever observ'd by
Naturalists, to have been seiz'd by those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
which afflict them when kept <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tame.
Hens I have seen Epileptic, Magpyes are often
afflicted by the same Distemper when housed,
but who ever found them fallen in the Fields?
The same may be observ'd of other Animals,
as Bull-finches, and many Quadrupids, which
can scarce bear housing, without peril of
some Disease or other. Which seems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that a distemper'd Air can make no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
but upon a vitiated Nourishment.
And this gives me a rise to add, That as the
Efforts of our Passions, that are owing to our
Intemperance, are more silent in other sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of our Life, so it is observable, they
have not been distinguish'd by any Inquirers
into Humane Nature, through want of well
understanding Humane Nature distinctly, or
in its simplicity. And here I find a late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Author much wanting to himself, in
not examining the Fountains of Idea's, which
would have helped him to have uncompound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, who, might by this means have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59240:62"/>
Practical Idea's; a Principle of Justice
being as difficultly erased, as that of Self-preservation.
For (to wave questioning the
Hypothesis of Idea's) since Judgment is made
of Objects, as they lye in the Imagination, it
must needs be, that, as on the one hand the
undue Examination of things may make a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
imperfect, so the strain of Imagination
by our Passions, must render our Judgment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just.
And this we see in our grosser Passions,
as Fear, Anger, Love or Aversion, but cannot
discern it so well in the lesser Emotions of our
Temper, which seem more quiet, wherein yet
it is equally discoverable, that the Inequality
of our Temper sways our Judgment, and is
often before-hand in the Cause, where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
only in the sequel, and seems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the Determination. Indeed we
may usually see in any error the stamp of
that Temper that form'd the Argument, or
of a rapid and unheedy Apprehension, that
inform'd the Understanding; so necessary to
right thinking and due Notions of things is
a due Temper, by how much our Passions
have a share in adjusting, if not forming, our
Idea's. I might here observe the Mistake of
those that refer the illness of their Nature,
to the necessity of their make, and how na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
the Account is, of Man's first Defection:
But to keep close to my Subject, I shall only
mind, that the Debility of our Mind, as well
as the Infirmities of our Bodies, is owing to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59240:63"/>
the Irregularity of our Living, and Vice of
our Nourishment. An Instance of this, is the
Distemper in hand, not only in the distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fears, and tumultuating Passions, that
attend it; and the innumerable delirous Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that are consequent to it, but in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
of the Body, as Obstructions of the parts
before mention'd, with Cephalick Diseases,
as Convulsions, Epilepises, Apoplexies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
the last nam'd of which, is so often owing to
the Pre-disposition of this Distemper, as much
confirms the account I have before given of
it. Now although the reason of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriac
Affection, as it gives a reason of
the effect of these Waters, may make this
account satisfactory enough; yet it is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
serviceable, in discovering the Cure more
clearly and perfectly, and by giving a right
Notion of it, may assist in setting the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to rights, and help those that are
afflicted, to make a true Judgment of their
Disturbances, as well as incourage them to a
Cure. With respect to a Cure, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Benefit of Exercise, and a moderate
Diet, without fermented Liquors; and that
Action and Attention are required, to Health
of Body and Mind. That Action is necessary
to due Thinking, all studious Men may and
do observe, and the reason is, That the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
of the Chyle, or Stoppages of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
by it, are remov'd by the hurry of the
Blood; which, together with steadiness of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59240:63"/>
Mind, which I call Attention, gives our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
its free Exercise and Working. And as
the same thing, that Exercise doth with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Living, is effected artificially by these
Waters, so the pleasure of an even Life, void
of these Hurries and Inconveniencies, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
a preventional Method of this way of
Living, for its Rectitude and Generosity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Flights and Extreams of the other,
that must seek for Remedies to Art. And it
is to be noted, That as this Distemper, in all
its Symptoms and Consequences, is effectually
cured by these Waters; and as it is moderated
by the foremention'd means, so all that are
affected with it, find their Error in drinking
Wine and strong fermented Liquors, as an
artificial Support, by the great sinking of
their Spirits, if not other Symptoms; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
about six hours after, and by the increase
of the Distemper by that means. To which
I may add, what may be no small Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and hath not been taken notice of by
Physicians usually, That the Distempers that
seize the Body at the Climactericks, if they
be moderated, so as to be kept from making
any mortal breach, will usually in two or
three Years time, depart of themselves upon
moderate living. I could give many Instances
of Epilepsies themselves, as well as Giddinesses,
Convulsions, a beginning Phthisis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
abated without any means two or three Years
after. But as this Remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> these Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59240:64"/>
relieve variety of Diseases, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the power of distemper'd Chyle or
Nourishment, and Weakness of Constitution
at the Cardines of our Life or Climactericks;
so the Observation of this may turn to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
if we consider, That many Distempers
that are not usually distinguish'd, are of this
Original: For the enlarging therefore of this
Benefit, we may observe, That the <hi>Affectio
Hypochondriaca,</hi> is, in this respect, but a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Distempers, which we may call Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macteric
or Cardinal. For the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of my Sense in this matter, I must
take notice, That though I cannot admit the
receiv'd Notion of them fully, either as to
their Fatality, or superstitious Original from
Numbers, yet that at the Septenaries, or near
the Body, receives its Changes, is not to be
denied; and that then many Diseases have
their Original, which may execute not fully
till some Years after. But although every
Septenary may be in some sort considerable,
yet I judge from Experience, that some may
be reputed Cardinal, and that not from the
Efficacy of Number, which runs the grand
Climacteric upon 63. Those that I find rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to name Cardinal, are those on which our
Life receives a considerable Change of State;
and though the fourteenth Year, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
cannot be excluded, yet Observation
of Distempers, or Mortality, makes me, with
respect to Diseases, to make or name three
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59240:64"/>
grand Climactericks, and to fix them on those
Years, when the Body receives its grand Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
in its Cuspis and declension, and
these are 21, 27 and 49. The Diseases of the
first are Hemorrhages and Consumptions,
which are frequent at that Age to enter the
Constitution, and not to yield to Remedies
till two or three Years after, though the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Exulceration render it curable.
The Distempers of the second are Cephalick,
Nervous and Flatulent. Those of the third
again are Phthises, Gouts, Stone, Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagies,
Rheumatisms, and other Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that proceed from an over Alkalisat
Crasis of the Blood, as hot, burning or smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
running Pains, and the like. In all which
cases these Waters may be expected to be
highly serviceable, by the same Qualifications
that capacitate them to relieve the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal,
<hi>viz.</hi> by Astringing, Deobstructing,
Invigorating, and taking off either the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasm
or Degeneracy of the Chyle. And I
speak not this without some Instances that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it: But from Hypochondriacal Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
I pass on next to Ulceration of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
which I have known cured in more than
one by <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Waters, which I must make
this Remark on, That they were Women of
the last cardinal or grand Climacterick. But
yet must not this confine the use of these Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to that case only, or forbid their proper
use in like Ulcers in other Ages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:59240:65"/>
Thus according to my design, I have recited
what I have experienced of their Virtues, but
I must not pass the Cure of Periodical annual
Colds and Feavers (which I mention above)
without this useful Observation, that as it is
the Peccancy of the Chyle, or Faeces of it,
that makes the Body obnoxious to the Effects
of the Air, so it may be reasonable to expect
the use of the same Remedy to be successful in
some other Distempers that come under this
Consideration.</p>

                  <head>Of some general Directions to be observ'd in
the Vse of the Chalybeat Waters.</head>
                  <p>THE Directions that emerge from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Waters, and of the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
they are used in, vary in some measure
with the Constitution of the Drinker, the
State and Nature of the Distemper, and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they are drank in. And although the
Choice of the Species of Water is directed by
the Distemper, yet nice or infirm and cold
Constitutions, make exactness necessary in
choosing those that have least Coldness; on
which account some have found, in the light
sort, <hi>Wellenborow</hi> and <hi>Islington</hi> less safe to be
drank, or to require more caution, from their
ill Effects on those that have drank them when
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59240:65"/>
out of Temper. The Season that one would
wish to drink these Waters in, is a dry Time,
and Summer, the Waters being then strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and the Season favouring their exerting
their Astringency, and inspiriting Qualities;
yet as Distempers do not wait always for the
conveniency of the Remedy, so the Waters
have been found effectual at all Seasons like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
And the incommode of the Season
may be help'd, by a Glass of somewhat more
Generous, after the Waters are run off, as
<hi>Gentian</hi> Wine, or the like; or Chalybeat Wine
in the Afternoon, which I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound to be
very Helpful, where the Moisture of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or Weakness of the Constitution made it
necessary; but not to be continued longer
than it was so. The difference of the Water
makes some difference in the rule of Drinking,
the Heavy ones not allowing so long a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of Drinking, and often admitting,
if not requiring, Purging, during the Course,
which six Weeks may well determine; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the light sort may safely, and ought to be
continued longer, to prevent return of the
Disease, and establish the Constitution: Else
the Chalybeat Waters require the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Rule, which is to be observ'd before, in
the time of, and after the drinking. Before
the drinking, that the foulness of the first
ways may not be carried farther, and at least
clog the Remedy, and that Nature may be
more light and easie, that must be removed,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59240:66"/>
before the drinking of the Waters is entred
upon. And although it cannot be supposed,
that the proper Purges for particular cases,
can here be consulted, yet that Emeticks, in
Cephalick Diseases, are best and fittest to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
all the ends necessary, is an Intimation
I cannot allow my self to pass. Catharticks
ought to be doubled at about two days di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
the first to regard the cleansing the
first ways, may be by a Bole of Lenitive Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
and as much <hi>Resina Jallopii</hi> as may
quicken it to desire, or Pills, or Draughts of
Infusion of Sena and Rhubarb; in both which
forms, I admire the additions of Salts either
of Wormwood or Tartar, that may make
them more detersive, and occur any unnatural
or exorbitant Acid. The latter Purgation
ought to regard the Disease, as Lenitive Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
with <hi>P. Diasenae,</hi> and <hi>Dialtheae,</hi> or
Manna for Gravel. In Colicks, and where
the Wind afflicts the Bowels, <hi>Hiera Picra.</hi>
In Cephalick Distempers, or where there is a
Disposition to be Aguish, gentle Emeticks.
Where Wind afflicts the more remote Passages,
or in the Blood, afflicting the Muscular parts,
Infusions of Purging Ingredients, as Sena and
Rhubarb, with a handful of Chamomel Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or the Weakness of the Stomach may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the <hi>Decotum amarum</hi> made Purging, or
Pills of <hi>Rudii</hi> and <hi>Ruffii</hi> mix'd, and two or
three drops of Oyl of Cinnamon. The Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
<hi>Succus Ebuli</hi> in the quantity of Cochl. 2
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59240:66"/>
                     <hi>vel</hi> 3 is most proper for, in my Judgment: In
the Melancholick Constitutions, an Infusion
of Sena and Salt of Tartar, among others, is
one of the first rate: The Scurvy, bitter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions.
The three last Diseases, these Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as other Chalybeats, serve, by strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
invigorating, and carrying off the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
Matter; and therefore those need a
due preparatory Course, as is sufficient to
bring the Blood and Vessels into such a state
as may be fit for these Waters. But yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
Dropsies, and other Obstructions from
Trouble of Mind, admit these Waters as the
only Remedy, and require no course but this
general Preparation. Excepting Dropsies, and
Distempers that are attended with old Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and Apoplectick Dispositions in Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Brains, I say, setting aside these, the
Purging Waters are the best Preparative, wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more universally, and leaving the Body in
the Temper that is most fit; and sometimes
prevents the necessity of these Chalybeat Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
the Proprieties of which, will appear in
a Table at the end of their History. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Pains of the Stomach often happen to
be so violent, as not to allow the use of these
Waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before they are abated, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
require a particular Evacuation, it seems
incumbent on me, to give some information,
how that Symptom may be reliev'd: They
are usually one of these three sorts, First, a
Convulsive Nipping Pain at the pit of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59240:67"/>
Stomach, that holds for some Weeks, and soon
upon eating is exacerbated: This usually rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
gives way, either to an Infusion of <hi>Baccae
Juniperi</hi> in Whitewine, or Ol. Terebinth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
inwardly, the last 16 drops at a time in
Beer. Another is a Pain all over the Stomach,
though sometimes gathering more to one part
of it, and is more violent and racking, and
goes off with a Looseness, being from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
of Watry Matter; This yields to the
common Domestick Glysters often repeated,
and is check'd by <hi>Ens Veneris,</hi> and sometimes
by Chalybeat Wine. The Pain that attends
a <hi>Chlorosis</hi> by <hi>Ol. Caryophyllorum</hi> taken in Sugar;
if from a depauperate Blood, by <hi>Vinum Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeatum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> here comes under consideration,
which, although some Asthma's, and other
cases, may render it necessary, yet, where
not necessary, is to be avoided, as an ill Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>para<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ivee
for drinking of Water; and must be
referr'd, together with other Preparations in
partic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> Distempers, to the Judgment of
the Physician that knows the Distemper, and
consults the Constitution.</p>
                  <p>Of drinking I purpose not to prescribe
either time or quantity, which vary with the
Disease and Constitution of the Drinker; but
only shall note, that as rising gradually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to a
full quantity, is required not only by the body,
that it may the better bear it, but by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper'd
part too: So the Vessels, that they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59240:67"/>
may be cleansed and strengthned in their own
Tone and Tension, require a gradual decrease.
But though the continuation of this Remedy
must be prescrib'd by the Nature of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
yet that a Caution is necessary, that the
drinking them be not left off too soon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in that in my own Observation, many
having suffer'd a Relapse, for want of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
the Remedy some time after the Cure.
And this is so general, that I may perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
assert, that less than three Months is not
generally sufficient to the drinking of them,
though they take effect in half the time. It is
not convenient to drink these Waters too
early, nor without some preceding walking
to empty the Body; neither is it safe to lye
down upon them, especially in Cephalick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers;
nor to allow any business to take
place in the Thoughts; on which score the
distance of the Wells, and the Resort, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
the drinking these Waters at their
Springs. But the most material Rule, which
the very design of them require, is, That du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Course, the Drinker use Exercise,
avoid all Flatulent Diet, and that of Gross
and much Nourishment, and drink as little
fermented Liquor as he may. And here espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
drinking much Wine is to be condemned
on a double account, for beside that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
Temper that the Wine gives, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them unfit for drinking the Waters the
Morning following, it opposes the Remedy,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59240:68"/>
and renders it ineffectual, by supporting the
Morbid State; and for this Reason, as gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Liquors are not to be omitted at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the drinking, so they ought wholly
to be set aside when the Course is well enter'd;
without which, Hypochondriacism, which is
the most general Case, will not admit of any
entire Conquest. Neither is the Course of
Living to be ended with the Course of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Waters, but that the use of them

abstemious living, with Exercise, ought to be

by how much it is disturb'd by Purging,

and Experience place this means last. But in

but remains a Question among Learned Men;
so the Varieties of their Natures, not having
been examin'd, have rendred the differences
of them unuseful. The due Examination of
both, I shall therefore propose, with their
Uses, which we shall find great, and very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct.
The Method I shall use, shall be to set
apart their Principles, and then inquire into
them, and then make Essays of the Waters.
In order to this, I shall distinguish their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristicks
and proper Signs, and trace their
Original. And that we may proceed surely,
I have examin'd the Waters at the Wells, and
the Earths of the several Wells, my self, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
those that I had as sure a Conveniency
of inquiring into, by some accurate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>question'd
Friends. The Purging Quality of
these Waters then, resides in the Salt, which
is peculiar to Wells that have these Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
               <p>These Purging Waters are all found above
the dead Loam, in a Loamy Clay, that is the
same continued to the Foundation, or dead
Loam. This I have found common to the
Selenitical Waters, as well as others; and in
this Loamy Clay, the Water hath only a level
Spring: And though the Waters, by the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
may seem to be in a Gravel, as those of
<hi>Richmond,</hi> yet the Earth, as I was there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by those that sunk the Well, proves to
be a continu'd Clay, and without mixture of
Gravel down to the dead Loam. The <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:59240:71"/>
Waters, by an Exception against this,
being a running Spring, and in a Gravel, but
the Earth of all others, that have had a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velly
Surface, proving upon Inquiry a Loamy
Clay, as that of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and that near <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
it is reasonable to allow me it here,
where the Spring is not lyable to enquiry;
and since in my examination of that Spring, I
shall prove it a complicated one, of a Saline
Water, as the rest, joyn'd with a Chalybeat
Water, which sort are ever running Springs.</p>
               <p>2. A Nitre ever appears on the Earth, about
the Springs where it is expos'd to the Air, so
at <hi>Scarborow, Woodham-Ferrys, Acton,</hi> &amp;c. at
<hi>Epsam</hi> it shews it self like a white Incrustati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet these Nitres all differ from the Salts
contain'd in the Waters.</p>
               <p>3. The Matter impowering these Waters,
is a Salt, of which they contain a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
some in a dry Season, affording near a
Dram in a Pint: The Quantities may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
from the weights of the Waters; and
this Salt not Volatile.</p>
               <p>4. They have universally one common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex,
that is, a Stone, form'd out of, and
bearing the face of Loam within when broken.
At <hi>Epsam</hi> it is more mellow, from the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Chalk that that Soyle affords; else it
is naturally hard, as I observ'd it in all the
other Wells, almost to striking of Fire with
Steel. At <hi>Alford</hi> (my Friend inform'd me)
the Stone would strike Fire, but not strong
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59240:72"/>
enough to kindle Tinder: This Stone is
is a sort of <hi>Pyrites,</hi> as the great Naturalist,
and Learned Physician, Dr. <hi>Martin Lister,</hi>
rightly names it; but that being a name of a
Genus of Marcasites, and so too large an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellative,
I shall particulary describe this,
which is peculiar to this sort of Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
This Stone then (which is found in
these Wells, at the bottom near the dead
Loam where the Water ooseth) in outward
crust resembles a Pibble, and as unform'd, and
as differing in bulk, most amounting to the
size of a Man's Head; and more of them are
found bigger than less. It is heavy and very
hard; when broke, it appears coated, with
flakes of <hi>Gypsum,</hi> some white, some yellowish,
some Alabastrine, not exceeding in thickness
the eighth of an Inch; and from its breaking,
and thready Composition, is distinguish'd by
Naturalists by the name of <hi>Trichitis.</hi> This
Coat invests some wholly, some are cased here
and there only, some this passing into, divides
into parcels: The Matter or Body of these
parcels too, differ in hardness, and some in
colour, containing Iron, either of the natural
colour as in most, or rushy, as in <hi>Richmond;</hi>
but most of these Stones are pure Loam hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<hi>Richmond</hi> Stone had this peculiar to it,
that the Stone was invested with <hi>Gypsum,</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
not divided by it as the rest, and was of a
lighter colour, near that of ashes not high
burnt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:59240:72"/>
The Stone of <hi>Dulwich</hi> again resembled the
rest, but had many shining Particles appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as in Marcasites: Their differences and
different Reasons follow by and by in their
Essays, and will be found agreeable to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Waters; where they will be
found to have no Essential difference, from
any Metalline parts or other, besides what
the differing nature of their Salts import,
which from their differing depth, and remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
from Nitre, makes the Stone proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
Marcasitical, or vary with the Soile:
The shining of some of these Stones, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to the Marcasitical Nature of the Juyce,
and found the same Particles natural to the
dead Loam, whence this Juyce seems to be
deriv'd, which seem'd to imply, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of this Juyce, consisted not in any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Mineral parts, but difference of
Digestion, and the Qualities the different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
may give it. I observ'd, among my
other Essays of these Stones, that when by
Fusion with fine Glass, I endeavour'd to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
any Mineral Tincture, though I disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
not any, yet the <hi>Dullwich</hi> Stone in the
same Fire, and at the same time, pierc'd the
Vessel it was melted in, which was of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-pipe
Clay, and made it break smooth
and shining like <hi>China</hi> Earth, which the other
Stones did not effect.</p>
               <p>The Gellying of these Stones in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
to me imported the same, it being the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ture
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59240:73"/>
of differing Marcasites, to form a Butter with
the same Salts; from which yet these differ'd,
in that these afforded it not by Sublimation,
which I try'd. And from the Nature of this
Juyce, the <hi>Dullwich</hi> Water seems to derive
the unkindliness of its Effects, which bears not
drinking with the same freedom as others,
being more cold and heavy on the Stomach.
The further inquiry into the Nature of these
Stones and Juyce informing them, and how
they have reference to these Waters, comes
in its place. The harmlesness of this Juyce,
appears in the <hi>Epsam</hi> Stone, which is more
lax and open, being not harder than a Chalk,
which shew'd its Original, but not the Essence
of its Purging, to require the unalter'd Juyce:
That the <hi>Epsam</hi> Stone is the same with the
other appear'd, in that some parts of it, as
well as some parts of the Gypseous Earth,
would gelly in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> as well as the other;
especially those parts where the Selenites shot.
Else the Infusion of this Stone gave a Green,
with Syrup of Violets, which the others gave
not.</p>
               <p>Having thus found the constant Mineral
Qualifications of these Wells, and <hi>Indicia</hi> of
the Waters, it will be satisfactory now, to
observe more closely the Waters, and in what
or how they agree. And these power to be
the same in Original and Nature further,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:59240:73"/>
1. That the Taste is common to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as well the Selenitical, or wherein the
<hi>Selenites</hi> are form'd, as the other sort which
are found in a constant loamy Clay and even,
and this in all its differences. For the smooth
Taste of <hi>Richmond</hi> Waters, is match'd by the
<hi>Colchester;</hi> the Bitterness of <hi>Epsam,</hi> in <hi>Dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
and a little in <hi>Brentwood-weal.</hi> Besides
there is somewhat of a common Taste to all;
so that may assist us in discovering their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>2. The Salt, though it differs, some being
figur'd, and some not, (of the latter sort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Epsam</hi> and <hi>Acton)</hi> some melting difficultly,
some easily, with the heat of a temperate
Hand, as the Salt of the same Waters do;
yet it agrees in its Nature, between a Nitre
and a Vitriol, joyning with Vitriols, and not
precipitating them, freedom from any Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Qualities and Temper, in which is a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Acidity and Nitre, and working a little
both with Acids and Alkalys, and having these
Qualities, the same with the Salts, they are
affine to.</p>
               <p>3. In their Virtues, not only in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of Purging, but in helping the Appetite,
allaying Hypochondriack Flatus, and the like
Effects which are Vitrioline.</p>
               <p>Now the Purging Wells are of two sorts,
The first affording a Stone, call'd by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists
the <hi>Selenites,</hi> which is shot in the Clay
where the Water issues; and these Wells al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59240:74"/>
afford veins of putrid Iron, together
with the <hi>Selenites,</hi> and some quantities of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Acid Juyce, like Spirit of Sulphur or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
in a condens'd coagulated form, or mix'd
with the Earth, and lying in yellow or Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugineous
Veins. Thus both at <hi>Epsam</hi> and
<hi>Woodham-Ferrys</hi> I found it, by examining the
Wells when new dug. The other sort have
no differing face consisting of an uniform Loam
to the bottom.</p>
               <p>I shall first give a short view of the proofs,
by which we may be sure we are rightly fix'd
upon the true Ingredients or Principles, and
then examine their Nature, and Reason of
their Production.</p>
               <p>That the Matter which these Wells exhibit
to our view, are the very Principles of the
Purging Salt of these Waters, and parcels of
the Matter, is proved by these following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>1. The Nature of the Purging Salts varies
as these vary, as may be observed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the Essays of the Waters, with the
Tryals of the Stones, and by softness of the
Salt of the Selenitical.</p>
               <p>2. The same Ingredients and Matter found
in all, and account for what they differ in,
and from the preceding Uniformity.</p>
               <p>3. It is not of a deeper Original, because
where-ever these Ingredients are found, there
is likewise the Purging Water; but beyond
these marks, is never any thing found but a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59240:74"/>
dead Loam, unpassable to Water, and unopen
to yield Salt: And this is clear in the Sele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitical
Water at <hi>Epsam,</hi> where neither Water
nor Selenites are found lower, though at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
some feet lower to enlarge the Spring,
which proved only common dead Loam.</p>
               <p>4. Not of a wider Derivation, none of the
same Waters lying in the neighbouring Earth,
whence these Springs may be suspected to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend;
nor any of the Indexes of them, nor
any Metals or Mineral bodies. Nor indeed
are these Earths found lying over any Mines,
constant at least, as these Signs are.</p>
               <p>5. Another most evident sign, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
are here rightly fix'd, is, That the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of these Waters which afford the Selenites,
we have a clear and good account of from all
Naturalists, to proceed only from a mixture
of Loam and Chalk-stone, and perhaps a little
Iron; and never to be found over any Mine,
but over Quarries of Chalk or Stone. Which
is a sufficient Argument, and the more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
in that they never took notice of the
Purging Qualities of the Waters.</p>
               <p>6. The Signs and Qualifications of these
Wells before recited, are proper to them only.</p>
               <p>7. Another Argument is to be drawn, from
the Disposition of this Earth to produce a Salt,
as is seen in its Efflorescence.</p>
               <p>8. From the softness of the Salt of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenitical
Waters, which will be understood
and compar'd in the following account.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:59240:75"/>
9. Their Innocence, regular Variation, and
that these Principles account for all their Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,
prove the Salt of these Waters to
be the genuine and natural Product of these
Principles.</p>
               <p>To all which add, That the Purging and
Medicinal Qualities resides in the Salt; and
that the open nature of Clays, would discover
any Mineral or Metal concern'd, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
more than we may observe.</p>
               <p>That we may understand whence, or to
what is this Salt owing, the Original of the
Salt, and nature both of the Earth and Juyces
concern'd in the Production of it, I proceed
now to examine the Principles.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Principles or Ingredients that impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the Purging Waters, examin'd.</head>
                  <p>HAving thus traced the Production of this
Salt, and determin'd it to the Earth,
through which the Wells are sunk, and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Stone or Juyce contain'd in these Stones;
we come now to examine these, their Nature,
and what parts of these enter the Composition,
or how they are concern'd in the Production
of this Salt. And upon due Essays of these
Earths and Stones, we shall find in general an
Earth rich of Salt, Chalybeat or Ferreous
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59240:75"/>
parts, a Mineral Juyce out of which this Salt
seems form'd; and we may observe the Salt
of the upper Soile somewhat concern'd in,
and that on the Varieties of the two last, the
Varieties of the Waters do depend. And these
I shall enquire into, as to their Original and
Nature.</p>
                  <p>The Earth in which these Wells are, and
which yields this Salt, is a Loamy Clay, more
mellow, and more of a Clay toward the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
but more loamy toward the bottom.
The inner Earth is such as our Tiles are made
of; at <hi>Richmond</hi> at <hi>Epsam,</hi> they dig both
Brick and Tyle, Earth too, as I remember,
out of the Hill yielding these Springs. So I
need not describe the Earth, it being known
that the ponderous close and fat is used for
Tiles, and the looser for Bricks. The colour
of these Earths vary a little, and though
usually Brown, yet in some that colour is
brightned near a Gray. The Earth of these
Springs is sound of these two kinds constantly,
either a meer Clay of the same face to the
bottom, as are the Wells where the Salt is
Christalliz'd, or firm and figur'd, or the same
Clay mix'd with Veins of Iron, and pleasantly
Acid Juyce, like Spirit of Vitriol, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
with Selenites, which are form'd in it.
The Wells where they dig, only a pure loamy
Clay, ever toward the bottom (which is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
more than twelve Feet, and I think never
more than twenty in depth) receives the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59240:76"/>
Water from the sides issuing from between
the Stones before describ'd; and nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
is observable in these Wells.</p>
                  <p>Now not only the face and figure of the
Salt, but its Nature likewise, acknowledge
this Earth as its natural Patent, and all is
confirm'd in the manner of its Production.
The form of the Salt of the Wells, usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles
the Salt shot about them upon the
Surface of the Earth, which at some is in
Stiriae, at some appears only like a soft mould.
The Nature of it is middle between a Nitre
and a Vitriol, which agrees well with the
Earth it is form'd of, Nitrous Earths requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
slackning in the open Air. And the
manner of the Production of this Salt, is
fully as agreeable to this account, for it is
not only at these Wells, that this sort of
Earth shoots this Nitrous Efflorescence, but
at all other places it is observable, as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in Ditches, and where-ever it is cast
up by the Tile makers; and which is worth a
Remark, as discovering the Reason or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of its Production, it is to be noted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That
this Efflorescence, appears only where the Air
is moist or damp, and confin'd. This I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
not only to account for the Production
of this Salt in Subterraneous Channels, but
also for the difference of the Salt of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
from that shooting on the Surface, that
the Salt of the Water is more Fusil, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
more of the Acid part of the Salt, which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59240:76"/>
is collected in proportion to the Closeness,
and the Moistness or Coldness of the place.
And as a further Illustration and proof of
what I assert, I shall give the Reader one or
two Essays of Loam taken from common Pits
for the making of Tiles, which prove that this
Earth contains a Salt that may be extracted,
and hint the manner of its Extraction. For
although no Loam yields any Salt to an Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of boyling Water, yet I found that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sharpened with Oyl of Vitriol, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt, or Spirit of Salt, would extract a
Salt; and which is yet more, that Lime water
would slacken it, and make it yield one. I
shall give the Examen of Loam, opened by
Spirit of Nitre, and Spirit of Vitriol.</p>

                  <p>I shall note, that these Infusions will detect
some Ferrugineous parts in Loam, and which
seem separated in the Selenitical Earth, rather
than added. The Salt that these Loamy Clays
yield, as it is of a common Origine with that
of common Earth, or upper Soile, so it seems
to vary much on that account with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Earth; but that this should be so
very rich in generating, it must be from the
more Saline Nature of this Earth, or from
plenty of some Menstruum to extract it; the
first may be from the continuation of this
Earth with the grand Matrix, which in others
in intercepted by Lays of Gravel, or the like:
The latter may be from Juyce, which is in a
sort Vitrioline: And the closeness of this
Clay, does much contribute to this Collection,
as well as the coldness of it. But the Nature
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59240:77"/>
of this Juyce comes next to be examin'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Essay of the Stones, which are Parcels
of this Loamy Earth.</p>
                  <p>The Stones then, which are the proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex
of these Wells, and which, from their
Nature, are apt to receive Mineral or Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
parts, must be supposed to contain part
of the Ingredients at least of this Salt. The
Stones I prov'd severally from the several
Wells, whence I took them my self, the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drostatical
weight of which, with some other
Essays, I shall more conveniently place at the
end of this Account. I proved them by Usti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Roasting, by Calcination, by Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by Precipitations: By Ustion, to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Salt: By the second, to open the
Body, and discover Mineral or Marcasite:
The third, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> discover any sulphurous Body
or Steam. Lastly, By Precipitations, both
out of a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> and of the wash'd Stone
out of <hi>Aqua fortis:</hi> By all which, as well as
by Fusion with fine Glass, the Stones prov'd
void of any Metalline or Mineral Mixture.
But instead of these, their particular Nature
appear'd, to consist in the Juyce or Salt of
them, saving only a little Iron which <hi>Woodham-Ferrys</hi>
afforded, and which will be found to
agree well with the Constitution of those
Waters which are Chalybeat. This particular
sort of Juyce, or Salt, appear'd in their form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Jelly with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> which would not
become liquid under some days standing; and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59240:78"/>
the parts I prov'd to be in some of the Earth
at <hi>Epsam,</hi> that lay among the Selenites, though
the Stones by the mixture of Chalk did not.
This Quality not attending Loam, suggested
somewhat different from that to be concern'd
in it; and knowing that Antimony, <hi>Auripig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi>
and perhaps some other Marcasites,
with the mixture of some Salts whence <hi>Aqua
fortis</hi> is made, would yield a Butter by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation;
I essay'd this Jelly by Sublimation
in like Vessels, but fail'd of my Expectation,
and then consider'd that this Jelly, not only
differ'd in being produc'd without Heat or
Sublimation, but had not the least Caustick
Qualities of the other Marcasitick Butters,
but rather mortify'd the Acid Spirit. But all
these Suggestions and Doubts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> clear'd to

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of this Stone,
when I understood it to be form'd of a Loamy
Clay; in conjunction of a Vitriolick Juyce.
For this I was first taught at <hi>Harwich,</hi> where I
found the same Stones exactly, nothing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
either in face when broke, or whole
and invested with the same <hi>Gypsum</hi> or <hi>Trichitis,</hi>
and with the same mixture of Iron. These
Stones there lye plentifully on the shore, and
stuck in the Bank at the bottom of the Cliff,
and only at the Foot of that Spot of the
Cliff that is a continued Loam. This Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
I refer'd to a Vitrioline Juyce in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the Loam, because the common
Coporas Stones are plentifully found on that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59240:78"/>
shore, and I observ'd Children employ'd there
to collect them; but whereas they lye thick
where the Cliff is gravelly, where the Cliff
was Loamy, and the shore floor'd with these
Stones, I found no Coporas Stones, nor did
the Children seek there for them, though
they pick'd close by it, where the Bank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
gravelly. So that these Stones seem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
in the Loam, as the other in the Gravel
by the same Juyce. And since I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of several of our Diggers for Tile-Earth,
that the Coporas Stone is only found
in those Clays that have a Gravel mix'd with
them. So that at <hi>Harwich</hi> this Bed of Stones
was the Foundation of the Loamy Cliff, where
the Cliff has been wash'd away or cut: For
the Harbour or Channel there, is Artificial,
and of no old Date, the Current having been
formerly on the other side of <hi>Languard Fort,</hi>
which then stood in <hi>Essex.</hi> The not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this, made the Gentleman in <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
to mention them as Petrifactions made by
the Sea. And from this undoubtedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
that Bed of Shells that covers the Cliff
at perhaps fifty feet hight, which must be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
thither at the making of the Harbour,
or clearing of it, how else could the petrify'd
Clay bed, which contains the Shells, lye a top,
and no Petrifaction lower, till you come
again to the bottom? I think that they must
originally have been the same lay, and that it
is inconsistent to suppose otherwise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:59240:79"/>
Having thus arriv'd at the Origin of the
Stones, I shall make one farther Observation,
which is, That these Stones yield the same
Salt in a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> which the Waters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
From all which I conclude, them Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of the Materials, whence these Purging
Waters have their Salt, and wherein the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Nature and Genius of the concrete
Juyce is to be had.</p>
                  <p>All this is confirm'd by the Nature of the
Salt of these Waters, which being a mean Salt,
between Vitriol and Nitre, requires such an
Earth, and such a Place for its Production,
for lower it had prov'd Vitrioline, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Nitrous, which, with the difference of
the Salt keeping pace with the varying of the
Stone, and with the corresponding Nature of
the Salt, produced in moist Cavities, as in
Cellars, to that sort of it which is soft, as
presently appears, confirms fully this Account,
as agreeable both to Reason and Experience.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of the Purging Waters wherein the Selenites

                  <p>THis sort of Waters have the same Taste
with the other, and the like Variety
in the Tasts of the several Waters, and Purge
alike. What they agree in is deliver'd above,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59240:79"/>
I shall therefore now consider their differences,
and the difference of the Principles, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the Reason of these, with the Nature of
the others. These Wells, upon inquiry, afford
no fresh Principles, or Mineral Ingredients,
but what the addition of a Calcarious Salt
produces, which rather affects these Waters
as a Menstruum. I proceed to observe the
difference and account for it.</p>
                  <p>These are ever in a Loam, but this Loam
partakes of a Lime-stone, this is evedent from
all accounts of the Selenites; and at <hi>Epsam</hi>
the blew Loam lyes in streaks in the Hill,
and a Quarry of Chalk limits the Town at
both ends. To this is owing the laxness of
the Loam here above the rest, and some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
it shews upon tryals, as its clearness
of Iron, which Salt of Chalk and Lime preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and where the Chalk is not found, as
at <hi>Woodham-Ferrys,</hi> the Water there is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pyrites,</hi> or hard Stone, is to be found
here, but why it is perfect at <hi>Woodham-Ferrys,</hi>
and more lax at <hi>Epsam,</hi> is owing to the same
reason. For those two Wells were, what I
could examine, being new dug, when I visited
them, to view and examine the Earth cast
out.</p>
                  <p>The Differences of the Earth of these Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
from the other kind, were common to
both these Wells. At <hi>Epsam,</hi> the Earth cast
out of the Well (I mean <hi>Simps<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n</hi>'s) near the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59240:80"/>
Parcels of Selenites, had some tenderer or
more brittle Earth of several colours, but all
near a Lemmon colour, or of Iron rust. All
these upon examination, both with burning,
and without, by bare washing, afforded Iron
which obey'd the Loadstone, and a Salt, or
rather Juyce, that was pleasingly Acid, and
not Caustick, but the Taste differ'd a little,
as the Colour differ'd: The Lemmon-colour'd
was exactly of the taste of Spirit of Vitriol,
without any odd taste; only note, that this
I first burnt; and the same Acidity I disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
in some white Flakes of the Stone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Metalline taste. I shall not be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
in the Sublimation of these Mineral
Earths; inasmuch as all the ways I attempted
to try them, discover'd nothing but pure
Earth besides.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Woodham-Ferrys,</hi> I observ'd the same col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our'd
Earths exactly, and discover'd only Iron,
and the Juyce or Salt mix'd with it; and as
at <hi>Epsam,</hi> so here, the Earth clear'd of these,
was loose and open, and was but common
Earth, as appear'd by weighing it Hydrosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically.
The Particulars, see in the Account
of the <hi>Wells.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence I was apt to think, from the Nature
of the Juyce approaching to that of Spirit of
Vitriol, and upon the slackness of the Earth
of these Wells, that the Disposition towards
an Alkaly of the admix'd Earth, had detected
and separated these Juyces, which seem lock'd
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59240:80"/>
up in the Loam of the other: But the Pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Vitrioline Juyce in these, make
me suspend that opinion; and, as I intimated
before, hence <hi>Epsam</hi> Water remains clear with
a mixture of Galls, whereas the other gives a
dark Purple. I shall, for clearness sake, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
now into the Origine of the Selenites,
and determine the Species of them these Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
belong to, which are a Species of the Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Kind. For the Salt of these Waters differ
from that of the other, as well as the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
in that the Salt here is unfigur'd, soft,
and melts in the warmth of a hand: In their
Operation they are accordingly more pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating,
and gall the parts of their Excretion,
or near it; which, that it is owing to the
softness of the Salt, and Calcarious Nature of
it, appears, in that <hi>Woodham-Ferrys</hi> does it
not so as <hi>Epsam</hi> and <hi>Acton.</hi> The different Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
shall be taken notice of in their place,
as the differences of the Salt shall be in the
Examen of the Waters.</p>
                  <p>Now I observe, all Waters that afford the
Selenites (at least of this Kind and Figure) to
be Purging; and because the Wells that afford
them, are capable to be proved beyond dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
as at <hi>Kettering,</hi> and in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> it
will much conduce to the clear proof of the
Ingredients and Principles of these Waters,
to give a good account of these which are a
member of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:59240:81"/>
At the places now named, the Selenites are
found in a blew Loam over a Stone Quarry, as
I am inform'd by those that have brought me
the Account from <hi>Kettering;</hi> and of <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>
by Dr. <hi>Plot:</hi> The Circumstances of which
(considering the Salt is not volatile) do
evince, That the Ingredients of these Waters
do not lye lower, since these Stones are so
usually found to have the same Foundation,
and constantly the same Matrix; for these
Selenites never being found the Index of any
Metal or Mineral, nor hard enough to be a
Spar; but being observ'd to agree universally
in constant Materials, which are the same with
the other sort of my Waters that is a Loam:
And the Mixture of a Lime-stone accounting
for the Production of the Selenites, I conclude
my account genuine, and clear of them all.</p>
                  <p>The Selenites of these Wells is form'd near
the bottom in the Loam, at the Water, as
they ever are, and the Spring small; some
are found of all sizes, from the largest to so
small, as scarce allow their Figure to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd;
and the Loam I found figur'd like the
Stones, and lying in clusters in like manner.
The Figures of them I found much differing,
Those at <hi>Acton</hi> Rhomboid: At <hi>Epsam</hi> many
Rhomboid, many imperfect ones, or like Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stula
of them, but most of them Columns of
six sides only, each side was a Parallelogram
inequilateral with a Pointing (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
under as many Triangles) and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59240:81"/>
their Commissure or Origine unequal; some
of them were more Conical; but mostly their
Position was, as that of those found by Dr.
<hi>Plot</hi> at <hi>Cornwell</hi> and <hi>Hanwell,</hi> many being fix'd
like Radii to one center.</p>
                  <p>Thus I found them at <hi>Simpson</hi>'s Well at
<hi>Epsam,</hi> with this Note, That where-ever they
stood thus, the Earth adjoyning to it had
much Iron in it, Fusil, and pleasantly Acid
mostly.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Woodham-Ferrys</hi> some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ew were Rhom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boid,
but most of them at one of the Lozenge
Figure, and resembling the Rhomboid, at the
other round and flat, and sharp; the two lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
opposite Surface declining, till they meet
at an edge, which was Semicircular.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Selenites</hi> found at <hi>Colchester</hi> were thin
and flat, and bent a little, consisted of <hi>Schiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
or Flakes, and are of no distinguishable shape.
I observe, that where I could get a view of
any quantity of the Earth, cast out of any of
these Wells, there were some of them always
Rhomboid, as the more genuine Figure; but
others to differ, with the Salt, as I judged,
and sometimes to be ruled by the quantity of
Iron, and receive the Figure that Metal usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
christallizes into.</p>
                  <p>What the <hi>Selenites</hi> owes its origine to, I
refer my self to the Sense and Observations of
Naturalists, who were not unacquainted with
this Qualification of the Water in which they
are generated. That most accurate Learned
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59240:82"/>
and curious Naturalist Dr. <hi>Plot,</hi> in his Natural
History of <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> Cap. 5. Par. 9. Speaking
of the <hi>Selenites.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>Georgius Agricola</hi> differs
from them all, and makes it a product of
Lime-stone and Water. <hi>Gignitur</hi> (says he)
<hi>Ex saxo calcis cum paucâ aquâ permisto.</hi> And
thus I find it to grow here with us at <hi>Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington,</hi>
in a blew Clay that lyes over the
Quarry, whose outermost Crust is a hard
Lime-stone.</q> For clearness sake, this Stone
may be distinguish'd into these four sorts.</p>
                  <p>1. Those <hi>Selenites</hi> that are really Fissil, into
tough flexil Plates, which is more properly
the <hi>Glacies Mari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> or <hi>Lapis Specularis. Muscovy</hi>
Glass.</p>
                  <p>2. Those that consist of brittle Plates, or
Flakes, which are not easily separable, at least
entire; an unform'd sort of these are found
in flat Plates not very thick near <hi>Colchester</hi>
at the North end, at a Publick-house half a
Mile from the Town, and in some Wells in
the Town. The formed ones usually consist
of six sides, the breadth being more than the
thickness, make the two level Surfaces broader
than the rest. In this they generally agree,
but the Rhomboid have their ends form'd
in like manner to make that Figure, so as to
have ends and sides alike; whereas those that
are longer and narrower, vary in the Figures
that the Depressions at the ends make. Some
are imperfect Rhomboid in one half, and of
an irregular Figure, the other half as at
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59240:82"/>
                     <hi>Epsam,</hi> &amp;c. or thinning to an edge, as at
<hi>Woodham-Ferrys.</hi> All these agree in an uniform
glassy Surface.</p>
                  <p>3. Rhomboid and in the Flakes, of which
it is compos'd, resembling the other; but the
Superficies is divisible into strings, the marks
or lines of which, appear in the Surface. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
these may be formed only where they
are produced at a Stone-Quarry; for of this
kind is that at <hi>Heddington</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> and
that of <hi>Kettering</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> and so
may be distinguish'd in its name as a Species of
Talc, <hi>Selenites Talceus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A 4th sort have a <hi>Cubico-Rhomboideal</hi> form;
these are constantly <hi>Hexaedra,</hi> of equal oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular
sides, or oblique-angled Parallelepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds;
are Fessil into thick Plates, or indeed
consist of Cubick pieces of the same Figure;
such as at <hi>Slindon</hi> in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> mention'd
by the same great Author, <hi>Natur. Hist. of Staff.</hi>
Cap. 5. Part 2. dug in Marle pits. These are
less transparent, and as a Species of <hi>Gypsum;</hi>
may be called <hi>Selenites Gypseus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the second sort (which I take only to be
the proper <hi>Selenites)</hi> belong those of these
Purging Wells. This distinction I think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be observed; for though I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to believe, that the Waters wherein
the others are found may Purge, yet the <hi>Sele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>
as they are related to another sort of
Stone, and have some variety in the Matrix,
may vary (reasonably enough) in their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59240:83"/>
as the <hi>Talceus</hi> being produced at a Stone-Quarry,
the Waters can scarce be supposed
to want the Coldness or Hardness such Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are wont to communicate. And so of
the rest.</p>
                  <p>The Origine of the Salt of these Waters,
appears most evidently in the Salt of this
Species, or sort of them, which I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
inquire into, by examining the Reason
of their Production, and compare with the
Salt that is nearest in resemblance. The Salt
contain'd in the Waters which I call Seleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
hath these Qualities or Properties pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to them, To be soft, and melt in the
warmth of a Hand; to be unfigur'd, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ret
the parts of Excretion; besides the middle
Nature of it, and its being void of Corrosive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which are common to the other sort.
In its Softness and Fluxilness, Nature and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Production, it exactly resembles the
Salt, that damp Cellars produce, and is fix'd
in the middle to Cobwebs, being the steam of
the Earth, and more liquid part of what is
extracted from it, and flows in the moist Air
there condens'd: And no known Salt in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath the Quality of running in so easie a
Heat, beside the Selenitical, but that. And
as this confirms its Original, so the Reason it
further complies with this Account: For this
soft Salt in these Wells, is the flowing part of
the Matter produced in them, the more solid
Particles, and figurable, being detain'd at
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59240:83"/>
the Loam, and employ'd in forming the
<hi>Selenites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now that the Lime-stone which is concern'd
in this Production, naturally effects this sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
by shooting the more dense parts, is
evident in the use of it to precipitate Metalline
parts, but more plainly in boiling Sugars.
The slackning quality of this chalky or limy
Salt, I hinted before to agree with the Earth
of these Wells; and it is to be noted, That
the Salt of the Selenitical, is accordingly more
uniform, not so thickning with Gall, nor vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so much towards Nitres and Vitriols as
the others do, but nearer the Spirit. So I
conclude the Salt of these Purging Waters, of
a middle Nature between Nitres and Vitriols,
and form'd out of the Loam, by the help of a
Vitrioline Juyce or liquid Salt, and collected
in moist Cavities.</p>

meeting in the centre: In a Well a few feet

Rhomboid. At both ends of the Town is

                     </gap>lk dug, and the Hill here and there hath
veins of blew Loam. Of the private Well
which was newly sunk, I inform'd my self by
examining the Earth cast out of it, which I
receiv'd of the Owner Mr. <hi>Symonds,</hi> together
with this Account.</p>
                  <p>The upper Earth, for two Spit deep, was
the same; then they came to a harder and
Loamy, which lasted about seven feet; then
to a looser, which sparkled with small Sele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
as at the publick Well; this held for
two feet, where they came at the Stones and
Water together: The Water in Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
flow'd in at the rate of an Ale-barrel in
24 hours. Below the Selenites they came at
a dead heavy Earth and black, partaking of
Iron, under which was the common dead
Loam, or Cortex of the Mineral Region:
And though they dug three or four feet deeper,
yet neither was Water or the former signs
found. As the Selenites had somewhat of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59240:87"/>
the shape of Vitriol of Iron, so where they
lay, were veins of Iron and colour'd Earth;
the Iron was pure, and obey'd the Load-stone;
the Earth, which was either of a Brimstone
colour, or that of Iron rust; I prov'd by
washing to be the same, only joyn'd by an
Acid Juyce like Spirit of Vitriol, which in the
yellow had no taste of the Iron, but a distinct
pleasant Acid; which with the Jellying of
some parts of the Earth in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the whiter part of it where the Sele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
lay, is what I observed there. I shall
not therefore repeat my Tryals of the Earths,
which were fruitless.</p>
                  <p>The Water is moderately clear, of Taste
bitter, together with a muakish Saltishness,
not manifestly Lixiviat, but a little of the
taste of the second Salt of Salt Marine, and of
that Cellar Salt that is gather'd by things
hanging in the middle of Cellars, and not what
fixes to the Walls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epsam</hi> Water precipitated not Vitriol dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
in it, but promoted its atramentous
Quality, as doth the Salt, not precipitating
the Colour, as Salt of Lime or Chalk, nor
turning it red, as some others, particularly Salt
of Cellars. Notwithstanding this, it agreed
with that sort of Alkaly particularly which is
calcarious, in that it restor'd the blew of
Tincture of Turnsole sharpen'd; it took a
Purple with a Tincture of Logwood in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water lively and full, not dull red a little
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59240:87"/>
purplish and dusky as Salt of Tartar made
with Saltpetre, and Alkalys produce; nor
tawny as Salt of Cellars. Further, as Salt of
Chalk, it troubled a Solution of Sublimat in
fair Water, and sent down a white precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
which Alum doth not. With Syrup of
Violets a Grass-green, as the same Salt. Yet
it peculiarly differ'd from the Salt of Chalk,
and all grosser Salts, in taking a high Yellow,
and clear Tincture from Gall, which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to Spirit of Nitre, it being not of the
Nature of Saltpetre, which is the only Salt
that takes a pale but clear Tincture. With
Syrup of Cloves it became dark <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ooty and
greenish, as do Alkalys and Fuligo of Vitriol,
that adheres to places where the Fume of
boyl'd Coporas comes.</p>
                  <p>☞ The peculiar Nature of the Salt of this
Water is, to be Calcarious, yet agreeing with
Vitriols, and particularly to resemble Spirit
of Nitre, rather than Nitre it self; yet to
resemble the Salt of Chalk, in precipitating a
Solution of Sublimate, which Spirit of Nitre
will not.</p>
                  <p>The Acidity that came over in Distilling,
was little and pleasant.</p>
                  <p>The Salt Grey near a White, and unfigur'd,
or uncapable of Christallization, but soft like
<hi>Barbadoes</hi> or <hi>Lisbon</hi> Sugar. It did not cast up
a Scum till it was near boyled up, and the Salt
precipitated in boyling. This Salt was wrought
on by Acids, yet it coagulated Salt of Tartar
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59240:88"/>
rendred Liquid, called <hi>Ol. Tartari per diliq.</hi>
it did not inflame with Sulphur, but blister'd
on a hot Iron, and was not Caustick either
burnt or unburnt. The Earth of this Salt
was white, and dissolv'd in part in distill'd
Vinegar, and was about an eighth of the Salt.
The Salt of the Water which is said to
amount in some dry Seasons to the proportion
of seven Drams in a Gallon, scarce then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the half of that quantity after a wet
one, when I had it, indeed not so much. The
Salt purged pleasantly in the quantity of half
an Ounce as I try'd it, but it seems to require
a very gentle Evaporation to the due Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of it, that Acidity of Alkalisatness may
be preserved entire. This Salt dissolv'd in
some of its own Water, deepned the yellow
colour of Galls to a Pink, and at last to a Red
or very near, as Spirit of Nitre does upon
long Infusion, but thickish as embody'd Salts.
I saw some Salt boyl'd up in Copper, without
any Verdigrease Tincture, so mild is the Acid.</p>

The Spring opens Northerly; is reputed
one of the strongest Purgers about <hi>London:</hi>
It is noted to occasion a great Soreness of the
Intestine and Fundament, which is reasonably
refer'd to the quantity of Salt they wash from
the Body, but the Penetration of the Salt of
the Water, may make it more pungent and
keen. The Water was whitish, not so clear
as <hi>Epsam,</hi> not saltish, but rather to me seem'd
sweet, with a little of the Bitterness of <hi>Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam:</hi>
It curdled with Soap, as do all.</p>
                  <p>The Salt of this Water is soft, and not
christalliz'd, wherein it agrees with <hi>Epsam</hi>
Salt, though I thought scarce so soft. The
distinct Nature of this Water, or Salt of this
Water, consists in, that this Salt is more Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious,
or of the Nature of Salt of Lime,
for the Water, boyl'd high, disturb'd a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of Sublimate in fair Water, whence it
precipitated a yellowish Sediment, a little
more yellow than the Water, which it left
white. And this Salt is likewise more Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
or hath more of the Nature of the Salt
of the upper Soyle, as appears, in that it
takes a pale Yellow from Gall, but dusky and
disturb'd, as common Salt doth effect; not so
dirty, nor so apt to precipitate, as <hi>Sal Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carium.</hi>
With Syrup of Violets it took a
Green, with Tincture of Logwood made with
Brandy a deep Red and purplish, as Nitrous
Salts do with cold Tincture of Logwood,
which hot would give a full Purple. The Salt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59240:89"/>
did not precipitate fine Silver out of Spirit of
Nitre, which common Salt would. A Pint
and half of the Water yielded forty eight
Grains of Salt, in which was six Grains and a

wrought. The Earth precipitated in Boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

in that Spirit of Nitre did not disturb
it, in that it troubled and rendred Milky a
Solution of Sublimate in fair Water, and sent
down a white Precipitate as Salt of Chalk
doth, and in giving the same Green with Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
of Violets. It became dark and sooty with
Syrup of Cloves as Alkalys, yet not so much
Alkalisate as to turn greenish, nor indeed to
lose all the Red. It had an Acidity, in that
it curdled Spirit of Harts-horn, and the same
it produced with the <hi>Lixivium</hi> of Salt of
Plants. With Gall it became thick and white,
as the Salts of Earths that are not perfectly
Nitrous, but of a mix'd Nature, or where

Orange, and clear as Alkalys produce. With
Iron and Gall it took a reddish Black and

Precipitation.</p>
                  <p>I found in two Quarts about 40 Grains of
Earth, light, leafy and gray, which Distill'd
Vinegar wrought on. The Salt was soft and
unfigur'd mostly, but had some <hi>Stiriae</hi> form'd
in it, flat and not pointed, at least most of
them.</p>
                  <p>This Salt melted not easily as <hi>Epsam</hi> Salt,
but bore a good Heat, and had a much greater
quantity of Earth in it, the hardness of which
was felt on the Tongue in tasting the Salt.
Much Earth precipitated in boyling as others,
but it bore not readily a Scum, till near boyl'd
up, at least as in making other Salt, till the
falling of the Salt.</p>
                  <p>I judged this Salt of the Nature of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaly,
and of kin to <hi>Epsam,</hi> but yet to differ,
being not so resembling the Spirit of Nitre,
in the Tryal with Gall; and accordingly that
Water increas'd Ink-making without turning
it Red; so that this seems more related to
the gross or embody'd Salt, which accordingly
makes it disturb a Solution of Gall.</p>
                  <p>This Water differs from the rest, in that
it troubles but very little a Solution of <hi>Sal

trouble a Solution of fine Silver in Spirit of
Nitre, which in a long time precipitated, the
Precipitation was neither so quick, nor so full,
nor in so large Curdles as common Sea-salt or
Rock-salt doth it.</p>

                     <hi>Richmond</hi> Water distill'd in a Glass retort,

disturb nor change the colour of Sublimate
Water, which Alkalys and Salt of Cellars
does. It was a little sweetish, and not cold

the particular Nature of the Salt of this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

varies in the Salt (as the Gravels and Loams

made of common Salt and Spirit of Vitriol,
and which likewise purgeth: It took very
little yellowness from Galls, and what it took
it would not hold, but suffer'd to precipitate
presently: The first being the effect of Spirit
of Salt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the last of Spirit of Vitriol. It cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
soapy Water in large Curdles, and <hi>Ol.
Tartari per deliquium</hi> the same; and upon shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
this Water rais'd a great Froth, which
it kept a great while. I judged therefore this
Water to contain a Salt resembling common
Salt, and that part of it which is condens'd
and christalliz'd through Cold in a Humid as
in Cellars, the Coagulation with Liquid Salt
of Tartar being not so universal, as with the

Water try'd at the Well after a dry Season
was clear, but not so Limpid as common
Spring Water, having somewhat of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of Rain-water; it was of the taste of
<hi>Saltpetre,</hi> or nearer <hi>Saltpetres</hi> second Salt, but
left a Vitriolick brackish or nauseous taste on
the Palat. Half a Pint and half an Ounce of
this Water, exceeded common Water in
weight 24 Grains; it made no alteration in a
Solution of Sublimate in fair Water, which
Nitres and Alkalys disturb; it agreed with
common Salt, in changing the Red of Syrup
of Clove Gilliflowers into a cloudy pale col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
in which the Red upon 24 hours stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was wholly lost, but was restored by a
drop of Spirit of Nitre; it had the Effects
of the same Salt in curdling strongly with

Water precipitated fine Silver out of Spirit
of Nitre, but not so quick and strongly, I
thought, as Rock-salt and Sea-salt. This
Water accordingly changed not the colour
of Syrup of Violets, neither doth common
Salt.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Salt of this Water agreeth with
common Salt, but comes not up to its power
of Precipitating or Coagulating, which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
would rather set and fix the Humour,
and so promote the Distemper, as appears in
the Effects of Bay-salt to produce the Scurvy,
which Property is observ'd to lye in the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the second or less coagulable part, and
not to be found in the Salt when purified.</p>
                  <p>It agrees in some Tryals with <hi>Saltpetres</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Salt, which is not wholly differing from
common Salt. But because Salts differ, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
the Water more nicely. It disturb'd
a Solution of <hi>Hungarian</hi> Vitriol which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt did not, Rock Salt very little, but
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59240:95"/>
the second Salt of <hi>Saltpetre</hi> readily effected
likewise, but scarce in so high a Degree, for
this sent down a yellowish Precipitate forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with;
yet it did not trouble a Solution of
Mercury Sublimate as <hi>Sal Gem.</hi> nor precipitate
it as do the Nitres and Lime-salt of a yellow,
or as Salt of Chalk and Marle white.</p>
                  <p>The Salt was gray near white, mostly near
Cubes, or in thick plates as common Salt,
some scurfie light parts with it, which was
the Scum which precipitated in Boyling, no
Stiriae or pointed parts could I observe. The
Water did early raise or bear a Scum. The
Salt readily ran <hi>per deliquium,</hi> and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Earth and grey about 24 Grains out of a
Quart of Water: This leafy Earth was very
light, and made a very small Effervescence
with distill'd Vinegar, nor would it wholly
take away its Acidity.</p>
                  <p>This Salt precipitated fine Silver out of
Spirit of Nitre in hard large Curdles; Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petres
second Salt only whitens and disturbs
the Solution which at last precipitates it.
<hi>Ol. Partari per deliquium</hi> works on it, but does
not precipitate the Silver: But this Salt, I
thought, did scarce so fully precipitate the
Silver as Rock Salt.</p>
                  <p>☞ I therefore refer the Nature of the Salt
of this Water to that of common Salt, whose
power it hath even to the depurating a Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Vitriol, but without either so gross
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59240:96"/>
and strong an Earth, or so severe and coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
an Acidity.</p>
                  <p>The Diseases that have been cur'd by these
Waters, as I found them registred in a Table
at the Well, were as I remember, <hi>Leprosie,
Scurvy, Vertigo's, Jaundies, Worms, Stone</hi> and
<hi>Colick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To understand on what account this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
exerts its power, beside Worms, which
every one knows to be destroy'd, and the
flatulent putrid matter suppress'd by Sea-salt,
I think the <hi>Leprosie</hi> may well illustrate. To
have a Notion of the Nature of this Disease,
It is not necessary here to inquire into the
particular Juyce it is seated, in, and Vessels
serving it; it is sufficient that the Nature and
Genius of the Humour or Salt is toward an
Alkali, exulcerating and dry, seated or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by too thick and luxuriant Chyle, in
too nitrous or scorching a Climate: That
the Cure of this Disease consists not only in
som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Qualities that mortifie it, but in some
pungent parts that can retain their Nature,
and are apt to separate the grosser parts, we
are taught by the success of Vipers in this
Disease, which have a Faculty of separating
Tartar from Canary in which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd,
which else yields none. On which, by
the way, I must observe the Error in choosing
that Wine for the Infusion, on which the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Vipers is in so much measure lost,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59240:96"/>
proportionably to the demand of the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Liquor. If this be conceded, I
think it must be allow'd, that as the Nature
of this Salt is disposed to mortifie Alkalys,
and to penetrate without Corruption, so its
being void of that severe <hi>Coagulum</hi> may qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
it to separate and discharge. And that
I beg not much in this Notion, will appear
in the opposite Salt of <hi>Brentwood-Weale,</hi> which
I have experienced to encourage and increase
this Disease.</p>

being near a fourth part. Some part of the

the last, was not shot so discernably, but was
in hard lumps, and seem'd to consist of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Salt, that is of a somewhat differing
Nature. This did differ from the other in

I shall clear it from partaking of Alum or Sea-salt
by Tryals, which will confirm my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the other Waters, since it is clear
of participating any thing with the Mine
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59240:101"/>
over which it runs, and the Mine would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
discover any other Minerals joyn'd, if
such there were; and the same Nitrous Earth
here sound, that is common to the others,
makes this more plain. The proportion the
nature of this Salt bears to the Nitre of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water, and true Nitres, is discoverable
by the quantity of time the Water retains its
Ink-making quality, Alkalies, and so the true
Nitre of the Ancients precipitate their dirty
black presently.</p>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was examin'd at the Spring, at
my direction, by the accurate hand of my
worthy Friend and Ingenious Gentleman
Mr. <hi>Edward Carter</hi> of <hi>Scarbourgh,</hi> in whose
own words I shall deliver their Tryals of them,
only adding to each a Corollary of the use I
make of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. What Colour Nutgall gives it, and
whether Turbid or Clear?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> A Grain of Gall strew'd upon the
Surface of eight or ten Ounces of the Water,
doth without any farther mixing, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
strike a deep reddish purple colour, which
presently becometh turbid; if you let the
same stand all night, the Water will in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
recover its pristine clearness, and a Powder
of the colour of colcothar will precipitate to
the bottom in a large quantity. Or if a few
drops of Spirit or Oyl of Vitriol be instill'd
into the foresaid Tincture, it will presently
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59240:101"/>
be clear as at first, without the Precipitation
of any Powder.</p>
                  <p>The reddish Purple is effected by Alkalisate
parts united to the Acid, distill'd Acids to the
like; but that the Salt of this Water is Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
is observable in its turbidness, but
chiefly in the Precipitation of the colour
upon standing, which Precipitation Spirit
of Vitriol prevents, though it destroys the
colour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Has the Water any Scum or bituminous
Film.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> When it stagnateth in any place,
or stands a few hours in an open Glass, there
is an Azure colour'd bituminous Film or Scum
upon it, and if the same be expos'd to the Air
for about a Week, there is one riseth up much
like that which swims upon Lime-water.</p>
                  <p>The first is common to Chalybeat waters,
which appears upon the separation of the
Nitrous and Vitrioline parts by the Air, but
the latter a peculiar of the Salt, which being
not calcarious, I judge to be of such a Quality
as complies with the Corruption of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so far as to suffer its grosser parts to be
thrown up, which Lime-water does by the
motion of its own active Salt; so far it differs
from those of the Nature of common Salt
which preserve Liquors. <hi>Weal</hi> water has the
same Disposition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:59240:102"/>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. What Colour the Water kept three
days in an open Glass will take with Nutgall turbid
or clear?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Galls give it a colour then much as
before, yet something more remiss, but if it
stand longer, as about a week, they cause
no such alteration, changing it only into
a milky colour, like Barly water, as Salt
of common Earth does, which is not Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. What Colour with Syrup of Violets?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> A light Green, which may be turn'd
into a reddish Purple, by adding some Spirit
or Oyl of Vitriol.</p>
                  <p>To these Remarks I have added some
(which perhaps may not be unacceptable)
touching the quantity of Salt and stone
Powder contained in those Waters, its
Taste, Odour and Figure when Christal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized.</p>
                  <p>According to my nearest Computation, it
hath about an Ounce in four Gallons, and
almost as much of the stone Powder, which
is of the colour of Sand made use of in Hour-glasses.
I never could discover any of the
blew Clay, which some pretend to have
found.</p>
                  <p>The Salt hath a very remarkable Bitterness,
and when newly made, a strong sulphurous
Smell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59240:102"/>
The Christals are very clear and transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
comprehended under eight plains, two
of which are Sexangular, and the other six
are Rectangular Parallelograms, which are
disposed after this manner, The sides are
constituted of the two Sexangular Planes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately
interpos'd to two of the largest
Parallelograms, each side standing at right
Angles with the other: The ends are termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by the four lesser Parallelograms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to each other, from the Extremities
or lesser sides of the lateral Parallelograms,
as the two Lines mark'd with the points and
dash. Thus I have described the Form of it
as intelligibly as I can in words, but because
a Figure will help to explain what hath been
said, and be a means to represent the Idea bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Understanding, I shall endeavour
to give you the best Delineation I can.</p>
                  <p>Half of the Planes or Surfaces may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
thus, but the other which are
opposite, must be supplied by the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Planes, which hath another like it directly
opposite. <hi>c, b, d,</hi> do shew the Proportions
of the greater and lesser Parallelograms, but
they cannot be represented Rectangular in the
Scheme, as indeed they are as was mentioned
above, the sides <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b</hi> do stand at right
Angles, and so do the sides opposite to them.

Thus far is the Account received in the
Gentleman's Letter dated <hi>Scarbourgh, June</hi> 22.
1697.</p>
                  <p>Some Christals of the Salt of this Water,
with the Earth or stony Powder of it, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
since from the same hand. The Salt
was clear and uniform or single, and not an
aggregate, consisting of <hi>Bacilli</hi> or Columns,
nor plected as the Alum there produced ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
the Figure was the same now describ'd,
only one of the ends was not so exact, being
a little broken; and the Christal in bulk
hardly amounted to half the measure of the
Figure.</p>
                  <p>This Salt precipitated not fine Silver out
of Spirit of Nitre, as Sea-salt, and our Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salt
does do, yet disturb'd not a Solution of
Sublimate, which Alkalies and Nitres do, and
which Alum thickens and whitens: A few
drops of this Salt dissolv'd in fair Water,
rendred a Solution of <hi>Sal Saturni</hi> white as
milk, which <hi>Saltpetre</hi> does not disturb: It
curdled <hi>Ol. Tartari per deliquium,</hi> but not so
strongly as <hi>Epsam</hi> Salt. The Salt inflam'd
not upon a hot Iron, though with Brimstone
added, nor was very fluxile.</p>
                  <p>☞ In Sum: The Salt partakes not of either
Alum or Sea-salt, but is Nitrous, not of the
Nature of <hi>Saltpetre</hi> or its second Salt, nor so
Alkalisate, as to discover it self in Sublimate
Water, or to give a deep Green with Syrup
of Violets, but which allows a mixture with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59240:104"/>
Vitriols, and is not so Alkalisate or full of
Nitre as to precipitate; but near that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
one of our common Earth, and which
is not so fix'd, as to keep in one state or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of it in Water; but hinders not, if
not promotes, the Fermentation or intestine
Motion of the Liquor, which it clears by
throwing up a Scum. For as far as appears
to me, Salts that have a Solidity, and yet a
disposition to Fermentation, that in burning
throw up a Scum rather than precipitate, as
the Salt of <hi>Weal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Water, and that that stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
on rich common Earth, does among the
Nitrous sort. It would be advantageous to
the discovery or distinguishing of the Nature
and Virtue of this Salt, to put some up in
a Bottle with Sack (which is a Wine that
makes no Tartar) to observe whether a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation
would result, only to Fine it, or
a Fermentation or disturbance would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
                  <p>The Propriety of this Water consists in
the middle nature of the Salt, which keeps
thick with Galls, as the Salts that Vitriols
embody with effect, which are not purely of
the nature of common Salt; yet is so familiar
to Vitriol, as not to disimbrace soon; beside
the Chalybeat parts, and its less volatile
Acidity.</p>

in Essex.</head>
                  <p>THE Earth cast out of this Well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
many discolour'd Parcels of mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
Earth, the colours of which were two,
that of Brimstone and a Ferrugineous; and
which yielded Iron upon Essay when only well
wash'd. And as at <hi>Epsam</hi> these Veins attend
the Selenites, so the same stone is plentifully
found here; most of them were in one half
resembling the Rhomboid, the other had a
differing Figure, by the declining of the two
opposite grand Planes, till they determin'd
at an edge, which was Semicircular, as in the
Figure. In parcels of this Loam inclos'd, I
found great plenty of Vermicular bodies
which were mere Iron; of which Metal one
<hi>Tubulus Marinus</hi> and several pieces I brought
away with me and reserve. The stone or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Marcasite, which I call <hi>Lapis Lutoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitriolicus</hi>
here, had many shining Particles in
it, and consisted of Parcels divided by a thin
Wall of <hi>Gypsum</hi> or <hi>Trichitis,</hi> and precipitated
some Iron when dissolved in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and
diluted with fair Water.</p>
                  <p>The Water was clear, of Taste Chalybeat,
but had more of the nauseous sweetish taste
of the Purging Waters not void of Bitterness;
with Gall a thick Purple, as Saline Chalybeats.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59240:105"/>
In the quantity of nine Ounces five Drams and
24 Grains, exceeded common Water in
weight thirteen Grains. It chang'd not the
colour of Syrup of Violets, it took not away
the colour of Syrup of Cloves, which Alkalies
do, by inducing a sooty or green, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt, by rendring it pale and cloudy. It
agreed with Vitriols and common Salt in
making no alteration in a Solution of English
and German Vitriol, nor in a Solution of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
Sublimate; yet curdled not much or
large with Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> and less
with Spirit of Harts-horn; and with Spirit
of Nitre suffer'd no alteration; with Log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
infus'd a Purple, but more toward a
Red or Murry. Note, I used in this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Water when boyl'd high toward
a Salt.</p>
                  <p>The Salt differ'd from Saltpetre, in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
a Solution of <hi>Sal Saturni</hi> milky; it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
a Solution of fine Silver in Spirit of
Nitre immediately as common Salt, yet made
with Liquid Salt of Tartar but a fine curdle;
with <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> a pale yellow, and
thick as common Salt; with Iron and Gall
infus'd, a right blew Ink, and which did not
precipitate.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Kensington</hi> Water gave a more red
black, and which soon fell; and with <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Nephriticum</hi> a clear high yellow near an
Orange.</p>

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:59240:106"/>
This Water of <hi>Woodham-Ferrys</hi> did not
precipitate any Ferrugineous parts or Okar,
upon its losing its power of Tinging with
Galls.</p>
                  <p>Then the Water with Gall took a yellow
tolerably clear, but not purely clear of distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
near the effect of common Salt.</p>
                  <p>The Salt of this Water comes near com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt (Bay Salt with Gall giving a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
cloudiness) as the other a Vitrioline
or mix'd one. The simplicity of the Salt
appears in the colour and clearness with
Gall.</p>
                  <p>It precipitated a ruddy Earth in boyling,
which distill'd Vinegar wrought on with
great Effervescence. The Salt seem'd of two
sorts, the first being hard, not readily flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in heat, and grain'd, and crackling a
little in the Fire and leaping. Some flat
shoots like Saltpetres <hi>Bacillis.</hi> The Earth
contain'd in two Quarts, was about forty
Grains.</p>
                  <p>The Water retain'd its power of Tinging

                  <p>THE Original and Genius of the Salt of
these Waters being thus arrived at,
their successful Effects in Distempers, and
how these are agreeable to the Nature of
the Salt, comes now under consideration,
that hence we may be directed to the right
and proper use of them. Diseases or more
truly Symptoms are so various in their
Causes, that, without the Knowledge of
these, Observation and Experience it self will
be uncertain and unserviceable. Now the
Diseases which are observed to be help'd by
Purging Waters, as ill Concoction, Pain at
the Stomach, Heart-burning, lost Appetite,
Vomitings, Cholical Pain of the Stomach,
Cholick, <hi>Iliaca Passio,</hi> Worms, Nephritick
Pain, Gout, Rhumatism, Heat of Urine, or
Suppression of it, Scurvy and its Symptoms,
as Itching, Pustles, and the like. Jaundies,
Vertigo, Headachs, Hysteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k and Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal
Passions, are all cured by the Waters,
only as they fall under this Notion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
That they proceed from a viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
or delinquent Chyle, and want of due
Ferment of the parts, and that the Matter
is seated in the first ways, or larger Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59240:107"/>
Vessels. It is so very material to observe
this, as not only to improve the use of them
in other Cases, but may likewise help us to
avoid the Misfortune of the Empirical use
of them in cases where they are ineffectual.
Errors of which kind I have observed in the
use of the Waters, and indeed of all other
Medicines, as the Jesuits Bark and the like.
That the Matter ought to be fit for exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating,
I might prove in almost all the
Distempers these are proper in, The Jaundies
are often cured by the Waters, when they
have proceeded from Melancholy, or have
been otherwise produced by the foulness of
the <hi>Viscera,</hi> or are a Symptom of obstructed
Menses, or a <hi>Plethora,</hi> but when Essential,
can be as little expected to have a Cure
from these Waters, as when it is Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
of a Feaver, or a Venenate Disease.
Vertigo again may proceed from Melancholy,
a flatulent foul Stomach, or tough Flegm in
the Blood, as in the Rhumatism, or from the
nature of the Salt of the Blood, as in Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies,
and in that Crasis which attends Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
chiefly at the grand Climacterick of 50,
or from a <hi>Plethora,</hi> and so may be subject to
the reach of these Waters; else in Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Distempers, such as Apoplexies, Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
to Lethargies, Palsies, and even in
Dropsies, Purging Waters in a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
can never be supposed to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59240:107"/>
From the same Chylous Recrements,
Convulsions often take origine, and may
have place among Cures of this kind, and
Pains in the Head, but ought to be mark'd
with the same Proviso. Accordingly Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against the use of them in a <hi>Chlorosis,</hi>
Feavers, <hi>Cholera morbus,</hi> and Suppression of
Urine from Stone or confirm'd Obstruction,
our Reason readily suggests; which too
forbids the use of them in Women with
Child.</p>
                  <p>The Qualifications that give these Waters
an extraordinary capacity for these Cures,
are their Acidity agreeable to that of the
Stomach, and which indeed is Vitrioline,
their abstersive Salt, of a middle nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Vitriol and Nitre, quantity of Liquor,
and not only their Purgin, but as it is easie
without Sickness or Griping, or other flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Disturbances raised usually by other
Purgers, and which hinder those calm Effects
that are necessary to the relief of some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers;
to which some would add Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and agreeable bitterness, but this holds
not in all. From all which we may reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
expect success, when a preternatural
Salt is to be wash'd away, the Ferment of the
Stomach to be restored, <hi>Viscera</hi> to be cleansed,
or cooling is necessary. Indeed the Purging
Waters, or their Salts, are much the finest
Purgers in Nature, and in many of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59240:108"/>
Cases often perform Cures alone.
They are the best Preparatives to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat
Waters, and the only Purge proper
to intervene in the use of them, where Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is expedient, because these do it without
disorder, and are of like nature. Of what
general use these Qualities make this Purge,
I need not discourse, especially for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
since so near all Diseases are owing to
the Vice of the Stomach, or Recrements of
the Chyle. But besides this general nature
of the Salt of these Waters, it is found of
some Specifick Qualities in many of them,
which frequently differ from each other, and
to have distinct Virtues accordingly. That
besides the Purging Quality, and what that
can contribute, there is so much in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Salt, as may give the Waters
the force of a Medicine, may be very easily
believ'd by any who will consider of what
Energy the Qualities are, that these Salts
differ in. The second part of <hi>Sal Marine</hi>
is known by Sea-men to produce the Scurvy,
and a Salt nearly affine to Nitre the Itch. It
is known that Nitre and Vitrioline or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt precipitate each other, and must be
allow'd to do as much in the Body, and may
be observed in the reason of the different
Cures wrought by these Waters. Alkalisate
Salts and Nitrous, produce a fluor of the
Blood, and in the present State of the Air,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59240:108"/>
which I intimated to be Nitrous or Alkali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate,
I have found Fluxes frequent I mean
Sanguinary, and have as certainly found Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeats
and Vitrioline Salts effectual, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<hi>Sal Prunellae</hi> to increase them, when
used by the less thinking Administrer.</p>
                  <p>You may observe in <hi>Lambeth</hi> Water a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt, without the severe Coagulum which
accounts for the Virtues. In <hi>Weal</hi> a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
opposite Nitrous one. In <hi>Kensington</hi>
near a <hi>Saltpetre.</hi> In <hi>Dullwich</hi> a Salt related to
common Salt, but very penetrative and flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile,
fit to command a Stubborn Antagonist,
but mischievous to a tender and over-heat
Body, and accordingly I have observed it.
I might go through all the Waters. The
good Effects of the Chalybeat Purgers in
Asthma's, a Dropsie make them a Peculiar
over and above what their Salt would.</p>
                  <p>And in Salts of the same nature as Nitres,
some we shall here find of a more open na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
approaching a calcarious one, and so
more apt to correct Acidities in the first ways,
some more lock'd, and so fit to reach them
when digested and remote. In <hi>Weal</hi> Water
I find an Alkaly joyn'd with a severe coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
Acid, the first raising the Floridness
of the Blood, the last apt to fix the Humour
and obstruct; and may have a good use to
those Complexions that need both these Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
as those do that are pale and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59240:109"/>
to be loose body'd. And although in
passing of right Judgment, the Consideration
of the Constitution and Complexion of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
is necessary, and as <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Water doth
in some provoke the Menses, in some stop
them, so this Water might produce the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
before named in a Person of a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine
Complexion on that account, which
is a natural Effect of a <hi>Plethora;</hi> yet it must
be allowed to be but answerable to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Salt. <hi>Epsam</hi> Salt hath a Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of softness to penetrate farther than
others without Obstruction, of the nature of
Spirit of Nitre, and so can both incide and
mellow what it meets with. The searching
Quality of this Salt, I have known univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
complain'd of, as raking and so heating
by lean Persons, both Men and Women, but
upon the same reason it is the most extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Purge for grosser Bodies. To know
rightly the Intentions these Salts satisfie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a good Understanding of the Nature
of the Disease, which here cannot be insisted
upon, only I shall give you one Instance in the
Use of <hi>Epsam</hi> Water in Melancholy, whether
natural Melancholy be not produced by the
Formation of the Vessels and Complication,
rather than by the nature of the Juyces, I
dispute not, nor how the Brain is concerned:
The Disease effectively demonstrates it self
to consist in the due Separation or discharge
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59240:109"/>
of the Excrements of the Body hindered,
and through want of that Salt that should
be separated with them to promote their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion,
whence their Spittle is fresh and stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
their Body bound, and which is perhaps
the Original of all this, the Blood allows not
of a due Separation of Choler, and other
parts that Nature alots to be amended. In
all these Intentions <hi>Epsam</hi> Water or Salt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends
it self by its calcarious Salt, to
advance the Heat and florid State of the
Blood, and mix with it; by its Acidity to
penetrate and incide, yet not of power to
precipitate and harden; but above all by its
Softness and Liquibility in Heat or Moisture,
it is disposed not only to cleanse, but to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Blood fluid and mellow, and leave the
Vessels lax. And that I am right here, and
not wide from Experience, it may be proper
to inform the Reader, that I have known this
Disease cured by this Water only, in those
Persons who have taken the other Waters,
as well as other Medicines, ineffectually.</p>
                  <p>And as Nitrous or Alkalisate Salts raise the
Fermentation of the Blood, which is the
same Effect which they have on Liquors, so
Acids correct and suppress it: The Effect of
one is ever discernable by flushing Heats, and
the happy Effects they have in Malignant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and the power of the last in correcting
the Heat of the Blood, and putting the Salt
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59240:110"/>
in condition for a Discharge, is evident in
the use of Acids, in those Feavers that are
attended with Exanthemata. And this I
mention, because in the Choice of a Purging
Water for Prevention of Sickness as they are
often drank, the Nature of the Feaver on
foot ought to be consider'd. I wave that, and
proceed to the Classes of the Waters, and their
several Virtues.</p>
                  <p>The Waters agree in general to create or
restore an Appetite, suppress Wind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Hypo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hondriacism. But the Virtues
that result from their Specifick Nature, both
from my Judgment and Experience in many of
them, stand thus.</p>
                  <p>1. A Water containing a Salt, somewhat
of the Nature of Salt of Chalk, but more
resembling the Spirit than body of Nitre,
and not corrosive. Of this kind is <hi>Epsam,</hi>
whose Salt is unfigur'd or ungrain'd, and
melts in the warmth of a hand. The Cases
a Salt of this Nature is adequate to, are Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
Cholicks and Cholical Pains in the
Stomach, Obstructions of the Glands, and
accordingly Heart-burning, Pains in the Sides,
and any parts of the Body, if not too confirm'd,
Scurvy, Vertigo; it cleanses gross Bodies,
and safely lessens Fatness; relieves Redness
of the Face; relaxes a costive Disposition;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59240:110"/>
and cleanses the Kidneys, and perhaps in
Ulcers of the Kidneys, or other parts, may
fitly precede Chalybeats.</p>
                  <p>2. A Water more calcarious, and whose
Salt is more of the Nature of the Nitre of
the Earth than of the Spirit; such are <hi>Acton,
Barnet</hi> and <hi>Stretham</hi> Waters, these I judge
proper in the Stone, Gout, Diseases of the
Lungs without Inflammation, and for Heart-burning;
and where-ever the Intention of
Sweetning the Blood is required, or raising
the warmth and heat of it, this may be a
suitable Purge; and are good in Melancholy,
wherein <hi>Acton</hi> claims the next place to <hi>Epsam:</hi>
They restore a good Colour to the Face, and
remove or cure the falling away of the Flesh,
and promote Fatning.</p>
                  <p>3. A Water whose Salt is Alkalisate, and
resembles Salt of Tartar, and the Sulphurous
Salts of Vegetables, though not perfectly;
and as is <hi>Vpminster,</hi> may be supposed to have
the power of sweetning Acidities in remoter
parts of the Body, strengthens the Stomach,
checks Vomiting, and where Alkalies suit, is
a good Diuretick, and is a proper Purge
where the Body has a Disposition to Agues or
Dropsies, only here the Salt is preferable to
the Water, as it may be taken in a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Vehicle.</p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:59240:111"/>

                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:59240:112"/>
4. A Salt Alkalisate, with a very hard coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating
Acidity, namely, <hi>Brentwood-weal,</hi> hath
the advantage of an Alkaly to sweeten the
Blood, but with Astriction, it increases flush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heats, Scurfyness, and Leprous Humours,
but is beneficial in any Fluxes through Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Weakness, and to the Hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal,
whose natural Temper is such; checks
the <hi>Catamenia,</hi> and may be good to prevent
Abortion, back'd with Chalybeats.</p>
                  <p>5. A Salt Alkalisate approaching a <hi>Saltpetre,</hi>
is that of the Water of <hi>Kensington,</hi> the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of an Alkaly appear before; as relating
to <hi>Saltpetre,</hi> it may be more Diuretick, it tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
Choler, allays Thirst, suppresseth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory
and putrid Heat, and easeth Pain.
The Earth contained in this Water, is so
much in quantity, and the leafy hard parts so
many, that I should think the Salt of this
Water to be preferable to the Water it self.
Or else the Water ought to be boyl'd till
half be evaporated, and then depurated by
suffering the grosser parts to subside.</p>
                  <p>All the Waters following partake of the
Nature of a Vitrioline or common Salt, or
Sea-salt, and so resist Putrifaction, make a
strong Concoction, are proper in Worms,
may cure a Jaundies when it comes upon a
Colick, mortifie Scabs, and remove Scurfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59240:112"/>
and kill several Humours, as Tetters and
the like Eruptions; their particular Natures
are as follow.</p>
                  <p>6. Waters which bear a Salt related to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt, but clear of the Muriatick part, are
<hi>Alford</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> and <hi>Colchester.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
an Appetite, for Worms and mortifying
Eruptions, and <hi>Hypochondriack Flatus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. A Salt more fully of the Nature of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or Sea salt, in its power of mortifying
preternatural Salts in the Body, without the
severity of coagulating, is found in <hi>Lambeth</hi>
Waters, whereof the nearest Well is the
most perfect. The Virtues see in the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of that Water. Only observe that
these are used outwardly as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
                  <p>8. A Salt of the Nature of that part of
common Salt which Christallizes in the cold,
is found in <hi>North-Hall</hi> Water, and may be
beneficial in the Scurvy, beyond any others,
as likewise in Rhumatisms, and in what
cases soever that are attended with Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>9. A Salt of the Nature of common or
Sea-salt, yet not having an Acidity agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Iron, but Fluxile, Penetrative and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59240:113"/>
Marcasitical, is that of <hi>Dullwich;</hi> it morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth

Effects of Luxury, but promotes the Flux

and that churlishly on those that either
Drinking or Walking hath put out of
Temper.</p>
                  <p>10. Salt of the Nature of Salt of <hi>English</hi>
Vitriol, that is of Iron, and seem a result
of the uniting of Vitriol and Nitre, or Salt
of common Earth, whose Characteristick is
to give a white clouded Liquor with Gall,
and not so high a colour with <hi>Lignum Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phriticum</hi>
as Alkalies give: This is the Salt
of <hi>Richmond</hi> Water, and the two Chalybeats,
and recommends the Use of these Waters,
in the Cure of Scurfs, is most safe in Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
in Ulcers in any part; in Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal
Cases exceed the rest: And the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of a Purging Water that is Chalybeat
is extraordinary great, it not only answering
the design of both Waters, but under the
consideration of a Purging Water, is made
thereby specifically proper in Asthma's and
beginning Dropsies, and without which Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification,
it could be administred neither so
safely, nor with so good Effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:59240:113"/>
According to my Method before, I shall
deliver the Virtues of the Chalybeat Purging
Waters, from Observation of the Learned
Dr. <hi>Witty</hi> at the Spring at <hi>Scarbourgh,</hi> the
happy Successes of which make him lift it
above all the Waters in <hi>Europe;</hi> he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
in it these Qualities, <hi>Crassos lentosque
humores attenuat incidit, &amp; dissolvit in Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo,

diluendi item &amp; detergendi virtutem nacta, eos

prout ab eorum positione videantur magis incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari.</hi>
And presently names the <hi>Venae lacteae,</hi>
the <hi>Portae</hi> and Liver; and he makes a Remark
at the Diuretick Quality, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two thirds presently run off by Urine,
it purges so much, and at both in their lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the bulk and weight of the Body. He
enters his Observations with a Cure of a
Scurvy, attended among other Symptoms
with Pains in the Joynts, and difficulty of
Breathing; and of a Gout in the same Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
so considerable abated by it, that in
a Letter he there acknowledges, he never
after that suffered any Symptom of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The Diseases further recorded by Dr. <hi>Witty</hi>
to have been cured by the same Water, and
of which he produceth instances, are, diverse
Distempers of the Head, chiefly arising from
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59240:114"/>
the consent of the Stomach and Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries,
Affections of the Nerves, and Spasm,
vellicating the Coats and Nerves of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;
or caused by Worms or sharp and
bilious Humours. Palsies that from their
accompanying Scurvy are called Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</p>
                  <p>A Vertigo assaulting upon the least motion
or heating of the Body.</p>
                  <p>A Vertigo with a Cold Sweat, intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

after the Cure of a <hi>Spasmus Cynicus,</hi> and
which he judg'd to be Scorbutical.</p>
                  <p>A Spontaneous Weariness and Weakness
of the Nerves, especially upon going forth
in Cold Weather, remaining after the Cure
of a Scorbutick Palsie, that at first had seiz'd
the Patient upon a Journey, and taken away
Reason, Sight, Strength and Motion.</p>
                  <p>An Epilepsie from a hot Vapour which the
Patient felt to rise from the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries,
and suddenly to strike his Head and
Joynts, and which had frustrated many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
                  <p>In Stoppages of the Breast he observed
it to promote Expectorating, Spontaneous
Weariness, and Difficulty or Shortness of
Breath.</p>
                  <p>A Phthisical Asthma, that suffered not
the Patient to lye down, or sleep, or keep
his Food, and scarce allow'd him to drink,

so as to recover his Flesh, and vanquish the
Symptoms.</p>

                  <p>Gout, a Fit of which he freed himself from

                  <p>I affix this Register exactly, because when
so nicely done, is the only true way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justing
their Virtues; and is so much the more
useful, as it is equally applicable to <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh</hi>
and <hi>Woodham-Ferrys,</hi> which are both
the same.</p>
                  <p>Rule of Drinking these Waters in general,
is the same which the Chalybeats require,
<hi>viz.</hi> Chearfulness and Exercise, and a mild
Diet, they are not to be slept upon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger, nor doth the benefit of them
consist with a Temper disordered by Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either in the use of them, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
before.</p>
                  <p>The Repetition of drinking Purging Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
three or four times, sufficiently answers
the general Design of washing the Body,
though the more stubborn disorders of some
Bodies, make a longer use of them necessary.
But when the Nature of the Distemper, or
its Obstinacy, require the use of them speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59240:115"/>
they ought to be continued as other
Remedies for many Weeks, though with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termissions
at Discretion.</p>
                  <p>The Use of the Salts of the Purging Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is very advantageous for Persons that
are distanced from them, and in the Winter,
especially in cases wherein the Milk, which
is usually added to make them agreeable by
turning them into Posset clarified, is not
allowable, as in Itches and Salt Eruptions.
The Use of which both in Glysters and
Purges, when dissolved in Water, or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Apozems, is most kindly, and may be
properly applied, as the Learned Dr. <hi>Grew</hi>

                  <head>Some Observations on the Bath Water in
Somersetshire.</head>
                  <p>THE smallness of the Quantity of the <hi>Bath</hi>
Water, which I could procure at so
great a distance, did not allow me Scope to
try the earthy and Saline parts collectible
by Evaporation. The Water was clear, and
coldish to taste, not wide of the taste of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water. It did not gild Silver, or make
it yellow, as it doth at the Spring. I could
discover little Alkalisate in it: It thickned
and became milky with Oyl of Tartar and
curdled: It did not precipitate Sublimate
dissolved in common Water considerably,
which upon standing some time became only
a very little whitish. The Salt contained in
this Water, appeared fully to be <hi>Saltpetre,</hi>
in that it did not the least disturb a Solution
of <hi>Sal Saturni</hi> in fair Water; but shewed a
little of the Nature of common Sait more
than <hi>Saltpetre</hi> hath, in giving a pale yellow
with <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> with a dark cloud
which settled; and in taking a dull Ale col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
not fine with Tincture of Logwood,
the red it took languish'd more and more:
And in precipitating a Solution of fine Silver
out of Spirit of Nitre in a hardish Curd, more
than <hi>Saltpetre</hi> doth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:59240:116"/>
Those that know the Nature of both Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre
and Sulphur, which are the Principles
that impregnate this Water, must allow them
to be produced by the heat of the Earth,
and not to be the cause of it. If we enquire
into the Cause and Original of this Heat,
the Nature of the Salt evidenceth it not to
be produced by any calcarious Quarry, nor
the Effervescence of contrary Salts and Acids:
Subterranean Fire is groundless, and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Absurdities; it may reasonably be
supposed to be maintained by the Heat of
the Earth; for as a considerable Heat is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to the Concoction and Preparation of
Metals, and is sensibly proved in the Mine-chambers;
so that Crust of dead loamy Earth
that assists to maintain it, separates it from
us; and though we find no such extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Heat, yet the Heat of the Mines do
not only prove a Heat, but imply a much
greater to be where the Metal is prepared,
than where it is separated. The Eruption
of it at places, I pretend not to account for,
but that it is different often in places not
many Rods distant, is beyond doubt.</p>
                  <p>The Virtues of these Minerals well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for the Cures wrought by the <hi>Bath,</hi>
the most which I have observed or known,
having been in Tumours or Palsies from tough
Phlegm; not to take notice of their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59240:117"/>
Use in Scabby Diseases: And those that
have been within my knowledge, have been
all performed by Pumping the diseasy part,
and not by Bathing. Now the Qualities that
Authors take notice of in Sulphur to heat
and dry, incide, open and provoke. Sweat,
and resist Putrefaction, consider'd with the
power of the other to ease Pain, penetrate,
discuss, and temper Inflammation, sufficeth
to the performing all this. But to bring it
nearer to sense, I shall take notice what any
Person may prove, that a Bath made of Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre,
Sea-salt and Brimstone, is the most
happy Dissolvent of Oedematous Tumours
even in the Legs, that hitherto I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
It is much to be suspected, that this
Water must lose much of its power, if not
the best part, by carriage, together with its
power of Tinging Silver yellow, especially
for inward use.</p>
                  <p>I shall conclude all with this useful Remark,
That as the Waters are a powerful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Remedy, so to have success in
the use of them, it is necessary to form
just and due Observations of them, by distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing,</p>
                  <p>1. What Cures are wrought by the Waters

                  <head>Some Observations on the Water of Queen
Camel in Somersetshire.</head>
                  <p>THE Trial of this Water I annex to the
Bath Water, because this is likewise a
Sulphurous one and might illustrate that; at
least having it by me I thought worth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving.
It is a cold Spring of a faetid smell,
in which, as well as in Taste, it resembled
that of a foul Gun, as my honoured Friend the
Reverend Mr. <hi>Samuel Adamson,</hi> who made the
Experiments for me at the Spring, inform'd
me. It tingeth the stones black on which it
falls. The use of this Water is inwardly and
outwardly in the Kings-Evil, and other Ulcers
and Scabbiness, in which the success is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and purgeth little of any thing, but
hath produced Eruptions if drank without oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
by a Body whose Constitution they
disagreed with. It hath the Reputation of
proceeding from a Copper Mine, for which
my Friend could discover no ground, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do the Trials, unless some <hi>Pyrites</hi> there
found may give the occasion.</p>
                  <p>This Water prov'd upon Tryal to contain
a Calcarious Salt, yet not so open as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
with Gall and <hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> and
a Sulphur differing from common Brimstone,
and more amicable to Alkalys, and not to be
precipitated by Acids; and to contain no
Metalline parts, at least openly so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:59240:119"/>
With Gall it took a very pale Yellow, and
upon standing a Week a little deeper colour,
and a little thicker.</p>
                  <p>With <hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> upon 12 hours
standing, a little deeper than with Gall; in
both which it resembled neither Vitriols,
which take less colour, nor as Alkalys, which
give a deeper, but nearer <hi>Saltpetre,</hi> or rather
common Pump-water.</p>
                  <p>Like Alkalys it curdled not Milk.</p>
                  <p>With a Solution of Sublimate, 15 drops in
4 ounces, a bright brass colour, and upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of 5 drops more, curdled and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
of a <hi>Feuille mort</hi> colour, as Alkalys and
Salt of Lime.</p>
                  <p>Oyl of Tartar <hi>p. del.</hi> 75 drops in 4 ounces,
made it more limpid and inclinable to a bright
Copper, which Vinegar would not preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate.</p>
                  <p>The Water, when it had stood a Week,
with a Solution of <hi>Sal Saturni,</hi> turn'd White
like Milk as Alkalys, but when fresh, with 10
drops of the Solution, took a dark brown
colour, and look'd thick.</p>
                  <p>The Sediment, which is small and dark col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our'd,
would not burn, nor would it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
a Colour to <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> nor to common
Salt upon standing, as Mettals and Copper
especially will.</p>
                  <p>For various Reasons I must excuse any ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Mineral from a share in this, especially
Arsenick or Copper, but judge it rather near
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59240:120"/>
to common Sulphur, but less remote from an
Alkaly: But to know this more nicely, the
<hi>Pyrites</hi> ought to be prov'd.</p>
                  <p>As this may shew the reason of its good
Effects in the King's-Evil, and why it agrees
not in a Scorbutick Disposition, so it may help
to drect its proper place in Acid Tumors, as
Milk Sores, or where the Chyle is curdled,
which if observ'd, might make the Waters
more useful.</p>
                  <p>This Water gilds Silver as doth the <hi>Bath</hi>
Water, and as doth common Sulphur.</p>

                  <head>A Second Essay of the Bath Water.</head>
                  <p>HAving some reason to be dissatisfied with
the former Essay of it, I procur'd
some more new: I found the Taste a very
little Nauseous and Saline. The Salt of it
resembled Common Salt, the Water not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing
a Solution of German Vitriol: nor
a Solution of Sublimat, and taking but a pale
dull red with Syrup of Cloves, and very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Colour from <hi>Lignum Nephriticum,</hi> and
with Gall pale and curdled. With a Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Salt of Lead it curdled strongly, but
Whitened not the Liquor so much as Pump
Water. Besides this strong Precipitation it
had this peculiar, not to praecipitate Silver, so
readily or so much as common Salt: And it
made a White curdle with Spirit of
Harts-horn, but did not disturb Spirit of <hi>Sal
Armoniac:</hi> This differing Effect, of these two
Spirits, is only found in a Decoction of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt and common Sulphur, and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous
Bodies; for I observed near the same,
to succeed with an Infusion of Orpiment and
Spirit of Vitriol diluted. This odd Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon
is in <hi>Dulwich</hi> Water, which hereby is
illustrated to be owing to the Sulphurousness
of the <hi>Pyrites,</hi> and perhaps depth of the
Water.</p>
