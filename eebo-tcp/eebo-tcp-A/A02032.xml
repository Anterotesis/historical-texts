            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>Then ſpake <hi>IESVS</hi> againe to them, ſaying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, ſhall not walke in darkneſſe, but ſhall haue the light of life.</q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE words containe a Sermon of our Sauiour Chriſt, preached to the Iewes in the Temple: Wherein two things are principally to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Preface and the principall Scope. The Preface is in the former words <hi>[Then ſpake Ieſus to them</hi> &amp;c.] Wherein conſider theſe circumſtances: Firſt, The perſon ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>[Ieſus ſpake:]</hi> his ſpeaking is amplified by a note of ſedulitie and oftenneſſe in ſpeaking <hi>[Spake againe.]</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The perſons to whom he ſpake, <hi>[to them]</hi> viz. the people of the Iewes, flocking together about him, not to the Phariſies. Thirdly, The time when, <hi>[then]</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:3540:4"/>
that is, either after this time when the Phariſes had temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, vpon occaſion of a woman taken in adulterie, or elſe in the great and laſt day of the feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as ſome thinke; but whether, it mattereth not much.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is ſaid, that he ſpake to them againe, hence we obſerue, and learne that Chriſt was moſt diligent, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, and painefull in his calling, being in all things anſwerable to the commandement and will of his father. He was often weary, hungry, thirſtie with trauailing, and preaching; neither fainting, nor failing therein through want of earthly reward (as the maner of earthly men is) nor diſcouraged therefrom with the feare of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies In the Chapter aforegoing the Iewes ſeeking to kill him, he trauailed into Galilee, and from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the Feaſt to Ieruſalem againe, where he taught continually in the Temple till the end of the laſt day of the Feaſt, then he went into the mount Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet to reſt and refreſh himſelfe, and earely in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he came againe into the Temple to preach. By which Hiſtory, and many other places, it is apparent, that Chriſt was continually employed in the actions of his calling. Hereupon it is that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cap.</hi> 21. 25. <hi>If all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iohn 21. 25.</note>
               <hi>things were written that Ieſus ſpake, and did, I ſuppoſe the world could hardly containe the bookes, that ſhould be written of him:</hi> which words he vttered out of the conſideration, and reuiew of Chriſts great and daylie pains in teaching, preaching, &amp; working miracles, which he thought could not more fitly be expreſſed than by ſuch an hyperbolicall kinde of ſpeaking. Likewiſe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4 34. Chriſt was wearied with trauaile, and thirſtie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neither drunke, nor eaten any thing ſince the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it being now mid-day, therefore his Diſciples <note place="margin">Iohn 4. 3 4.</note>prayed him to eate; but he anſwered, <hi>I haue meate to eate that yee know not of: My meate is, that I may doe the will of him that ſent mee, and finiſh his worke.</hi> As if he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3540:4"/>
had ſaid, though meate be now neceſſarie for me, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faſted thus long, yet is the doing of my fathers wil, and finiſhing of his worke more neceſſarie; therefore occaſion of preaching, by the comming of the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, at this inſtant, being offered, I muſt forget bodily hunger, I muſt not now regard bodily meate, but I muſt redeeme the preſent occaſion, with neglect of my body and bodily ſuſtenance. Likewiſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 55. <hi>I ſate dayly</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Math. 26. 55.</note>
               <hi>teaching in the Temple among you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hereby the Miniſters of Chriſt, are taught by his example to be laborious and painfull in the faithfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their office, in the diſtruction of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſinne and Satan, and in gathering and building vp the Church and kingdome of Chriſt, ſeeing that he hath ſent them in like manner as his father ſent him, as himſelfe ſaith. In <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 35. Chriſt exhorteth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to performe the duties of faithfull labourers in the Lords harueſt, to be carefull in reaping his fruits; his argument is drawn from the compariſon of earthly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt-labour. <hi>Say yee not, there are yet foure months, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 35.</note>
               <hi>then commeth the harueſt?</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, you are ſo carefull for this earthly harueſt, that you count the moneths, the weekes, and dayes till harueſt come, ſo hungarly doe you looke for it, and painefully labour in it; but the Lords harueſt, for which you ought to be as careful, is euen now at hand, for yee may ſee the regions already white to the harueſt, therefore you muſt not now be ſo carefull for bodily meate, as to labour in the Lords harueſt, and to delight your ſoules in his worke doing, euen in reaping and gathering ſoules into his barne, redeeming all times and occaſions with loſſe of your meate, drinke, reſt, ſleepe, pleaſures, &amp;c. euen as earthly men do in the reaping and ining of their fruits. Furthermore he inforceth this exhortation by an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawne from the effect; namely, the reward of the harueſt-labour, <hi>verſe</hi> 36. <hi>He that reapeth receiueth wages,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:3540:5"/>

               <p>It is an vſuall thing in the Scriptures to repreſent ſpirituall and heauenly things, by bodily and earthly things, that therein, as in glaſſes, we may behold heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, although obſcurely, which notwithſtanding wee cannot otherwiſe perceiue, and ſee immediately, being too glorious, and vehement obiects for vs. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we cannot behold the light of the Sun in the Sun, but by reflexion thereof in the Moone, in the ſtars, in the water, or other bright body, or elſe by refraction thereof in the miſtie ayre: ſo the ſoule, while it is in the body, heareth, ſeeth, vnderſtandeth, imagineth,

               <p>And becauſe light and darkeneſſe are much vſed in the Scriptures, I will ſpeake a little of this materiall, and bodily light; becauſe it giueth light, and vnderſtanding not onely to that, whatſoeuer may be ſpoken of in this text, but to many other places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Light is in ſubſtance cleane, pure, beautifull, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, ſimple, vniforme, voide of all mixture, free from outward pollution, and may more fitly be compared to the ſubſtance of the higheſt Heauen, which is the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, or <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> of God, and his Angels, than to any earthly thing. Such is the glory of the light, that the eye cannot behold it, being in a ſubiect of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture like it ſelfe, as the Sunne is.</p>
               <p>Againe, the light is pleaſant, delightfull, cheerefull, comfortable, ioyfull, hopefull. For the light is the life of the world, and of euery liuing creature, and the abſence of light is the deſtruction of euery creature. It is the life of the world in a double reſpect: firſt, in reſpect of the vitall vertue: ſecondly, in reſpect of the ſhining.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The vitall power of the light is diſperſed throughout all nature, from the higheſt Heauen, to the center of the earth, comprehending, and contayning all things in it. And though it giueth not light to the eye in all things, yet it ſhineth inuiſibly in euery thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe vertue ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3540:6"/>
inuiſibly, ſence, motion, and life in all creatures, and without which the vertues, and operations of the ſtarres aboue, and elements below, are fruitleſſe, liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and dead: ſo that Light being a materiall creature <note place="margin">Auguſt. Baſil.</note>in it ſelfe, is the common life, and forme of euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And this is the light that God created the firſt day.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The light is the life of the World, in reſpect of the ſhining<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if there were no light, all things ſhould be hid in darkeneſſe, and inuiſible, and therefore could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing mooue without ſtumbling, and falling, neither know whether to goe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 35. And what could be <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 35.</note>looked for but ſudaine death? Againe, without light we ſhould haue no knowledge of any thing: the firmament, and elements, with all their creatures ſhould be inuiſible to vs, there ſhould be nothing but blindneſſe, ignorance, feare, horror, ſorrow, deſpaire, we ſhould be farre worſe than the priſoner that lies in the bottome of a naſtie dungeon: Yea, if the light of the Sunne were not, the World ſhould be a very picture, and reſemblance of Hell, a confuſion of beaſts, foules, and men, euery one treading other vnder foote, yea all things ſhould be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together into one Chaos, or maſſe: there ſhould be nothing but hunger, thirſt, cold, nakedneſſe, feares, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, mourning, and wailing, continuall dying, one thing deuouring another. Conſider therefore what is the neceſſitie, excellencie, glory and felicitie of the light, which is the life of the World. Hence it is that light is vſed in the Scripture to ſignifie good, and darkeneſſe euill. Light ſignifieth the glory of Heauen, the eſſence, and holineſſe of God, the ſonne of God, the doctrine of the Goſpell, naturall vnderſtanding, knowledge, and wiſedome in the minde, the knowledge of the glory and wiſedome of God in the ſaluation of the elect, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life, Chriſtians, felicitie, and proſperitie, life. Contrarily, darkeneſſe ſignifieth Hell, the paines and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3540:7"/>
of Hell, ſinne and wickedneſſe, the blindneſſe and ignorance of man ſince the fall, ſinfull and luſtfull liuing, the Gentiles that know not God, calamitie, and miſerie, death. Theſe things are generally ſignified by Light and Darkeneſſe.</p>
               <p>But for the clearing of this perticular place, the light hath foure ſpeciall ſignifications. Firſt, It ſignifieth God, that is, the Trinitie in the Vnitie. Secondly, It ſignifieth the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, that is the Vnitie in the Trinitie. Thirdly, it ſignifieth the Doctrine of the Goſpell. Fourthly, it ſignifieth Chriſtians, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 5.</note> Concerning the firſt ſignification; It is ſayd, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>God is Light, and in him is no darkeneſſe.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, God is holy. This holineſſe of the Diuine nature ſtandeth: Firſt, in the life, and incomprehenſible eſſence, or being of God: Secondly, in his other eſſentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, as his power, wiſedome, iuſtice, mercy, goodneſſes Thirdly, in his vnſpeakeable, complete, celeſtiall ioy, bleſſedneſſe, and felicitie. And as God is all light, ſo there is no light without him, for all that is without him, is ignorance, darkeneſſe, and impuritie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the ſecond ſignification. I. God the father is the light of the world, but this light in him is inuiſible</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 16.</note>
                  <hi>to the world, and to Angels, 1</hi> Tim. <hi>6. 16.</hi> Who onely hath immortalitie, and dwelleth in the Light, which none can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 18. Wiſ. 9. 13.</note>vnto. Ioh. <hi>1. 18.</hi> No man hath ſeene God at any time. Wiſ. <hi>9. 13.</hi> What man is he, that can know the Counſell of God; or who can thinke what the will of God is? <hi>Alſo,</hi> No man knoweth the father but the ſonne, &amp;c. <hi>Therefore this light of the world in the perſon of the father is hid &amp; inuiſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. God the Sonne is the light of the world, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication from the father, and in him is the light, and life of the world manifeſt, and viſible, which was hid in God from euerlaſting. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 36. <hi>As the father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he giuen to the Sonne to haue life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:3540:7"/>
For this cauſe is he called the image of the inuiſible God, and brightneſſe of his glory, whoſe glorious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wiſedome, and goodneſſe ſhineth in the ſonne, who with the father, is one and the ſame God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. Hence it is, that he is called the wiſdome of the father, becauſe he perfectly knoweth all ſecrets hidden in the father. And he is in ſpeciall manner called the Word, becauſe he reuealeth theſe ſecrets, and this light to the <note place="margin">Nazian in orat. de filio Dei. Baſil. in praefat. ante euang. Ioh.</note>World, in mans nature, and by mans voice. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time: the ſonne which is in the boſome of the father, he hath declared him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sonne therefore is the light, and life of men in a double reſpect. I. Chriſt is the light and life of man in the worke of creation: for by participation of his life, and light, he receiued life, motion, ſence, and knowledge. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>In it was life, and the life was the light of men.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. He is the life, and light of man in the worke of redemption: in which reſpect, here he calls himſelfe the light of the World. The former naturall life, and light, which we receiued from him in the creation, is turned into darkeneſſe and death, through the enuy of the Deuill, and ſinne. So that naturally we are without God, without light, without life, lying in the darkeneſſe of ignorance, and the pollution of ſinne. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18.

               <p>Now, that which the Apoſtle ſaith there, that Chriſt is our wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, is all one with that, which Chriſt ſaith heere, <hi>I am the light of the world:</hi> Therefore if any man deſire to know more wiſdome, or other wiſedome, more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, or other righteouſneſſe, more redemption, or other, in whole, or in the leaſt part, let him heare the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. <hi>Beware leaſt there be any man, that</hi>

                  <hi>Act</hi> 5. 24. The chiefe Prieſt &amp; Saduces had put the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in priſon, but an Angel deliuered them in the night, and commanded them to preach in the Temple the next day. Now the chiefe Prieſt and the Captaine of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the high Prieſts, hearing what was done, doubted of them whereunto this would grow. Theſe carnall and graceleſſe politicians regarding only the eſtabliſhing of their place, and of themſelues, and of all things for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3540:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
feared an alteration, &amp; doubted whether it would in the end proue to be with them or againſt them. And becauſe indeed that it could not but be againſt them (for the preaching of Ieſus to be the ſonne of God, the Prince and Sauiour of the world muſt needs conuince them of rebellion and murther, to their vtter diſgrace, ſhame, and confuſion, among all the people) therefore they labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all meanes to murther the Apoſtles, &amp; to quench the light of the Goſpell.

               <p>Furthermore, as the world in all times and ages here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore hath not knowne the ſtraight paths of God; ſo in theſe preſent dayes of ours the true and right profeſsion of Chriſtianity is counted of many puritaniſme, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſſe, phantaſticalneſſe, affectation of ſingularity, and hypocriſie. True it is indeed, that as there are true Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and true beleeuers, ſo Satan ſtirs vp counterfeits, that haue an outward ſhew and reſemblance of them, but are not purged from their inward filthineſſe: Theſe are they that worldlings ſtumble at, concluding thus, euen ſo are they all, therefore their profeſsion is but a kind of ſect; and to follow the common courſe, and practiſe of the world, is the ſureſt and ſafeſt way. Here Satan hath his deſire.

               <p>When Chriſt the light and life of the world preached the Goſpell of ſaluation to the world, in the outward forme and appearance of the Prophets that were before him, and of his Apoſtles and miniſters after him, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his doctrine with miracles, he had diuers followers.

                  <hi>him to gaze on him and his miracles,</hi> and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Herod</hi> was glad when <hi>Pilate</hi> had ſent him to him,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3540:12"/>
hauing been deſirous of a long ſeaſon to ſee him, becauſe he had heard many things of him, &amp; truſted to ſee ſome <note place="margin">Luke 23. 8.</note>ſigne done by him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 8. III. Some followed him for their bellies ſake, as many doe in theſe dayes. Thus <hi>Iudas</hi> followed him; not becauſe he loued him, and embraced his doctrine in ſincerity, but becauſe he was a theefe, and <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 19.</note>had the bag, and bare that which was giuen. <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 6. Thus the Scribe followed him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 19. <hi>Master I will follow thee whither ſoeuer thou goeſt.</hi> He imagined in his earthly heart, as did <hi>Iudas</hi> and the people of the Iewes, that Chriſt ſhould in the end be crowned King of the Iewes, and that he would prefer and aduance his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as earthly Princes vſe to doe. Therefore Chriſt ſhapes him an anſwer accordingly, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. <hi>The foxes haue holes and the birds of the heauen haue neſts, but the Sonne of Man hath not where to reſt his head;</hi> conſequently he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all wherewith to gratifie his followers and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers. Thus alſo a great multitude followed him ouer <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 26.</note>the ſea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> and from thence backe to <hi>Capernaum, Iohn</hi> 6. 26. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, you ſeeke me not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the miracles, but becauſe of the loaues that ye ate, and were filled.</hi> Fourthly, ſome followed him of enuy to entangle him, in his ſpeechs, as did the Phariſies, Scribes, Sadduces, Lawyers, and the Herodians, which thought that <hi>Herod</hi> was the Chriſt. Theſe are carnall and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall followers, which neither are meant of here in this place.</p>
               <p>The true following of Chriſt, which here he ſpeaketh of, is expreſſed by diuers ſimilitudes in the Scripture. <note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 21.</note>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 21. <hi>My ſheepe here my voice, and I know them, and they follow me,</hi> &amp;c. where hearing ſignifieth Faith, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Obedience. In other countries the ſhepheards driue not their ſheepe, but they call them and they follow them. Euery flocke knoweth the voice of their owne ſhepheard, by often hearing him, &amp; they follow him, but after a ſtrange voice they will not follow: Euen ſo Chriſts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3540:12"/>
ſheep, the elect, heare his word, they know it and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, and are obedient to it, that is, they ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be ruled, and gouerned by their chiefe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard Ieſus Chriſt, ſpeaking to them and calling them to him in his word, yea clocking them together as the hen doth her chickens. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 31. But mark the cauſe why they heare &amp; obey him, in theſe words <hi>(And I know them.)</hi> This knowing is not onely vnderſtood of Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, whereby he knew who were his from before all times, but of his knowing of them effectually in time. I call it effectuall knowledge when the elect are poſſeſſed of this knowing or acknowledging them, by the inward calling of his ſpirit. And this aſſurance of Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, acknowledging and owning them, is the cauſe why they know and acknowledge him, and are deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his word.</p>
               <p>Againe, this true following of Chriſt is farther expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Therefore be ye followers of God, as deare</hi>

                  <hi>children.</hi> This verſe is a concluſion of an exhortation of the laſt end of the verſe afore going, <hi>forgiue ye one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiuen you: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ye followers,</hi> &amp;c. Children wee know doe imitate their parents, not onely in deeds and words, but euen in the affections of their hearts, and imaginations of their minds, reſembling them inwardly, as they doe outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo that a man may ſay, this is right the fathers child, or the father will neuer be dead whiles the child liueth. Now the reaſon hereof is, becauſe he hath receiued the ſpirit of generation from the father, which frameth, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioneth, and worketh him into the image, ſimilitude, identity or ſelfeneſſe (as I may ſay) of his father: And this is a deare childe, becauſe the father doth not onely loue his child, but himſelfe alſo in the child; and the child not onely loueth his father, but himſelfe in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo that the one cannot hate the other, vnleſſe he hate himſelfe; and neuer man hated his owne fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3540:13"/>
this vnion is moſt firme, and perpetuall: euen ſo the children of God doe carry the reſemblance and likeneſſe of God in the inner man, in holineſſe by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the firſt Table, and righteouſneſſe, by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ſecond Table of the Commandments, which both proceed from Loue, and Loue from Faith.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I need not to amplifie this following, whereby Gods children follow him, by any more ſpecialls; for as they follow him in holineſſe, righteouſneſſe, mercifulneſſe, loue, truth, vprightneſſe, ſo alſo in all other things. 1</hi> Pet. <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 15.</note>

               <p>Now the cauſe why the children of God doe ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him in true wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is becauſe they haue receiued from him the ſpirit of regeneration. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Except a man be borne of water</hi>

Whatſoeuer we are, how morally good ſoeuer we be, we are but children of wrath, quite cut off from God, hauing no part at all in him; wild Oliues, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 24. Baſtards and runnagates, <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 24.</note>as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Cham,</hi> vntill God adopt vs into his family, giuing vs the ſpirit of ſonnes, of his owne free mercy, and grace, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. 6 <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 26. 17. Becauſe this politicall terme of adoption is vſed often in the Epiſtles, I will
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3540:14"/>
briefly declare the meaning thereof.</p>
               <p>Generation or begetting of children is naturall or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall: legall generation is a politicall act maintaining na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ordained for their comfort, which haue no chidren, the law prouiding children for them, whom nature hath failed. And thus may a man be ſaid to beget children legally.</p>
               <p>Legall generation is alſo twofold, <hi>Adrogation</hi> and <hi>adoption.</hi> Adrogation is when he that is a free man, and vnder no mans power, authority or command, viz. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of father, or maſter, is receiued into the place of a ſonne, by an other, which thus by law becommeth his father. And if he that is thus adrogate haue children, they are alſo vnder his power, as Nephewes, that is, his ſons children.</p>
               <p>Adoption is when he that is vnder the power of an other, whether father or maſter, is taken by another man to be his ſonne and heire. And if he haue ſonnes that is thus adopted, they are the nephewes of the adoptour. And although the adoptour cannot giue the ſpirit of a ſonne vnto him (which only the naturall father can do) yet is the adopted ſo obliged &amp; bound to him for thoſe ſo great benefits both of freedome and inheritance, as that he cannot but for euer be moſt thankfull to him, yea alwayes ready and deſirous to teſtifie the ſame by his loue, dutifulneſſe, obedience, and all meanes towards his adoptour, euen as he were his owne ſonne, and he his naturall father.</p>
               <p>To apply this. We, euen the beſt that euer was, were vnder the power of others, to wit, in the bondage, and vnder the tyranny of the diuell, and ſinne, who had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power and command ouer vs: and we miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wretches yeelded our ſelues willingly, yea with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, into ſubiection, and homage vnto them, being deſtitute of the knowledge of God and godlines.

vs out of the thraldome of thoſe tyrants with the bloodſhed and death of his owne ſonne: which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmitted himſelf in obedience to his father here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; for by no other price, nor other meanes could this purchaſe be made. Who becauſe he was not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, but perfect God alſo, did by the ſpirit of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification free himſelfe from the graue, the puniſhment, and imputation of our ſinnes; and by the power of the ſame raiſed himſelfe from death vnto life, corruption, and death hauing no power ouer him. This ſanctifying ſpirit of the ſonne hath the Father giuen vs, that by the power thereof our bond-mens minds, wills, affections, might be mortified and crucified; and that ſonne-like and ſpirituall minds, wills, affections, might be put into vs, daily renuing vs into the nature of ingenuous, and freeborne ſonnes. This is more then the legall father or adoptour can doe. For he can doe no more but binde his adopted ſonne to thankfulneſſe for his benefits of bodily freedome, and earthly inheritance; but God hath giuen vs the ſpirit of his ſonne, whereby we are made and tranſformed into naturall ſonnes, and therefore affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towards him, as the child is towards his naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel. Much more thankfull therefore, louing, dutifull and obedient ought we to be (if we be true ſonnes) to God our father, and Chriſt our redeemer, that hath ſo dearely bought vs out of the power of ſinne, death, and damnation, and brought vs into the glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſonnes, and hope of euerlaſting inheritance toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his owne ſonne.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is apparant, that it is the ſpirit which quickneth, begetteth, faſhioneth, and conformeth the children of God into the ſimilitude and likenes of God their father, wherein at the firſt they were created, and into which they are renewed by the holy Ghoſt, by the Goſpell of faith. This begetting and quickning ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is called immortall ſeede. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Being borne</hi>

This ſeede is not the eſſence of the holy Ghoſt, but the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof, begetting faith of the Goſpell in vs, crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body of ſinne in vs, and renuing vs into the <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 13.</note>image of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 13. 14. <hi>If ye mortifie the deeds of the fleſh by the ſpirit, ye ſhall liue; for as many as are led by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, are the ſonnes of God.

               </p>
               <p>To conclude this point then: As the child doth imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the father by the vnion and identity of the ſpirit communicated vnto him from the father: euen ſo the child of God doth imitate and follow Chriſt by the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirit of God and Chriſt, which the Apoſtle <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note>calls participation of the diuine nature. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by moſt great and pretious promiſes are giuen vnto vs, that by them ye ſhould be partakers of the godly nature, in that ye flee the corruption which is in the world through luſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt</hi> Hereupon it may be demanded, how we are partakers of the godly nature, and how we are ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be the children of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are partakers of the godly nature two wayes. Firſt, in reſpect of the effect, vertues, and gifts of the holy Ghoſt working in vs, and by vs; as, firſt, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our minds with the true knowledge of Chriſt: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, begetting faith in vs, and incorporating vs into Chriſt: thirdly, purging out the leauen of naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in vs: fourthly, faſhioning vs into new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: fiftly, applying Chriſt with his gifts, and treaſures vnto vs: ſixtly, leading vs into all truth: ſeuenthly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting vs in afflictions: eightly, ſealing the certainty of our inheritance in our hearts by his teſtimony, as a <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 14.</note>pledge or earneſt of the promiſes of God. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 14. Hence it is that he is called <hi>The ſpirit of wiſedome, and vnderſtanding, the ſpirit of counſell, and ſtrength, the ſpirit of</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:3540:15"/>
                  <hi>knowledge, and feare of the Lord, Eſay.</hi> 11. 2.

Moreouer the Apoſtles were partakers of the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in reſpect of thoſe extraordinary gifts wherewith they were endued for the execution of their Apoſtolicall office.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are partakers of the godly nature, in reſpect of the eſſence of God: not that Gods eſſence is any part of vs; but as he is God euery where filling hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth with his eſſence, ſo is he in ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with, and in his children, and by his preſence is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall in them. Whereupon <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>The</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 11.</note>

               <p>Thirdly, in this place the following of Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the following of light, or to a lanterne that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth light to trauellers to goe the right way without error, falling or ſtumbling. Such a compariſon the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt maketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 105. <hi>Thy word is a lanterne to my</hi>

                  <hi>feet, that I might not ſtumble, nor erre.</hi> The word then, both ſheweth the right way for a Chriſtian to walke in, and guideth him in the right way to walke without offence. So that to follow the light is to haue our conuerſation in this world according to the word of God, which by his ſonne he hath ſent and reuealed to vs, and is effectuall in them that are ſaued, bringing them out of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this world into the glorious light and ſunſhine of his kingdome and grace. Thus much of the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It followeth now to ſpeake of the negatiue reaſon inforcing the ſame.</p>

                  <hi>III.</hi> Shall not walke in darkneſſe.</head>
               <p>What it is to walke or liue in darkneſſe, the Apoſtle plainly declareth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 17. 18. 19. the 17 verſe is a dehortation, <hi>Walke not as other Gentiles doe in the vanity of their minds.</hi> Vanity of mind is a priuation or want of true wiſedome and knowledge, whereupon the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the minde, the affections of the heart, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of life, are not according to true wiſedome and knowledge, but vaine, that is, fooliſh, fruitleſſe, vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 21.</note>to no end. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21. <hi>What fruit had you then in theſe things whereof you are now aſhamed? for the end of theſe things is death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the two verſes following, he farther expreſſeth this vaine and fooliſh life of the Gentiles, ſhewing and declaring it by the cauſes thereof, which are two. The firſt is in the 18. verſe, namely the corruption of the mind. The ſecond is in the 19, verſe, and that is remorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe of conſcience.</p>
               <p>The corruption of the minde ſtands in two things. Firſt, in the preſence of euill <hi>(hauing their cogitation dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.)</hi> Secondly, in the abſence of good <hi>(Being ſtrangers from the life of God.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the darkneſſe of the minde, I thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it. Man was created in the image of God, that is, <note place="margin">Col. 3. 10.</note>in the true knowledge of God. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>And haue put on the new man, which is renued in knowledge, after the image of him that hath created him, and in true righteouſneſſe and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 24.</note>
                  <hi>holineſſe. Epheſ.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe.</hi> This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was as a pure and eleare light in the minde of man; but after that by the fall man was ſeparated from God, this light was darkned, that is, this knowledge was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with ignorance as a puniſhment of the fall, ſo that there remained onely ſome ſmall notions, glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, or remainders of light or knowledge in him.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3540:16"/>
Then againe, this light or remainder of knowledge is farther corrupted by the frowardneſſe of the affections and will. Now this ſmall remnant being taken away, there ſucceedeth meere darkneſſe, and brutiſh igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 23. <hi>If the light that is in thee be darknes, how</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 23.</note>
                  <hi>great is that darkneſſe?</hi> As if he had ſaid, if thy naturall reaſon be darkned through the malice of thy heart, there is nothing but meere darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the corruption of the mind ſtandeth in the abſence of good <hi>(ſtrangers from the life of God.)</hi> Life is naturall, or ſpirituall; the former we haue by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Adam,</hi> and it is the function of the ſoule in motion, ſenſe, and reaſon.</p>
               <p>Spirituall life is that which we haue by regeneration or new birth, which is the action of the holy Ghoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting faith in vs, by the power whereof we deſtroy the body of ſinne, and are renued into the image of God, which is here called the life of God. This life of God <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly declare, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 19. 20. <hi>That I</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 19. 20.</note>
                  <hi>might liue to God I am crucified with Chriſt (as touching the old man)</hi> 20. <hi>Thus I liue, yet not I now, but Chriſt liueth in me (his ſpirit worketh new obedience in me.)</hi> In the words following he defineth this dying to ſinne, and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life by the cauſe <hi>(And in that I now liue in the fleſh, I liue by the faith of the ſonne of God.)</hi> The Gentiles and prophane perſons are far from this godly life.</p>
               <p>Furthermore this their ſtrangeneſſe from the life of God is declared by the cauſe thereof, that is, their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: their ignorance is declared by the cauſe alſo, to wit, the hardneſſe of their heart, which is the peruerſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the will and of the affections in the heart. And becauſe froward and peruerſe men doe reſiſt, and ſeeke to quench the ſmall light that is in them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God giueth them vp into a reprobate minde voide <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 28.</note>of all iudgement. <hi>Rom,</hi> 1. 28. <hi>This is the firſt cauſe of vaine, fooliſh, and fruitleſſe liuing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:3540:17"/>
The ſecond cauſe is remorceleſneſſe of conſcience, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>Which being paſt feeling, haue giuen themſelues to wantonneſſe.</hi> Cuſtome in ſinne hardneth the heart, and the heart being hardned rebelleth againſt the mind, and putteth out the light of reaſon, which bringeth a curſe vpon the conſcience, and taketh away all remorſe of ſinne, which is a token of reprobation. The Apoſtle <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 2.</note>calleth it a ſeared conſcience that cannot bleed. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. Thus haue I ſhewed what it is to walke in darkneſſe which is to liue, not according to the knowledge of God, and his waves, but according to the imaginations and corrupt affections of our owne hearts. And thus doe all men naturally liue, though neuer ſo wiſe, learned, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and great in the world; their whole life is fooliſh, fruitleſſe, vnprofitable, and their end is eternall death.</p>
               <p>For the further clearing of this point, I will ſhew in what particulars the vaine and fooliſh life of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant is compared to darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, darkneſſe is a priuation and want of light: ſo ſpirituall darkneſſe, that is, the ignorance, and blindneſſe of the heart is a priuation, and want of the light or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in darkneſſe all things are inuiſible, one thing cannot be diſcerned from another: Blacke, and white, good and euill, hurtfull things and profitable things are not diſcerned So in ſpirituall darkneſſe, men call good euill, and euill good; ſinne is delightfull and ſweet to them, yea they coun tit abhomination todepart <note place="margin">1 Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. 4.</note>from euill. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Wherein it ſeemeth ſtrange vnto them, that yee run not with them to the ſame exceſſe of riot, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeake they euill of you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, in darkneſſe a man knowes not the right way, though he be neuer ſo quickeſighted, and although he be ſet in it, yet will he ſoone goe aſtray, running into by-paths and dangerous wayes, like a blind man: ſo in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3540:17"/>
So in ſpirituall darkneſſe, ignorance of God in his word, a man knowes not the way of life: this narrow way he can not finde, &amp; though he be neuer ſo ſubtill, politicke, wiſe, and learned, well may he grope for the ſtreight gate, as the men of <hi>Sodome</hi> did for <hi>Lots</hi> dore, but he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to finde it; and though he daily looke on it, yet ſhall he not diſcerne it: All his wayes are the wayes of death, and the good and right way ſeemeth to him to be the worſt way.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if this light of the ſunne were not, the earth ſhould be a very picture and reſemblance of hell, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed maſſe, or heape of beaſts, foules, and men, one thing treading other vnder foot, nothing but hunger, thirſt, cold, nakedneſſe, feare, terrours, ſorrow, deſpaire, mourning, and wailing, continuall dying, one thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring another: Euen ſo in ſpirituall darkneſſe, where the knowledge of Gods word is not, there is a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of hell, and men are like diuels: there is nothing but diſorder and confuſion, no dueties towards God, nor towards man put in practiſe. Where this glorious light of the Goſpell ſhineth not in the hearts of men, they are like to beaſts and Serpents, yea, they degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into the natures of all noiſome and venemous beaſts. Firſt, they hatch cockatrice egges, that is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer <note place="margin">Eſay 59. 5.

Eightly, rauenous and greedy of the prey, full of cruelty, and without all mercy, like to wolues, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. Where the light of the Goſpell ſhineth not in the hearts and mindes of men what can there be but pride, vaineglory, drunkenneſſe, exceſſiue drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, oppreſſion, deceiuing one another, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, euery Superiour treading his Inferiour vnder foote; politicke and craftie circumuenting one another, wily intrapping and inſnaring one another; couſenage, fraudulent dealing, diſſembling and lying in bargaining, bloodſucking by cruell oppreſſion hatefull and heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh rent-racking, vaine and prodigall ſpending, volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous liuing, and licentious gaming, murthers, enuy, ill will, contention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and trouble, whoredomes, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and wantonneſſe? Theſe and ſuch like, are the workes of darkneſſe, euen of them that are aliue in body, and dead in ſoule. But Chriſt is the light of the world: they that follow him ſhall not liue in ſuch darkneſſe, but ſhall haue the light of life. Thus much of the negatiue reaſon: the affirmatiue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>IIII.</hi> But ſhall haue the light of life.</head>
               <p>There be two lights of life, or liuely lights. Firſt the knowledge of God in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, participated by the ſonne of God to <hi>Adam</hi> in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is called liuely light: I ſay, the naturall knowledge of God in <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, was the light of naturall life, which life ſtood in abſolute holineſſe, which was his perfect obedience to the firſt Table, and abſolute righteouſneſſe, which was his obedience to the ſecond.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3540:18"/>
But this liuely light by the fall was extinguiſhed, yet not wholly, but ſo buried in ignorance and impurity, as it is of no force to bring forth in vs any pure worſhip of God, or holineſſe of life, but ſerueth rather to bridle and reſtraine vs from outragious ſinne, and to giue vs ſome light to diſcerne our ignorance and malice, to our owne accuſation and condemnation, ſo that it is a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not a liuely light.</p>
               <p>The ſecond light is a new knowledge, that is, the knowledge of God in Chriſt. Of God in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world to himſelfe: of God in Chriſt our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and louing father: of God in Chriſt redeeming and purchaſing vs againe, when by ſinne we were vtterly loſt: of God in Chriſt reſtoring vs to ſight, that were vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly blinde, and ignorant: of God in Chriſt aboliſhing the body of ſinne, and corruption in vs: of God in Chriſt renuing vs into his owne image and likenes, from which by <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion we fell: of God in Chriſt, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the curſe of the earth, with all afflictions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, into bleſſings and meanes to eternall bliſſe: of God in Chriſt, preparing a kingdome and heauenly Citty for vs, whoſe pauements, walles, and buildings are of Golde, Pearle, Emeraldes, Chryſolites, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles, and all coſtly ornaments, a thouſand times excelling the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple in glory.</p>
               <p>He that followeth Chriſt hath this liuely light in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he that followeth him not, hath no light in him, but is ſhut vp in ignorance and darkneſſe. Hee I ſay that denying carnall wiſedome, and fleſhly luſts, doth follow him, is enlightned to ſee and behold the glory of God in ſauing the elect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by and through Chriſt, which the Goſpell ſetteth forth: And by vertue of this light and ſauing knowledge is he made partaker of the diuine nature, that is quickned to liue the life of God, which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3540:19"/>
ſtands in new obedience. He therefore that followeth Chriſt hath the light of life.</p>
               <p>What it is to haue the light of life, or to walke in the light, is plainely expreſſed. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 35. 36. <hi>Yet a little</hi>

                  <hi>while the light is with you; walke while yee haue light, leaſt the darkneſſe come vpon you,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth heere to walke in the light, which ſignifieth two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to beleeue in him, as it is in the verſe following, <hi>while yee haue light, beleeue in the light,</hi> &amp;c. firſt, I ſay, to walke in the light ſignifieth to beleeue in Chriſt, our wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſignifieth the performance of all duties worthy of a Chriſtian, which is to haue our conuerſation according to our faith in him. For as the light of the day is giuen to vs to walke, and labour in our callings; euen ſo this ſpirituall light or day, ſhining in the Goſpel, is giuen to vs to walke, to labour, and to liue therein. And he that walketh not in the light of the Goſpell, walketh in darkneſſe, euen after the imagination of his owne corrupt heart, in the craftineſſe and deceiueable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of fleſhly luſts. For the further clearing of this point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will ſhew in what particulars this liuely &amp; ſauing knowledge of God in Chriſt, reuealed in the Goſpell, and applied to the elect by the ſpirit, is called Light.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the light is ſo glorious a creature, that no fleſhly eye can behold it, being in a ſubiect of nature, like it ſelfe, as the Sunne is: euen ſo the light of the Goſpell is ſo glorious, that the eye of mans reaſon and vnderſtanding cannot in the leaſt meaſure appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the light is pleaſant, delightfull, cheerfull, comfortable, ioyfull, and hopefull; but in the abſence
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3540:19"/>
of light there is heauineſſe, ſadneſſe, ſleepineſſe, penſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſorrowfulneſſe, diſpairfulneſſe, fearefulneſſe: euen ſo, this ſauing knowledge placeth the ſoule in much more happineſſe, and felicity, affording true and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting pleaſures, true delights, true cheerfulneſſe, true comforts, true ioyes, true hope, which the miſeries and afflictions of this life cannot aboliſh or corrupt, ſeeing that they are the rayes and beames of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, ſhining in vs. How inuincible, and vnquenchable is this ſauing knowledge, the light of life?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the viſible light is the life of the materiall world, maintaining life, motion, ſenſe, in all creatures in the firmament aboue, and elements below, euen ſo this ſauing knowledge is the life of the ſpirituall world, that is, the companie of Gods elect, kindling ſpirituall life in them, giuing ſpirituall wiſedome, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, reaſon, ſenſe, motion, vnto them, whereby they differ from other men, more then other men differ from beaſts.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as by the ſhining light all things are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vs, and euery thing is diſcerned and knowne: euen ſo by this ſauing knowledge are all things made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to the eyes of our minds. For by vertue hereof, we diſcerne betweene good and euill, betweene holineſſe and prophaneneſſe, betweene true wiſedome and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly craftineſſe, betweene the true worſhip of God, and idolatrie, or falſe-worſhippe, betweene ſincerity and hypocriſie, between the workes of light and darkneſſe, betweene Chriſt, and Antichriſt; between God and the Diuell, who can transforme himſelfe into an Angell of light, to blinde the eyes of Infidels, that they that want this knowledge diſcerne little or nothing at all between the one and the other, yea they altogether take the one for the other, like to the blind man that goeth confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3540:20"/>
the contrary way.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, as the light doth enlighten the bodily eyes, whereby we ſee to walke in the right way, and that without ſtumbling or falling: euen ſo this ſauing knowledge ſheweth the right way to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bliſſe, and guideth vs without falling into the pitfalls of Satan, and this wicked world.</p>
