            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>OThers their praise may gratefully bestow,</l>
            <l>And pay that Debt, which they to merit owe:</l>
            <l>But Im indebted on a double Score,</l>

            <l>And who an equal recompence can tell,</l>
            <l>For one who sings, and one who loves so well?</l>
            <l>To praise your Verse, is what the most will do,</l>
            <l>I would do something more, in praising you;</l>
            <l>Not, how the Poet's for his Verse admir'd,</l>
            <l>But how good Nature makes the Man desir'd.</l>
            <l>And yet the Task's so great to praise a Friend,</l>
            <l>That I much rather would your Verse commend.</l>
            <l>I would indeed; but something in your Lines</l>
            <l>So strange, so dazling, so peculiar Shines,</l>
            <l>That loud-tongu'd praise must here be at a stand,</l>
            <l>And Silent wonder only must commend.</l>

            <l>The Rev'rend Prophet now with joy may see,</l>

            <l>Now all their bright perfections scatter'd shine</l>
            <l>In ev'ry Poem, but Unite in Thine;</l>
            <l>So the Sun yeilds a double Heat and Light,</l>
            <l>When in a Glass his scatter'd Beams Unite:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Maeon</hi>'s Great Son, no longer shall confine,</l>

            <l>Judicious <hi>Dryden,</hi> may with <hi>Virgil</hi> claim,</l>
            <l>Of just, yet daring flights, the prudent Fame:</l>

               <hi>Waller</hi> in Verse as Tender as his Love,</l>
            <l>Like soft <hi>Catullus,</hi> does our passions move:</l>

            <head>Poetae Britannici. A POEM.</head>
            <l>SURE, when the Maker in his Heav'nly Breast</l>
            <l>Design'd a Creature to command the rest,</l>
            <l>Of all th' erected Progeny of Clay,</l>
            <l>His Noblest Labour was his first Essay.</l>
            <l>There shone th' Eternal Brightness, and a Mind</l>
            <l>Proportion'd for the Father of Mankind.</l>
            <l>The vigour of Omnipotence was seen.</l>
            <l>In his high Actions, and imperial Mien.</l>
            <l>Inrich'd with Arts unstudy'd, and untaught,</l>
            <l>With loftiness of Soul, and dignity of Thought;</l>
            <l>To rule the World, and what he rul'd to Sing,</l>
            <l>And be at once the Poet, and the King.</l>
            <l>Whether his Learning with his Breath he drew,</l>
            <l>And saw the depth of Nature at a view:</l>
            <l>Or, new descending from th' Angelick Race,</l>
            <l>Retain'd some Tincture of his native place.</l>
            <l>Fine was the matter of that curious Frame</l>
            <l>Which lodg'd his Fiery Guest, and like the same.</l>
            <l>Nor was a less resemblance in his Sense:</l>
            <l>His Thoughts were lofty, just his Eloquence.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:108080:4"/>When e're he spoke, from his Seraphick Tongue</l>
            <l>Ten thousand comely Graces, ever young</l>
            <l>With new <hi>Calliope's</hi> and <hi>Clio's</hi> sprung.</l>
            <l>No shackling Rhyme chain'd the free Poets mind;</l>
            <l>Majestick was his Style, and unconfin'd.</l>
            <l>Vast was each Sentence, and each wondrous strain</l>
            <l>Sprung forth, unlabour'd, from his fruitful Brain.</l>
            <l>But when he yielded to deluding Charms,</l>
            <l>Th' harmonious Goddess shunn'd his empty Arms.</l>
            <l>The Muse no more his sacred Breast inspir'd,</l>
            <l>But to the Skies, her ancient Seat, retir'd.</l>
            <l>Yet here and there Coelestial Seeds she threw,</l>
            <l>And rain'd melodious Blessings, as she flew.</l>
            <l>Which some receiv'd, whom gracious Heaven design'd</l>
            <l>For high Employments, and their Clay refin'd.</l>
            <l>Who, of a Species more sublime can tame</l>
            <l>The rushing God, and stem the rapid Flame.</l>
            <l>When in their Breasts th' impetuous <hi>Numen</hi> rowls,</l>
            <l>And with uncommon heaves swells their Diviner Souls.</l>
            <l>Thus the Companion of the Godhead sung,</l>
            <l>And wrote upon those Reeds from whence he sprung.</l>
            <l>He, first of Poets, told how Infant light</l>
            <l>Unknown before, dawn'd from the Womb of Night;</l>
            <l>How Sin and Shame th' Unhappy Couple knew,</l>
            <l>And through affrighted <hi>Eden,</hi> more affrighted, flew.</l>
            <l>How God advanc'd his Darling <hi>Abram</hi>'s fame</l>
            <l>In the sure promise of his lengthn'd Name.</l>
            <l>On <hi>Horeb</hi>'s top, or <hi>Sina</hi>'s flaming Hill,</l>
            <l>Familiar Heav'n reveal'd his sacred Will.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Seth</hi>'s Column then firm and unshaken stood,</l>
            <l>And long out-liv'd the malice of the Flood.</l>
            <l>His Father's fall was Letter'd on the Stone;</l>
            <l>Thence Arts, Inventions, Sciences were known.</l>

            <l>Around his Head, and Sun the brighten'd way.</l>
            <l>But misty Clouds of unexpected Night,</l>

            <l>Thus <hi>L—gh</hi> by Reason strove not to controul,</l>
            <l>The Powerful heat, which o'er-inform'd his Soul.</l>
            <l>He took his Swinge, and Nature's bounds surpast,</l>

            <l>The Double Vertue of <hi>Nassovian</hi> Fire,</l>

            <l>Thro' Air, and Earth, and Seas, I would disperse</l>

            <l>The Murm'ring Waves to hear me should grow tame,</l>
