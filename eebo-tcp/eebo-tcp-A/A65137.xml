            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THERE are so many things in the Works of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> that do not directly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Architecture, that one would

think they were less fitted to Instruct those that have a design to learn the Precepts of this Art, than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the World that the Author was the most knowing Architect that ever was, and a Person of the greatest Merit: He had the Honour to serve <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> and <hi>Augustus,</hi> the two Greatest and most Magnificent Princes of the World, in an Age when all things were come to the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfection.</p>
               <p>For one may see in reading his Works, which are full of a wonderful variety of Matters, which he treats of with a singular Erudition, that this great Man had acquired that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Knowledge which is necessary for his Profession by more excellent Methods, and more capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing something excellent, than the bare exercise and ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of a Mechanical Art could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly<note place="margin">

a certain Facility which meer Artizans have not, of penetrating the deepest Secrets, and all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of so vast an Art, as that of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture.</p>

                  <hi>Fano,</hi> a very little City; insomuch, that the greatest part of the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects of that Age, who had gained the general Vogue, being so ignorant, that they did not know even (as himself is forced to declare) the first Principles of their Art: The Quality of a mere Architect was become so Contemptible, that if his Books had not carried all the Marks of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61224:8"/>
Knowledge, and rare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and undeceived the World by taking away the prejudice that his small employ created him, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts he has left us would have wanted that Authority that was necessary to support them.</p>
               <p>For Architecture being an Art that has scarce any other Rule to walk by, in performing all those Excellencies her Works are capable of, than what we call a Good Fancy, which truly distinguishes that which is Beautiful and Good from that which is not so; it's absolutely necessary that one be perswaded that the Fancy he follows is better than any other; to the end, that this Perswasion insinuating it self into them that study this Art, it may form in them a Correct and Regular Idea, which without this Perswasion, would be always floating and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; so that to establish this Good Fancy, it's necessary to have one to whom we give great / deference, and who has merited great Credit by the Learning that is found in his Writings; and is believed to have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61224:9"/>
had sufficent abilities of chusing well among all Antiquity, that which is most solid and capable of founding the Precepts of Architecture.</p>
               <p>The Veneration we have for the first Inventers of Arts, is not only Natural, but it's founded upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; which makes us judge, that he that had the first Thought, and first invented any Thing, must needs have had a fitter Genius, and a better Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for it, than all those that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards laboured to bring it to its utmost Perfection. The <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were the Inventers of Architecture, as well as of other Sciences, having left many Works behind them as well in Building as in Books, which were looked upon in the time of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> as the Models of what was perfect and accomplished in this Art, <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> chiefly followed and imitated them; and in the Composition of his Book, gathered from them all that was to be found Excellent and Rare in all their Works; which makes us believe, that he has omitted nothing that was necessary, to form the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61224:9"/>
Idea of Good and Beautiful, since there is not the least probability that any thing could escape so Rare a Wit, Illuminated with so many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Lights.</p>
               <p>But because at present the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> is so generally esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, that all Ages have placed him in the first Rank of great Wits, and that there is nothing necessary to recommend the Precepts of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, but to prove they were drawn out of his Works: We having here designed to make only an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of his Works, we thought it would be necessary to cut off many things that this Famous Author has drawn out of an infinity of Writers, whose Works are now lost, and only gives a short Account of the Contents of every Book, in the beginning of this Abridgment; handling only in this Book, those Things that directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Architecture; disposing the Matter in a different Method from that of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> who often leaves off the Matter he is treating of, and takes it up again in another place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61224:10"/>The Order we have proposed to our selves in this Abstract, is, That after having given an Account in few words of what is contained in the whole Book; we Explain more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly what we judge may be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to those that study Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture. This Treatise is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Two Parts; The First contains the Maxims and Precepts that may be accommodated to <hi>Modern</hi> Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture; the Second contains all that appertains to the <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Antique</hi> Architectures; which, though often affected, have little that's now made use of, may yet nevertheless serve to form the Judgment, and regulate the Fancy, and serve for Examples of things that may be useful.</p>
               <p>I make a Distinction between the <hi>Ancient</hi> Architecture, and the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique</hi> Architecture, and the <hi>Modern</hi>; for we call that Architecture <hi>Ancient</hi> of which <hi>Vitruvius</hi> has writ, and of which we may as yet see many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the Fabricks that remain in <hi>Greece.</hi> The Architecture which we call <hi>Antique,</hi> is that which may be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61224:10"/>
found in the Famous Edifices, which, since the Time of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> were built at <hi>Rome, Constantinople,</hi> and many other places. The <hi>Modern,</hi> is that which being more accommodated to the present use, or for other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, has changed some of the Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions and Proportions which were observed by the <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Antique</hi> Architects.</p>

               <p>ALL his Works are divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Three Parts: The First<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</note> Treats of Building; The Second is Gnomonical, and treats at large of Astronomical and Geometrical Affairs. The Third gives Rules and Examples for making Machines or Engines ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, either in War or Building. The First Part is treated of in the Eight first Books: The Second in the Ninth: The Third in the Last.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61224:11"/>The First Part which relates to Building is twofold, for they are either publick or private. He speaks of private Buildings in the Sixth Book; and as to that which relates to publick Buildings, it's likewise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Three Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> That which has Relation to Security, which consists in Fortifications, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the Third Chapter of the First Book; That which appertains to Religion, of which he treats in the Third and Fourth Books, and that which relates to publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, as <hi>Town-Houses, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres, Baths, Academies, Market-places, Gates</hi>; of which he treats in the Fifth Book.</p>
               <p>The Gnomonical part is treated of in the Ninth Book.</p>
               <p>The Third Part which treats of Machines, is treated of in the Tenth and Last Book.</p>
               <p>Besides there particular Matters of Architecture, there are Three things that appertain to all sort of Edifices, which are, Solidity, Convenience, and Beauty. He speaks of Solidity in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61224:11"/>
the Eleventh Chapter of the Sixth Book; of Convenience, in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Chapter of the same Book; and of Beauty through the whole Chapter of the Seventh Book; which contains all the Ornaments that Painting and Sculpture are capable of giving to all sorts of Fabricks; and as to Proportion, which ought to be esteemed one of the principal Foundations of Beauty, it's treated of throughout all his Works.</p>
               <p>But to make it better understood, in what Method every Book explains those things, we must tell you, That in the First Book, after having treated of those things that belong to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture in General, by the Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Parts that compose it, and of those that are required in an Architect, the Author explains in particular what choice ought to be made of the Seat where we ought to Build, as to Health and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; after he speaks of the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and of the Building of Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Form of Towers and Walls of Cities, he dilates himself
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61224:12"/>
upon the Air and Healthiness of the Situation.</p>
               <p>In the Second Book, he speaks of the Original of Architecture, and what were the first Habitations of Mankind; after he treats of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, <hi>viz.</hi> of Brick, Sand, Lime, Stones, and Timber: After which he treats of the different Methods of laying, binding, and Masonry of Stones. He Philosophizes upon their Principles, and upon the Nature of Lime, upon the choice of Sand, and the time of cutting of Wood.</p>
               <p>The Third Book treats of the Proportion of the Temples, and of seven sorts of them which are those called <hi>Antes, Prostyle, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiprostyle, Periptere, Pseudiptere, Diptere</hi> and <hi>Hypaethre.</hi> After he speaks of the Different spaces that ought to be betwxit every Pillar, to which he gives the Five Names fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, (which in the latter Part of this Book shall be more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, as well as divers Terms of Art) <hi>viz. Pycnostyle, Systyle, Diastyle, Araeostyle</hi> and <hi>Eustyle.</hi> After that, he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61224:12"/>
gives in particular the Proportions of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Order, and demonstrates that it has a Proportion with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies.</p>
               <p>The Fourth gives the Proportion of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> and <hi>Dorick</hi> Orders for Temples, with the Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all the Parts that compose them.</p>
               <p>The Fifth treats of Publick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Market-places, Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, Palaces, Baths, Schools</hi> for Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and <hi>Academies</hi> for Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and in Conclusion, of <hi>Sea-Ports</hi>; and after occasionally discourses at large upon Musick, because, speaking of Theatres, he gives an account how the Ancient Architects, were in some places of the Theatre wont to place Vessels of Brass to serve for several sorts of tunable Echo's, and augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Voice of the Comedians.</p>
               <p>In the Sixth he teaches what were the Proportions and Forms of private Houses among the Greeks and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, as well in the City as Country; and describes all the parts of the House, <hi>viz.</hi> the Courts, Porches,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61224:13"/>
Halls, Dining Rooms, Chambers, Cabinets and Libraries.</p>
               <p>In the Seventh he treats of the manner of making use of Mortar for Plaster and Floors; how Lime and the Powder of Marble ought to be prepared to make Stuck. He speaks likewise of the Ornaments that are common to all sorts of Buildings, as Painting; and all sorts of Colours, as well Natural as Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, that the Ancients made use of.</p>
               <p>In the Eighth he speaks of Waters, and Rivers, and Fountains; <hi>viz.</hi> of their Springs, of their Nature, and Properties; how they are to be sought; and of the Conduits that are to bring them to Cities and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages.</p>
               <p>The Ninth is wholly Gnomonical, and teaches the manner of making Sun-Dials, and gives an account of the Rules of Geometry, how to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure solid Bodies. He discourses at large of the Course of the Stars, and the particular Description of those that are called Fixed Stars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61224:13"/>The Last is taken up wholly in the Description of making Machines to lift up great Weights, and others for several uses; <hi>viz.</hi> for the Elevation of Water for Corn-Mills, Water-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Measuring the Way as well by Sea as by Land; but it chiefly treats of Machines fit for the use of Building and War.</p>

                  <head>ARTICLE I. Of the Original of Architecture.</head>
                  <p>IT's related by Historians, That<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</note> Men, who in former times inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Woods and Caverns like wild Beasts, first assembled themselves to make Houses and Cities, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61224:15"/>
was occasioned by a Forest that was set on fire, which drew all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants together by its novelty and surprizing effects; so that many Men meeting together in the same place, they found out means, by helping one another, to harbour themselves more conveniently, than in Caves and under Trees; so that it is pretended, that Architecture was the Beginning and Original of all other Arts. For Men seeing that they had success in Building, which necessity made them invent, they had the Thoughts and Courage of seeking out other Arts, and applying themselves to them.</p>
                  <p>Now even as they took Trees, Rocks and other Things that Nature her self furnished Beasts to harbour themselves under, which were made use of as Models for the first Houses, which at first were only made of green Turf and broken Branches of Trees, they made use of them afterwards, in the same manner, to arrive at something more perfect. For passing from the Imitation of the Natural to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61224:15"/>
that of Artificial, they invented all the Ornaments of Edifices that were most curiously wrought, in giving them the Form and Shape of those things that are simply necessary to<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> the most natural Buildings: And the Pieces of Timber of which the Roofs and Floors of Houses are made, were the Original of <hi>Pillars, Architraves, Frises, Triglyphs, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, Brackets, Corniches, Frontons</hi> or <hi>Piediments,</hi> which are made of Stone or Marble.</p>
                  <p>The Pillars which are to be smaller at top than at bottom, were made in Imitation of the Boles or Trunks of Trees, and their use was taken from the Carpenters Posts that are made to support the Building. The <hi>Architraves</hi> which are laid across many <hi>Pillars,</hi> represent <hi>Summers</hi> that join many <hi>Posts</hi> together. The <hi>Frises</hi> imitate the <hi>Muring</hi> that is raised upon the <hi>Summers</hi> betwixt the ends of the Beams that are laid directly upon the <hi>Pillars.</hi> The <hi>Triglyphs</hi> represent, the Ceiling or Joyner's work which was made upon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61224:16"/>
the ends of the Beams to conserve them. The <hi>Corniches</hi> are as it were the extream parts of the <hi>Joists.</hi> The <hi>Modillions</hi> represent the ends of the Sheers, and the <hi>Dentels</hi> represent the ends of the principal <hi>Rafter.</hi> The <hi>Frontons</hi> are made in imitation of the <hi>Firms</hi> or <hi>Girders,</hi> upon which is laid the Roof of the House.</p>
                  <p>There is likewise another Original of Architecture, which is taken from the Inventers of the several Orders, and those that added the Ornaments to embellish them. For it's the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> Opinion, that the first Fabrick that was made, according to any of the Orders, was the Temple that King <hi>Dorus</hi> built in Honour of <hi>Juno,</hi> in the City of <hi>Argos.</hi> And it obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the name of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order when <hi>Ion</hi> the Conducter of a Colony which he established in <hi>Asia,</hi> made many Temples be built according to the Model of the Temple built by <hi>Dorus</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Ionians</hi> having changed some of the Proportions and Orna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, were the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61224:16"/>
Authors of another Order, which was called the <hi>Ionick,</hi> according to which, they built a Temple in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Diana.</hi> The reason of this change was, that this Temple being dedicated to a Divinity, which they represented under the Shape of a Young Lady, they thought it was proper to make their Pillars more tapering, the better to represent the airy Stature of this Goddess, and for this reason they adorned it more delicately, adding Bases which represent the Buskin'd Ornaments of the Legs and Feet, according to the Mode of that time; and Made the <hi>Channellings</hi> deeper to represent the Foldings and Plaits of a fine light Garment. They put likewise <hi>Volutes</hi> or <hi>Scrowls</hi> upon the <hi>Capital,</hi> pretending that they imitated the Head-Dress of a Young Lady, whose Hair Beautifully descending from the top of her Head, was folded up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each Ear.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards <hi>Calimachus</hi> an <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> embellished the Capitals of the Pillars, adding to them more Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61224:17"/>
                     <hi>Volutes</hi> or <hi>Scrowls,</hi> and more in number, enriching them with the Leaves of <hi>Brank Vrsine</hi> and Roses. It's said, That this Capital, which, according to <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> makes all the Distinction betwixt the <hi>Corinthian</hi> and <hi>Ionick</hi> Order, was invented by this ingenious Artisan upon this occasion. Having seen the Leaves of the above-mentioned Plant grow round about a Basket which was set upon the Tomb of a Young <hi>Corinthian</hi> Lady, and which, as it happened, was set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the middle of the Plant. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the Basket by the <hi>Tambour</hi> or <hi>Vase</hi> of the Capital, to which he made an <hi>Abacus</hi> to imitate the Tile with which the Basket was covered, and that he represented the Stalks of the Herb by the <hi>Volutes</hi> or <hi>Scrowls,</hi> which were ever after placed upon the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Capital. See Table the IXth.</p>
                  <p>This great Artist likewise invented other Ornaments, as those we call <hi>Eggs,</hi> because of the <hi>Ovals</hi> in the <hi>Relief</hi> which are in the Mouldings of the <hi>Corniches</hi> and are like <hi>Eggs.</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61224:17"/>
The Ancients called this Ornament <hi>Echinus,</hi> which signifies the sharp prickly shell of Chestnuts, because they found these Ovals represented a Chestnut half open, as it is when it's ripe.</p>

                  <head>ART. II. What Architecture is.</head>
                  <p>ARchitecture is a Science which ought to be accompanied with the Knowledge of a great many other Arts and Sciences, by which means<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</note> it forms a correct Judgment of all the Works of other Arts that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to it. This Science is acquired
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61224:18"/>
by <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> The <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>Architecture</hi> is that Knowledge of this Art which is acquired by stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, travelling and discourse. The Practick is that knowledge that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Actual Building of great Fabricks. These Two Parts are so necessary, that never any came to any great Perfection without them both. The one being lame and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect without the other, so they must walk hand in hand.</p>
                  <p>Besides, the Knowledge of things that particularly belong to Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, there are infinite other things that are necessary to be known by an Architect.</p>
                  <p>For, First, it's necessary that he be able to couch in writing his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Building, and to design the Plan, and make an excellent Model of it.</p>
                  <p>Geometry likewise is very necessary for him in many occasions.</p>
                  <p>He must also know Arithmetick to make a true Calculation.</p>
                  <p>He must be knowing in History, and be able to give a reason for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the Ornaments of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61224:18"/>
Architecture which are founded upon History. For Example, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Pillars he support the Floors of the House with the figures of Women, which are called <hi>Cariatides,</hi> he ought to know that the <hi>Greeks</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented these Figures to let Posterity know the Victories they obtained over the <hi>Cariens,</hi> whose Wives they made Captives, and put their Images in their Buildings.</p>
                  <p>It's necessary likewise, that he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Precepts of Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy; for he ought to have a great Soul, and be bold without Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, just, faithful, and totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from Avarice.</p>
                  <p>The Architect also ought to have a great Docility which may hinder<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</note> him from neglecting the advice that is given him, not only by the meanest Artist, but also by those that understand nothing of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture; for not only Architects, but all the World must judge of his Works.</p>
                  <p>Natural Philosophy is likewise ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> for him for to discover what
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61224:19"/>
are the Causes of many things which he must put a remedy to.</p>
                  <p>He ought also to know something of <hi>Physick,</hi> to know the qualities of the Air, which makes Places Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Habitable, or the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>He should not be ignorant of the Laws and the Customs of Places for the Building of Partition Walls, for prospect and for the conveying of Waters and Sewers.</p>
                  <p>He ought to know <hi>Astronomy,</hi> that he may be able to make all sorts of Dials.</p>
                  <p>It was necessary among the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, that an Architect should have skill in <hi>Musick</hi> to make and order <hi>Catapults</hi> and other Machines of War, which were strung with strings made of Guts, whose found they were to observe, that they might judge of the strength and stiffness of the Beams which were bended with those Strings. <hi>Musick</hi> was also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in those days for the placing musically Vessels of Brass in the Theatres, as we have said before.</p>

                  <head>ART. III. What are the Parts of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture.</head>
                  <p>THere are Three Things which ought to meet in every Fabrick, <hi>viz. Solidity, Convenience</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> which Architecture gives them; by the due ordering and disposition of all the Parts that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Edifice, and which she rules by a just Proportion, having regard to a true <hi>Decorum,</hi> and well regulated <hi>Occonomy</hi>; from whence it follows, that Architecture has Eight Parts, <hi>viz. Solidity, Convenience, Beauty, Order, Disposition, Decorum, Oeconomy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solidity</hi> depends upon the goodness of the Foundation, choice of Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and the right use of them; which ought to be with a due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, disposition and convenient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of all Parts together, and of one in respect of another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61224:20"/>
                     <hi>Convenience</hi> likewise consists in the ordering and disposition, which is so good that nothing hinders the use of any part of the Edifice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beauty</hi> consists in the excellent and agreeable form, and the just pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of all its parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Order</hi> is that which makes, that all the parts of an Edifice have a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent bigness, whether we consider them apart or with Relation to the whole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Disposition</hi> is the orderly Ranging and agreeable Union of all the parts that compose the Work; so that as Order respects the Greatness, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position respects Form and Situation, which are Two Things compriz'd under the word <hi>Quality,</hi> which <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> attributes to Disposition, and opposes to Quantity, which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to Order. There are three ways by which the Architect may take a view beforehand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick he is to build, <hi>viz.</hi> First, <hi>Ich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nography,</hi> which is the <hi>Geometrical</hi> Plan; <hi>Orthography,</hi> which is the <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Elevation,</hi> and <hi>Scenography,</hi> which is <hi>Perspective Elevation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61224:20"/>
                     <hi>Proportion,</hi> which is also call'd <hi>Eurythmy,</hi> is that which makes the Union of all parts of the Work, and which renders the Prospect agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when the Height answers the Breadth, and the Breadth the Length; every one having its just measure. It is defin'd, the Relation that all the Work has with its Parts, and which every one of them has separately to the Idea of the whole, according to the measure of any Part. For as in Humane Bodies there is a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Foot, Hand, Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and other Parts; so amongst Works that are Perfect, from any particular Part, we may make a certain Judgment of the Greatness of the whole Work: For Example, the Diameter of a Pillar, or the Length of a <hi>Triglyph,</hi> creates in us a right Judgment of the Greatness of the whole Temple.</p>
                  <p>And here we must remark, that to express the Relation that many things have one to another, as to their Greatness or different Number of Parts, <hi>Vitruvius</hi> indifferently makes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61224:21"/>
use of three words, which are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, Eurythmy,</hi> and <hi>Symmetry.</hi> But we have thought it proper on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make use of the word Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because <hi>Eurythmy</hi> is a Greek word, which signifies nothing else but Proportion; and Symmetry, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a word commonly used, does not signifie in the Vulgar Languages what <hi>Vitruvius</hi> understands by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; for he understands by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, a Relation according to Reason; and Symmetry, in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Languages, signifies only, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Parity and Equality. For the word <hi>Simmetria</hi> signifies in Latin and Greek <hi>Relation</hi> only. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, as the Relation that Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Eight Foot high, have with other Windows of Six Foot, when the one are Four Foot broad, and the other Three: and Symmetry, in the Vulgar Languages, signifies the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, for Example, That Windows have one to another, when they are all of an equal height and equal breadth; and that their Number and Distances are equal to the Right and the Left;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61224:21"/>
so that if the distances be unequal of one side, the like inequality is to be found in the other.</p>
                  <p>Decorum or Decency, is that which makes the Aspect of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick so correct, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is not approv'd of, and founded upon some Authority. It teaches us to have regard to three things, which are, <hi>Design, Custom</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Regard to Design makes us chuse for Example, other Dispositions and Proportions for a Palace than for a Church.</p>
                  <p>The Respect we have to Custom, is the Reason, for Example, That the Porches and Entries of Houses are adorned, when the Inner Parts are Rich and Magnificent.</p>
                  <p>The Regard we have to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Places, makes as chuse dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Prospects for different Parts of the Fabrick, to make them the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somer and the more convenient: For Example, the Bed-Chambers and the Libraries are exposed to the Morning Sun; the Winter Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61224:22"/>
to the West; the Closets or Pictures and other Curiosities, which should always have equal Light, to the North.</p>
                  <p>Oeconomy teaches the Architect to have regard to the Expences that are to be made, and to the Quality of the Materials, near the Places where he Builds, and to take his Measures rightly for the Order and Disposition; <hi>viz.</hi> to give the Fabrick a convenient Form and Magnitude.</p>
                  <p>These Eight Parts, as we have said, have a Relation to the Three first, <hi>viz. Solidity, Convenience, Beauty,</hi> which suppose, <hi>Order Disposition, Proportion, Decorum</hi> and <hi>Oeconomy.</hi> This is the reason that we divide this first Part only into Three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; the first is of the Solidity; the second of the Convenience; the third of the Beauty of the Fabrick.</p>

                  <head>ARTICLE I. Of the Choice of Materials.</head>
                  <p>THE Materials of which <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi> speaks are, Stone, Brick, Wood, Lime, and Sand.</p>
                  <p>All the Stones are not of one sort, for some are soft, some harder, and some extreamly hard.</p>
                  <p>Those that are not hard are easily cut, and are good for the Inner Parts of the Buildings, where they are cover'd from Rain and Frost which brings them to Powder, and if they be made use of in Buildings near the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61224:23"/>
Sea, the Salt Particles of the Air and Heat destroys them.</p>
                  <p>Those that are indifferently hard, are fit to bear Weight; but there are some sorts of them, that easily crack with the heat of the Fire.</p>
                  <p>There is likewise another sort of Stone, which is a kind of Free-Stone; some are Red, some Black, and some White, which are as easily cut with a Saw as Wood.</p>
                  <p>The best Bricks are those which are only dry'd and not baked in the Fire; but there are many Years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to dry them well: and for this Reason, at <hi>Vtica,</hi> a City of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> they made a Law; That none should make use of Bricks which had not been made five Years: For these sort of Bricks, so dry'd, had their Pores so close in their Superficies, that they would swim upon Water like a Pumice-Stone; and they had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Lightness, which made them very fit for all sorts of Buildings.</p>
                  <p>The Earth of which these Bricks were usually made was very Fat, and a sort of White Chalky Clay without
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61224:23"/>
Gravel or Sand, which made them Lighter and more Durable; they mixed Straw with them to make them better bound and firmer.</p>
                  <p>The Woods which were made use of in all Buildings, are Oak, Poplar, Beech, Elm, Cypress, Firr; but some of them are not so proper for Building as others.</p>
                  <p>The Firr, because it has great plenty of Air, and Fire, and but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Earth and Water, is light, and does not easily bend; but is very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Worms and Fire.</p>
                  <p>The Oak which is more Earthy lasts for ever under Ground; but above Ground is apt to cleave.</p>
                  <p>The Beech which has little of Earthiness, Humidity and Fire, but great plenty of Air, is not very solid and easily breaks.</p>
                  <p>The Poplar and the Linden Trees are only good for light Work, they are easily cut and so finest for Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                  <p>The Alder is good to make Piles of in Marthy Places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:61224:24"/>The Elm and the Ash have this property, that they do not easily cleave, and that they are pliable.</p>
                  <p>The Yoke-Elm is likewise pliable, and yet very strong; this is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that they made Yokes for their Oxen of them in Old Time.</p>
                  <p>The Pine and the Cypress have this defect, that they easily bend under any Weight, because of their great Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; but they have this Advantage, that their Humidity does not engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Worms, because of their Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which kills them.</p>
                  <p>The Juniper and the Cedar have the same Vertue of hindering Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: the Juniper by its Gum, which is call'd <hi>Sandarax,</hi> and the Cedar by its Oil call'd <hi>Cedrium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Larch-Tree has likewise the same Vertue, but its particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is, that it will not burn. There is a remarkable Story of this Wood, which is, That when <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd a Castle at the Foot of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> there was a Tower built of this Wood, which prov'd the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Defence of the Place. He
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61224:24"/>
thought to take it easily by making a great Fire at the Foot of the Tower, but for all this great Fire, the Tower did not suffer the least Damage.</p>
                  <p>The Olive-Tree is likewise very serviceable, if it be put in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and Walls of Cities; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has been singed a little, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced among the Stones, it lasts for ever, and is out of all danger of Corruption.</p>
                  <p>Lime is made of White Stones or Flinty Pebbles, the harder the Stones are which 'tis made of, the better it is for Building. That which is made of soft Spongy Stones, is proper for Plastring.</p>
                  <p>There are five sorts of Sand; <hi>viz.</hi> Sand that is dug out of the Ground, River Sand, Gravel, Sea-Sand, and Pozzolana, which is a Sand peculiar to some Parts of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The best Sand is that which being rubb'd between the Hands makes a little Noise, which that Sand does not, which is Earthy, because it is not rough. Another Mark of good Sand is, that when 'tis put upon any
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61224:25"/>
Thing that is White and shak'd off, it leaves no Mark behind.</p>
                  <p>The Sand which is dug out of the Earth has all these Qualities, and is esteem'd the best. <hi>Vitruvius</hi> makes four sorts of it; <hi>viz.</hi> White, Black, Red, and Bright like a Carbuncle.</p>
                  <p>If it happen that there be no good Place to dig Sand in, we may make use of Sea-Sand, or River-Sand, which is likewise better for Plastering than the Sand which is digged, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for Building, because it drys quickly. Gravel likewise is very good, provided the grosser Parts be taken away. Sea-Sand is worst of all, because 'tis long adrying; and for this Reason, where 'tis made use of in Building, they are forc'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist sometimes till it dry.</p>
                  <p>The Sand which is found near <hi>Nae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> call'd <hi>Pozzolana</hi> is so proper to make good Mortar, if it be mixed with Lime, that not only in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Fabricks, but even in the very bottom of the Sea it grows into a wonderful hard Body. In Old Times they made use of it for Moles or Ports
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61224:25"/>
of the Sea, for after having made with Piles and Boards a Partition, they fill'd up the whole Compass of the Partition with this Mortar, which dry'd of it self in the middle of the Water and became a solid Body.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="article">
                  <head>ART. II. Of the Vse of the Materials.</head>
                  <p>THE first thing we should have a Care of before we begin to build, is, to have the Stones dug out of the Quarry before they be used, and to expose them in some open Place, to the end that those which are endamaged by the Air, during this Time, may be put in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and those that prove Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Good may be kept for the Walls above Ground.</p>
                  <p>We must likewise have a great care of the Wood which we make use of; That it be cut in a seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Time, which is in Autumn and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61224:26"/>
Winter; for then it is not full of that superfluous Humidity which weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in dilating its Fibers, but it is firm and well closed by the Cold. This is so true, that the Wood of Trees which grow and become very great in a little Time, by reason of their great Humidity, is tender and apt to break, and very unfit for Building Which Experience shows us particularly in those Firrs call'd <hi>Supernates,</hi> which grow in <hi>Italy,</hi> on that side the <hi>Apennine,</hi> towards the <hi>Adriatick</hi>-Sea, for they are great and beautiful, but their Wood is not good for Building; whereas those on the other side of the Mountain, which are exposed to Heat and Dryness, call'd <hi>Infernates,</hi> are very good for Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>This superfluous Humidity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damages Trees so much, that we are sometimes constrain'd to make a hole at the foot of the Tree and let it run out, which is the occasion of the Practice which is observ'd in cutting of Wood for Building, to Tap that Tree at the Foot, cutting not only the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61224:26"/>
Bark, but even some part of the Wood it self, and so leave it for some time before it be Fell'd.</p>
                  <p>It is likewise easie to judge of what great Importance the draining of this superfluous Humidity is for strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Timber, and hindring Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</note> from this, That those Piles which are interlaced among the Stones in the Walls and Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Towns endure for ever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Corrupting, when they have been burnt a little on the outside.</p>
                  <p>Bricks ought not to be made use of<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</note> but in very thick Walls; for this reason they did not build with Brick in <hi>Rome,</hi> for to save Ground; they were not permitted to make the Walls of their Houses above a Foot and a Half thick, which Makes about<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</note> 16 Inches and a half of our Foot.</p>
                  <p>They likewise never made the top of their Walls with Brick; for the Brick of the Ancients not being baked, this part of the Wall would have been easily endamaged; for this reason they built it with Tiles, a foot and a half high, comprizing the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61224:27"/>
Cornish or Entablature which was made likewise of Tiles to cast off the Water and defend the rest of the Wall. They likewise chose for these Cornishes the best Tiles, <hi>viz.</hi> those that had been long on the top of the Houses, and given sufficient Proof that they were well baked and made of good Matter.</p>
                  <p>The Walling with Brick was so much esteem'd among the Ancients, that all their Fabricks, as well pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as private, and their most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Palaces were built with them. But that which principally made this sort of Building be esteem'd, was its great Duration; for when expert Architects were called to make an Estimate of Buildings, they always deducted an 80th. part of what they judged the Building cost for every Year that the Wall had been stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for they supposed that the Wall could not ordinarily endure more than Fourscore Years; but when they valued Buildings of Brick, they always valued them at what they cost at first, supposing them to be of an Eternal Duration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61224:27"/>To make the right use of Lime and Sand, and to make good Mortar of them, it is necessary that the Lime be first well Quench'd, and that it be kept a long time, to the end that if there be any Piece of it that is not well burnt in the Kilo, it may, being extinguished at leasure, soften as well as the rest. This is of Great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance particularly in Plastering and Works of <hi>Stuck,</hi> which is a Composition of Marble finely beaten with Lime. For if any little Pieces remain that are not well baked, when they come to be made use of, they crack and break the Work.</p>
                  <p>The way to know whether the Lime be well Quench'd, is thus: You<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</note> may thrust a Chip of Wood into it or a Knife, and if the Chip of Wood meet with any Stones, or that the Knife comes out clean without any sticking to it, it signifies the Lime was not will burnt; for when 'tis well Quench'd, it is Fat and will stick to the Knife; but the quite contrary happens to Mortar, for it is neither well prepar'd, nor well mix'd, if it stick to the Trowel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:61224:28"/>For to make the right use of Sand, you must first consider what it<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</note> is to be employ'd in; for if it be Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar for Plastring, you must not make use of Sand that was lately dug out, for it drys the Mortar too fast, which cracks the Plastring; but quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary if it be to be employ'd in Mason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it must not have been a long time expos'd to the Air, for the Sun and the Moon do so alter it, that the Rain dissolves it, and turns it almost all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Earth.</p>
                  <p>The Proportion that Sand and<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</note> Lime ought to have to make good Mortar, should be three parts of Sand that is dug, or two parts of River-Sand or Sea-Sand against on of Lime, and 'twill be yet much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if you add to the Sand of the Sea and the River a third part of Tiles well beaten.</p>
                  <p>One of the Principal Things that<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</note> is to be observ'd in making Mortar is, to mix it well. The Grecian Workmen were so careful of this, that they Tewed it a great while, putting Ten Men to every Vessel wherein they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61224:28"/>
wrought it, which gave so great a hardness to the Mortar, that when any big pieces of Plaster fell off the Old Walls, they made Tables of it.</p>

as you can, and drive in Piles of Alder, Olive, or Oak, a little singed, near together, and fill up the void Places between the Piles with Coal.</p>

                  <p>To make the Binding of the Stones the stronger in the Foundation of great Fabricks, you must put Piles of Olive a little singed and placed very thick from one Parement or Courk to another, which serves, as it were, for Keys and Braces; for this Wood so prepar'd, is not subject to Worms, and will endure for ever, either in the Earth or in the Water, without the least Damage.</p>

                  <p>THE right ordering of Stones<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> joined with Mortar, which is call'd Masonry, is sevenfold; there are three of them which are of hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Stone; <hi>viz.</hi> that which is in Form of a <hi>Net,</hi> that which is in <hi>Binding,</hi> that which is call'd the <hi>Greek Mason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> There are likewise three sorts of Masonry of unhewed Stones; <hi>viz.</hi> that which is of an <hi>equal Course</hi>; and that which is of an unequal, and that which is fill'd up in the middle; the seventh is compounded of all the rest.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Net-Masonry</hi> is that which is made of Stones perfectly squar'd in their Courses, and are laid so; that the Joints go obliquely, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agonals are the one Perpendicular, and the other Level. This is the most pleasing Masonry to the Sight, but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61224:30"/>
it is apt to crack. See the Figure A. Table I.</p>
                  <p>The Masonry call'd the <hi>Bound-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonry,</hi> is that, as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> explains it, in which the Stones are plac'd one upon another like Tiles; that is to say, where the Joints of the Beds are Level, and the Mounters are Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular; so that the Joint that mounts and separates two Stones falls directly upon the middle of the Stone which is below.</p>
                  <p>Some Authors call this sort of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonry <hi>Incertain,</hi> but they are mistaken; for they read <hi>Incerta</hi> instead of <hi>Inserta</hi> it is not so Beautiful as the Net-work, but it is more solid and durable. See the Figure BB. Table I.</p>
                  <p>The Masonry which <hi>Vitruvius</hi> says is particular to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> is that, where after we have laid two Stones each of which make a Parement or <hi>Course,</hi> another is laid at the end, which makes two Parements or <hi>Courses,</hi> and all the Building through observe this Order. This may be call'd <hi>Double-Binding</hi>; for the Binding is not only of Stones of the same
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61224:30"/>
                     <hi>Course</hi> one with another, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of one <hi>Course</hi> with another <hi>Course.</hi> See Figure CC. Table I.</p>
                  <p>The manner of Walling by unequal Courses call'd <hi>Isodomum</hi> by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, differs in nothing from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonry call'd <hi>Bound-Masonry,</hi> but only in this, that the Stones are not hewed. See Figure D. Table I.</p>
                  <p>The other manner by unequal Courses call'd <hi>Pseudisodomum</hi> is also made of unhewed Stone, and laid in <hi>Bound-Work,</hi> but they are not of the same thickness, and there is no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality observ'd, but only in the several Courses, the Courses them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves being unequal one to another. See Figure A. Table I.</p>
                  <p>The Masonry which is fill'd up in the middle, call'd by the Ancients <hi>Emplecton,</hi> is likewise made of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hewed Stone and by Courses, but the Stones are only set in order as to the <hi>Parements</hi> or <hi>Courses,</hi> but the middle is fill'd up with Stones thrown in carelesly among the Mortar. See Fig. FF, GG, H. Table I.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:61224:31"/>Among all these sorts of Masonry, that will always be best which is made of Stones of an indifferent size, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lesser than greater; to the end that the Mortar penetrating them in more parts may bind them faster, and the strength of the Mortar does not so soon decay. For we see that the Mortar which is laid in the Joints or Seams of the greater Stones with time decays and turns to Dust, which never happens to the most Ancient Fabricks which have been built of little Stones. From thence we may conclude, that it is ill Husbandry to be sparing of Mortar.</p>
                  <p>For this reason <hi>Vitruvius</hi> proposes another sort of Masonry, which may be call'd the <hi>Compound Mason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> for it is all the former together, of Stones hewed and unhewed, and fastned together with Cramp-Irons. The Structure is as follows: The <hi>Courses</hi> being made of hew'd Stone, the middle place which was left void is fill'd up with Mortar and Pebbles thrown in together; after this they bind the Stones of one <hi>Parement</hi> or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61224:31"/>
                     <hi>Course</hi> to those of another with Cramp-Irons fasten'd with melted Lead. This is done to the end, that the abundance of Mortar which is in the middle may furnish and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate a sufficient Humidity to the Joints of the great Stones which make the <hi>Parements.</hi> See the Figure K. Table I.</p>
                  <p>There are many Precautions to be given to make the Masonry more firm and durable, and these Precautions are common to all the different sorts of Masonry.</p>
                  <p>When you would have the Walls<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</note> very thick, for great and heavy Buildings, you must strengthen the inner part of the Wall with long Piles of singed Olive, which serves for Keys and Braces, for this Wood being so prepar'd never corrupts.</p>
                  <p>It is likewise of great Importance for the strength of Walls, that all be<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible: broken type" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61224:32"/>
Pillar that carrys false, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible the Work should continue long.</p>
                  <p>There are also two ways of strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Walls, which are either to ease them of their own weight, or of that of the Earth which they are to support.</p>
                  <p>The first way of easing is in those Places where there are void spaces, as above Doors or Windows. These easements may be made two different ways; the first is to put over the Lintel which supports the Wall, which is over the void space of the Gates and Windows, two Beams, which lying or resting below direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon <hi>Pieds-droits</hi> or <hi>Piers</hi> meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether above.</p>
                  <p>The other way is, to make direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over the void spaces Vaulted Arches with Stones cut corner-ways and tending to one Center. For the Walls be so strengthned by the means of these easements, that part of the Wall which is below will not sink at all being easied of the load of the part that is above, and if some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61224:32"/>
should happen by tract of time, it may be mended without propping that which is above.</p>
                  <p>The second way of easing, is, for Walls that are made to support the Earth; for, besides the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thickness which they ought to have, they should have likewise But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses on that side next the Earth, so far distant one from another as is the breadth of the Wall; they ought likewise to have an <hi>Emparement</hi> or large Foundation which must be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the height of the Wall, so that they go diminishing by degrees from the bottom to the top, where they come to equal the height of the Wall.</p>
                  <p>The effect of these <hi>Buttresses</hi> is not<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</note> only to support the Earth by their Resistance, but likewise to lessen its Efforts when it swells, in dividing it into many parts.</p>
                  <p>And if it be judg'd that these <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</note> be not sufficient, the Wall also which supports the Earth must be strengthned with other <hi>Buttresses</hi> within.</p>

                  <head>ART. V. Of Flooring and Ceiling.</head>
                  <p>THere are four sorts of Flooring, some are upon the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Ground, others between two Stories, others make the Roof of the House in Plat-form, and the last is <hi>Plat-Fond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make those Floors that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ground, you must first make the Earth smooth and plain, if it be firm and solid, if not, it must be beaten with a Rammer with which they ram down their Piles; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having cover'd the Earth with the first <hi>Lay</hi> or <hi>Bed,</hi> call'd <hi>Statumen</hi> by the Ancients, which was of Flinty Stones about the bigness of ones Fist, among which was mixed Mortar made of Lime and Sand. Then they laid the second <hi>Bed,</hi> which they call'd <hi>Rudus,</hi> which was made of lesser Stones, of which there were three Parts for one
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61224:33"/>
of Stone if they were new, for if they were taken out of old Buildings, five parts of Stones or Pibbles would be required for two of Lime.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> had a way of making their<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.</note> Floors in those low places where cold and humidity ordinarily reign, which freed them from there Inconveniences. They digged the Earth two Footdeep, and after having beaten it well, they laid a Bed of Mortar or Cement a little sloping from either side to the Channel, which convey'd the Water under Ground; they laid a Bed of Coal upon the first Mortar, and having beaten them well, they cover'd them with another Cement or Mortar made of Lime, Sand and Ashes, which they made smooth when it was dry with a Polishing-Stone. These Floors presently drank up the Water that fell upon them, that one might walk barefoot without being incommoded by the Cold.</p>
                  <p>For the Floors which are between two Stories, there must be a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care taken, that if there be any Partition below it, that it may not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61224:34"/>
touch the Flooring for fear lest if the Flooring came to sink a little, it might be broke upon the Partition which remains firm.</p>
                  <p>To make these Floorings, the Boards must be nailed at each end up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Joist, to the end they may not warp; these Boards or Planks being cover'd with Straw, to hinder the Lime from wasting the Timber, the first Bed must be laid, made of a mixture of Mortar and little Stones a hand breadth, which must be beaten a long time with Iron-Levers, and so it must make a solid Crust which must be nine Inches thick; upon it shall be laid the <hi>Noyau</hi> or <hi>Ame,</hi> which must be at least six Inches thick: It must be made of Cement, with which must be mix'd one part Lime for two parts of Cement. Upon the <hi>Ame</hi> or <hi>Noyau</hi>

                     </note> is placed the <hi>Parement</hi> made with the Rule, afterwards it must be scrap'd and all the Eminences and Inequality taken away: After that must be laid a Composition of Lime, Sand and beaten Marble, to fill equally all the Seams or Joints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:61224:34"/>If a Flooring be to be made in the open Air, as upon <hi>Terrasses,</hi> that may endure Rain or Frost without any Damage; you must nail upon the Joists two Ranks of Boards across, one above the other; and having laid the first Bed, as is said before, it must be Paved with great Square Bricks two Foot Square, which must be hollow'd in the Ends in the Form of a half-Channel, the breadth of an Inch, which must be fill'd with Lime mixed with Oil. These Square Bricks must be higher in the middle, sloping two Inches for every six Foot; that is to say, a Forty-eighth Part: Upon these Square Bricks must be laid the <hi>Ame</hi>; upon which, after it has been well beaten, as well as the rest, must be put great Square Stones; and to hinder the Moisture from hurting the Boards, it is good to pour as much of the Lees of Oil as they will soak up.</p>
                  <p>The under part of the Flooring, and the <hi>Plat-Fonds,</hi> must be made also with great Care. To make the <hi>Plat-Fonds</hi> or <hi>Flat-roofs</hi> in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61224:35"/>
Form of a Vault, you must nail to the Joists of the Boards, or to the Rafters of the Roof, from two Foot<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</note> to two Foot pieces of crooked Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Choice must be made of Timber that is not apt to rot; such as, <hi>viz. Cypress, Box, Juniper,</hi> and <hi>Olive</hi>; no <hi>Oke</hi> must be made use of, because it will warp and crack the Work. The Joists being fastened to the <hi>Summers,</hi> you must fix to them <hi>Spanish-Broom</hi> with <hi>Greek-Reeds</hi> well beaten. These Reeds are in stead of Laths, which at present are made use. of to make the Eaves of Houses; over these Reeds must be laid a Plaster of Mortar, made of Sand, to hinder the Drops of Water which may fall from above from endamaging these <hi>Plat-Fonds.</hi> After which, the under part must be Plaster'd pretty thick, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all Places equal with Mortar made of Lime and Sand, that it may be afterwards Polished with Mortar made with Lime and Marble.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients sometimes made dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vaults, when they were afraid<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</note> that the Humidity which is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61224:35"/>
by the Vapours which mount up might rot the Wood which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Vaults. This Method they principally made use of in their Baths.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Corniches</hi> which are made use of under the <hi>Plat-Fonds,</hi> ought to be little, left their great Jetting out, or Projecture should make them heavy, and apt to fall. For this Reason they ought to be made of pure Stuck of Marble, without any Plaster, that all the Work drying at the same time, may be less apt to break.</p>

                  <p>TO make Plaster that it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a long time, and not crack; you must take Care to lay it on Walls that are very Dry; for if the Walls be Moist, the Plastering being expos'd to the Air, and drying faster than the Walls, will crack.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:61224:36"/>To do this Methodically, it must be laid, Bed after Bed, or Lay after Lay, having a great Care not to lay one Bed till the other be almost dry. The Ancients put six Lays, three of Mortar made of Lime and Sand, and three of Stuck. The first Lays or Beds were always thicker than the last, and they were very careful to make use of no Mortar made either of Sand or Stuck in their Plastring, that had not been a long time beaten and mix'd together; especially the Stuck, which must be beaten and mix'd till it will not stick to the Trowel.</p>
                  <p>They took likewise a great deal of Pains to run several times over and beat the Plaster, which gave it a Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, a Whiteness, and Polish'd it so well, that it shin'd like a Mirror.</p>
                  <p>These Plasterings so made, serve to Paint in <hi>Fresco</hi> upon; for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours being laid upon the Mortar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was dry, pierced it, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied with it; so that the Painting could not be defaced though it were wash'd; which would easily be wash'd off if the Mortar were dry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61224:36"/>They likewise laid these Plasterings upon Partitions of Wood filled with fat Earth, nailing Reeds to them, as we do Laths, and daubing it over with Clay, and then putting on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther row of Reeds across upon the former, and another Bed of fat Earth or Clay, upon which they laid Beds of Mortar and Stuck, as we have said before.</p>
                  <p>For the Plastering of low and moist places, they had a great many other Precautions, especially within the<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</note> House; for as what belonged to the Out-part of the House, they contented themselves to Plaster from the Bottom of the Wall to the height of three Feet, with Cement.</p>
                  <p>But as to the Inward-parts of the House, when the Ground without was higher than the lowermost Floo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; they run up a little narrow Wall against the great one, leaving betwixt the two Walls only the distance of a Channel or Sewer, which they made lower than the Flooring, to receive the Water which might be gather'd against the Walls, and let it run out;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61224:37"/>
and to the End they might hinder the gathering of much Water, by the Vapours which might be enclosed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two Walls, they made towards the top of the little Wall Vents to let it out, and this little Wall was Plastered on the Out-side with Mortar and Stuck, as we have said before.</p>
                  <p>When the Place was too narrow to permit those Counter-Walls to be made within, they put hollow Tiles one upon another against the Wall, and placed and plaster'd them over with Mortar and Stuck. These Tiles which were Pitch'd over within, and were Demi-Channels, let the Water fall down into the Sewer, which sweat from the great Wall, and so let all the Vapours, which were engendred by Humidity, go out at the Vents.</p>

                     </note> the Architect ought to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is the Convenience of the place where he would Build the Fabrick. This is the reason that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates</hi> was blamed by <hi>Alexander,</hi> for having propos'd him an Excellent Design for Building a City in a Barren place, and incapable of Nourishing those who were to Inhabit it.</p>
                  <p>We must then choose a place that is fertile, and hath abundance of every thing; and which hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Rivers and Ports capable of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61224:38"/>
it with all the Product and Commodities of the adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                  <p>The Third thing to be considered is, whether the Air be wholesome; and for this End, we must choose a high situated place, that it may be less Subject to Fogs and Mists; it must be likewise far from all Morasses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Corruption that may be caused by the infectious Breath of Venomous Beasts which commonly are ingendred there, makes the place very unwholsom, unless these Morasses be near the Sea, and situated high, that the Water may fall easily from them into the Sea, and that the Sea may likewise sometimes overflow them, and by its Saltness kill all the Veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Beasts.</p>
                  <p>It is likewise to be remark'd, That a City situated upon the Sea, must needs have an unwholsom Air, if it be towards the South or the West; for generally the Heat weakens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the Cold strengthens them; and so we see by Experience, that those who go out of a Cold Country
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61224:38"/>
into an Hot, have great difficulty to keep themselves in Health; whereas on the contrary, the Inhabitants of Hot Countries who go into Colder, have generally good Health.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients were accustomed to judge of the Quality of the Air, Water and Fruits, which might render a place wholsome by the Constitution of the Bodies of those Beasts which were nourished there, and to this End they consulted their Entrails; for if the Liver was Corrupted, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that the same thing must happen to Men that should Inhabit in that place.</p>

                  <p>AFter having chosen a wholsome place, the Streets must be laid out according to the most Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Aspect of the Heavens, and the

                  <p>The Prospect of Private Mens Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses is made more or less Commodious, by the Openings which are differently made, to receive the Air and the Light ccording to the Quality of the Parts that are in the Fabrick.</p>
                  <p>For the Cellars, Granaries, and generally all places that we wou'd Lock up, or keep any thing in, should<note place="margin">

                  <p>The different Use of the Parts which Compose the Buildings, do likewise require different Situations for the Dining-Rooms in Winter, and the Baths among the Ancients, were always turned to the West, for that Situation made them warmer, because the Sun then shone upon them, about<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.</note> the time they were wont to make use of those Apartments.</p>
                  <p>The Libraries ought to be turned to the rising Sun, because they are generally made use of in the Morning;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61224:39"/>
besides, the Books are not so much damnified in Libraries so situated, as in those which are turned to the South and West, which are subject to Worms and a certain Humidity which engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Moldiness, and consequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys the Books.</p>
                  <p>The Dining-Rooms for the Spring and Autumn, should be turned towards the East, to the end, that being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the great force the Sun hath when it is near Setting, they may be cooler about the time they are to be made use of.</p>
                  <p>The Summer Apartments must be turned to the North, that they may be fresher and cooler.</p>
                  <p>This Situation is likewise very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Closets, which are adorn'd with Pictures for the Light which is always equal, represents the Colours always alike.</p>
                  <p>There must likewise great respect be had to the difference of Climates, for the Excess of Heat and Cold, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire different Situations and Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; for the Houses in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts of the World, ought to

                  <p>THE Disposition or Distribution of Fabricks contributes much to their Convenience, when each thing is so plac'd, that it is in a Proper place for the Use for which the Fabrick is Design'd; and for this reason the Town-House and the Market-Place ought to be in the Middle of the City,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.</note>
unless it happen that there be a Port or a River; for the Market ought not to be far distant from those places where the Merchandize is.</p>
                  <p>The Houses of Private Men, ought to be differently disposed, according to the divers Conditions of those that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61224:40"/>
Dwell in them: For in the Houses of Great Men, the Apartments of the Lord, must not be at the Entry, where ought to be nothing but <hi>Portico's, Courts, Peristyles, Halls,</hi> and <hi>Gardens</hi> to receive the great Number of those who have Business with them, and make their Court to them.</p>
                  <p>The Houses of Merchants ought to have at the Entry their <hi>Shops</hi> and <hi>Magazines,</hi> and all other places where Strangers are to come about their Business.</p>
                  <p>The Country Houses ought to have<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.</note> a different Order and Disposition from those of the City.</p>
                  <p>For the Kitchen ought to be near the Ox-house, so that from their Cratches they may see the Chimney and the rising Sun; for this makes the Oxen more Beautiful, and makes their Hair lie better.</p>
                  <p>The Baths ought likewise to be near the Kitchen, that the Water may be more conveniently heated.</p>
                  <p>The Press ought not to be far from the Kitchen, for that will much facilitate the Service that is necessary
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61224:41"/>
for the Preparation of Olives. If the Press be made of Wooden Beams, it ought to have at least for 16 Foot Breadth, 40 Foot of Length, if there be but one; or 24, if there be 2.</p>
                  <p>Not far from the Press, must the Cellar be plac'd, whose Windows must be turned to the North, because the heat spoils the Wine.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, the Place where the Oil is kept, ought to be turned to the South; to the End, the gentle heat of the Sun may keep the Oil from freezing.</p>
                  <p>The Houses for Sheep and Goats ought to be so large, that each of them may at least have 4 Foot for his place.</p>
                  <p>The Stables must likewise be Built near the House in a warm place, but not turned towards the Chimney; for Horses that often see the Fire, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ill Coated.</p>
                  <p>The Barns and Granaries, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Mills, ought to be at a pretty distance from the House, because of the Danger of Fire.</p>

               <div n="1" type="article">
                  <head>ARTICLE I. In what the Beauty of Building Consists.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BVildings</hi> may have two sorts of Beauty, the one <hi>Positive,</hi> and the other <hi>Arbitrary. Positive Beauty,</hi> is that which necessarily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of her self; <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> is that which doth not necessarily please of her self, but her agreeableness depends upon the Circumstances that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Positive Beauty,</hi> consists in Three principal Things; <hi>viz.</hi> In the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61224:43"/>
of the Relation that the Parts have one to another, which is called <hi>Symmetry,</hi> in the Richness of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, in the Properness, Neatness, and Exactness of the Performance.</p>
                  <p>As to what regards the Relation of the Parts of the Fabrick one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Vitruvius</hi> hath not spoke of it, but only where he prefers the <hi>Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> of Walling before all other sorts of <hi>Masonry,</hi> because of the Uniformity that is in that Figure, and the laying<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</note> of the Stones; As to the Richness of the Materials, he leaves the Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him that is at the Expences of<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> the Building; and he acknowledges that the Beauty of the Performance depends wholly upon the Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousness<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</note> and Industry of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>The second sort of <hi>Beauty,</hi> which only pleases by the Circumstances that accompany it, is of two sorts; The one is called <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and the other <hi>Regularity. Wisdom</hi> consists in the reasonable use of <hi>Positive Beauties,</hi> which result from the use and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ranking of the Parts; for the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61224:44"/>
Perfection of which, to a rich and precious Material, is given an Equal and Uniform Figure, with all the Property and Correctness possible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vitruvius</hi> gives us two Examples of this sort of <hi>Beauty</hi>; The first is, When <hi>Bosses</hi> or <hi>Relievo's</hi> are made to hide the Joynts, putting them directly under the <hi>Bosses</hi> which hide them by their jetting or projecture, for this gives them great Beauty and an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Aspect.</p>
                  <p>The second is, When we consider the Winter-Appartments, that we have a care, that upon the Ceiling there be little or no Carving, and that the Ornaments be not made of Stuck, because it hath a shining white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which will not endure the least nastiness; for it is impossible to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the smoak of the Fire and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles which are lighted in the Winter, from tarnishing the beautiful Colour of the Work to which the Filth will stick, and enter into the Crevises of the Carving, which cannot be wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Regularity</hi> depends upon the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61224:44"/>
Observation of the Laws which are Established for the Proportions of all the Parts of <hi>Architecture,</hi> the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of these Laws extreamly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses those that understand <hi>Architecture,</hi> who love these Proportions for two Reasons.</p>
                  <p>The First is, That they are for the most part founded upon Reason; which requires, for example, that the parts that support and are under, be stronger than those above; as we see in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destalls,</hi> which are broader than the Pillars they support, and they are broader at the bottom than the top.</p>
                  <p>The other Motive is <hi>Prevention,</hi> which is one of the most usual Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the <hi>Beauty</hi> of all things, for even as we love the Fashion of the Cloaths which the Courtiers wear, although this mode have no <hi>Positive Beauty,</hi> but only for the Positive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Persons that wear them; so we are accustomed to love the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of the Members of <hi>Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> rather because of the great Opinion that we have of them that Invented them, than for any <hi>Positive
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61224:45"/>
Beauty</hi> which is found in the Works of the Ancients, where these Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are observ'd; for often these Proportions are against Reason; as we may see in the <hi>Thorus</hi> of the <hi>Ionick Base,</hi> in the <hi>Faces</hi> of <hi>Architraves</hi> and <hi>Chambranles,</hi> or <hi>Door-Cases,</hi> with their <hi>Mouldings,</hi> where the Strong is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Weak, and many other things, which Custom only hath made supportable.</p>
                  <p>These Proportions appertain to Three principal Members, which are <hi>Pillars, Piedements, Chambranles</hi>; the <hi>Pillars</hi> taken Generically, and as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to <hi>Piedements,</hi> and <hi>Chambranles</hi> or <hi>Door-Cases,</hi> have Three parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Pedestal,</hi> the <hi>Pillar,</hi> and the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments.</hi> Every one of these Parts is likewise divided into Three other Parts, for the <hi>Pedestal</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the <hi>Basis,</hi> its <hi>Die</hi> and its <hi>Cornish</hi>; the <hi>Pillar</hi> Comprehends its <hi>Base, Shaft</hi> and <hi>Capital.</hi> The <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> consist in the <hi>Architrave, Frise,</hi> and <hi>Corniche.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Piedement</hi> or <hi>Fronton,</hi> has likewise Three Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61224:45"/>
the <hi>Corniches,</hi> and the <hi>Acroteres.</hi> The <hi>Chambranle</hi> or <hi>Door-Case</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of two <hi>Pieds-droits,</hi> or <hi>Piers,</hi> and the <hi>Lintel</hi> which also supports a <hi>Frise,</hi> which has likewise its <hi>Cornich.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Disposition, Form, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Proportions of all the Parts make two things, to which all that is Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in Building hath a Relation, which is <hi>Gender</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gender</hi> depends of the Proportion, which is between the thickness of the <hi>Pillars</hi> and the space betwixt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Order,</hi> doth likewise depend in part upon the Proportion which is between the thickness of the <hi>Pillars,</hi> and their height; but we must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise joyn to this Proportion many other things that appertain to the principal Parts of the <hi>Pillars,</hi> and other Parts which accompany it, such as are the <hi>Gates,</hi> the <hi>Chambranles,</hi> or <hi>Door-Cases</hi>; and other things which are different in different <hi>Orders.</hi>

                  <head>ART. II. Of the Five sorts of Fabricks.</head>
                  <p>THERE are Five sorts of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks; The First is called <hi>Pyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostyle,</hi> viz. where the Pillars are very close one to another, in such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion that there is but from one Pillar to another, the space of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter and half of the Pillar. See the <hi>Fig.</hi> A A. <hi>Tab.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>The Second is called <hi>Systile,</hi> viz. where the Pillars seem to be joyned together, are notwithstanding a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more distant one from another than in the <hi>Pycnostile</hi>; for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>columniation is two Diameters of the Pillars.</p>
                  <p>The Defect that is observ'd in the <hi>Systile</hi> as well as in the <hi>Pycnostile</hi> is, that the Entrance of the Fabricks which are placed in that distance are very narrow: So that <hi>Vitruvius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks that the Ladies as they walk
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61224:46"/>
to the Temple hand in hand, were forced when they came thither to quit one another, because they could not<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</note> go two a Breast between the Pillars. See the Figure B B. Tab. II:</p>
                  <p>The Third is called <hi>Diastyle; viz.</hi> where the Pillars are further distant, the space of the Intercolumniation being three Diameters, and the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience is, that the space is so great, that the <hi>Architraves</hi> which lie upon the two Pillars are in danger of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; because the Ancients made them of one Stone. See Figure C C. Tab. II.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth is called <hi>Areostyle; viz.</hi> where the Pillars are set very thin, there is no certain Proportion, but the distance of one Pillar from another, is much greater than that of <hi>Diastyle</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> and for this reason it can have no <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitrave</hi> but of Wood. See the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure D D. Tab. II.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth is called <hi>Eustyle; viz.</hi> where the Pillars are distant from one another by a more convenient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion than in any of the other kind. The distance consists of two Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61224:47"/>
of the Pillars, and one Fourth part of the Diameter: It has also this in particular, That the Interco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation in the middle is larger than the rest, having three Diameters of the Pillars; for this reason it sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth all others in Beauty, Solidity, and Convenience. See Tab. III.</p>
                  <p>Although the Essentials of these sive Kinds, consist in the Proportion that is between the Diameter of the Pillar, and its Intercolumniation, they are also different by the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is between the Diameter of the Pillar and its height for the <hi>Genders</hi> or sorts, in which the Pillars are close one to another, ought to have the lesser Pillars; and in that kind, where the Pillars are in a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance one from another, they ought to be greater.</p>
                  <p>But it's true, notwithstanding that these Proportions are not always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, and that very often, to the <hi>Ionick</hi> and <hi>Corinthian</hi> Pillars, which are the smallest of all, Intercolumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are given, whichp are proper to those of the <hi>Thuscan Order,</hi> where<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.</note> the Pillars are the greatest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:61224:47"/>But the Ordinary Practice is, to give to the Pillars of the <hi>Areostyle</hi> kind, the Magnitude of the 8th part<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> of their height.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Diastyle</hi> and <hi>Eustyle,</hi> the height is divided into Eight parts and an half, to give one to the breadth.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Systyle</hi> Kind, the Height is divided into Nine parts and an half, and one is given to the thickness.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Picnostyle,</hi> the thickness of the Pillar is the 10th part of the height, the reason of these different Proportions is founded upon this, that these Pillars do seem to lose of their thickness according as they are in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion great or long; and it's like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for this Reason, that it is thought convenient to have the Pillars in the Corners thicker by a 50th part.

                  <p>These Orders were Invented to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Design that might be had of making Fabricks more or less Massy, and more or less adorn'd, for the Distinction of these Orders consists in two things, that as the <hi>Thuscan</hi> and <hi>Dorick</hi> Order are more massy and less adorn'd, so the <hi>Corinthian</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound</hi> are Slenderer and Richer, the <hi>Ionick</hi> holds the Middle, as well in its Proportions, as its Ornaments, being less massy and more adorn'd than the <hi>Thuscan</hi> and the <hi>Dorick,</hi> and more massy and less adorn'd than the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound</hi> and the <hi>Corinthian.</hi>

                  <head>ART. IV. Of Things that are Common to several Orders.</head>
                  <p>BEfore we treat of the Differences of these Five Orders, it would be proper to speak of those Things that are common to several Orders; as are the <hi>Steps, Pedestals,</hi> the <hi>Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pillars,</hi> their <hi>Channelling, Piede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Cornices,</hi> and <hi>Acroteres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Steps</hi> which are before the Temple, ought always to be of an unequal Number, to the end, that having put the right Foot in mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</note> the first <hi>Step,</hi> it may likewise be upon the last.</p>
                  <p>They ought not to be more than 6 Inches 10 Lines high, nor less than 6 inches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:61224:49"/>Their breadth ought to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to their height, and this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion ought to be of 3 to 4; so that if the <hi>Steps</hi> be 6 parts high, which is 3 times 2, they must be 8 broad,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> which is 4 times 2; following the Proportion of a Triangular Rectangle invented by <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Landing-places ought not to be narrower than 16 Inches and an half, nor broader than 22 Inches, and all the <hi>Steps</hi> that are round about a<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</note> Fabrick should be all of the same breadth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pedestals</hi> which support many Pillars of the same Rank, will be much handsomer if one make them jet out before every Pillar like a Joynt-Stool; for otherwise, if the <hi>Bases</hi> were all of one size, they would resemble a Channel.</p>
                  <p>If Leaning-places, or Elbow-places are to be betwixt the <hi>Pedestals,</hi> it's necessary that they be as high as the <hi>Pedestals,</hi> and that the <hi>Cornices</hi> of the <hi>Pedestals,</hi> and of the Leaning or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow-places be equal, and have a true Proportion one to another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:61224:49"/>All the Pillars ought to go dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing towards the top, to augment their Strength, and render them more Beautiful, imitating the Bodies of<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</note> Trees, which are greater at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom than at the Top. But this <hi>Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution</hi> must be lesser in the great Pillars which have their highest part further from the Sight, and which by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence makes them at the top seem lesser, according to the ordinary Effect of Perspective; which always dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth Objects according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> that they are distant from the Eye.</p>
                  <p>The Rule of this different <hi>Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is, that a Pillar that is 15 Foot high, ought to have in the upper part 5 parts of 6 in the which the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Base</hi> of the Pillar is divided; that which is from 15 to 20 Foot, ought to have 5 and an half of the 6 and an half of the Diameter; that which is from 20 to 30, ought to have 6 of the 7 parts of the Diameter; that which is from 30 to 40, must have 6 and an half of 7 and an half of the Diameter; that which is from 40 to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61224:50"/>
50, must have 7 of 8 of the Diameter. These <hi>Diminutions</hi> do not belong to the <hi>Thuscan Order,</hi> whose Pillars are much more diminished; as we shall show hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Besides this <hi>Diminution</hi> which is made towards the top of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, there is another below, which makes the Pillar about the middle swell like a Belly; the measure of this swelling is taken from the magnitude of this<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</note> which makes up the Distance between the <hi>Channels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another sort of <hi>Diminution of Pillars,</hi> which is made of one Pillar in respect of another; It is of 2 sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> when a second rank is placed upon the first, for then the second Pillar must be lesser a fourth part than those below, or when <hi>Portico's</hi> are made that have Pillars in the Corners, for those in the middle must be less than<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> those in the Corners, a 50th part.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Channellings</hi> are so called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are as it were <hi>Demi-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,</hi> which descend from the top of the Pillar to the bottom; they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the Plaites of the Garments

                  </p>
                  <p>There are three sorts of <hi>Channel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> the two first are particular and proper to the <hi>Dorick Order</hi>; the third is common to the <hi>Ionick, Corinthian</hi> and <hi>Compound:</hi> The two first are more plain and simple, and fewer in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</note> than the others.</p>
                  <p>The most Simple is that which is not hollowed at all, and which hath only <hi>Pans</hi> and slat Fronts or Faces.</p>
                  <p>The other is a little hollowed; to make this hollowness, a Square must be made, whose Side must be equal to the <hi>Pan,</hi> in which the <hi>Channelling</hi> is to be made, and having put one foot of the Compass in the middle of the Square, make a crooked Line<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</note> from one Angle of the <hi>Channelling</hi> to the other, both these <hi>Channellings</hi> are made up to the number of Twenty.</p>
                  <p>The other Orders have 24, and sometimes 32, when it is design'd to make the Pillars seem greater than they are; for the Eye judgeth that all things are greater when they have<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</note> more and different Marks, which

                  <p>These <hi>Channellings</hi> are deeper than those of the <hi>Dorick Order,</hi> and the depth ought to be just so much, that a Carpenter's Rule being put into the Cavity, touch with its Angle the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and with its sides the two Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the <hi>Channelling. Vitruvius</hi> hath not taught us what the Proportions of the <hi>Channelling</hi> should be, in respect of the <hi>Fillet</hi> which makes up the space between the <hi>Channellings,</hi> nor what the breadth of the <hi>Fillet</hi> should be, which he hath establish'd for the rule of the swelling Belly of the Pillar.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Piedement</hi> is composed of a <hi>Tympan</hi> and <hi>Cornices</hi>; to have the true height of the <hi>Tympan,</hi> we must divide the breadth which is between the two ends of the <hi>Cymatium</hi> of the <hi>Larmier,</hi> or <hi>Drip</hi> which supports the <hi>Piedement,</hi> into 9 parts, and give one to the <hi>Tympan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thickness of the <hi>Cornice</hi> being added to this 9th part, makes up the height of the whole <hi>Piedement</hi> or <hi>Fronton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61224:51"/>The <hi>Tympan</hi> ought to be Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular upon the <hi>Gorge</hi> of the Pillar, the things that are common to all <hi>Corni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> are, that the <hi>Cornice</hi> of the <hi>Piede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> must be equal to that below, excepting the last great <hi>Cymatium,</hi> which ought not to be upon the <hi>Cornice</hi> below the <hi>Piedement,</hi> but it ought to go over the <hi>Cornices</hi> which are sloping upon the <hi>Piedement</hi> or <hi>Fronton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This great <hi>Cymatium</hi> ought to have of height an 8th part more than the <hi>Crown,</hi> or <hi>Drip,</hi> or <hi>Larmier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In places where there are no <hi>Piede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> in the great <hi>Cymatiums</hi> of the <hi>Cornices,</hi> must be cut the Heads of Lions, at such a distance, that there must be one directly upon every Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that the other answer directly upon the great <hi>Dalles,</hi> that cover the House. These Heads of Lions are pierced through to convey the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which falls from the Roof upon the <hi>Cornice</hi>: The Heads of the Lions which are not directly upon the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, ought not to be pierced, to the end the Water may flow with the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61224:52"/>
greater impetuosity through those which are directly upon the Pillars, and that it may not fall between the Pillars upon those who are to go into the <hi>Portico's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> in their great Buildings never put any <hi>Dentels</hi> under the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillons,</hi> because the <hi>Rafters</hi> could not be under the <hi>Forces,</hi> or <hi>Sheers,</hi> and it is a great fault that That, which according to the true Rules of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to be placed above, should be placed under in the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>For this Reason, the Ancients ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver approved of <hi>Modillons</hi> in the <hi>Piedements,</hi> nor of <hi>Dentels,</hi> but only simple <hi>Cornices</hi>; for neither the <hi>Forces, Sheers,</hi> nor the <hi>Rasters</hi> can be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in the <hi>Piedements,</hi> out of which they cannot jet but only directly out of the Eaves of the House upon which they lie sloping.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Acroteres</hi> are three <hi>Pedestals,</hi> which are upon the Corners and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the <hi>Piedement</hi> to support Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; those of the Corner ought to be as high as the Middle of the

                     <hi>Tympan</hi>; but the <hi>Acrotere</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ought to be higher by an 8th part than the other.</p>
                  <p>All the Members or Parts which shall be placed upon the Capitals of Pillars, <hi>viz. Architraves, Frises, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nices, Tympans,</hi> and <hi>Acroteres,</hi> should encline forward the 12th part of their height.</p>
                  <p>There is likewise another General Rule; which is, that all the parts that jet out, should have their Projecture equal to their Height.</p>

                  <p>The breadth of the <hi>Ionick Base</hi> is the Diameter of the Pillar, to which is added a 4th. and an 8th. part; its height is half the Diameter; its height being divided into three parts, one is allowed for the <hi>Plinthus,</hi> the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided into seven parts, three are allowed to the <hi>Torus</hi> above, after equally dividing the four which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, the two above are for the upper <hi>Scotia,</hi> with its <hi>Astragal</hi>: The two below are for the lower <hi>Scotia,</hi> which will appear greater than the upper, because it extends to the edge of the <hi>Plinthus,</hi> the <hi>Astragals</hi> must have the 8th. part of the <hi>Scotia,</hi> whose Jetting or Projecture must be the 8th. part of the whole <hi>Base</hi> joyned to the 6th. part of the Diameter of the Pillar.

ought to be the height of the <hi>Capital,</hi> comprizing the Round of the <hi>Volute</hi> or <hi>Scroll,</hi> but there must be substracted from the corner of the <hi>Abacus</hi> a 12th. part and an half of the height of the <hi>Capital,</hi> and after the whole thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Capital</hi> must be divided into nine parts and an half, and one and an half must be left for the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Abacus,</hi> that the <hi>Volutes</hi> or <hi>Scrolls</hi> may be made of the eight which remain; then having left under the <hi>Abacus</hi> four parts and an half of these eight, a Line must be drawn in the place which cuts the two a-cross and the Points of the Section shall be <hi>Eyes,</hi> which shall have eight parts for their Diameter; in half the space of the <hi>Eye</hi> shall be placed the Centers through which shall be drawn with a Compass the Spiral-Line of the <hi>Volate,</hi> beginning the height under the <hi>Abacus,</hi> and going into the four Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Division, diminishing till we come directly to the first Quarter, and giving to every Quarter a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Center.</p>

those that are greater require other, and generally the greater Proportions are required for the Pillars that are greater; and for this reason we have said, that the higher the Pillars are, the less Diminution they must have; so when the Pillars are above 15 Foot, we must add a 9th. part to the Diameter of the Pillar for to give the breadth to the <hi>Abacus</hi>; to which is never added more than an 18th. part to Pillars of 15 Foot.</p>

                  <p>The height ought to be different, according to the proportion of the height of the Pillar; for if the Pillar be from 12 to 15 Foot, we must allow the <hi>Architrave</hi> the height of half a Diameter of the bottom of the Pillar, if it be from 15 to 20, we must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the height of the Pillar into 15 parts, to the end we may allow one to the <hi>Architrave</hi>; so if it be from 20

                  </p>
                  <p>The rest being divided into 12 parts; three must be allowed to the first <hi>Face,</hi> four to the second, and five to that above, upon which is the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matium.</hi>

                  <p>The Disposition and Figures of the Ramparts were so ordered, that the Towers advanced out of the Walls to the end, that when the Enemy approached them, the Besieged which were in the Towers, might fall upon their Flank, both on the Right and the Left.</p>
                  <p>They took likewise great Care to make the Approaches to the Walls difficult, ordering their Ways so, that they came not directly, but to the Left of the Gate. For by this means, the Besiegers were constrained to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to them that were upon the Walls the Right side, which was not covered with a Buckler.</p>
                  <p>The Figure of a <hi>strong</hi> place ought neither to be Square, nor composed of Angles that advance too far. But the Ancients made them with many Sinuosities or Corners, for Angles that are too far advanc'd, are more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous for the Besiegers, than the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:61224:63"/>The thickness of the Wall was so ordered, that two Armed Men might walk by one another upon the Wall without justling.</p>
                  <p>They made their Walls strong and durable, with sindged Beams of Olive, which bound them and kept them up.</p>
                  <p>Although there be nothing that makes the Ramparts so strong as Earth, they had not for all that the Custom of making Terrasses, unless it were in some place where some Eminency was so near the Wall, that the Besiegers might easily enter.</p>
                  <p>To make the Terrasses strong, and to hinder the Earth from pushing down the two Walls that supported it, they made Buttresses or Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which went from one Wall to another, to the end, that the Earth being divided into many parts, might not have that weight to push the Walls.</p>
                  <p>Their Towers were round, for those that are square are easily ruin'd by their War-like Engines, and their Battering easily broke down the Corners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:61224:64"/>Directly against the Tower, the Wall was cut off within the breadth of the Tower, and the Walls so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted were only joyned with Joyces, which were not nailed down; to the end, that if the Enemy made themselves Masters of some part of the Wall, the Besieged might take up this Bridge made of Joists, and hinder their further advance.</p>

                  <p>THE second Sort of Publick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks, which are those that belong to Religion are the <hi>Temples,</hi> which among the Ancients were of two Sorts; some were after the <hi>Greek,</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Temples</hi> after the <hi>Tuscan</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion were Square, the <hi>Greeks</hi> made them sometimes Round, sometimes Square; in the Square <hi>Temples</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> there are three Things to be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61224:64"/>
considered, <hi>viz.</hi> The Parts that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, the Proportion of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and its <hi>Aspect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Parts of the Square <hi>Temples,</hi> were for the most part Five; for they had almost every one of them a Porch before the Temple called <hi>Pronaos,</hi> and another Porch behind the <hi>Temple,</hi> called <hi>Posticum,</hi> or <hi>Opisthedomos,</hi> the middle of the <hi>Temple,</hi> called <hi>Cella,</hi> or <hi>Sacos</hi>; the <hi>Portico's</hi> or <hi>Isles,</hi> and the <hi>Gate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Porch was a place covered at the Entrance at the greatest part of <hi>Temples,</hi> being as broad as the whole <hi>Temple.</hi> There were three sorts of them. Some were surrounded with Pillars on three Sides; Others had only Pillars in the Front, the Sides of the Porch being made up by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the Side-Walls of the <hi>Temple</hi>; Others were made up at the Sides, partly by Pillars, and partly by the Continuation of the Side-Walls of the <hi>Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Posticum</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the Porch, having likewise a Gate, but all Temples had not <hi>Posti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cums,</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:61224:65"/>
though almost every <hi>Temple</hi> had its <hi>Pronaos,</hi> or Porch.</p>
                  <p>The Middle of the <hi>Temple,</hi> called <hi>Cella,</hi> was a place inclosed with four Walls, having no Light but at the Gate, unless it were uncovered, as we shall shew hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portico's</hi> which make the Isles, were ranks of Pillars, sometimes sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, sometimes double, which stood along the Sides of the <hi>Temple</hi> on the out-side: some <hi>Temples</hi> wanted this part.</p>
                  <p>The Gates of the <hi>Temples</hi> were diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent according to the difference of the Order of the Architecture, according to which the <hi>Temple</hi> was built: there was the <hi>Dorick,</hi> the <hi>Ionick,</hi> and the <hi>Attick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The height of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Gate was taken by dividing into 3 parts and an half, the space which is from below to the bottom of the <hi>Plat-fond</hi> of the <hi>Portico,</hi> which <hi>Platfond</hi> was called <hi>Lacunar:</hi> they allow'd 2 to the height of the Gate under the <hi>Lintel:</hi> this height was divided into 12 parts; 5 and an half were taken for the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61224:65"/>
breadth of the Gate below, for above it was straiter by a 3d. part. A 4th. part, and even an 8th. part of the <hi>Chambranle</hi> or <hi>Door-Case,</hi> according to the height of the Gate, which was to be less straitened above, the higher it was. The breadth of the <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branle</hi> or <hi>Door-Case,</hi> was the 12th. part of the height of the Opening of the Gate.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chambranle</hi> or <hi>Door-Case</hi> grew straiter and straiter towards the top, <hi>viz.</hi> the 4th. part of its breadth: it was only edged with a <hi>Cymatium,</hi> with an <hi>Astragal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>Cymatium</hi> above the <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branle</hi> or <hi>Door-Case,</hi> was a <hi>Frise</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hyperthyron,</hi> which had the same breadth with the <hi>Chambranle</hi> or <hi>Door-Case.</hi> Upon this <hi>Frise</hi> was placed a <hi>Dorick Cymatium,</hi> with a <hi>Lesbian Astragal</hi>; both of them jetting out very little.</p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>Moulures</hi> the <hi>Flat-Crown</hi> was placed, with its little <hi>Cymatium,</hi> which jetted out the whole breadth above of the <hi>Chambranle</hi> or <hi>Door-Case,</hi> with its Mould.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:61224:66"/>The height of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Gates was taken as those of the <hi>Dorick</hi>; but to have the right breadth, they divided the height into 2 parts and an half: To allow them one and an half below, it was straitned at the top, as the <hi>Dorick</hi> Gate was; the breadth of the <hi>Chambranle</hi> was the 14th. part of the height of the Opening of the Gate; this breadth of the <hi>Chambranle,</hi> or <hi>Door-Case,</hi> being divided into 6, one was allowed for the <hi>Cymatium,</hi> the rest being divided into 12, 3 were allowed to the 1st. Face comprising its <hi>Astragal,</hi> 4 to the 2d. and 5 to the 3d.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Frise</hi> which is called <hi>Hyperthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> was made with the same Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in the <hi>Dorick Order.</hi> The <hi>Consoles</hi> or <hi>Shouldering-Pieces,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended directly to the bottom of the <hi>Chambranle</hi> or <hi>Door-Case,</hi> without comprizing the <hi>Foliage</hi> or <hi>Leaf-work</hi> that they had at the bottom: The breadth above was the 3d. part of that of the <hi>Chambranle</hi> or <hi>Door-Case,</hi> and at the bottom they grew straiter by a 4th. part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:61224:66"/>The <hi>Attick</hi> were like the <hi>Dorick,</hi> but their <hi>Chambranles</hi> or <hi>Door-Cases</hi> had only a <hi>Plat-band</hi> under the <hi>Cyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> and this <hi>Plat-band</hi> or <hi>Face,</hi> had only the breadth of 2 parts in 7, into which was divided all the rest of the <hi>Chambranle</hi> or <hi>Door-Case</hi> with its <hi>Mouldings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Proportion of the <hi>Temples</hi> was so ordered, that they were twice as long as broad, but it is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood precisely, but only of <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> that were without <hi>Pillars,</hi> whose length was divided into 8, and 4 were<note place="margin">

                  <p>The <hi>Temples</hi> which had <hi>Pillars</hi> round about, could not have this double Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; for as much as the length had only the double of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>columniations, and by consequence a<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Aspect</hi> of the <hi>Temples</hi> signifies two things in <hi>Vitruvius, viz.</hi> The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the parts of the <hi>Temple,</hi> in respect of one another, and the Disposition in respect of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:61224:67"/>As to what regards the Disposition of the <hi>Temple</hi> in respect of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Ancients always observed to turn them toward the Sun-rising, if the place were not ill-disposed for it, and that some great Street obliged them to turn it otherwise.</p>
                  <p>As to what belongs to the Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Porch, Porticum, Isles</hi> or <hi>Oiles</hi> within the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> and the <hi>Gates,</hi> it was different in the <hi>Temples</hi> which were without <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> and in those which had <hi>Pillars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Temples</hi> without <hi>Pillars,</hi> were those that were not 20 Foot broad, the length of these <hi>Temples</hi> being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into 8, 4 were allowed for the<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Temples</hi> which had <hi>Pillars</hi> were of 8 sorts; The 1st. and the most Simple, was that which was called <hi>Ad Antes,</hi> because in this sort of <hi>Temples,</hi> there were only 2 <hi>Pillars</hi> in<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</note> the Face or Front before, betwixt 2 <hi>Antes.</hi> There was 3 sorts of these <hi>Temples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The First and the most Simple, had
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61224:67"/>
2 <hi>Pillars</hi> before the Face of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> at whose Corners there were 2 <hi>Antes,</hi> and the 2 <hi>Pillars</hi> supported a <hi>Piedement</hi> or <hi>Fronton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second Sort had likewise but 2 <hi>Pillars,</hi> but they were between 2 <hi>Antes</hi> upon the same Line with the <hi>Antes</hi>; and these <hi>Antes</hi> with the 2 <hi>Pillars,</hi> made up the <hi>Face</hi> of the <hi>Porch</hi> of the <hi>Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third Sort was, when betwixt 2 <hi>Pillars</hi> which were at the <hi>Face</hi> before, which made up the <hi>Porch,</hi> there were likewise 2 others within the <hi>Porch</hi>; these <hi>Pillars</hi> within, were not so thick as those without, although they were of an equal height; but to the end they might seem as thick as those without, they made more <hi>Channellings,</hi> for the most part 28 or 32, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing those without had 24; this was done to get more room within the <hi>Porch.</hi> These <hi>Temples</hi> had also this particular to themselves, that the Front of the <hi>Porch</hi> was closed with Partitions of <hi>Marble</hi> or <hi>Joyner's Work,</hi> which ran from the <hi>Ante</hi> of one of the Corners to its neighbouring <hi>Pillar,</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:61224:68"/>
and from this <hi>Ante</hi> to the other <hi>Pillar,</hi> and from this <hi>Pillar</hi> to the other <hi>Ante.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second Sort of <hi>Temples,</hi> with <hi>Pillars,</hi> was called <hi>Prostyle</hi>; which differ'd not from the first, but in this, that besides the 2 <hi>Pillars</hi> of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Ad Antes,</hi> there were two others directly on the Angular <hi>Antes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third Sort was called <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prostyle</hi>; because it had <hi>Pillars</hi> as well behind as before.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Sort was the <hi>Periptere,</hi> which in the Front, as well as behind, had 6 <hi>Pillars,</hi> and 12 on every side, counting those of the Corners: the distance which was between the <hi>Pillars</hi> and the <hi>Walls,</hi> was equal to that which was between the <hi>Pillars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fifth, the <hi>Pseud-diptere,</hi> viz. <hi>False Diptere,</hi> it had 8 <hi>Pillars</hi> in the <hi>Front,</hi> and as many behind, and 15 on every side, counting those of the Corners: the <hi>Pillars</hi> were distant from the Wall, the space of 2 Interco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations, and the thickness of a <hi>Pillar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sixth Sort was the <hi>Diptere,</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:61224:68"/>
which had 8 <hi>Pillars</hi> before and behind, and 2 rows round about.</p>
                  <p>The Seventh Sort was called <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pethre,</hi> because the inner part of the <hi>Temple</hi> was uncovered, it had 10 <hi>Pillars</hi> before and behind; and as to the rest, it was like the <hi>Diptere,</hi> but in this particular to it self, that all about it had two Orders of <hi>Pillars,</hi> at a little distance from the Wall, to make <hi>Portico's,</hi> as in the <hi>Peristyles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Eighth was called <hi>Pseudo-Perip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere</hi> or <hi>False Periptere</hi>; for the Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the <hi>Pillars</hi> was equal to that of the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the <hi>Periptere</hi>: This <hi>Temple</hi> having 6 <hi>Pillars</hi> in the <hi>Front,</hi> and behind, and 11 in the <hi>Isles</hi> or <hi>Wings</hi>; but the Disposition of the Walls of the <hi>Temple</hi> was different in this, that they extended even to the <hi>Pillars,</hi> which made no <hi>Portico,</hi> for they were joyned to the Walls, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept those of the <hi>Porch</hi> which were insulated, or stood alone like Islands.</p>
                  <p>The Round <hi>Temples</hi> were of 2 sorts; The first were called <hi>Monopteres,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had no Walls, having only an <hi>Isle</hi> or <hi>Wing</hi>; viz. <hi>Pillars</hi> which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61224:69"/>
supported a <hi>Coupe.</hi> Their Proportion was, that dividing the whole <hi>Temple</hi> into three, one part was allowed for the <hi>Steps</hi> upon which the <hi>Pillars</hi> were placed, which had their height equal to the distance that there was from one <hi>Pillar,</hi> to that which was Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically opposite to it.</p>
                  <p>The Second Sort which was called <hi>Periptere,</hi> had <hi>Pillars</hi> upon their <hi>Basis</hi> round about the <hi>Temple,</hi> the space that was between the <hi>Basis</hi> and the <hi>Wall</hi> was the 5th. part of the whole <hi>Temple,</hi> and the Diameter of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> within, was equal to the height of the <hi>Pillar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Temples</hi> after the <hi>Tuscan</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion were square, having 5 parts in length and 4 in breadth; the <hi>Porch</hi> which was as great as the rest of the <hi>Temple,</hi> had 4 <hi>Pillars</hi> in the <hi>Front</hi>; the Sides were closed half by the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the Walls of the <hi>Temple,</hi> half by 2 <hi>Angular Pillars</hi>; and there were likewise 2 <hi>Pillars</hi> in the middle of the <hi>Porch</hi>: The <hi>Temple</hi> had 2 <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels</hi> within on each Side.</p>
                  <p>We find that the Ancients had 14
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61224:69"/>
Sorts of <hi>Temples,</hi> viz. 1. The Temple without <hi>Pillars.</hi> 2. The Temple <hi>ad Antes</hi> Simply. 3. The Temple <hi>ad Antes,</hi> with 2 <hi>Pillars</hi> upon the same Line with the <hi>Antes.</hi> 4. The Temple <hi>ad Antes,</hi> with <hi>Pillars</hi> of an unequal Magnitude. 5. The <hi>Prostyle.</hi> 6. The <hi>Amphiprostyle.</hi> 7. The <hi>Pertptere.</hi> 8. The <hi>Pseudo-diptere.</hi> 9. The <hi>Diptere.</hi> 10. The <hi>Hypethre.</hi> 11.

                  <p>There was likewise a Second rank of Pillars upon the Wings, which made high Galleries, and these Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond rank of Pillars were placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Pedestal</hi> in the form of a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, high enough to hinder those that were in the high Galleries from being seen by those that were below.</p>
                  <p>At the End of every <hi>Basilica,</hi> there was a high and great Hall called <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiques,</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:61224:70"/>
which were joyned one to another by high Galleries: they served the Spectators while Justice was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Theaters</hi> were composed of three parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The Steps or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which were instead of Seats for the Spectators: they were disposed in a Semi-circle, and they closed a void space in the middle and at the bottom of the whole <hi>Theater,</hi> which was called the <hi>Orchestra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Orchestra</hi> was made in the <hi>Graecian Theatre,</hi> to Dance the Ballets. The Senators were placed in that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> because the Ballets were<note place="margin">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61224:71"/>
The Steps or Degrees were 14 or 15 Inches high, and from 28 to 30 broad.</p>
                  <p>Under the Degrees, above every <hi>Palliere,</hi> there were in the great <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> 13 <hi>Chambers,</hi> in which were Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of Brass, set to several Tunes, or Tones; which by their Echo aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Voice of the Players. The Scene or Stage, was composed of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> the <hi>Proscenium</hi> and the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenium.</hi> The <hi>Pulpit</hi> was the place where the Actors played: it was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not above five Foot at the most above the <hi>Orchestra,</hi> or <hi>Pit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proscenium</hi> was the Front of the Stage, which was adorned with Pillars of several sorts one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. These Orders were so propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that the second was a fourth part lesser than the first. The third diminishing according to the same Proportion.</p>
                  <p>The Front had three Gates, that in the middle which was the greatest was called the <hi>Royal Gate,</hi> the two others were called the <hi>Gates of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These three Gates were closed

with Machines, made in a Triangle, and composed of three Fronts or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces well Painted, to represent Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Perspective; they served for<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Parascenium</hi> or <hi>Postscenium</hi> was the hinder part of the <hi>Theater,</hi> and the place whither the Actors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired and dressed themselves, and had their Rehearsals, and where the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines were kept. Near the <hi>Theaters,</hi> were Publick Walks, in length a <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> which is about 90 <hi>Perches.</hi> There were Trees planted, and round about it were double <hi>Portico's,</hi> which were every one as broad as the Pillars on the out-side were high; for those within were higher by a fifth part, than those without, and they were likewise of a different <hi>Order</hi>; for those without were of the <hi>Dorick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:61224:72"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Ancients built their <hi>Ports</hi> in two manners; at those which were <hi>Natural,</hi> they only made <hi>Portico's</hi> round about with <hi>Magazines</hi> and <hi>Towers</hi> at the Ends, for to shut the <hi>Port</hi> with a<note place="margin">

                  <p>Those which were <hi>Artificial,</hi> were built three several ways: The first was to make Partitions of Wood only, without emptying the Water which was within the Partitions, and they cast into the Partitions, Stone and Mortar made with <hi>Pozzolana,</hi> thrown in hand over head; for they were certain that this Mortar wou'd grow dry in the bottom of the Water. The second Way was by making Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions with ordinary Clay, or fat Earth at the bottom of the Sea, after the Water had been emptied out by Pumps. The third Way was to build a Mole upon the Sea-Coast, and to cast it in when the <hi>Mason's</hi> Work was sufficiently dry, which only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired two Months time. That they might the better throw these Moles
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61224:72"/>
into the Sea, they built them half upon the Sea-Coast, and half upon an heap of Sand which they made close to the Sea-Coast; to the end, that this Sand which was stopped by nothing but by the Walls, built only to support it during the time that the Mole was a drying, might let it fall when the Sea came to carry away the Sand after that the Walls were beaten down.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bathes</hi> of the Ancients con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of many Chambers; some for<note place="margin">

                  <p>Some of the Chambers had a moderate Heat, to warm their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies insensibly, and prepare them for a stronger Heat to make them Sweat.</p>
                  <p>The Chamber they were to Sweat in, was called <hi>Laconicum,</hi> and was round, and Vaulted like the ends of an Oven, pierced at the top with a round Opening, which was opened and shut with a Buckler of Brass, which hung at a Chain, by which means they augmented or diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Heat according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61224:73"/>
that they pull'd up, or let down the Buckler.</p>
                  <p>One and the same Furnace heated both the Air and the Water, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Disposition of the places which were nearer or further from the Furnace, whose heat was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Chambers from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Flooring, which was made full of little holes.</p>
                  <p>The Water was likewise diversly tempered by the different situation of three great Vessels of Brass, whose Water went from one into another, and there were Pipes that conveyed these three sorts of Water into the <hi>Bath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Academies</hi> of the Ancients, which they called <hi>Palaestra,</hi> was a place where the Youth learned Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and their Exercises. They were composed of three parts, <hi>viz</hi> Of a <hi>Peristyle,</hi> a <hi>Xyste,</hi> and a <hi>Stadium</hi>; the <hi>Peristyle</hi> was a Court surrounded with <hi>Portico's,</hi> which were of two sorts; three of them were Simple, and one Double.</p>
                  <p>The Simple stood in a row against
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61224:73"/>
three Bodies of Lodgings, composed of many great Halls, where the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers had their Disputes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
                  <p>The Bodies of the Lodgings, which was the length of the double <hi>Portico,</hi> and one part of the Bodies of Lodgings which turned in, were distributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several parts, for the Studies and Exercises of Youth; for there they had their <hi>Classes,</hi> their <hi>Baths,</hi> their <hi>Stoves,</hi> and their <hi>Tenis-Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Xyste</hi> was a place planted with Trees, and surrounded with <hi>Portico's</hi> on every side: These <hi>Portico's</hi> were of two sorts.</p>
                  <p>There was one double which was set against the Bodies of the Lodgings, to which the double <hi>Portico</hi> of the <hi>Peristyle</hi> was joyned.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Simple Portico's</hi> had two Wings, under these <hi>Simple Portico's</hi> there were hollow Ways, where they performed their Exercises; the rest of the <hi>Portico</hi> was raised to the right and the left, for those that had a mind to Walk while the rest performed their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, in the hollow ways.</p>

                  <p>These Courts made with Jettings, were of four sorts; The first was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Tuscan,</hi> this Court was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a Jetting <hi>en auvent,</hi> which was laid upon four Beams, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by other standing Beams pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Corners.</p>

                  <p>THE Houses of the Ancients had <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Magnificent Entries,</hi> they were sometimes 15 Perches long and 9 broad, and they were supported upon two ranks of Pillars, which made a Wing on each Side, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their breadth and length was taken three Ways. The first was, when having divided the length into 5, 3 were allowed for the breadth. The second was, when having divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it into 3, 2 were allowed for the breadth. The third was, when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made an Equilateral Square, the Diagonal of this Square was taken for the length, and the Side for the breadth.</p>
                  <p>The height was equal to the length, taken from the Pavement below, to the bottom of the <hi>Plat-Fonds</hi> or <hi>Flat-Roof,</hi> which was hollowed on the

                  <p>The Proportion that the <hi>Alley</hi> which was in the middle between the Pillars, had with the Wings, was different according to the Magnitude of the <hi>Vestibule</hi> or <hi>Entry,</hi> for the greater they were or the lesser, the Wings had a proportionable breadth with the <hi>Alley</hi> in the middle; So that if the <hi>Vestibule</hi> or <hi>Entry</hi> was 100 Foot long, the Wings had only for their breadth the 50th. part of the length; and when it was but 30 Foot long, they had only the 3d. part.</p>

                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.</note> they had three sorts of Machines. The first was composed of three pieces of Wood, which were joyned together at top by a Pin which went through them all; so that there were two of these pieces which were on one side, a little distance one from the other, and the third was opposite to them; The two which were together on the one side, had a Hand-Mill which drew a Rope, which passed within a Truckle with three Pullies, of which that part which had the two Pullies was fastned to the top of the <hi>Machine,</hi> and that which had but one, was fastned to the Weight to be drawn up.</p>
                  <p>The second <hi>Machine</hi> was stronger<note place="margin">

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61224:80"/>
the Wheel there was another Rope twisted, which was drawn by a Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass; sometimes the great Wheel was hollow, so that Men could walk within it, and so turn it.</p>
                  <p>The third had but one long and strong piece of Wood, which was kept up and stayed by Shrowds, as the Mast of a Ship is. By the help of these Shrowds, they bended and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this piece of Wood where they pleased, drawing the Shrowds fast on the one side and loosening them on the other. The <hi>Mouft's</hi> Crane as well those which were fastned to this piece of Wood, as those which were fastned to the VVeight which was to be drawn up, had each of them three ranks of Pullies, which had three in every rank, that three Ropes might go through them, which were not drawn by Hand-Mills, nor by VVheels, but by Men who pulled seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral at one time at the same Rope: And that this might be done with the more ease, the three Ropes or Cables after having passed the last Pullies of that part of the Moufte which was at

the top of the <hi>Machine</hi>; they descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded down below, each upon one Pully, which vvas but the height of the Men: this <hi>Machine</hi> quickly povverfully lifted up the greatest VVeights.</p>

                  <p>THESE <hi>Machines</hi> were of four sorts.</p>
                  <p>The first was the <hi>Tympan,</hi> of which<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 10.</note> there were two sorts; The first ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated a great deal of Water, but not very high, for it only mounted to the Axle-tree of the <hi>Tympan,</hi> which was a great Wheel made of Planks which made two bottoms divided into eight from the Center to the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, each Separation, having an opening half a Foot wide near the Circumference to draw the Water, which being elevated upon the Axle-tree, ran through the Cavities which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61224:81"/>
were hollowed in each Separation.</p>
                  <p>The Second <hi>Machine,</hi> was a Wheel which elevated the Water as high as its Circumference, by the help of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Boxes which were fastned round about, and which poured out the Water into a Reeve as the Wheel, having mounted, began to descend.</p>
                  <p>The Third <hi>Machine</hi> was a Chain<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> with Buckets, as the one mounted, the other descended, being drawn by the Axle-tree.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth <hi>Machine</hi> was the Vice or <hi>Skrew,</hi> which is attributed to <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> though <hi>Vitruvius</hi> makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Inventor. This Vice was made of a piece of Wood, long six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times its Diameter: about this piece of Wood was put Obliquely a Hoop of Willow VVood besmeared with Pitch, and it was Conducted by turning from one end of the piece of the Wood to the other: Upon this Hoop others were put so that they were like the Vaulting of a Stair-Case whose ascent goes turning. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, this Vice was fastned and strengthned with Planks, which were
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61224:81"/>
pitched within, and covered with Iron Rings and Plates without: At the two ends of the piece of Wood, were Pins, which entring into the Suckets, made the <hi>Machine</hi> capable of Motion. This Vice or Skrew was placed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the bent or sloping of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle Rectangle of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> This <hi>Machine</hi> elevated easily a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water, but it could not carry it high.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth <hi>Machine,</hi> was the Pump of <hi>Ctesibius</hi>; it was composed of two<note place="margin">

For the VVater by the Impulsion of the Sucket, was forced to enter into these Pipes, because it could not go out by the Openings by which it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, because of the Suckets which stopped them, these two Pipes were joyned together in a <hi>Tambour,</hi> which had likewise its Suckets, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the VVater from descending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <p>The <hi>Catapulta,</hi> lanced Javelins or Javelots, from 12 to 15 Foot in length, they were made of two Trees, set one against another, like the Masts of a Ship, which were bended in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with a Hand-Mill. These Trees being on a suddain unbent, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously struck together, and forced violently the Javelin. They were bent the one after the other by the same Cord, which was made of Guts, to the end, that the Master who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the Engine, might be assured, that the two Trees or Beams were equally bent.

There was a Cylinder which traversed an excentrical piece, by the help of which they heightned, or let down the End of one of the Beams below, according as the Master of the <hi>Machine</hi> judged it necessary, for the augmenting or diminishing their bent, which was known by the sound of the Cord, which was alike in both, when they were equally bent.

            <p>ABridgments of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> have been formerly printed, but none of them have followed the design which <hi>Philebert de l'Orme</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in his Third Book: He desires that in abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Vitruvius</hi> the matters which this Author treats of confusedly should be put into order, and that the things belonging to the same Subject, which are found dispersed in divers places, should be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted together into one Chapter. This Method, which the most part of the eminent Writers have neglected, has been carefully observed in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, it serving very much to the better appeehending and retaining the things treated of. We have been exact to put in nothing that is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> to which end the <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Works <hi>are</hi> all along quoted in the Margin; nothing being added, but some few lines here and there, to continue the Discourse, and render it more clear: Notwithstanding which precautions, some things may possibly still remain obscure, in which case the Reader must have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the whole Works of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> where he will find all necessary Explanation.</p>
            <p>This little Treatise is not only necessary for those who begin the study of Architecture, but will be also of great use to even Masters themselves; for it is not to be doubted, that <hi>Vitruvius</hi> being so great a Master in this Art, his Authority, together with that of all the Ancients, which is included in his Works, must be capable of instructing the <hi>Apprentices,</hi> and confirming the Masters, and thereby establish the good Maxims and certain Rules of Architecture.</p>

            <p>THis Abridgment having been very well received in French, we have ventured to put it in English, and doubt not but it will be as acceptable to our Nation, who are allowed to be as competent Judges of this Art as any. The Translation is very exact; the Cutts altogether as well, if not better, than in the French; and in the Table of the Explication of the Terms used in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, we have added the Etymology and Derivation of them, which is not in the French.</p>
