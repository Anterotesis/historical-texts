         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> womb appeares, who little thirſts after the living God, whoſe wildneſſe, wantonneſs, and negligence of the everlaſting ſalvation appeares; yet full, like <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> being full of that which is wicked and profane; the ſtreets of your Town will manifeſt it. O people, where is your ſalvation, and what aſſurance have you of that, and of your Eternal Inheritance, where nothing that doth defile, enters? O are ye come to examine, and ſee whether Chriſt be in you, or no, that wickedneſs, profaneneſs, unrighteouſneſs, ungodlineſs, filthineſs, might go out of you? For if Chriſt be found within you, the ſtrong man goes out that has kept the houſe, and defiled the heart, and the body, and the mind, and that priſoned the ſoule; If Chriſt be felt within, there's the ſoules Biſhop. O peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I am grieved with your abominations, and filthineſs, and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourineſs, and untowardneſs, and your unſubjected ſtate to the life and power of God; If you do not repent, and that your mindes be not changed to ſerve the living God in Spirit, which morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſinne and corruption, the Earth will vomit you out, who has cumbred it, and deſtroyed the Creatures of God on your fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ungodly luſts, and that you have ſerved and pleaſured. O I am weary of mine adverſaries ſaith the Lord, I am weary of your abominations, ye have loaded the juſt, and preſſed it as a Cart with ſheaves, your hearts are groſs and fat; with your tongues, you have talked of God, but your hearts has been farre off, after your own ends: your younger children, boyes and people are full of lightneſs, wildeneſs, folly, and vanity, and envie, and mocking, ſcorn and deriſion, (which is not a good ſavour in your ſtreets) ſtubborneſs, and untowardneſs, and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and wildeneſs, more like <hi>Eſau's</hi> and <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> ſtock, then <hi>Iſaack's</hi> and <hi>Jacob's</hi>; your old men are not ſober, nor ſolid, nor grave, and ſo they are not good patterns to the younger: ſo ye are all more like Heathens then Chriſtians, empty of the good, full of the forgetfulneſs of God, and out of his fear, as though there was no God, as though ye had never heard talk of God, nor Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor Chriſt; But this ſaying is fulfilled, <hi>The Teachers have not profited the people at all, Jer.</hi> 23. But like people, like Prieſt. But what a Teacher is he that muſt ſerve this people? who muſt be the Prophet, or the Prieſt, that muſt fit ſuch a people? Surely he muſt be ſuch a one as teaches for <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> and <hi>bears Rule</hi> by his meanes, that will <hi>devine for money,</hi> that will <hi>preach peace</hi> to them, while they put into their mouthes, ſuch as mindes <hi>Earthly things, who ſerves not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own bellies,</hi> that has ſuch fruites in the ſtreets: But <hi>ſuch as ſeeks for their gain from their quarter,</hi> and the price, never lead people to the Lord, but lead them into the Earth, and to be like themſelves, and they live like beaſts and ſwine, as you may read, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. <hi>Mic.</hi> 3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. <hi>Eſai</hi> 56. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> 23, whoſe fruits declares it. And away with the profeſſion of God with your lips, while your hearts are farre off; and away with your making a trade of the Scriptures, Chriſts and the Prophets and the Apoſtles words, which many ſuffered death for giving them forth; and away with your lukewarmneſs, and away with your carnal formality, and away with your Doctrines and Traditions of men, which periſhes in the uſing of them; and away with your ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Davids Quakings,</hi> and tremblings, and faſtings in Meeter, and come to ſing in the ſpirit; and away with your hour-glaſs preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hypocritical praying, and your old Maſs-houſe worſhip, which is called Steeple-houſe or Church, and come to <hi>the Church in God,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. and <hi>to worſhip God in ſpirit; John</hi> 4. and the Lord is come to teach his people himſelfe by his Spirit, and to bring them off from all the worlds Teachers, and Churches, and wayes, to Chriſt, the way to himſelf, and he doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world, that all through the light might believe; and every one believing in the light which hath enlightened them, they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the children of the light; But they that hate the light that doth enlighten them, they hate Chriſt, and that condemnes them: and that's the light that lets the Drunkard ſee he ſhould not be drunk, and the curſer that he ſhould not curſe, nor ſwear, and the thief, that he ſhould not ſteale; and that the coſiner ſhould not coſen, nor cheat, nor wrong, nor defraud; and lets the profane ſee he ſhould not profane; and lets the envious man ſee he ſhould not envie, nor fight, nor quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, nor lie, nor commit adultery; that's the light which diſcovers that: not to look after a woman to luſt after her, that's the light that ſaith ſo, which if ye love the light, it will let you ſee all your evill thoughts, words and actions which be wrought out of God, and turn you from them; and coming into the light, your works will be wrought in God, and your words will be from him, and ſo good: that is in every one of your boſomes that will judge you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you acting contrary to it, and reprove you; which if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and hearken to it, it will turn your minds to the Lord God; But if you hate it, it will be your condemnation. Therefore now while you have time, conſider and prize it, for this is the day of your Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Salvation profered to you: and with the light, with which you ſee your ſin, which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightened you withall, with the ſame you may ſee your ſalvation, Chriſt Jeſus, from whence it comes, to ſave you from your ſin. And people, that which may be known of God is made manifeſt within you, which God hath ſhewed unto you, that when you do the thing which is not convenient, not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but worthy of death, by that of God in you ye can tell; and while your minds is reprobate from that, ye are all ſtrangers from the life of God, and the covenant of Promiſe. And Friends, the light ye muſt feel in your own hearts, to give you <hi>the light of the knowledge of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God in the face of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. <hi>and all the children of the Lord, ſhall be taught of the Lord; Eſai.</hi> 54. and ye muſt come to know <hi>the anointing in you, to teach you,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. <hi>and the Kingdome of Heaven</hi> ye muſt know <hi>within you, Luke</hi> 17. and that's it which never conſents to ſin. And ye muſt come to know the New Covenant, the Law in your minds, and in your hearts, by which ye need not ſay to one another, know the Lord, But that all might come to know him, from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to the leaſt, that witneſs the Law of God put and written in your minds and hearts, that you may come to witneſs the Lord is your God, and ye his people.</p>
            <p>Repent, leſt you come to ſay you had time, when it is paſt; ſo from a lover of your ſoules, and your eternal good.</p>
