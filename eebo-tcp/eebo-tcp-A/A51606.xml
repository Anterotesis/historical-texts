            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Before I come to which relation I cannot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
my ſelfe from exclamation, let all the forreſts
wherein fierce lions are contained be joined in one,
and privy ſearch made, to know if ever female did

            <p>In the pariſh of Saint Margarets Weſtminſter,
dwelleth one <hi>Anne Hamton,</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Margeret
Harwood;</hi> this <hi>Anne Hamton</hi> had a husband which
like a loving man indeed delighted in nothing
more but to ſee his wife pleaſant: for he would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſay my wife being troubled it behoveth me not
to be at reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe being pleaſant I ought to be joyful:
But ſhe, moſt unkind woman, was of a contrary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
for ſhe at her owne houſe, would take an
occaſion to be merry, when the greateſt miſchiefe
had befallen him. Hee was a very laborious man,
but ſhe, a light huſwife, when he was working ſhee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94672:3"/>
would be goſſiping, with one young fellow or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or elſe with ſuch women as were like to her
ſelfe: never was ſhe more joyfull then when ſhe was
out of her good husbands company: what her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
got by taking paines, ſhe ſpent by taking her
pleaſure: his mony being thus conſumed, and his
goods waſted, he upon a time ſpoke to her after this
manner.</p>
            <p>Wife, what doe you meane to doe? how doſt
thou intend to live? my mony you ſpend, which
I get hardly, my goods you waſte, you never got
the worth of a joyntſtoole, my company you hate,
you muſt have better. O wife, wife, take counſell
by me thy hitherto loving husband, forſake that
company which hate not thy body, but ſoule, doe
not drink healths to thine own confuſion, nor with
ſo greedy an appetite ſwallow thine own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
repent in time of thy wickedneſſe leſt when
thou thinkeſt thy ſelfe in ſecurity, the Lord doth
cut thee off, and what will then become of thy
poore ſoule; love me thy husband, hate thoſe
which intice thee to wickedneſſe, truſt not to
their ſmiling countenances, for in their hearts
doe lye hid nothing but abominations. If thou wilt
(I ſay) have my love, hate ſuch, or elſe never
more thinke to enjoy, that which as yet you have
alwaies had.</p>
            <p>What harme was there in all this which he ſpake
unto her? But notwithſtanding ſhe forſooth took
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94672:4"/>
it in diſtaſte, and giving him a ſcolding reply, ſhee
left the roome, and went to her companion in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
<hi>Margerite Harwood,</hi> which was her Landlady,
to whom ſhe revealed the ſecrets of her heart, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that her husband was an enemy to good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,
and continually wrangled and brawled at
her, becauſe ſhe affected it. In which ſhe lyed, for
hee alwayes ſpoke in a very loving manner unto
her, except ſhe overmuch provoked him.</p>
            <p>Moreover ſhe ſaid that ſhee ſhould never bee in
quiet untill by ſome way or other ſhe were ſhifted
of him.</p>
            <p>The devill finding an occaſion how to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
a miſchievous intent, alwayes makes uſe of it,
hee knowes how to pleaſe every ones wicked hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
Wherefore he tempted the Landlady with
bloody cogitations, for ſhee hearing her Ningles
unjuſt complaint, ſhe cryed out that it was her own
fault, for letting ſuch an abject villaine to live; hang
him, cut his throat, or poyſon him, for he is not fit
to live upon the earth amongſt good fellowes. To
condiſcend to whoſe counſell, ſhe ſeemed very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
but at length the devill got the better of
her, and then ſhe did agree to poyſon him. And for
the ſame intent ſhe went and got five drams of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
enough to have deſtroyed ten men, and mixt
it amongſt his food, which he no ſooner had taken,
but that he preſently did ſwell very much, which

five drams; well done, ſaid ſhe, if five will not bee
enough, ten ſhall, and thereupon they went up to
ſee him, but he was then burſt. Then did they both
diſſemble a lamentable cry, which cauſed the
neighbours to come in to ſee what was the matter,
where they did behold ſuch a wofull ſpectacle as
was ſufficient to exhauſt teares from the dryeſt
eye compoſed of Pumice ſtone; for there did they
ſee his nayles quite pilled of, his hands did ſeeme
onely like two great boyles, his belly ſeemed as if
hot irons had beene thruſt into it, his viſage was ſo
much defaced by the quicke operation of the ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
poyſon, that had they not well knowne the
body, they would have ſworne it not to have beene
the man which they came to viſit: they all eaſily
perceived that he was poyſoned.</p>
            <p>A Chyrurgion being ſent for, ripped up his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and found the poyſon lying round about his
heart. As alſo there was found poyſon in a paper
in the window; the Chyrurgion calling for a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice
glaſſe put the ſame therein, which immediatly
broke the glaſſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore they ſent for an officer, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
