            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To Monſieur
William de Schuylenburg,
LORD of Dukenburg,
Counſellor, and Clerk of the Council
TO HIS
BRITANNIC MAJESTY.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have taken the Liberty to offer
you a Preſent which perhaps
will ſurprize you; for we are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
poſſeſs'd with an Opinion
that 'tis impoſſible for the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to manage both a <hi>Sword</hi> and a
<hi>Pen.</hi> If I had the leaſt Inclination
to pretend to the Quality of an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
I wou'd endeavour to demonſtrate
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonableneſs of that Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice;
nor do I believe that I ſhou'd
find it a very difficult Task to perform.
<pb facs="tcp:51983:3"/>
I cou'd eaſily tranſcribe the Stories of
ſo many famous <hi>Captains</hi> who were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
remarkable for their <hi>Wit</hi> and
for their <hi>Valour;</hi> and diſplay'd the
former in their <hi>Writings</hi> with as much
Honour and Succeſs as they ſignaliz'd
the latter in the moſt dangerous <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles:</hi>
And from theſe Inſtances I wou'd
conclude that the neareſt and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Way to Glory is to follow the bright
Tracts of thoſe <hi>Illuſtrious Heroes.</hi>
But ſince the Proſecution of ſo noble
an Attempt wou'd require a larger
Stock of Merit and Abilities than ever
I cou'd boaſt of, I will not be guilty of
ſo much Vanity as to alledge thoſe <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi>
in my own Vindication. Nor
will I trouble You with any ſtudy'd or
formal <hi>Apology,</hi> ſince I'm confident
You will be eaſily perſuaded to forgive
my Boldneſs in preſenting You with
the Obſervations I made during
my <hi>Travels,</hi> which I thought I might
communicate to the Publick without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
the Province, or provoking the
Jealouſie of <hi>Men of Letters.</hi> I made
<pb facs="tcp:51983:3"/>
it my Recreation for ſome Weeks to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
'em for the Preſs, and ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
if they can furniſh You with any
tolerable Entertainment for ſome Hours.
Your <hi>Approbation</hi> is all the Glory,
and the higheſt Recompence I deſire.
'Tis true, I cannot ask ſo noble a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
without diſcovering the Boldneſs
of my Ambition; for you have ſo nice
a Taſte, and ſo exact a Judgment,
that you never beſtow that Favour but
on ſuch as merit Applauſe from all the
World. But I encourage my ſelf with
reflecting on that <hi>Goodneſs</hi> which is
ſo natural and peculiar to You, and
even preſume to hope that the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Your Temper will put a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Bias upon Your Judgment,
and incline You to excuſe, or at leaſt
to over-look my <hi>Errors.</hi> This, <hi>SIR,</hi>
is the only Favour I beg leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
for I never entertain'd a Thought
of courting Your <hi>Protection</hi> on the
Score of ſo mean a Preſent. I know
that muſt be obtain'd by a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Method; nor do I hope to procure
<pb facs="tcp:51983:4"/>
it by any other Way than that by
which all <hi>Good Men</hi> who have the
Happineſs to be known to you, may
pretend to it. 'Tis from Your <hi>Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi>
alone that I expect ſo glorious an
Advantage, and from that compaſſionate
and bountiful Inclination, which has
render'd You the Support of ſo many
<hi>Illuſtrious Exiles,</hi> whom the Tempeſt
of the Age has caſt upon the Shores
of <hi>Holland,</hi> where, by Your Favour,
they have found not only a Safe but a
Peaceful and Convenient Retreat, and
are enabl'd to out-live the Loſs of all
their Hopes and Fortunes. Since then
a Man of Honour may aſſure himſelf
of Your <hi>Protection</hi> without being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to bribe Your Favour, I might
be juſtly accus'd both of Folly and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
if I ſhou'd endeavour to obtain
it by indirect Methods. No, <hi>Sir,</hi> I
never harbour'd ſo criminal a Thought;
and the only reaſon why I make bold to
conſecrate the Fruit of my <hi>Travels</hi> to
You, is becauſe this <hi>Dedication</hi> will
furniſh me with an Opportunity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:51983:4"/>
the vaſt Debt I owe You.
The Iniquity of Fortune made me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of expreſſing the Senſe I have
of Your Goodneſs; and I can aſſure
You, that Conſideration alone ſate hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
upon me than all the reſt of my
Diſaſters. And is it not natural for a
Man in ſuch a Condition to embrace
the firſt Occaſion he can meet with of
ſatisfying in ſome Meaſure the extreme
Deſire he has to expreſs his <hi>Gratitude?</hi>
Permit me then to acknowledge that I
have receiv'd very conſiderable Favours
from You, that You beſtow'd 'em in
the moſt obliging Manner imaginable,
that I never merited 'em, that You
cou'd not have the leaſt Reaſon to
believe that ever I cou'd requite 'em,
and conſequently that You were only
acted by a Principle of <hi>doing Good,</hi>
without the leaſt hope of a <hi>Return.</hi>
This, <hi>Sir,</hi> is what I deſire to publiſh
to all the World; this is the only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
that incited me to prefix this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to thoſe which You will find in the
Body of the Treatiſe; and to convince
<pb facs="tcp:51983:5"/>
You that I had no other Deſign in my View,
I ſhall pnrpoſely avoid the uſual Strain of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications,</hi>
and ſave You the trouble of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe Praiſes which Your <hi>Merit</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
from all the World, and Your <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
will not receive even from Your beſt
Friends. 'Tis not without extreme Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that I decline ſo inviting a Subject; and
I had almoſt made bold to tell You, that You
were oblig'd to me for my <hi>Silence.</hi> You
know what a vaſt Field lies before me, and
with how much Pleaſure and Satisfaction I
wou'd have made Uſe of this Opportunity to
acquaint the World with Your unalterable Love
to Your Country, Your inviolable Fidelity to the
State, Your Zeal and Affection to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Service, Your extraordinary Abilities and
Capacity for the Management of thoſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Affairs that are intruſted to Your Care;
the Clearneſs and Quickneſs of Your Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
the Solidity of Your Judgment, Your
uncommon Generoſity, the charming Sweetneſs
of Your Temper, Your incorruptible Probity,
and all the other eminent Vertues and Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which hath gain'd You the Eſteem and
Admiration of all the World. 'Twou'd be an
<pb facs="tcp:51983:5"/>
endleſs Task to mention all thoſe rare aud no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Qualities which have ſo juſtly intitl'd You
to the Favour of the <hi>greateſt King</hi> in the

and therefore ſhall content my ſelf with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring

Leave to aſſure You that I am, and ſhall ever

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Cuſtom of Writing <hi>Prefaces</hi> has
been ſo long eſtabliſh'd, and is grown
ſo common, that what was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
look'd upon as a <hi>Courteſie,</hi> is now
reckon'd a <hi>Duty:</hi> and if the <hi>Reader</hi> be not
coax'd into good Humour, he thinks himſelf
engag'd in Honour to reſent the Affront, and
the <hi>Book</hi> muſt be damn'd for the Clown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs
of the <hi>Author.</hi> But tho' I dare not
venture to ſend this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> abroad without
ſo neceſſary an Ornament, I muſt confeſs I'm
ſomewhat puzzl'd how to begin my Addreſs.
'Tis true, I might pretend a Right (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
as juſtly too as many others) to that
thread-bare Excuſe of common <hi>Scriblers;</hi> that
neither my Humour, nor Profeſſion inclines
me to ſet up for an <hi>Author,</hi> that this <hi>Treatiſe</hi>
was compos'd and deſign'd for my own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Uſe, that I happen'd to ſhew it to ſome
Friends, and was at laſt conſtrain'd by their
perpetual and reſiſtleſs Importunities, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to its Publication. But tho' I ſhou'd
ſpoil my Compliment to the <hi>Reader,</hi> I will
neither endeavour to court his Favour, nor
ſave my Credit by a <hi>Lie:</hi> that is, I will not
<pb facs="tcp:51983:7"/>
pretend that I was either forc'd or perſwaded
to a thing which I choſe for a Diverſion in
my <hi>Winter-Quarters,</hi> where I ſpent my time
in reviſing and putting in Order the Notes
I had taken during my Travels. As to the
Method I have obſerv'd in communicating
my Obſervations, beſides other Advantages 'tis
certainly moſt convenient for a Man of my
Profeſſion. One that is not accuſtom'd to
Writing, expreſſes his Thoughts more
eaſily in <hi>familiar Letters</hi> than in a <hi>continu'd
Diſcourſe:</hi> for he is neither acquainted with
the Niceties of a correct <hi>Style,</hi> nor able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
an exact <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> and <hi>Connexion</hi> in ſo
great a Variety of Matter.</p>
            <p>'Twou'd be a difficult and laborious Task
to anſwer all the <hi>Objections</hi> that may be made
againſt this Work: And therefore ſince I am
not naturally over-fond of making Apologies,
I'm reſolv'd to let it go at a venture, and
take its Fate among the <hi>Criticks,</hi> without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my ſelf the Trouble to conſider, much
leſs to prevent or confute their Cenſures. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it muſt be acknowledg'd, that 'tis the
Deſign of all Authors, and mine in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
to <hi>pleaſe,</hi> and therefore it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
to be ſpeak the <hi>Reader</hi>'s Favour, ſince he
muſt ſhortly become my <hi>Judge:</hi> and I may
juſtly deſire to be <hi>heard</hi> before my <hi>Doom</hi> be
pronounc'd.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I expect to be cenſur'd
for writing on a <hi>Subject</hi> which has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
handl'd by ſo many Learned and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive
<hi>Travellers,</hi> and ſeems to be quite <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51983:7"/>
by the vaſt Number of <hi>Relations</hi> with

to this Objection, I might content my
ſelf with deſiring the <hi>Reader</hi> to conſult the
<hi>Prefaces</hi> of thoſe Authors who have treated
on the ſame Subject; but without giving him
the Trouble of peruſing their <hi>Reaſons,</hi> I can
aſſure him, that in the following <hi>Letters</hi> he
will meet with ſeveral <hi>Obſervations</hi> that are
omitted by other <hi>Travellers.</hi> I made it my
principal Buſineſs to obſerve the <hi>Manners</hi> and
<hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> which are ſubject to
frequent and conſiderable Alterations; and
conſequently I may, without Vanity, affirm,
that my <hi>Remarks</hi> will furniſh the <hi>Reader</hi> with
a freſher, and more diverting Entertainment,
than the dry <hi>Relations</hi> of a meer <hi>Antiquary</hi> or
<hi>Geographer.</hi> Neither is the Subject ſo barren nor
ſo much exhauſted, as the <hi>Objection</hi> ſuppoſes, and
we commonly imagine it to be. A hundred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have handl'd it before me, and in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
a hundred more will treat of it after
me. But almoſt every Writer purſues a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Method, and takes Notice of ſome
Things that were neglected by others: and
tho' I have related nothing but what I have
ſeen or heard, I ſhall be always glad to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe
the <hi>Writings</hi> of ſucceeding <hi>Travellers,</hi> and
may perhaps find ſeveral conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
in their <hi>Relations</hi> that had eſcap'd my
own Obſervation.</p>
            <p>'Tis true there are ſome Things ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
deſcrib'd in the Relations of other <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,</hi>
that I choſe rather to omit many beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:51983:8"/>
               <hi>Deſcriptions</hi> with which I might have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh'd
my <hi>Work,</hi> than to tranſcribe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the <hi>Obſervations</hi> that are already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the Public. As for Example;
what cou'd I have added to the exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Roman Pantheon, Capitol, Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum,</hi>
&amp;c. of the <hi>Palace</hi> of S. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi>
of the <hi>Great Council,</hi> and a thouſand other
Things of that Nature? 'Twill perhaps be
objected, that for the ſame Reaſon I ought
to have omitted ſeveral other Deſcriptions,
which I have taken care to inſert in my <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
but to remove that Prejudice 'twill be
ſufficient to put the <hi>Reader</hi> in mind that there
is ſo neceſſary a <hi>Connexion</hi> between my <hi>Old</hi>
and <hi>New</hi> Obſervations, that I cou'd not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
mention the <hi>latter,</hi> without taking Notice
of the <hi>former.</hi> 'Tis true, I cannot pretend
the ſame Excuſe for that part of my Book,
where I treat of the <hi>Egyptian Pyramids,</hi> of
<hi>Cairo,</hi> and the Ruines of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> But
there is ſomething ſo wonderful and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
in thoſe Celebrated Monuments of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
that I concluded the curious <hi>Reader</hi>
wou'd be glad of an Opportunity to refreſh
his Memory by Reading the <hi>Two Letters</hi> I
have written on that <hi>Subject:</hi> and as for
thoſe who are already ſo well acquainted
with theſe <hi>Curioſities,</hi> that they cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their Time with Pleaſure in Reading a
New Account of 'em, they may eaſily ſave
themſelves that Trouble, by skipping over
Ten or Twelve Leaves.</p>

<hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the
<hi>People</hi> of whom I have occaſion to diſcourſe, or
for ſome other Reaſons that need not be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd.
Since I muſt expect to be treated with
the utmoſt Rigour and Spite by ſuch peeviſh
and mercileſs Cenſurers; I do not think my ſelf
oblig'd either to ſubmit to their Judgment, or
to appeaſe their Anger. And therefore I ſhall
content my ſelf with telling 'em plainly, that
they may lay aſide my <hi>Book,</hi> when they meet
with any Thing in it that offends 'em, and that
I ſhall be equally unconcern'd whether they
<hi>approve</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi> it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reader</hi> may eaſily perceive, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
not to have ended my <hi>Relation</hi> at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>
I thought, in a <hi>Second Part,</hi> to have given

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I muſt beg leave to complain of the hardneſs
of the Task you impoſe upon me, by requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
me to give you an exact Relation of
our preſent Campaign, with the Deſcription
of thoſe Cities in <hi>Germany</hi> which I ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to viſit; but neither the Troubleſomneſs of
ſuch a Correſpondence, nor the Sence of my own
Unfitneſs to Manage it, ſhall make me decline an
Undertaking by which I may convince you of
my extream deſire to obtain the honour of your
Friendſhip, and to ſecure my ſelf in the Poſſeſſion
of it beyond the danger or fear of any future
Alteration.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin, then, with acquainting you, that
we were about eight Days ago quarter'd in a
City call'd <hi>Spire,</hi> which is now a heap of Stones:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51983:17"/>
The Inhabitants have been threaten'd theſe three
Months, with the execution of that fatal Deſign
of reducing the City to Aſhes, and during that
time liv'd in a cruel Uncertainty, and perpetual
Fear of their impending Ruine. <hi>Spire</hi> was ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> call'd of old <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metum,</hi>
and its Inhabitants <hi>Nimetes;</hi> it was the
Seat of the Imperial Chamber, compos'd of two
Preſidents, one a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and the other a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;</hi>
and fifteen Counſellors, eight of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,</hi>
and ſeven of the other Perſuaſion. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
of <hi>Triers</hi> held the Biſhoprick of that City,
the Sovereignty of which is extended over ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
fine Territories; and among the reſt, <hi>Philipsburg,</hi>
which the Emperor was oblig'd to reſtore to that
Prelate, by the Treaty concluded with <hi>France</hi> at
<hi>Triers,</hi> in 1685. The Cathedral was a large and
fine Structure, well furniſh'd with Lights, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
with great Pyramidal Towers at the four
Corners. On the Right-ſide of the Church ſtood
the Epiſcopal Palace, famous for its Architecture,
and enrich'd on the Inſide with a great variety of
fine Pictures; and on the other ſide was the Houſe
of the Canons, with a very ancient Cloyſter, in
the middle of which there was a Mount of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives
cut in the Rock, eſteem'd to be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece
of Sculpture. Before the Church there
was a great Court or void Space, capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
10000 Men drawn up in <hi>Battalia.</hi> All
the Houſes that ſurrounded it were well built,
eſpecially that of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> which fronted the
Biſhop's Palace, where thoſe Fathers had a very
curious Library of above 6000 Volumes, which
was conſum'd in the general Conflagration of
the City; with five or ſix others belonging to
private Perſons that were no leſs conſiderable.
The Inhabitants of <hi>Spire</hi> were Rich, and lovers of
Pleaſure: The City was ſurrounded with a great
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51983:17"/>
number of Gardens abundantly furniſh'd with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that might contribute to the Advantage
and Pleaſure of the Owners; for beſides the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Orange-Trees which were preſerv'd there
notwithſtanding the Coldneſs of the Climate; and
the various Ornaments of cover'd and open'd
Walks, Flowers, Water-Works, and Statues; there
was a great abundance of all ſorts of Fruit-Trees.
Every Garden had alſo the convenience of a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure-Houſe,
very handſomly built, and all over
Painted and Gilt after the <hi>German</hi> Faſhion, in which
the Gentlemen of <hi>Spire</hi> paſs'd the time with a great
deal of Satisfaction, ſome in Drinking, and others
in more charming Diverſions. The Town-Houſe
was famous for its Antiquity, which was ſaid to
amount to above twelve Ages ſince its firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
but had nothing elſe to recommend it
to the Obſervation of Travellers. Before the
Gate there hung on an Iron-Ring, a <hi>Bone of an Arm,</hi>
which equall'd a Thigh-Bone in bigneſs, and
was proportionably long. 'Tis affirm'd in the
Records of the City, that the Man to whom that
Bone belong'd, whoſe Name was <hi>Olps,</hi> was twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
five Foot high, and that he was kill'd about
1300 Years agoe in a Siege againſt the Town,
the Ladder breaking under him as he was ſcaling
the Walls; which gave a fair Opportunity to the
Beſieg'd to rid themſelves of ſo formidable an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
by pouring whole Hogſheads of boiling
Pitch upon him. His Hip-Bone was alſo preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the great Hall, which I have often ſeen,
without giving much credit to the Story; for
tis hard to conceive, that a Man of ſuch a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine
Stature cou'd have eſcap'd the Obſrvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>To return to <hi>Spire;</hi> The City was taken by
the <hi>Dauphin</hi> about the end of the laſt Year,
(when he made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Philipsburg</hi>)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51983:18"/>
and was immediately put under Contribution;
and beſides, 6000 Men were quarter'd in it during
the Winter, which made the Inhabitants believe
they had already ſuffer'd the ſevereſt Effects of
their Enemies Fury. But they were extremely
ſurpriz'd, when in the laſt Spring they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to raiſe 60000 Crowns, under pain of
Burning. This rigorous Order cou'd not be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
without reducing 'em to Beggary; for
Money was already very ſcarce in the City,
and yet thoſe Wretches put themſelves to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſtretch to raiſe the Summ; which they had
no ſooner paid, but the Baron <hi>de Monclair</hi> caus'd
a Proclamation to be publiſh'd with Sound of
Trumpet, commanding all the Inhabitants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
with their Goods, becauſe the Town was to
be burnt on the 5<hi>th.</hi> Day after the publiſhing of
the Order. And to add to the Cruelty of their
Puniſhment, they were not ſuffer'd to paſs the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> where they might have found ſome Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
among their Friends and Relations, but
were forc'd to retire to <hi>Alſace,</hi> among the <hi>French,</hi>
who treated them like ſo many Beaſts, without
the leaſt Mark of Humanity or Compaſſion. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all theſe Severities, they might have found
ſome Conſolation even in the extremity of their
Affliction, if they had been furniſh'd with Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
for the Tranſportation of their Goods; but
they were not to expect the leaſt Favour, and were
oblig'd to hire Waggons of the Peaſants and Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
who, taking Advantage of their Neceſſity,
made 'em pay ſuch exceſſive Rates, that they were
forc'd to leave the greateſt part of their Goods
for want of Carriage. In that time of Extremity
I heard ſome of thoſe miſerable Creatures offer
fifteen Crowns a-day for the uſe of a Horſe,
that might have been bought for a ſmaller
Summ. Never any Man beheld ſo touching an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51983:18"/>
Object as was occaſion'd by the Grief and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation
that cover'd every Face in this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
City, at the publiſhing of the Burning-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Our Eyes and Ears were every where ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Tears and Lamentations; the Women
eſpecially mov'd the hardeſt Hearts with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
their Deſpair making 'em tear their
Hair, and ſtrike their Heads againſt the Wall.</p>
               <p>At laſt the fatal Term being expir'd, they
were forc'd to bid a laſting Farewel to the
City, and with it to almoſt all their Goods and
Poſſeſſions. Then their Lamentations began afreſh,
and their Deſpair appear'd more viſibly than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
nor was it poſſible for any Heart that was
not entirely diveſted of all ſence of Humanity,
to reſiſt the Motions of Compaſſion that were
excited at the ſight of ſo deplorable an Object.
Noblemen, Tradeſmen, the Poor and the Rich,
began their doleful March, without any Mark
of Diſtinction, all equally Miſerable; with this
only difference, that the Rich were more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of their Misfortunes than thoſe whoſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
ſecur'd 'em from the danger of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Loſſes. I'm ſtill fill'd with Horrour as often
as I reflect on that diſmal Spectacle; and I'm
confident you wou'd not be leſs deeply touch'd
with a ſence of the irrecoverable Ruine of ſo
many innocent Perſons, if you had been an Eye-Witneſs
of it. You cou'd not have beheld, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feeling almoſt the ſame Tranſports of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
two or three hundred Noble-women and
Citizens Wives walking on foot in the midſt of an
Infinite Crowd of People, and moſt of 'em fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by five or ſix ſmall Children, ſome of 'em
hanging at the Mother's Breaſt, not knowing
where to ſhelter themſelves during the Night,
nor where to find neceſſary Refreſhment and
Suſtenance for their weary'd Bodies; for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51983:19"/>
Contributions that were exacted from 'em,
had ſo drain'd their Purſes, that three quarters of
'em were not Maſters of one Peny; and thoſe
who had the happineſs to preſerve the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of their Money, had hid it under-ground,
for fear of being robb'd by the Soldiers on the
Road, as ſeveral of 'em were who had not us'd
that Precaution.</p>
               <p>After their Departure, the Town was abandon'd
for two Days to the Mercy of the Soldiers, who
committed a Thouſand Sacrileges; for hoping to
find ſome hidden Treaſures, they threw down the
Altars, dig'd up dead Bodies, and rif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d the moſt
Ancient and Venerable Tombs, without ſparing
thoſe of an Emperour, and ſeveral great Princes
and Prelates that were in the Cathedral, which
they turn'd to a Stable.</p>
               <p>After all theſe Violences, the appointed Day
for the final deſtruction of the City being come,
the Troops were encampt, and 200 Men, each
with a lighted Torch in his Hand, were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

hardly give Credit to my Relation, if I ſhou'd
undertake to give you a particular Account of
the prodigious quantity of Wine that was waſted on
this Occaſion; for there was a ſufficient Store of
that Liquor in <hi>Spire</hi> to furniſh ſuch a City as
<hi>Paris</hi> above a Month: And beſides, it was of
the moſt excellent ſorts, all near eight Years old
at leaſt; and even ſome of the richeſt Citizens
uſually kept it twelve Years, preſerving it in large
Casks, many of which contain'd 100 Hogſheads.
I'm perſuaded that no other City in the World
cou'd boaſt of ſo fine and ſo numerous Cellars,
as <hi>Spire;</hi> they were deep, large, and well vault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with great Pillars that ſuſtain'd the whole
weight of the Houſes and Streets; ſo that they
ſeem'd to be Subterraneous Temples, conſecrated
to the God <hi>Bacchus.</hi> The Citizen with whom I
lodg'd had a very ſtately one, which contain'd
100 Casks, ſuch as thoſe I have already deſcrib'd,
full of the moſt excellent ſorts of Wine. I never
viſited this well-ſtor'd Cellar, but I thought on
our dear <hi>N</hi>—, and wiſh'd his Company, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
my ſelf with the Thought, how nobly I
cou'd have regal'd him, eſpecially with one Cask

Wines to the <hi>Germans,</hi> whoſe Heads are

the conveniency of contriving the Fortifications
as he pleas'd. All the Houſes were exactly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,

               <p>I Hope this Letter will in ſome meaſure atone
for my long Silence, and convince you that
my Neglect was not the only Cauſe of my not
writing to you once every Month, according to
your Deſire: For I concluded that a compleat
Relation of the Compaign wou'd be a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Preſent to you, than if I had ſent you
from time to time ſome interrupted and ill-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
Accounts of it. Beſides, I was ſo little
Maſter of my Time during the whole Month
of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that you cannot with Juſtice refuſe to
put a leſs ſevere Conſtruction on my Silence:
And I'm confident that after you have read the
Account of my Misfortunes in the beginning of
this Month, you will eſteem me a fitter Object
of your Compaſſion than Anger. Perhaps you
little expected to hear of my Confinement to a
cloſe Priſon for fifteen Days; but I can aſſure
you, that if the Marqueſs <hi>D'Efiat</hi> had not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaf'd

my ſuſpected Crimes, in a Letter to Monſieur

you a particular Account of that Accident, the
Order of time obliges me to entertain you with
a Relation of our Warlike Expeditions.</p>
               <p>While our Army, in <hi>July,</hi> lay quiet, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> attack'd and took <hi>Keiſerwaert:</hi>
And we were afterwards inform'd, that,
not content with that Succeſs, he ſate down
before <hi>Bonn;</hi> and that <hi>Mentz</hi> was inveſted by the
Dukes of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with an Army of
Seventy thouſand Men, which oblig'd us to make
a Diverſion in the <hi>Palatinate:</hi> And that Deſign
was executed with ſo much Fury and Cruelty,
that Poſterity will hardly ever give credit to that
part of the Hiſtory of our Age. We paſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d the

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>urg</hi> on a Bridge of Boats, in the
beginning of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> I need not tell you that
this City was ſurrender'd to the <hi>Dauphin</hi> on his
Birth-day (<hi>Novemb.</hi> 1.) which he render'd famous
by his firſt Conqueſt: But I cannot forbear do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Juſtice to the Bravery and Greatneſs of Mind
which he ſhew'd on that Occaſion. For he was
everywhere preſent, and neither gave his Orders
by Proxy, nor ſuffer'd any thing to be done
without his Knowledge. <hi>Philipsburg</hi> is a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
Town, ſcarce able to contain a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Gariſon, nor can it boaſt of one remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Houſe, but that which belongs to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.
But, notwithſtanding thoſe Defects,
'tis a place of great importance, both by reaſon
of its Situation between the <hi>Rhine</hi> and a large
and deep Marſh, and its numerous Fortifications.
There was a Redoubt on the other ſide of the
<hi>Rhine</hi> to defend the Paſſage of the River, which
the <hi>Dauphin</hi> took in two Days: But there are ſo
many new Works added, that it may be call'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51983:22"/>
more properly a conſiderable Fort than a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Redoubt. The next Day we encamp'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Heydelberg,</hi> which we inveſted on the ſide
next the <hi>Rhine.</hi> This City was part of our laſt
Year's Conqueſts, and had paid Contributions
two or three times. Some of our Troops had
their Winter-Quarters in it, and poſſeſs'd it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt Diſturbance till the Spring, when
by an unaccountable ſort of Policy, we blew up
the Caſtle, and left the Town (I think) on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that we might have the pleaſure of Beſieging it
two Months after: For you muſt not imagine
becauſe the Trenches were not open'd, that the
Siege was never really intended, ſince 'tis plain
from reaſon that we ſate down before it with
that deſign, becauſe we cou'd not have choſen a
more probable way to divert the Imperial Forces:
And beſides, 'tis certain that Monſieur <hi>de Duras</hi>
had given Orders for a general Aſſault the Day
on which the Place was reliev'd by a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 3000 Men, who enter'd the Town with
ſeveral Boats laden with Ammunition, and all
ſorts of neceſſary Proviſions. However, our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
conſiſting of 25000 Men, with 45 Pieces of
Cannon, lay ſeven Days before it, during which
time we loſt 8 or 900 good Soldiers, beſides ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Officers; and were at laſt forc'd to leave
a defenceleſs Town, that might have been ſtorm'd
with Sword in Hand the firſt Night we ſate
down before it: For we had already ruin'd thoſe
inconſiderable Fortifications that defended it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we left it in the Spring: And at the ſame
time we blew up the Caſtle, or at leaſt the beſt
part of it, in which alone the ſtrength of the
Place conſiſted. Nevertheleſs all its Defects might
have been corrected by an induſtrious Maſter:
And beſides, it muſt be acknowledg'd to be a
Place of great Importance, if we conſider the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51983:23"/>
Advantages of its Situation; for it wou'd have
open'd a Paſſage on the <hi>Neckar,</hi> and made us
Maſters of the whole Country as far as <hi>Franckfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heydelberg</hi> is the Chief City of the Palatinate of
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> ſeated on the <hi>Neckar,</hi> in a Bottom betwixt
two Hills. The Caſtle where the Electors formerly
reſided, ſtands on a Hillock that commands the
Town, and has the Advantage of a lovely, but of
late neglected Garden. The Strangers that paſs'd
thro' this City never fail'd to pay a Viſit to the famous
<hi>Tun,</hi> of above a hundred Years ſtanding, and were
uſually receiv'd with the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> which is a Glaſs
containing about two Quarts. The <hi>French,</hi> who
quarter'd here during the Winter, were ſo ſenſible
of the Charms of that hoſpitable Veſſel, that they
left not one Drop in it, tho' it contain'd above
300 Hogſheads of Wine. Near the City there
is a fair Church, conſiſting of three ſeveral Vaults,
under which the <hi>Catholicks, Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi>
perform Divine Service. It was built by
<hi>Charles Lewis,</hi> Elector Palatine, who nam'd it
<hi>The Temple of Concord,</hi> to put his Subjects in mind
that their Temporal Safety depended on their
Union; and that a diverſity of Intereſts was not
a neceſſary Conſequence of Difference in Religion.
This City was formerly Miſtreſs of one of the
fineſt Libraries in the World, which ſhe poſſeſs'd
till the Year 1622, when Count <hi>Tilly</hi> having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the City, ſent part of the Books to <hi>Rome,</hi>
while the reſt were diſpers'd like thoſe of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>

ſince no other Library contain'd ſo numerous a

from our intended Aſſault, we decamp'd on

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d about eight a-clock at the little
Town of <hi>Wiſeloch,</hi> which we burnt in our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51983:23"/>
after we had thruſt out the Inhabitants.
<hi>Sinſennes,</hi> and ſeveral other Villages, met with the ſame
Treatment from our Dragoons, who were always
entruſted with theſe fiery Commiſſions. Theſe
Miniſters of our Fury allow'd no longer reſpite
to the Places they were order'd to deſtroy, than
what might give 'em leiſure to plunder the beſt
Effects of the Inhabitants, raviſh their Wives and
Daughters, and commit a thouſand other Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
The Fame of our Cruelties was quickly ſpread
over the Countries of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> and <hi>Baden,</hi> and
drove away all the Inhabitants of the Towns and
Villages to which we approach'd; who fled from
us as from the Enemies and Deſtroyers of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
endeavouring to ſave their Lives in the Woods
and Foreſts, where many of 'em ſeeking to avoid
one kind of Death, met with another no leſs terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and choſe rather to be <hi>ſtarv'd</hi> than <hi>kill'd;</hi>
ſo that from hence-forward during our whole
March, we found not one Perſon, either in the
Towns or Country thro' which we paſs'd. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Weingarten</hi> and <hi>Bruchſal</hi> pretended to ſtop our
Career; but two Days after they were conſtrain'd
to Surrender, and both the Garriſons and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
were made Priſoners of War, and the Towns
were treated with the ſame Severity with thoſe
that were formerly mention'd, by the Troops that
enter'd into 'em. At the ſame time Monſieur <hi>de
Boufflers,</hi> who commanded a Flying Camp, came
before a little Town call'd <hi>Cocheim,</hi> in which there
was a Garriſon of 600 Men, and fearing leaſt the
Place ſhou'd be reliev'd, immediately gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for an Aſſault, which was carry'd on and
receiv'd with equal Vigour and Bravery. The
Action laſted two Hours, after which our Men
were oblig'd to retire; but the Major, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the Town, contenting himſelf with
ſo remarkable a Succeſs, and concluding that the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51983:24"/>
Courage of the <hi>French</hi> Troops was ſo well cool'd,
that they wou'd hardly venture to return to a
place where they had met with ſo rough a Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
inſtead of taking Meaſures to prevent a
Surprize, went to recruit his Spirits after ſo hot
an Action, with a Glaſs of his beloved Wine:
In the mean time Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> upon a
Signal which was made to him by ſome Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in the Town, commanded his Dragoons to
renew the Attack, which they did with greater
Vigour than before, and ſtorming the Town,
ran to the place of Arms, with their Swords in
their Hands, where they found the Garriſon drawn
up in <hi>Battalia,</hi> whom they put to the Sword,
not allowing them the benefit of Quarter. The
Slaughter laſted three Hours, during which, Men,
Women, and Children were kill'd without Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
Nor could the Fury of the Soldiers be ſtopp'd
till the General had by repeated Orders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
'em to put an end to the Maſſacre.
They were Maſters of the Art of ſqueezing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
even out of thoſe who had none, which
they had learn'd in <hi>France,</hi> at the expence of the
poor <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and here they diſplay'd all their
Skill, uſing the Inhabitants with the utmoſt Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity,
to make 'em diſcover their Treaſures.
From thence Monſieur <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> continuing his
March and his Cruelties, burnt entirely the
Towns of <hi>Keyſereſch, Dhonu, Helleſheim, Meyem, Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Kerpen,</hi> and all the other Cities and Villages
of that Country, which oblig'd the Elector of
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> to detach 10000 Men, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of General <hi>Schonen,</hi> to give him Battle; but
that Unfaithful Officer communicated the Orders
he had receiv'd to the Marqueſs <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> who
immediately retir'd to <hi>Philipsburg.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51983:24"/>
In the mean time we were no leſs careful
than <hi>Boufflers</hi>'s Dragoons to act the part of brave
Incendiaries, and continu'd our March from <hi>Bruch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi>
to <hi>

Ware-Houſes, Shops, and Houſes full of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
and Furniture, but altogether void of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
who were taught by the Misfortunes
of their Neighbours, not to expect our Viſit.
The Pillage laſted two Days; after which the
Cities were ſet on Fire, after the laudable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of this Campaign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baden</hi> is ſituated in <hi>Suabia,</hi> and gives the Title
of Marqueſs to a Family, the Head of which is
a Prince of the Empire on a double Account,
both by his Birth, which is Ancient and Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and by his Principality, which gives him a
Voice in the Diets of the Empire. The Town
was Rich, embelliſh'd with fine Houſes, fair Streets,
and lovely Gardens; and beſides had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the moſt remarkable Baths in <hi>Europe.</hi>
The Princeſs of <hi>Baden</hi> left no means on her ſide
to preſerve their City; ſhe ſollicited the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and the King himſelf, and offer'd to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the Walls; but all her Endeavours cou'd not
procure the leaſt Mitigation of its Doom, and
<hi>Baden</hi> was laid in Aſhes, as well as its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Towns.</p>
               <p>Four Leagues from hence lay <hi>Durlach,</hi> call'd in
<hi>Latine, Durlacum,</hi> which gives ſome Title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to the Younger Branch of the Houſe of <hi>Baden,</hi>
who have alſo a Voice in the <hi>Diets.</hi> It was in my
Opinion a larger and fairer Town than <hi>Baden,</hi> inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by ſeveral rich Merchants, and a conſiderable
number of Perſons of Quality, and adorn'd with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
magnificent Structures, which I had not time to
conſider at leiſure, before the fatal Sentence was
executed upon 'em. The Caſtle particularly was a
ſtately Edifice; a magnificent Portal open'd a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51983:25"/>
into a vaſt Court; from whence we aſcended
by a broad Stair-Caſe, to a large Hall, out of which
you might paſs into the Apartments appointed for
Winter and Summer, and all the other Seaſons. The
Furniture of all theſe Apartments was very rich, and
well-contriv'd, at leaſt as far as I cou'd judge by
what was left; for the moſt precious Part of it, with
all the Plate, was remov'd; only there remain'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Pieces of very fine Tapeſtry richly Wrought,
Embroider'd Silk Beds of great Value, and ſome of
Gold and Silver; Tables and Cabinets of <hi>China-Work,</hi>
Looking-Glaſſes, magnificent Lamps of Chryſtal,
and ſeveral other Ornaments of the ſame Nature;
which inſpir'd the Beholder with a great <hi>Idea</hi> of
the Richneſs of that part of the Furniture which
was remov'd. The Platfond of the Library was
enrich'd with Gilding and very curious Paintings,
and it contain'd between four and five thouſand Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes;
adjoining to this were two Cabinets full of
Papers rank'd from top to bottom in very good
Order. The diſpoſitions of the Gardens were ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Beauty of the Houſe, and the Eye was
every where ſaluted with Objects of Pleaſure; but
all thoſe Beauties were conſum'd by the mercileſs
Fire, and reduc'd to a few Heaps of Aſhes, and
diſmal Ruines. During our abode here, the <hi>Germans,</hi>
who had made a Detachment of Two or Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men to diſturb us, took ſome of our Men, with
Two hundred Horſes that were Forraging in the
Country. They had done the ſame at <hi>Sinſennes,</hi> and
beſides a terrible Sickneſs made ſuch a prodigious
Havock among our Troops, that when we arriv'd at
<hi>Strasburg</hi> we were forc'd to ſend above Six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men to the Hoſpital, which leſſen'd our Army
to ſuch a Degree, that the Number of thoſe who
were render'd uſeleſs by the Sickneſs, with thoſe
who were kill'd at <hi>Heydelberg, Bruch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>al,</hi> and <hi>Wein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garten</hi>
amounted to 11000 Men, of which there
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51983:25"/>
were at leaſt 5000 dead, without reckoning above
1000 Horſes, that were either taken from us, or
dy'd by the Way; for the ill Weather that had laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
during the whole Campaign, had ſo weaken'd
and ſpoil'd 'em, that only ſuch who were very well
mounted were Maſters of a Horſe fit for Service.</p>
               <p>To return to our March; We decamp'd from
<hi>Durlach,</hi> and leaving <hi>Fort-Lewis</hi> on our Right-hand,
which is a ſtrong and well-fortify'd Place, built by
the King's Order, we arriv'd before <hi>Stolof,</hi> the only
Town that eſcap'd the utmoſt Marks of our Fury;
for the Magiſtrates, to appeaſe <hi>Monſieur de Duras,</hi>
preſented him with the Summ of 50000 Crowns,
which prevail'd ſo far on his good Nature, that he
contented himſelf with ordering the Town to be
pillag'd, and the Walls to be demoliſh'd. Two days
after we arriv'd near <hi>Strasburg,</hi> where I was conſtrain'd
to leave the Army, in a manner that was not very
agreeable to my Humour. I was ſtruck with ſo
much Horrour, when I reflected on the Barbarities,
and the Deſolation of ſo many Towns of which
I had been an Eye-witneſs, and ſometimes an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
that I cou'd not forbear expreſſing my
Indignation, and was therefore look'd upon as a
ſuſpicious Perſon by ſome of our moſt reſolute
<hi>Burners.</hi> It happen'd one day, that being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in a pretty warm Diſpute with ſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
that were none of my beſt Friends, at the
General's Quarters, I handl'd thoſe nice Points
with a great deal of Freedom, and plainly told
'em my Opinion of the Revolution in <hi>England,</hi>
and of the Difference between King <hi>William</hi>'s Way
of making War, and that which was in Faſhion
among us. So bold a Declaration of my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
procur'd me the Title of the Prince of
<hi>Orange's</hi> Spy; and Complaints were made againſt
me to the Count <hi>de Marſin,</hi> Commander of the
Brigade, who order'd me to be apprehended, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51983:26"/>
carry'd to <hi>Strasburg;</hi> tho' I muſt own my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to him, that he forbore putting me in the
Mercy of a <hi>Council of War,</hi> till he ſhou'd receive
a clearer Information of my Crime; in order to
which he commanded my Trunks to be ſeiz'd,
where he found nothing to confirm his Suſpicions,
but a <hi>Book of Pſalms,</hi> which was a ſufficient Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
(of what I did not deny) that I had been
a <hi>Hugonot.</hi> But the Marqueſs <hi>d' Efiat</hi> had the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
(as I told you before) to give me ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a Character in a Letter which he wrote to
<hi>Monſieur de Chamilly</hi> on this Occaſion, that I was ſet
at Liberty after an Impriſonment of fifteen Days,
without any other Puniſhment, than that I was
oblig'd to hear the tedious Exhortations of certain
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Capuchins,</hi> to whom I promis'd to be a
<hi>Good Catholick</hi> for the future.</p>
               <p>We are inform'd that <hi>Mentz</hi> was ſurrender'd on
the 8<hi>th.</hi> inſtant, notwithſtanding the brave Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
made by the Marqueſs <hi>d' Uxelles,</hi> Governour
of the Place, who perform'd on this occaſion, all
that cou'd be expected from a Man of Courage and
an experienc'd Captain; and defended a Place which
is not very conſiderable for its Strength, againſt a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Army commanded by two Princes, on whom,
without running the hazard of being accus'd of
Flattery, I may beſtow the glorious Title of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes.</hi>
'Tis true he loſt a great number of Men; but
none that are acquainted with Affairs of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
will be ſurpriz'd at the leſſening of the Numbers
of a Garriſon that turn the War upon their Beſiegers,
and make three vigorous Sallies in one Day. The
moſt conſiderable Loſs they ſuſtain'd, was occaſion'd
by the general Aſſault of the Counterſcarp, on the
7<hi>th.</hi> inſtant in the Evening, which laſted five Hours,
and was both carry'd on, and receiv'd with ſuch an
obſtinate Fury, that few old Soldiers can pretend to
have ſeen ſo warm a Diſpute. But at laſt the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51983:26"/>
were forc'd to retire, their Powder failing,
and moſt of their Muſquets being ſplit; and the
<hi>Imperialiſts</hi> lodg'd themſelves on the Counterſcarp,
and began to fill up the Ditch, in order to aſſault the
Town, which oblig'd the Governour to beat a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
and <hi>Capitulate.</hi> The Garriſon march'd out with
their Arms and Baggage, Drums beating, Colours
flying, Matches lighted, and their Bullets in their
Mouths, with ſix Pieces of Cannon, and two Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.
I hear the King was ſo well ſatisfi'd with the
Marqueſs <hi>d' Uxelles</hi>'s Conduct on this Occaſion, that
he thought he ow'd him no leſs a Recompence for
making ſo brave a Defence, than the Government
of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> which is one of the moſt important
Places in his Dominions, beſides a Gratuity of 1200
Crowns, which he has already receiv'd. Nor cou'd
his Majeſty have choſen a more deſerving Object of
his Favour; for the Marqueſs <hi>d' Uxelles</hi> is not only
an excellent Captain, but in all other reſpects a
well-accompliſh'd Perſon. I never heard that he
was accus'd of any other Crimes, but Haughtineſs
to his Inferiour Officers, and an Inclination to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Pleaſures that were brought into Faſhion about
20 or 30 Years ago: but I am ſo far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to warrant the Truth of theſe Accuſations,
that I muſt confeſs I believe 'em to be meer malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Aſperſions.</p>
               <p>We have alſo receiv'd Advice, That <hi>Bonn</hi> is very
much ſtraiten'd; ſo that if the King loſe that Place,
he will only retain <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> of all the Conqueſts
his Son made laſt Year.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I muſt tell you, with all the
ſincerity of a Friend, that my late unjuſt Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
has mightily cool'd my Affection to the
<hi>French</hi> Service; and beſides, as young as I am, my
Thoughts aſpire ſometimes to more ſolid Objects
than bare Pleaſure. I'm e'en reſolv'd then in good
earneſt to encreaſe the number of the <hi>Refugees;</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51983:27"/>
I'm not a little confirm'd in that Reſolution, by a
ſeaſonable ſupply of Money I have juſt now receiv'd.
I have no other Buſineſs at preſent, than to put things
in Order for my Departure; intending to begin my
Journey in few Days, on the only Horſe I'm now
Maſter of, for my Servant carry'd away the other two,
which was my whole Equipage. I deſign in the firſt
place to viſit <hi>Geneva,</hi> and there to expect a freſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
of Money, before I begin my remoter Travels.</p>
               <p>I remember I have heard you expreſs a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be more particularly acquainted with
<hi>Strasburg,</hi> than the Accounts you have hitherto
receiv'd of it cou'd make you; and therefore I
ſhall take this Occaſion to ſatisfie your Curioſity
before I finiſh my Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Strasburg</hi> is a large City, very well built, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>German</hi> Faſhion, ſeated at the end of a
vaſt and fertil Field, extremely ſmooth and level,
ſo that you may diſcover the City from the
Mountains of <hi>Saverne,</hi> which are eight Leagues
diſtant from it. 'Tis waſh'd by the River <hi>Ill,</hi>
and divided into the Old and and New City
by the <hi>Beuſche;</hi> and both theſe Rivers fall into
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which is but a quarter of a League
diſtant from the Town. The Biſhop of this place
is Suffragan to the Elector of <hi>Mentz;</hi> and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the Cardinal of <hi>Furſtemberg</hi> is Biſhop of
<hi>Strasburg</hi> by the Mercy of God, and of the
Crown of <hi>France.</hi> The Count of <hi>Chamilly,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General
of his Majeſty's Armies, is Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
and Monſieur <hi>de Labadie</hi> formerly Major,
was made the King's Lieutenant ſince I came to
the City. 'Tis a very ancient City, but was
never acknowledged for a Republick till the time
of <hi>Luther,</hi> whoſe Doctrine it receiv'd: And its
Rights were never ſince diſputed till the Year
1682, when the King made himſelf Maſter of
it, as a Dependence, or rather the Capital City
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51983:27"/>
of <hi>Alſace,</hi> which belongs to him by Virtue of the
Treaty of <hi>Munſter.</hi> You are not unacquainted with
the Methods that were taken to juſtifie his Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The Eyes of ſome of the principal Burgoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
were ſo well enlighten'd with the Summ of
100000 Crowns, that all their Doubts were clear'd
in a Moment; and thoſe Conſcientious Magiſtrates
put his Majeſty in poſſeſſion of a Place to which
he had aſſerted his Right by ſuch convincing
Arguments, with all the Self-denial and Diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſedneſs
that cou'd be deſir'd. But this Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
was not made with the Unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the Citizens, the greateſt part of whom
bewail'd, and continue ſtill to bewail the Loſs
of their Liberty, which, next the Sovereign Good,
ought to be the deareſt Bleſſing to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Minds. Nor are their Complaints ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded;
for they have been extremely harras'd
of late, and even their Religion cou'd not eſcape
the Fury of their new Maſters. I know not what
Excuſe can be pretended for ſo manifeſt a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Rights of a free City, that ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on Condition that its Liberty, and all its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Privileges, ſhou'd be preſerv'd intire. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
if they be only conſider'd as Natives of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſace,</hi>
what plauſible Reaſon can be alledg'd why
they ſhou'd be treated with greater Severity than
the reſt of their Neighbours? Has not the King
an equal Right to the whole Province? and why
ſhou'd <hi>Strasburg</hi> be ſingl'd out for the Object of
his Indignation, ſince there are ſeveral leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Places in <hi>Alſace,</hi> whoſe Privileges are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to remain untouch'd? Thus, for Example,
the Inhabitants of St. <hi>Mary aux Mines,</hi> in the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
part of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> continue ſtill in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their ancient Rights; the River ſeparates
the Precinct of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from that of the
<hi>Catholicks:</hi> The ſame Privileges are common both
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51983:28"/>
to the Prieſts and Miniſters, and they live in a
peaceful Union without incroaching upon one
another. I was inform'd by the Guardian of the
<hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>deliers</hi> in that place, that when the Queen
came thither, in her Journey to receive the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phineſs,</hi>
ſhe reſolv'd to build a Chapel, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of a Vow ſhe had made, and appointed
the Place where it ſhou'd be erected in the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory
of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who immediately came
to beg her Majeſty not to violate their Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which they ſhew'd her; and ſhe was ſo well
ſatisfy'd with the Juſtice of their Deſire, that
ſhe was eaſily prevail'd with to countermand her
former Orders. And I can aſſure you, that the
Privileges of that paltry Village are ſtill preſerv'd
with ſo little innovation, that I have ſeen with
my own Eyes the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Divine Service by Turns in the Parochial
Church. But it ſeems the People of <hi>Strasburg</hi>
were not thought worthy of ſo favourable a
Treatment. The <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who were ſole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Cathedral, were compell'd to give
place to the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who are at preſent poſſeſs'd
both of that and moſt other Churches in the
City, tho' about twelve Years ago they cou'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pretend a Right to a Chapel that belongs
to the Order of <hi>Malta.</hi> This is certainly one of
the faireſt Churches in <hi>Europe;</hi> and I may venture
to ſay, that its Steeple cannot be parrallel'd in the
whole World: This magnificent Tower is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
with wonderful Art, and the Stones are all
exactly cut into ſeveral Figures, which charm the
Eye of the Spectator: Its heights amounts to 560
Foot, and its breadth to 52; the Doors are of
Braſs, and proportionable to the largeneſs of the
Building. Since the <hi>Catholicks</hi> became Maſters of
it, they have built a great Altar, according to the
Modern way, in the Floor of the Nave, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51983:28"/>
is of a Triangular Figure, with large Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Columns at the Angles, ſupporting a Dome
adorn'd with many <hi>Baſſo-relievo's,</hi> and fine
Paintings. The Tabernacle is in the middle of
the Altar, enrich'd with excellent Sculptures;
and all the other Ornaments are Beautiful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the poſſibility of Improvement. But all
the Charms of ſo rare a Piece of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
cannot long detain the Spectator from
ſatisfying his Curioſity with a View of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Clock built by the Chapter, which marks
the Minutes, Hours, Days of the Month and
Week, the Age of the Moon, Signs of the <hi>Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,</hi>
and the Centuries or Ages of the World,
by a Wheel that performs only one Round in
the ſpace of a hundred Years. If you wou'd
have the pleaſure to behold all the Beauties of
the Clock, you muſt wait till Noon, when the
twelve Apoſtles appear, and each knocks with a
Hammer on the Bell. The ſtriking of this, as
well as of all the reſt of the Hours, is preceded by
the crowing of a Cock, who claps' his Wings,
ſtretches out his Neck, and Crows ſo naturally,
that if your Eyes did not convince you that he
is made of Copper, you wou'd certainly conclude
him to be really that which he repreſents. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after the Hiſtory of the <hi>Annunciation</hi> appears,
the Door of the Virgin's Chamber opens, and the
Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> comes to intimate her Conception;
the Virgin, who is on her Knees at Prayer, turns
to hear his Meſſage; and at the ſame time the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> deſcends upon her Head in form of a
Dove: And all theſe Motions are perform'd with
an admirable Exactneſs.</p>
               <p>This beautiful Church is not the only Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Strasburg:</hi> The reſt of its Buildings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
an attentive Conſideration, eſpecially the
Fortifications, on which the King has beſtow'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51983:29"/>
ſuch prodigious Summs: The Citadel has its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Beauties, where the King entertains a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Cadets.</hi> But the City is ſo extremely
large, and lies ſo open, that all the Works with
which it is ſurrounded, cou'd hardly reſiſt the
Attacks of a powerful Enemy, if it were not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd
on all ſides by the impregnable Forts ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by his Majeſty's Order, on the Bridge over
the <hi>Rhine;</hi> for all the Advantage an Army cou'd
propoſe by taking the City while thoſe Forts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> wou'd amount
to no more than the Poſſeſſion of a large and
ſtrong Priſon.</p>
               <p>'Twou'd be needleſs to deſcribe the Manners
and Cuſtoms of the Inhabitants, ſince they are
ſo obſervant of all the Faſhions of their New
Maſters, that a meer Stranger wou'd imagine 'em
to be natural <hi>Frenchmen.</hi>

               <p>I Left <hi>Strasburg</hi> about the end of the laſt Month,
and paſſing by <hi>Saverne, Phalsburg,</hi> and <hi>Marſal,</hi>
(which is much different from what it was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore)
arriv'd at <hi>Metz</hi> in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> from whence
the Cardinal of <hi>Furſtemburg</hi> was gone ſome Days
before. He retir'd to this place in the beginning
of the Year, not thinking himſelf ſecure at <hi>Bonn:</hi>
And he was even ſo ſenſible of the Danger with
which that place was threaten'd, that he brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him the very Bolts of the Doors of
the Epiſcopal Palace. In the mean time he put
on a ſeeming Confidence, and talk'd of nothing
but Conqueſts and Electorates, promiſing great
things to all his Friends; and even levy'd two
Companies of Soldiers for his Guard, whom he
was afterwards forc'd to disband for want of
Money to pay 'em. I ſtaid two Days at <hi>Metz,</hi>
to conſider all its Rarities. The City is pretty
large, and tolerably well Fortify'd. There is a
Company of <hi>Cadets</hi> in the Citadel, which has
four Baſtions, with good Ditches full of Water.
The Cathedral, which is dedicated to S. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
is built on the declivity of a Hillock; ſo that
whereas we uſually aſcend to other Churches,
we muſt go down ſeven or eight Steps to this.
It is a large Building, tho' there is nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
in it but the Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſmal Font, conſiſting
of one piece of <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> about ten Foot long,
which is a Rarity in this Country. The Biſhop
aſſumes the Title of a <hi>Prince of the Holy Empire;</hi>
and is a Suffragan of the Elector of <hi>Triers.</hi> This
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51983:30"/>
City was formerly the Metropolis of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Auſtraſia,</hi> which <hi>Clovis</hi> I. gave to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Son <hi>Thierry,</hi> creating him the firſt King of
it: Afterwards it purchas'd its Liberty for the
Summ of 100000 Crowns, of <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bouillon,</hi>
at his departure for the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the Character of a Republick till the Year
1552, in which it was treacherouſly ſeiz'd by the
Conſtable <hi>de Montmorenci,</hi> in the Name of <hi>Henry</hi> II.
For pretending to go to the aſſiſtance of the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> he ask'd permiſſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the City, under pretext that he had fall'n ſick
by the Way; and the next Morning ſent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the Mayor and Echevins of the Town,
that he was deſirous to communicate an Affair
of great importance to 'em before his Death.
When he ſaw 'em all met together in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
he ſtarted up, and thruſt his Poniard into
the Mayor's Breaſt, for a Signal to his Followers
to ſtab the reſt of the Magiſtrates: And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after the Execution of that cruel Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
the <hi>French</hi> run about the Streets, crying, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
le Roy,</hi> and made themſelves Maſters of the
Gates, and afterwards of the whole City. About
the end of the ſame Year, it was in vain beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by <hi>Charles</hi> V. who was forc'd to make a
ſhameful Retreat by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the place. Since that unſucceſsful Attempt,
<hi>Metz</hi> remain'd ſtill under the Dominion or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Protection of our Kings: For the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
carry'd all their Appeals before the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Chamber at <hi>Spire,</hi> till <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. eſtabliſh'd
a Parliament in this place, extending its Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
over <hi>Toul, Verdun,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin.</hi>
The Emperour complain'd of this Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
nor was the Conteſt that happen'd on this
Occaſion entirely decided, till the Peace that was
concluded in 1648. Beſides the Parliament, the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51983:30"/>
King erected a new Court of Judicature here
ſome Years ago, which has had the Impudence
(if I may uſe that Expreſſion without expoſing
my ſelf to the ſame Cenſure) to cite before it
Kings and Sovereign Princes, to yield Homage
and Fealty for ſome Territories over which they
pretend to have a Right of Superiority, as the
Counties of <hi>Chini</hi> and <hi>Aloſt,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Deux-Ponts,</hi>
and ſeveral others.</p>
               <p>This is the only City in <hi>France</hi> where <hi>Jews</hi>
are permitted to ſettle; and there are even ſome
Towns in <hi>Alſace</hi> where they dare not lodge one
Night. At <hi>Strasburg</hi> they are forc'd to pay thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Sous</hi> at the Gate, before they are ſuffer'd to
enter the City; and I have been often ſurpriz'd
at the extraordinary dexterity of the Toll-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
in diſcovering a Man of that Nation.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Metz</hi> I came to <hi>Nanci,</hi> the chief City
of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and Reſidence of the Dukes of that
Name. 'Tis hardly poſſible that a Town which
has chang'd its Maſters ſo often, ſhou'd be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
for its Riches: However, 'tis very well
fortify'd; and the ſame Prince by whoſe Orders
'twas almoſt entirely ruin'd in 1661, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
pleas'd to repair it. The River <hi>Meurte</hi>
paſſes by the Walls, and fills the Ditches, which
are of a conſiderable Depth. The City is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into the High and Low Town; and the
Ducal Palace, which is ſeated in the former, is
a very large Structure, of an admirable
Architecture, and adorn'd with many fine Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.
Among its other Rarities, there is a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Figure of Wood, conſiſting of ſeveral Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
fitted together with ſo much Exactneſs and
Art, that it may be made to imitate all the
Motions and Geſtures of a living Man. S. <hi>George</hi>'s
Church is particularly remarkable for the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
Tombs of the Dukes that lie inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

About ſeven or eight Years ago this City was
depriv'd of two of its nobleſt Ornaments; the
famous Culverin, that ſhot a Bullet to S. <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
a Village two large Leagues from <hi>Nanci;</hi> and
the Brazen Horſe, that carri'd the Statue of one
of the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> Theſe are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the fineſt caſt Pieces in <hi>France,</hi> and were
always thought too heavy for Carriage, till a
certain Engineer undertook to remove 'em, and
ſucceeded in the Attempt. The latter was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to ſupport the King's Statue in the Place
of Conqueſts at <hi>Paris,</hi> but was found to be of
too ſmall a ſize; and the other was carry'd to
<hi>Dunkirk.</hi> The Inhabitants of this City, and, in
general, all the Third State (or Commons) of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> are ſtill extremely devoted to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of their true and natural Prince; and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
not to expreſs their Affection to him on all
Occaſions, with a certain innocent Frankneſs,
which together with their Clowniſh way of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is eſteem'd by the <hi>French</hi> rather worthy of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Anger. But the Nobility are ſo dazzl'd
with the glaring Proſpect of Court-Preferment,
that they ſeem to have quite forgot the loſs of
their ancient Privileges, which were ſo great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Government of their Dukes, that they
were in a manner Sovereign Princes; whereas at
preſent they are reduc'd to an equal Level with
the reſt of the Gentlemen of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>I ſtay'd not at <hi>Nanci,</hi> but continuing my Journey
towards <hi>Dijon,</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Langres</hi> in <hi>Champagne.</hi> This
City is ſeated on a Mountain almoſt inacceſſible on
all ſides: but the Inhabitants have no reaſon to be
proud of the ſtrength of its Situation, which makes
it a kind of Priſon; for the Deſcent from the Town
is extremely uneaſie, and a Man may without Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
boaſt of his Lungs, if he can climb from the
bottom of the Hill to the Gate, without loſing his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51983:31"/>
Breath. The People of the Country call this the
<hi>Maiden-City,</hi> both becauſe it has not been taken for
ſeveral Ages, and by reaſon of its Fidelity to the
Crown: The Biſhop is both a Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Lord, and has the Title of Duke and Peer of
<hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Day I paſs'd thro' one of the moſt
charming and fertil Plains in <hi>France,</hi> and arriv'd at
<hi>Dijon.</hi> The City begins to appear at a conſiderable
diſtance, and preſents a Traveller with the pleaſant
Proſpect of 100 Spires that overtop the Houſes; for
which reaſon <hi>Dijon</hi> is uſually call'd the <hi>Town of Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
'Tis ſeated on the Banks of the <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>che</hi> and <hi>Suſon,</hi>
and was founded by the Emperour <hi>Aurelian,</hi> tho'
ſome affirm that 'tis much more ancient, and that
he only repair'd it. But not to invade the Province
of Antiquaries, I ſhall content my ſelf with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
you that 'tis a very fine City: The Streets are
large and fair, the Courts ſpacious, the Buildings
very beautiful, and the Churches extremely magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent.
Among the reſt I cannot forbear taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the famous Abbey of S. <hi>Benign,</hi> which was
built by <hi>Gregory,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Langres,</hi> after he had
miraculouſly found the Body of that Saint. 'Tis
one of the largeſt, and higheſt Structures that are
anywhere to be ſeen, adorn'd with three Stone-Spires,
the heighth of which is ſuitable to the reſt
of the Building. The Abbey-Church of S. <hi>Stephen</hi> is
on the other Side of the City, and is no leſs remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for its Beauty. The Front of <hi>Our Lady's</hi> Church
ſurpaſſes all the reſt, conſiſting of a large Clock-Tower
all over wrought, riſing between two others
ſmaller, but no leſs curiouſly adorn'd, which charm
the Eyes of the Beholder. S. <hi>John's</hi> Church, the
Holy Chapel, the Convents of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and
<hi>Cordeliers,</hi> and generally all the reſt of the Churches
and Convents deſerve particular Obſervation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that of the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> without the City,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51983:32"/>
towards the <hi>Red Gate,</hi> which is one of the richeſt
Monaſteries in the Kingdom. There are a hundred
<hi>Monks</hi> in it, who obſerve with ſo religious a Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
their Vows of Solitude and Silence, that a
Stranger viſiting the Place wou'd be tempted to
think it were uninhabited. And I may venture to
add, that perhaps they may make a better uſe of
their Revenues than any other Convent in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
for beſides a conſiderable Summ which they
give to the Hoſpital of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
every Week five or ſix hundred Loaves to the
Poor. They have a very fine Cloyſter, and a finer
Church, where the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and a King
of <hi>Poland</hi> lie interr'd in magnificent Tombs.</p>
               <p>On a Hillock, on the other Side of the City,
there is a Convent of one of the Orders of <hi>Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi>
Friers, ſaid to be the Houſe of S. <hi>Bernard's</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was Lord of the Place that ſtill retains
the Name of <hi>Bourg-fontaines.</hi> The Room where he
was born, which is a very little and low Hall, of a
ſquare Figure, is turn'd to a Chapel, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
over the Door: <hi>Come, my Children, and I
will bring you into the Houſe of my Father, and into
the Chamber where my Mother brought me forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dijon</hi> is the Capital City of the Dutchy of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy:</hi>
'tis the Seat of a Parliament, Generality or
general Receipt of the <hi>Finances,</hi> Chamber of <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,</hi>
and a Court that takes Cognizance of Affairs
relating to the Coining and Value of Money; and
beſides the States of the Province meet here once in
three Years: ſo that it wants only the Dignity of
an <hi>Epiſcopal See,</hi> being under the Juriſdiction of the
Biſhop of <hi>Langres.</hi> It had formerly very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Privileges; and our Kings at their Acceſſion to
the Crown, and as often as they enter'd into the
City, were oblig'd to ſwear to preſerve 'em. But
that Cuſtom was aboliſh'd by the preſent King,
when he paſs'd this way to receive the Queen at her
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51983:32"/>
Arrival from <hi>Spain.</hi> For when the <hi>Mayor</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with the reſt of the Magiſtrates, preſented
the Keys of the City, together with a Copy of
their Privileges to his Majeſty, humbly beſeeching
him that he wou'd ſwear to preſerve 'em, after the
Example of all his Predeceſſors, and even of the
late King of Glorious Memory; Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>
reply'd, <hi>Are you ſo inſolent as to impoſe an Oath upon
your King?</hi> The Magiſtrates ſurpriz'd at ſo ſevere a
Reprimand, anſwer'd with a great deal of Reſpect,
that they pretended not to impoſe any thing, but
only begg'd and hop'd to obtain that Favour from
his Majeſty's Juſtice and Goodneſs. <hi>I underſtand
your Meaning,</hi> reply'd the Cardinal, <hi>you wou'd be a
Free City and Commonwealth. And I aſſure you, in
his Majeſty's Name, that, without taking an Oath,
he conſiders you as ſuch, but prepare your ſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his Conqueſt.</hi> This Threatning was quickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted,
for the next Day 8000 Men enter'd the
City, and the Cardinal made a general Alteration
in the Magiſtracy. The Mayoralty of <hi>Dijon</hi> was
the beſt Place of that Nature in <hi>France;</hi> for beſides
the Title of a Viſcount, the Government of the
City, and of all the Third Eſtate or Commonalty
of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was annex'd to it. The Inhabitants of
this City are generally of a very free and ſociable
Temper, and the Women enjoy all the Advantages
of an honeſt Liberty. So charming a Society puts
a kind of eaſie Conſtraint upon Strangers, and
makes 'em break all their Reſolutions of haſtening
their Departure: for 'tis impoſſible to ſtay here four
and twenty Hours without making ſome agreeable
Acquaintance, which may afterwards prove the
Source of a great deal of Pleaſure. The narrow
Compaſs of a Letter will not allow me to inſert
the Relation of a very pleaſant Adventure that I
met with in this place; but I'm reſolv'd to make

                  <hi>CHaalons</hi> is a conſiderable City, honour'd with
the Title of a <hi>County,</hi> and is the ſame with the
ancient <hi>Cabilonum</hi> mention'd in <hi>Caeſar's Commentaries.</hi>
It appears by the Ruines of an old <hi>Amphitheatre,</hi>
that this place was formerly poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
I lodg'd at the <hi>Pelican,</hi> where I had the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to meet with three Merchants of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who
were returning thither, and promis'd to ſhew me
all the Rarities of that City. We had ſcarce tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
a Mile, when we met with a Prieſt walking
a-foot, in a pretty genteel Garb: He was a Man
of a very ſerious Mien, but talk'd wittily. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
the Civility of one of our Company, who
offer'd him the Conveniency of riding behind him
half a League of bad way, thro' which we were
oblig'd to paſs. This Accident gave us occaſion to
diſcourſe of the Uneaſineſs of travelling on Foot,
and of the Happineſs of thoſe who by Virtue of
certain <hi>Charms,</hi> can ride 30 or 40 Leagues a day.
I was never fond of believing what I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51983:33"/>
and I muſt confeſs my Reaſon was too
hard for my Faith on this Occaſion. However I
know not whether I ſhou'd have been able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Oppoſition of ſome of my Fellow-Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
if he who had the Prieſt behind him had
not vigorouſly undertaken my Defence. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
continu'd for ſome time pretty warm on both
ſides, till our mutual Wearineſs rather than Want
of Arguments, made us at laſt conſent to chuſe the
Prieſt, who had not yet ſided with either Party,
to be Judge of our Difference. He very gravely
told us, that the controverted Story was a certain
Truth, and that he knew ſome Perſons who were
Maſters of that Secret; I cou'd not forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the ſerious Tone with which he pronounc'd
Sentence againſt me; and he was ſo vex'd at my
Incredulity, that he began to maintain his Aſſertion
with a great deal of heat. Immediately his Fellow-Horſeman
took up the Cudgels, and they engag'd
in a Debate which laſted about a Quarter of an
Hour; till at laſt the Prieſt perceiving that 'twas
in vain to contend longer with ſo obſtinate an
Adverſary, told us plainly that he himſelf cou'd do
the Feat, tho' he never us'd to put it in Practice;
and that if his Opponent had a Mind to ſee the
Experiment, he wou'd make his Horſe carry him
to <hi>Maſcon</hi> in two Hours. The Merchant took him
at his word, and ſummon'd him to perform his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
to which he conſented, and immediately the
Horſe gallop'd away with ſo prodigious a Swiftneſs,
that we loſt ſight of 'em in a Moment. This Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
did not much ſurprize us at firſt; for we
thought the Prieſt had a Spur conceal'd in his hand,
with which he prick'd the Horſe: in the mean time
we rode on, but cou'd neither ſee, nor hear the
leaſt News of our Gallopers till we arriv'd at <hi>Maſcon</hi>
on the morrow, where we found the Merchand ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
melancholick. He told us that he was carry'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51983:34"/>
to <hi>Maſcon</hi> exactly in two Hours after he left us, with
ſo much Eaſe, that he imagin'd all the while he
was riding at a Hand-Gallop; but that his Horſe
fell dead aſſoon as he enter'd the Stable. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that the Prieſt was a <hi>Wizard,</hi> and was ſo
firmly perſwaded of the Truth of his Opinion, by
the concurring Teſtimony of our Landlord, who
knew the Man, that he enter'd an Accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and procur'd him to be apprehended
the ſame day. I was oblig'd to give Evidence with
the reſt, and to declare all that I had ſeen him do,
which, in my Opinion, cou'd not amount to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Proof of his Guilt. I know no Reaſon
that ſhou'd hinder us from ſuppoſing that a good
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe, ſuch as the Merchant's was, might
with a good Spur be made to gallop eight Leagues
in two hours, and without any Enchantment fall
dead at his Journey's End. Yet this Accident made
a great Noiſe, and the <hi>Poor Devil</hi> was ſent to Priſon,
where I left him. I had almoſt forgot to tell you
that they found in his Pockets a Piece of Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
four fingers breadth long, and two broad,
with this Sentence in <hi>Red Letters, Adjutor meus, &amp;
Protector meus, tu Domine, nè derelinquas me,</hi> with four
ſmall <hi>Croſſes,</hi> one at each End, one above, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
below, which they fanſi'd to be a certain <hi>Charm</hi>
or <hi>Character.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Maſcon</hi> we proceeded on our Journey to
<hi>Lyons,</hi> where I was forc'd to ſell my Horſe, who
was gall'd under the Saddle-Bow. I reſolv'd to
ſpend ſome Days in this Place, that I might have
time to take a full View of a City that is eſteem'd
the Largeſt and moſt Conſiderable in the Kingdom,
next to <hi>Paris,</hi> and is certainly worthy of all the
Curioſity of a Traveller. 'Tis ſeated at the Conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the <hi>Rhone</hi> and the <hi>Saône,</hi> in a Bottom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Hills. The Houſes equal, or rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
thoſe of <hi>Paris</hi> in Heighth, ſome of 'em amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51983:34"/>
to ſix Stories; which makes the Streets
ſomewhat Dark, by reaſon of their Narrowneſs.
There are many fine Courts in the City, but none
of 'em are comparable to <hi>Belle-Cour,</hi> which is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh'd
with Rows of Trees; tho' its principal
Ornament conſiſts in the Company that reſort to
it; for 'tis the general Rendezvous of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Quality and good Breeding; and ſince the
Ladies here are no leſs Generous than Charming,
and cannot juſtly be accus'd of Inhumanity to
their Captives, there are many Intrigues form'd in
this Place, which are carry'd on with all the
Tenderneſs and Pleaſure that a reciprocal Paſſion
can inſpire.</p>
               <p>To give you a compendious Account of the
publick Edifices in <hi>Lions,</hi> in which reſpect it holds
the firſt Rank, without Controverſy, among all
the Cities of <hi>France;</hi> I ſhall begin with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan
Church, dedicated to S. <hi>John,</hi> and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> on the Ruines of
a Temple formerly conſecrated to <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> There
is a <hi>Clock</hi> near the Choir, which ſurpaſſes that
of <hi>Strasburg</hi> in the fineneſs of its Contrivance and
Workmanſhip; for, beſides all the Rarities men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in the Deſcription of that famous Machine,
the Clock of <hi>Lions</hi> has ſeveral peculiar Beauties;
among which I ſhall only take notice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
that Chants the Hymn of S. <hi>John</hi> with all
the exactneſs imaginable. The Needle that marks
the Hours, and grows longer or ſhorter according
to the various dimenſions of the Oval Dial, and
the Days of the Week mark'd by Figures that
appear every Morning in a Nich on the top of
the Clock, in the room of thoſe that poſſeſs'd
the ſame place the Day before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King of France</hi> by Virtue of his Crown, is
the firſt <hi>Canon</hi> of this Church; and all the reſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51983:35"/>
have the Title of <hi>Counts;</hi> and muſt prove their
Nobility before they can be receiv'd.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral other Magnificent Churches
in <hi>Lions.</hi> That of <hi>Nôtre-dame de Forvieres</hi> is one
of the moſt ancient, which was formerly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to <hi>Venus.</hi> Every curious Traveller ought to
view the City from the Steeple of this Church,
where he may have a diſtinct Proſpect of its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and Situation. Adjoining to this are the
Ruines of the Palace of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Amphitheatre, where Learned and Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Antiquaries may find an excellent Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to diſplay their Skill in the Examination
of an infinite Number of Inſcriptions, Statues,
Tombs, Urns, Medals, and other rich Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Grandeur. But my unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedneſs
with thoſe Studies makes me purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decline entring upon this Subject; ſince I'm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
you'll be better pleas'd with my Silence,
than if I ſhou'd ſend you an imperfect or erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Account, under the ſpecious Title of <hi>A
Deſcription of the Antiquities of</hi> Lions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Town-Houſe</hi> is a Maſter-piece of Art, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
furniſh'd with all the Advantages and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of Beauty, Situation, Extent, Height,
Architecture, Marbles, Paintings, Gardens, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
Antiquities, and every thing elſe that may
recommend a Building to the Obſervation of a
Curious and Knowing Traveller. Its Front re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
the <hi>Place des Terreaux,</hi> which is one of the
moſt pleaſant Courts in in the City; and before
it there is a lovely Fountain, which is none of
its leaſt Conſiderable Ornaments. In the firſt place
I took notice of a large Clock-Tower, riſing between
two high Pavilions, under which is the Entry to the
Palace adorn'd with large Columns of a precious kind
of Marble. Then I went up ſome Steps, and
coming under the Pavilions, obſerv'd two Tables
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51983:35"/>
of Braſs, where I found engrav'd in Ancient Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
the Patent granted by the Emperour <hi>Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
to the Inhabitants of <hi>Lions,</hi> when he beſtow'd
the Privileges of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens upon 'em. From
thence I enter'd into the Firſt, and afterwards
into the Second Court, where I conſider'd with
a great deal of Pleaſure and Attention, the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
and Deſign of that Majeſtick Maſs of Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
which is of a Square Figure, and bounded
at the four Corners with as many large and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high Pavilions. Afterwards I went down to
the Garden, which is embelliſh'd with Gravel
Walks, Beds of Flowers, Fountains, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
other Ornaments. After I had ſatisfy'd my
Curioſity with a View of the external Beauties of
this Noble Structure, I return'd to admire the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of it. I went up a pair of winding Stairs,
of a very excellent Contrivance, to the Hall,
where I was agreeably ſurpriz'd with its Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Gilding, Paintings, and eſpecially a great
number of Pictures of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> which
are all finiſh'd Pieces: And in the the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments
I obſerv'd a vaſt variety of different
Beauties, which I dare not undertake to deſcribe.
I ſpent the whole Morning in this Houſe, and
employ'd the Afternoon with a great deal of
Satisfaction, in viſiting the <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> which may
be reckon'd among the moſt conſiderable Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of that Nature in <hi>France. Hòtel Dieu</hi> is a
ſpacious Structure, well built, and very rich:
All ſorts of diſeas'd Perſons are receiv'd into it;
ſo that 'tis always very full, and wou'd hardly
be able to maintain ſo vaſt a Charge, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the greatneſs of its Revenues, if the
Archbiſhop did not beſtow upon it the Profits
accruing from the Diſpenſation of eating Eggs,
Milk, Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Hoſpital <hi>de la Charite</hi> is a
Modern Foundation; and tho' tis not near ſo large
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51983:36"/>
as the former, it may be juſtly reckon'd equal to
it in other reſpects. On the top of a great Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
that ſerves for an Entry to the Building,
there is the Figure of a <hi>Pelican,</hi> tearing her Breaſt,
to feed her young ones; the true Emblem of
<hi>Charity</hi> I obſerv'd one thing at <hi>Lions</hi> which I
had not ſeen in any other part of <hi>France,</hi> I mean
the Place of <hi>Refuge</hi> for Criminals, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Church nor Royal Palace, but a Houſe
appointed for that Purpoſe, and uſually call'd the
<hi>Sanctuary.</hi> Towards the Gate <hi>des Trions,</hi> I ſaw the
<hi>Aqueducts</hi> that were built by the <hi>Romans</hi> for the
Conveyance of Water into the City; and not far
from thence there is a Cave, call'd the <hi>Grotto,</hi>
which is alſo ſaid to be one of their Works.
The Country about the City is embelliſh'd with
a vaſt number of lovely Seats, among which <hi>la
Duchere</hi> and <hi>la Claire</hi> deſerve a particular Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The City has ſix Gates, three Bridges, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two hundred Streets, and above a hundred
Churches, Convents, or Chapels. The Archbiſhop
is the chief Prelate of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and by Virtue
of his Primacy receives Appeals from all the
parts of <hi>France</hi> in Eccleſiaſtical Caſes. Monſieur
<hi>de Villeroy</hi> is the preſent Archbiſhop, and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General
of the whole Province. He is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
of a very honourable Family, but is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
one of the rougheſt and leaſt Complaiſant
Men in the World. I cannot forbear relating
to you, upon this occaſion, a very pleaſant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
that paſs'd between this Prelate and
Monſieur <hi>de la Feuillade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Mareſchal, ſays the Story, riding Poſt to
<hi>Turin,</hi> in a very mean Garb, to diſpatch ſome
Affairs of Importance, ſtopt at <hi>Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns</hi> to deliver a
Packet from the King to the Archbiſhop, who
taking the Bearer for an Ordinary Courier, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he pretended to no higher Quality, ask'd
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51983:36"/>
him, <hi>Whether there were any</hi> News <hi>at Paris.</hi> Green
Peaſe, <hi>my Lord,</hi> reply'd the Mareſchal. <hi>You miſtake
my meaning, Friend,</hi> ſaid the Archbiſhop; <hi>I wou'd
know what People were</hi> ſaying <hi>when you left Paris?
My Lord,</hi> anſwer'd the Mareſchal, <hi>they were</hi> ſaying
<hi>Veſpers.</hi> Then the Prelate perceiving that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Courier abus'd him, fell into a Paſſion, ſaying,
<hi>How, Friend? where were you taught to ſpeak thus to
Perſons of my Quality and Character? What are you?—What
do People uſe to</hi> call <hi>you? Why, my Lord,</hi> reply'd
the Mareſchal, <hi>ſome are pleas'd to</hi> call <hi>me Friend,
others Monſieur, and the King calls me Couſin.</hi> Theſe
Words ſurpriz'd the Archbiſhop, who, conſidering
the Mareſchal more attentively, at laſt knew him,
and made an Apology for his incivility. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
I can hardly be induc'd to believe that a
Man of his Quality wou'd have ſtoop'd to ſuch
<hi>punning Wit,</hi> which is only graceful in the Mouth of
a true <hi>Courier:</hi> Tho' 'tis well known that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de la Feuillade</hi> was a Perſon of a very odd
and ſingular Humour. You have doubtleſs read
what an Author of great Reputation relates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Diſcourſe to the King about the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Rheims;</hi> and if you can believe that
Story, you will not think this incredible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lions</hi> is a very ancient City, known to <hi>Titus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
and <hi>Plutarch</hi> by the Name of <hi>The Iſland.</hi> The
Name which it ſtill retains was given to it by
<hi>Anthony,</hi> (who obtain'd <hi>Celtica Gallia</hi> for his part of
the Empire) when he enter'd the City on a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
Chariot drawn by twelve <hi>Lions;</hi> and he
afterwards caus'd Money to be coin'd in the ſame
place, of which I have ſeen ſome Pieces, bearing his
Figure on one ſide, and on the other a <hi>Lion,</hi> with
the Word <hi>Lugduni.</hi> The Town it ſelf neither is,
nor can be made very ſtrong; but 'tis comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by three good Caſtles which defend its Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.
The firſt is the famous Fort of <hi>Peter An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:51983:37"/>
built on the top of a ſteep Mountain, with
the rare Advantage of an excellent Spring of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
the ſecond is that of S. <hi>Sebaſtian;</hi> and the
third has the Name of S. <hi>Clair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I intended to have gone directly from <hi>Lions</hi> to
<hi>Geneva;</hi> but I ſoon found that I cou'd not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
that Deſign without throwing my ſelf
into unavoidable Dangers; for the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are ſo
narrowly watch'd every where, that 'tis abſolutely
impoſſible to travel thither without a Paſs-port, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
a Man were Maſter of the Invention of fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thro' the Air. Nor is it very ſafe to demand
a Paſs-port of the Archbiſhop; for very lately he
order'd two Merchants to be apprehended, for
no other reaſon than that they were going to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</hi>
That <hi>Name</hi> alone is ſufficient to make any
Man paſs for a <hi>Heretick</hi> that dares venture to
pronounce it; and he may reckon himſelf favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
treated if his Crime be not immediately
judg'd worthy of the <hi>Gallows.</hi> You cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
with what care I avoid the mentioning of
ſo dangerous a Word; and, I aſſure you, I'm ſo
much in Love with the Principle of <hi>Self-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that I talk of nothing but <hi>Rome;</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that the only Deſign of my Travels is to
wait upon the Duke <hi>de Chaûnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this Caution, and the Commotions that
at preſent diſturb this Country, are occaſion'd
by the return of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> who arming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the Canton of <hi>Bern</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> with
a Secrecy that prevented even the Suſpicions of
their Enemies, form'd two Bodies, one of 1200,
and the other of 3000 Men; and embarking on
the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> forc'd their way thro' <hi>Savoy</hi>
to their own Country, in ſpite of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Forces of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> who oppos'd their
Paſſage, and oblig'd 'em to five or ſix Battels,
or rather Skirmiſhes, in which the <hi>Vaudois</hi> had
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51983:37"/>
ſtill the Advantage; but all thoſe who were
caught ſtraggling were made to pay for their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and immediately hang'd without Mercy.
'Tis impoſſible for a conſidering Perſon to reflect
without amazement, on the Succeſs of that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.
The firſt Body of thoſe poor Exiles had
ſo little Experience in the Management of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Expeditions, that there was not one Officer
among 'em to conduct the reſt; for they had no
other Commanders but one Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> a
Miniſter, and under him a Maſon, nam'd <hi>Turel,</hi>
for their Lieutenant-General. Judge, Sir, whether
ſuch doughty Captains were fitted for the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement
of an Attempt, which a Triple num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of regulated Troops durſt not have undertaken.
This Conſideration makes me very inclinable to
believe that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> not only knew and
allow'd, but was the Promoter, and even the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of their Deſign; eſpecially ſince 'tis plain
that he might have eaſily prevented the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, by cutting off their Paſſage, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
'em periſh in the Mountains.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid enough to convince you, that 'tis
not ſafe for me to proſecute my intended Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Geneva;</hi> however I'll leave no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſay'd,
to get out of the limits of <hi>France,</hi> and to
break thro' all the Difficulties that lie in my
Way. In purſuance of that Deſign, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
ſeems in a manner impracticable, I'm reſolv'd
at all Adventures to go to <hi>Grenoble,</hi> that I may
at leaſt draw <hi>nearer</hi> the Confines of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
in expectation of a more favourable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to get <hi>beyond</hi> 'em. I am,</p>

               <p>I Acquainted you in my laſt with my Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to continue my Journey to <hi>Grenoble.</hi> At
my departure from <hi>Lions</hi> I hir'd a <hi>Poſt-Aſs</hi> at
S. <hi>Siforins,</hi> out of pure Curioſity to try ſo rare
an Experiment: Tho' I muſt confeſs this way of
Travelling is not altogether without its Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
for the Rider may boldly venture a Fall,
without running the hazard of breaking his Neck.
I paſs'd thro' <hi>Vienne,</hi> a very Ancient City, and
of Old much eſteem'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
its diſadvantageous Situation at the
bottom of two great Mountains, which dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Place extremely. <hi>Pilate,</hi> the Governour
of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and our Saviour's Judge, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſent hither; and they ſtill ſhow the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium,</hi>
or Hall of Juſtice, where he was wont to
pronounce Judgment. There is a round Stone in
the Wall with this Inſcription, <hi>This is the Globe of
Pilate's Scepter;</hi> tho' its unfitneſs for ſuch an Uſe
makes me rather inclinable to believe, that the
Inſcription ſpeaks of the Houſe, which might be
call'd <hi>The Globe of a Sceptre,</hi> by way of Figure or
Alluſion. They alſo make Strangers take notice
of a ſquare Tower, where they pretend he ended
his Days, after an Impriſonment of Seven Years.
The City is full of ſuch-like Antiquities, which
are the only things in it that deſerve a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's
Obſervation; for the Buildings are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable.
S. <hi>Severus's</hi> Church ſtands in a Place
where formerly the <hi>Heathens</hi> ador'd a <hi>Hundred Gods,</hi>
under a great Tree, that was afterwards cut
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51983:38"/>
down and rooted up by that Saint's Order, as
appears by this Inſcription on a Column:
<q>Arborem Deos Severus evertit<lb/>
Centum Deorum.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There goes a Story, that under that Tree there
was found a <hi>Death's-Head,</hi> full of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
with which the Church was built. I will
not pretend to demonſtrate the falſeneſs of this
Tradition; but I think I may venture to conclude,
that either the Head was very big, or the Wages
of Workmen in thoſe Days very low; for ſuch a
Structure cou'd not now be erected for ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Crowns.</p>
               <p>Without the City, in a place call'd <hi>The Field de
l' Aguillé,</hi> there is an high <hi>Pyramid,</hi> conſiſting of
ſeveral Stones join'd together without Mortar or
Cement, and ſupported by an Ancient Vault of
the ſame kind of Architecture, reſembling a little
Chapel. The Inhabitants of <hi>Vienne</hi> pretend that
this Pyramid was erected by an Emperour, with
a Deſign that his Aſhes ſhou'd be plac'd in an
Urn on the top of it, that his Tomb might be
nearer Heaven. The Archiepiſcopal Church is
conſecrated to S. <hi>Maurice,</hi> whoſe Head is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in it. The Archbiſhop aſſumes the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Primate of the Primates of the Gauls;</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a right to that Title, in oppoſition to the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> againſt whom he has a Suit
on this Occaſion, that (if we we may judge by
Appearances) will not be ſoon decided. <hi>Vienne</hi>
was the Capital City of <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> before the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a Parliament at <hi>Grenoble;</hi> and therefore
the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> among the reſt of their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
ſtyle themſelves <hi>Dauphins of Viennois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thence continuing my Journey, mounted
as before, at the rate of five <hi>Sous</hi> by the Stage,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51983:39"/>
which is the ordinary Price; I and my Aſs had
the Fortune to meet with a Couple of Fellow-Travellers.
Immediately I accoſted my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and finding nothing either in his Mien or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
that deſerv'd Contempt, I concluded that
he was a Merchant of <hi>Lions</hi> or <hi>Grenoble.</hi> About
two Hours after our Meeting, perceiving at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
diſtance a Coach drawn by Six Horſes,
and attended with ſome Horſemen, coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, he preſently alighted, and turn'd his
Aſs looſe: Then ſhrinking up one of his Arms,
and turning it awry, as if he had been Lame, he
walk'd bare-headed to the Boot of the Coach, and
begg'd Charity of the Paſſengers. I was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſurpriz'd at ſo odd and unexpected an Action,
nor cou'd I divine the Meaning of it; for I
thought it almoſt impoſſible that a Man, who, I
imagin'd, was neither Poor nor Sick, cou'd be
guilty of ſo much Baſeneſs: However, ſince my
Beaſt had already carry'd me ſo far, that I cou'd
not obſerve diſtinctly what he ſaid or did, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to ſuſpend my Judgment till I ſhou'd learn
the reaſon of it from his own Mouth. Aſſoon
as he came up, I ask'd what he went to do at
the Coach; <hi>Somewhat,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>that will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſurprize you: Perhaps you did not believe me to be
a profeſs'd Beggar; yet I aſſure you I have no other
Trade; and if you ſtay at</hi> Grenoble, <hi>you may be a
Witneſs of my Diligence in that Vocation. I'm going
to the Hoſpital in that City, where I'm ſure of a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for three Days, during which I hope to get three
Piſtoles.</hi> I was no leſs aſtoniſh'd at what I heard
him ſay, than at what I had already ſeen him
do: But he went on with the ſame Frankneſs,
and told me the whole Hiſtory of his Life. He
ſaid he was born at <hi>Avignon,</hi> of a conſiderable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
in that City, and that he had actually a
Revenue of above 200 Livres; that during his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51983:39"/>
Infancy he had ſo ſtrong an Inclination to Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
that he uſually ſtole away from his Father
and Mother to ask Alms on the High-ways;
where he ſometimes pick'd up twenty or thirty
<hi>Sous</hi> a Day, which made him ſo fond of that
Courſe of Life, that he cou'd never afterwards
leave it. He aſſur'd me, that the Trade of
Begging was attended at leaſt with as much
Pleaſure as Pain; and that he was ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd
to it, that he was reſolv'd to make it
the only Buſineſs of his Life. In the mean
time I hearken'd to him with an Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that wou'd not ſuffer me to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
him; and he ſcrupl'd not to acquaint me
with moſt of the uſual Tricks of his <hi>Fellow-Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds.</hi>
They ſpend their whole Lives in wandring
from one Hoſpital to another, and know exactly
all the Cuſtoms of thoſe Places, and the various
Offices of Charity that were appointed by the
Founders to be perform'd in 'em. Some of 'em
cover themſelves with Rags, and putting their
Arms or Legs out of Joint, take up their Poſt at
a Church Door from Morning to Night, while
others go about in a pretty decent Garb, and
pretending to be poor Officers who have been
robb'd of their Money, and are at a great diſtance
from their Friends and Relations, beg the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Aſſiſtance of thoſe whom they meet, with
a certain Baſhfulneſs, and mournful Tone, that
deceives many well-diſpos'd Perſons. He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
me in all theſe Myſteries, was of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Order, and contemn'd the others as a ſort
of <hi>Puny Mumpers,</hi> who had neither Courage nor
Ambition: Adding, that he got more in a Day
that the beſt of them cou'd do in a whole Month.
Nevertheleſs theſe <hi>Strolers</hi> depend not wholly on
Charity; they have another Trade which is no
leſs Gainful than Begging, I mean the ſelling of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51983:40"/>
                  <hi>Paſs-Ports</hi> to Travellers. My Companion percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that I had none, deſir'd me to buy one of
him; and at the firſt Inn where we alighted,
ſhew'd me at leaſt a Hundred. I ask'd him the
Price of One: <hi>There are ſome,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>of all
Prices, as well as other Commodities; for ſome are Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,
others forg'd; ſome of an old, others of a freſh
Date; and if you will be ſatisfy'd with ſuch as are
Counterfeit, you ſhall have 'em for fifteen</hi> Sous <hi>a-piece.</hi>
I thank'd him for his Ingenuity; but told him,
that I cou'd not truſt to a falſe <hi>Paſs-Port. Yet
they are as ſure as the reſt,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>for they
are never call'd in Queſtion; and all the Authentick</hi>
Paſs-Ports <hi>I have, are procur'd on the Credit of ſuch
as I wrote with my own Hand, for otherwiſe they
wou'd not give me any: However, you may pleaſe your
ſelf both in the Choice and Goodneſs of your Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for I have ſome for all Places.</hi> Then I ask'd him
one for <hi>Geneva;</hi> but he told me, that to his great
Sorrow and Loſs, 'twas impoſſible to obtain one
for that Place; aſſuring me, that if he had a
Hundred of 'em, he cou'd diſpoſe of 'em all at
the Rate of Ten Piſtoles a-piece. At laſt I gave
him two Piſtoles for a <hi>Paſs-Port</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be granted by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> to one
<hi>Bidault,</hi> and afterwards ratify'd and approv'd at <hi>Vienne.</hi>
He ſwore and proteſted that 'twou'd infallibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
me an unqueſtion'd Paſſage; but the extream
deſire I had to make my Eſcape out of <hi>France</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than any Credit I gave to his Aſſeverations,
made me willing to run the Hazard; tho', after
all, I apprehended the Danger to be greater than
it really was: For aſſoon as I preſented my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<hi>Paſs-Port</hi> to the Marqueſs <hi>de S. André,</hi> he
granted me another without the leaſt Difficulty, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
me to paſs thro' <hi>Chambery, S. John de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienne,</hi>
and <hi>Turin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:51983:40"/>
                  <hi>Grenoble</hi> became the Capital City of <hi>Dauphiné,</hi>
when <hi>Charles</hi> VII. eſtabliſh'd a Parliament in it,
and has ever ſince continu'd in the poſſeſſion of
that Dignity. This Country was bequeath'd to
King <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> by <hi>Humbert,</hi> the laſt Prince
of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> on condition that from thenceforth
the Preſumptive Heir of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi>
ſhou'd be ſtil'd <hi>Dauphin of Viennois;</hi> and bear in
his Coat-Armorial the Arms of <hi>France</hi> quarter'd
with thoſe of <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> which are, Or, <hi>a Dolphin</hi>
Azure, <hi>Creſted, Finn'd, and Ear'd</hi> Gules. The Tomb
of <hi>Andrew, Humbert's</hi> Son, is in the Church of the
<hi>Dominicans</hi> that fronts the <hi>Place de Grenette,</hi> which
is the fineſt in <hi>Grenoble,</hi> both for its Largeneſs, and
the Magnificence of the Building with which 'tis
adorn'd, eſpecially the Parliament-Houſe, to which
you enter thro' a Court, border'd with Shops full
of all ſorts of Commodities: 'Tis of an Antique
Structure, and the Chambers are very well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.
The Governour's Houſe is large, and
has the Advantage of a very pleaſant Proſpect.
The Epiſcopal Church of <hi>Nôtre-Dame</hi> is another
Piece of Architecture remarkable for its Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But after all, 'tis certain that the principal
Glory of <hi>Grenoble</hi> conſiſts not in its Buildings;
and they who wou'd have the pleaſure to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with all its Beauty, muſt not expect
to gratifie their Curioſity by a Tranſient View
of it. For it has the Honour to be the Seat of
ſeveral Noble Families, who are ſo far above the
Clowniſhneſs that might be expected in ſo remote
a Province, that their Converſation and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be juſtly reckon'd the Standard of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
and good Breeding: So that a Stranger is
amaz'd to find the moſt refin'd Politeneſs of the
Court in the midſt of thoſe wild Mountains.
'Tis ſeated on the Banks of <hi>Iſſere,</hi> in a Valley, which
my Natural averſion to all Hilly Countries will not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51983:41"/>
ſuffer me to call Pleaſant. Yet at my departure
from the City, I ſaw ſome places that muſt be
acknowledged to have a kind of diſmal Beauty,
eſpecially the Monaſtery of the <hi>Carthuſians.</hi> The
very Aſcent to it is a Journey of ſix Hours, thro'
Ways that are almoſt only paſſable for Mules,
which are very common and extremely fine in
this Country: At leaſt I can aſſure you, that
thoſe who live in it may for ever deſpair of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Coach or Waggon near their Habitation,
unleſs it be made upon the Place. Theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
that ſeem to have been appointed by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as a wild Retreat for Wolves and Boars, are
nevertheleſs inhabited by Humane Creatures, if I
may give that Name to Animals that ſeem to have
a nearer reſemblance to Bears than Men. Their
Habit conſiſts of ſo Courſe a Cloth, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wear above one Suit of Clothes during their

'Tis a certain reddiſh Stuff, of the thickneſs of two
Crown Pieces, and every Thread in it is at leaſt
as big as Packthread. Theſe miſerable Wretches
are perfect Strangers to all manner of Pleaſure:
Their main or only Happineſs conſiſts in filling
their Stomachs with a ſort of Bread that none of
our Dogs wou'd taſte; and even that is a Rarity
among 'em: They drink Water, and live Night
and Day in Huts of Straw in the midſt of their
Oxen, Cows, and Hogs, which are their uſual
Companions, and are utterly unacquainted with
the Tranſactions of the reſt of Mankind.</p>
               <p>'Tis impoſſible to approach the Monaſtery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feeling an over-bearing Melancholy that damps
the gayeſt Spirits: 'tis ſeated between two high and
rugged Mountains or rather perpendicular Rocks,
and the Ghaſtlineſs of the Proſpect is heighten'd by
the Pine-Trees, that caſt a diſmal Shade upon the
jutting Cliffs. And to compleat the Horrour of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51983:41"/>
the Place, the Ears are ſtunn'd with the amazing
Dinn of a Torrent that rolls impetuouſly thro' the
Bottom which ſeparates the Mountains. The <hi>Monks</hi>
have ſpar'd no Pains to cut a Way thro' thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
impaſſable Precipices; and 'tis certain that
ſo laborious a Work cou'd not be perform'd without
a vaſt Expence of Treaſure. However they cannot
be accus'd of throwing away their Money upon
uſeleſs Projects; for, if you except the trouble of
aſcending and deſcending, a Man may walk pretty
eaſily to the Convent from the Bridges that are
built at the two Ends, and in the narroweſt Places
at the Bottom, eſpecially that next <hi>Grenoble,</hi> which
joins the oppoſite Mountains with a little Arch that
over-looks the Torrent, and is commanded by a
Houſe at the End of the Bridge, which Ten Men
might defend againſt a Hundred thouſand. Nor is the
Paſſage to the Convent leſs difficult on the other ſide,
ſo that it might be juſtly eſteem'd a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Poſt, if it were as important as 'tis ſtrong: but
in my Opinion the Uſeleſneſs of the Conqueſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
it as effectually againſt the Attacks of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as the Strength of its Situation. Theſe Paſſages
end in a ſort of Meadow or little Valley, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a hundred Paces in breadth, and a large quarter
of a League in length, where the Monaſtery is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The <hi>Monks</hi> have made ſeveral ſucceſsleſs At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to cultivate and embelliſh their ſolitary
Abode; which are ſo many convincing Proofs of
the Badneſs of the Soil, that makes it incapable
of Improvement. However, they ſtill continue to
encreaſe their Buildings, for they have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of Wood, Stones, and Iron upon the Spot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Conveniency of Mills, that are turn'd by a
ſmall Torrent which paſſes by the Convent, and
furniſhes 'em plentifully with Water. I'm perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they cannot eat one half of their Yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
which amounts to 300000 Livres: tho' Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51983:42"/>
of their Order are ſeldom guilty of pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Bellies, and tho' they are at a vaſt Charge

               <p>Aſſoon as I arriv'd, the Father, who is appointed

was a very ſeaſonable piece of Hoſpitality, for I

the Father-Prior came to make me a Compliment,
and left a Monk to keep me Company during my

impracticable in this place, inſtead of a Square
Cloyſter, they were forc'd to build a Row
of Cells, above 300 Paces in length. After I had
taken a View of all the Apartments, my Guide
brought me back to my Chamber, where we ſupp'd
on Fiſh; for there is no Fleſh eaten in the Houſe;
after which he left me to repoſe.</p>
               <p>Next Morning about Nine a-clock he return'd,
to conduct me to the Place where S. <hi>Bruno</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
his Penance, which is not acceſſible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great difficulty, being on the Top of the
Mountain, and ſo extremely Cold, that I cannot
imagine it was ever inhabited by Men. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
theſe Fathers aſſur'd me, that 'twas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Habitation of that Saint, with his Six Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;
and ſhew'd me certain Caves or <hi>Grotto's</hi>
cut out of the Rock, where they ſpent their Days
in the Exerciſe of Religious Auſterities. Since
that time the Monks erected a very fine Chapel,
enrich'd with ſeveral Pictures; among which that
of the Saint himſelf is particularly remarkable for
its finiſh'd Beauty. They forget not to make
Strangers take notice of their Rock, on which, if
you can believe their Tradition, an Angel appear'd
to him every Day, and brought him his neceſſary
Food. But it ſeems his Companions were not ſo
much in love with Mortification; for after his
Death they left the Hermitage, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
half a League lower, to the place where
the Monaſtery is now ſeated, with the permiſſion
of S <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf; who did 'em the favour to
appear in Perſon on that Occaſion, and promis'd
'em the Virgin's Aſſiſtance, on condition they
ſhou'd rehearſe her Office once every Day:</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledg'd that theſe Fathers do
not content themſelves with a bare verbal Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of the <hi>World</hi> and of <hi>Themſelves;</hi> for their
Practice is ſuitable to the Auſterity of their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51983:43"/>
The Solitude of their Receſs is certainly
worthy of Admiration; they live in a perpetual
Confinement among thoſe almoſt inacceſſible Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
where they ſpend their Lives in Prayer,
Contemplation, and the Severities of Repentance;
and are ſo little acquainted with the reſt of the
World, that they are ignorant even of the moſt
Remarkable Occurrences that are tranſacted in it.
They never eat Fleſh, faſt three quarters of the
Year, ſubmit to the rigour of Monaſtical Diſcipline
twice every Week, wear Sackcloth, ſpend nine
Hours in the Church every Day, obſerve a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Silence, and undergo voluntary and frequent
Acts of Mortification: So that if thoſe Perſons be
damn'd at laſt, I may venture to ſay that they
buy Hell at as dear a rate as the Saints purchaſe
Paradiſe. To make you leſs apt to ſuſpect the
Truth of this Relation, 'twill be ſufficient to tell
you, that the very ſight of the place inſpir'd me
with ſo reſiſtleſs a Melancholy, that I ſpent the
whole Night in making ſerious Reflexions on the
Vanity of the World. But, after all, you muſt
not have ſo favourable an Opinion of the force of
this Religious Charm, as to imagine it ſufficient to
imprint an indelible Character of Sanctity; for I
aſſure you, a little of the Air of the World ſoon
diſſipated all my additional Devotion, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to recover my wonted Gaiety by degrees, as
I approach'd <hi>Chambery.</hi> The Way thither is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Monument of the Grandeur and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of <hi>Charles Emmanuel,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by
whoſe Orders it was cut out of the Rock, for the
Conveniency of his Trading-Subjects; as it appears
by an Inſcription faſten'd to the Rock, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
with the Arms of that Prince. The
Road for a conſiderable diſtance from the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
is border'd with Precipices, and rugged Cliffs,
that caſt forth an almoſt innumerable Multitude
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51983:43"/>
of impetuous Torrents, which roll along with a
horrid Dinn. But afterwards the Traveller has
time to recover his Senſes, when at the end of
this frightful Paſſage, he meets with a pleaſant
Road, that brings him inſenſibly to <hi>Chambery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chambery</hi> is the principal City of the Dutchy
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſeated among the Mountains on the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Rivers of <hi>Orbane</hi> and <hi>Eſſe.</hi> As for Spiritual Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
'tis under the Juriſdiction of the Biſhop of
<hi>Grenoble;</hi> and for its Temporal Government, there
is a Senate, or Court of Juſtice, reſembling a
<hi>French</hi> Parliament, which takes Cognizance of all
Civil and Criminal Suits; and its Authority is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
over the whole Dutchy. This is all the
Account I can give you of <hi>Chambery;</hi> only I can
aſſure you 'tis neither large, ſtrong, nor beautiful.
I took a Paſs-Port of the Preſident, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on my Journey, paſs'd by <hi>Montmelian,</hi> about
two Leagues diſtant from <hi>Chambery,</hi> and ſeated on
the Top of a little Hill, that riſes like a Sugar-Loaf
in the midſt of a Valley: It may be reckon'd
almoſt impregnable; for it ſeems to be plac'd out
of the reach of all other Enemies but Famine,
and want of Proviſions: But the Town, that is
ſeated below, is a Place of no Defence, and much
leſs conſiderable than a Thouſand Villages in <hi>France.
S. John de Morienne,</hi> where I arriv'd the next Day,
deſerves no better Character, tho' it be honour'd with
a Biſhop's See. Here I took another Paſs-Port of
the great Vicar, which I may reckon cheap, tho'
it coſt me very dear; for it brought me ſafe to
this place, without being at the Charge of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
               <p>Two Days after I arriv'd at the Village of <hi>Lane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
ſeated directly at the Foot of Mount <hi>Cennis.</hi>
This remarkable Hill is famous both for its height,
in which reſpect it exceeds the talleſt Mountains
of the <hi>Alps;</hi> and for a Bottomleſs Lake, ſituated in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51983:44"/>
the middle of its Surface. I aſcended a League
and a half before I arriv'd at the Lake; after
which I found a Plain; extending about a large
League; and in that an Inn, where I was accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
with the moſt deſirable Entertainment in
theſe Mountains, I mean the warmth of a good
Fire; for the Way is lin'd on both ſides with vaſt
Hills of Snow; and the Wind is ſo cold and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
that the poor Traveller is hardly able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
himſelf on his numm'd Limbs. After I had
reſted an Hour, I mounted my Mule, for there
are no other Beaſts of Carriage able to paſs the
Mountain; and found the Deſcent on the other
ſide as troubleſome and uneaſie as the Aſcent, which
I have already deſcrib'd.</p>
               <p>The ſame Evening I arriv'd at <hi>Suza,</hi> a little Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Frontiers of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> ſeated at the Foot
of a Mountain, and ſeparated from <hi>Turin</hi> by a vaſt
and fertil Plain: It has the Advantage of a pure
and healthy Air, pleaſant Meadows, good Wine,
and beautiful Houſes. The warmth of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
exceeds that of <hi>France,</hi> but the Heat is not
ſo intollerable as at <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that the Traveller
finds as great an Alteration at his Deſcent from
the Mountains of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as if he were tranſported
in an Inſtant from <hi>Norway</hi> to <hi>Italy;</hi> and is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
raviſh'd at the ſudden Change of a ſtormy
Winter into a Mild and Temperate Spring.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Turin</hi> is ſeated at the other end of
this charming Plain, between the <hi>Po</hi> and the <hi>Loire,</hi>
which furniſh it abundantly with all the Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Conveniences of Life. 'Tis enclos'd with
ſtrong Walls, and ſurrounded with broad, deep,
and well-lin'd Ditches. The Cittadel is a Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of Fortification; for the Duke has ſpar'd no
Coſt to make it Strong and Magnificent; and if
the Goodneſs of the Soil had been ſuitable to the
Care he has taken to improve it, I'm confident
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51983:44"/>
'twou'd have been abſolutely impregnable. The
Town is all glorious within, and adorn'd with a
Thouſand Beauties: The Publick Places are ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
all newly built with an admirable Regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
The Streets are broad, and ſtreight as a Line:
The nobleſt improvements of Architecture are mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently
diſplay'd in the Palaces; the Gilding,
Paintings, and other Ornaments of the Churches are
ſuitable to the Beauty of the Buildings; the Shops
are full of all ſorts of rich and fine Stuffs; and
the Academies for riding the Great Horſe, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
and Martial Exerciſes, deſerve a particular
Obſervation. And to compleat the Glories of the
Place, there is a Court, that, notwithſtanding its
ſmallneſs, may be juſtly reckon'd the Seat of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
and Politeneſs; 'Tis compos'd of a Society
of both Sexes, that are equally Admirable; the
Ladies for their reſiſtleſs Charms; and the Men
for a Nobleneſs of Mien, and Magnificence of Garb,
that ſeems peculiar to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, I have endeavour'd to give you in
few Words, a juſt <hi>Idea</hi> of this Charming City;
for it wou'd be an endleſs Labour to undertake
the particular Deſcription of every fine Church,
and beautiful Palace, in a place where ſuch Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
are no Rarities. All the Ornaments of this
City are Modern; at leaſt I cou'd not, upon the
ſtricteſt Enquiry, diſcover any other Antiquities
than thoſe in the Duke's Gallery, which is full
of all ſorts of fine Paintings, rare Munuſcripts,
Medals, Vaſes, and other Curioſities of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The Gate of the Palace is defended with
two Culverins, admirable for their Largeneſs and
Workmanſhip; and a Mortar of a prodigious big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
The Metropolitan Church is dedicated to
S. <hi>John,</hi> and exceeds all the reſt in Magnificence:
'Tis a ſtately Dome, enrich'd on the Inſide with
Paintings, of a finiſh'd Regularity and Fineneſs:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51983:45"/>
And to all the other Ornaments, there was lately
added a Chapel of a ſurprizing Beauty and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
This admirable Structure is of an excellent
Architecture, and ſeems in a manner to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid
with a glittering Cover of Gold and Silver:
'Twas built on purpoſe for the <hi>Holy Handkerchief,</hi>
which is kept there at preſent. You cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
with what Devotion the People of this Place
adorn that Relick; which is a little Sheet, with
the Image of our Saviour painted very imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the middle, of a yellowiſh Colour. I need
not tell you that this is commonly pretended to be
the ſame Cloth in which Chriſt's Face was wrapt
at his Burial, and that his Image was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
ſtamp'd upon it: But there are ſo many
other Pretenders to the ſame Dignity, that I
will not undertake to decide ſo doubtful a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
               <p>According to all Appearance, the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will not remain long in the King's Intereſts;
for he has already given out Commiſſions for the
levying of two Regiments of Foot, and one of
Dragoons, with an expreſs Order, not to receive
a <hi>Frenchman</hi> into 'em; and beſides, 'tis certain
that he did not oppoſe the Paſſage of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets,</hi>
as he might have eaſily done: For all the
Motions of his Troops, were only in Order to
their Encampment at <hi>Verecil;</hi> and I'm perſuaded
the only reaſon why he ſuffer'd the <hi>French</hi> to act
on that Occaſion, was becauſe he cou'd not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
'em.</p>
               <p>I have met with another Obſtacle, that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard
my Journey to <hi>Iſaly</hi> for ſome time; for the
whole Country is full of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who Infeſt all
the Roads, and commit a Thouſand Robberies.
The People here are daily alarm'd with freſh Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of theſe Diſorders; ſo that I have been
at laſt prevail'd with to alter my Reſolution, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51983:45"/>

of making any remarkable Obſervation
that I had not taken notice of before; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all that I ſhall add to the Account I gave
you of that City, is, that the People have an
extraordinary Love to their Sovereign. You'll per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
tell me, that this is not a very uncommon
Obſervation, ſince 'tis natural for all Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
their Governours: But I hope you'll acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that there are various Degrees in this kind
of Affection, as well as in all others; and that I
cannot be accus'd of Trifling, when I aſſure you,
that never was the Breaſt of any Subject fill'd
with a more ardent and reſpectful Love to his
Prince, than that which the Inhabitants of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
have for the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Nor is their
Zeal for his Intereſt, and Affection to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
the Effect of a blind Inclination: For 'tis
no wonder that thoſe who owe their Happineſs
to the mild Influences of his Government are
charm'd with the Greatneſs of his Courage and

               <p>The Dutcheſs is an illuſtrious Example of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal

               <p>I forgot to tell you in my laſt, that it Rains
almoſt perpetually at <hi>Turin;</hi> and, (whatever you
may think on't) this is a very important Remark
for Perſons of my Humour and Fortune. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forbear complaining of the Unkindneſs of my
Deſtiny, that expoſes me to be drench'd with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Shower for want of a Coach, and even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
the Happineſs of thoſe who are better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided;
for, if God had thought fit to intruſt me
with the Management of 10000 Livres a Year, I
wou'd not have deny'd my ſelf the Pleaſure of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
in a portable Houſe.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Turin</hi> I came in ſeven Hours to <hi>Pignerol.</hi>
The Town is very well fortify'd; and the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
as now it ſtands, after ſo many Additions and
Alterations, may be juſtly reckon'd one of the
ſtrongeſt places in his Majeſty's Poſſeſſion, and a
terrible Thorn in the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Foot, which
may one Day make him halt, if he do not take
care to pluck it out. Here the unfortunate Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Fouquet</hi> ſpent the laſt part of his Life, and
(as 'tis generally believ'd) compos'd that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Treatiſe, entitul'd, <hi>The Counſels of Wiſdom.</hi> If
that Report be true, even his Enemies muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that the Confinement of his Body di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51983:46"/>
not the Freedom and Tranquillity of his
Mind, and that he was entirely diſengag'd from
the Allurements of this World. Nevertheleſs, I'm
certainly inform'd by Perſons of unſuſpected Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
that he attempted to make his Eſcape by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Sheets of his Bed; and that he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
put under a Guard of four Centinels inſtead
of one, as well as the Count <hi>de Lauſun,</hi> who about
four Years ago had little reaſon to flatter himſelf
with the hopes of a Releaſe. The Marqueſs <hi>d'Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
the preſent Governour of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> is a Man
of a large and comely Stature, brave, and well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Duties of his Office.</p>
               <p>Leaving <hi>Pignerol</hi> I proceeded on my Journey thro'
the long Valley of <hi>Seſtriere</hi> to <hi>Guilleſtre,</hi> and from
thence by the Way of <hi>Briançon</hi> to <hi>Ambrun,</hi> a little
City on the Frontiers of <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> inacceſſible on
one ſide, by reaſon of the Steepneſs of the Rock on
which 'tis built, but only defended on the other
with a weak and ſingle Wall. The Archbiſhoprick
of this Place is at preſent poſſeſs'd by <hi>Monſieur de
Genlis,</hi> Nephew to the Marqueſs <hi>de Genlis,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General
of his Majeſty's Forces, and Captain-Lieutenant
of the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s Company of
<hi>Geudarms.</hi> This Prelate ſignaliz'd his Courage and
Zeal in the late Campaign againſt the <hi>Vaudois;</hi> for
he remain'd in the Camp all the Summer, and was
perſonally engag'd in the Battel of <hi>Salbertrand:</hi> And
this unuſual Bravery in a Man of his Character, has
procur'd him ſo much Honour and Authority in the
Country, that when I produc'd his Paſs-Port at
<hi>Gap,</hi> the Major, who commanded in the Place, told
me that if it had been ſign'd by the King himſelf
it wou'd not have been ſo much reſpected. 'Tis true
he gave me a very favourable Character, for he was
not ignorant that I had the Honour to be very well
known to his Uncle: and 'twas alſo on that Score
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51983:47"/>
that he kept me two days at <hi>Ambrun,</hi> and entertain'd
me with a great deal of Kindneſs.</p>
               <p>You muſt give me leave to detain you a while with
an Account of my fatiguing Paſſage over Mount <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevre:</hi>
for tho' it be neither ſo large nor ſo high as
<hi>Cenis,</hi> the croſſing of that Mountain put me to more
Trouble and Pain than ever I ſuffer'd in any one
day of my Life. I was mounted on a Horſe that
was not worth Six-pence, which I hir'd of a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
at <hi>Briançon,</hi> and accompany'd with a Guide
who was utterly unacquainted with the Roads, and
carry'd me quite out of the Way. But that was not
my greateſt Misfortune, for my Horſe ſtuck ſo faſt
in the Snow, which reach'd above his Belly, that
I cou'd not make him go one Step farther, and was
at laſt forc'd to alight and endeavour to open a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
for him to the High-way; for I perceiv'd cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Sticks at a conſiderable diſtance, which (I knew)
were ſet up as Marks to keep Travellers from wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
out of the Road. But I quickly found my
Deſign impracticable, for both I and my Horſe were
ſo benumn'd with the Cold, that we cou'd hardly
ſtir a Leg; and beſides the Wind drove the Snow
upon me faſter than I cou'd rake it away: ſo that
I was beginning to give over my uſeleſs Labour,
and to reflect in good earneſt on a Death that ſeem'd
unavoidable, when I diſcover'd certain black Spots,
that gave me ſome hope of finding a Village not far
the place where I thought to have ended my days.
Immediately I left my Guide, Horſe and Baggage,
and, feeble as I was, ventur'd into the midſt of the
Snow, in queſt of thoſe Houſes, where at laſt, by
God's Aſſiſtance, I arriv'd, and was receiv'd with
all imaginable Marks of Kindneſs by thoſe Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Wretches, who brought me into one of their
Hutts, which I found ſtuff'd with Oxen, Cows,
Sheep, Cats, Dogs, and (the moſt miſerable Part
of the Family) Men and Women. Nevertheleſs
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51983:47"/>
I aſſure you that the Sight of this Place, which
perhaps at another time wou'd have turn'd my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
ſeem'd more charming to me in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
than the moſt glorious Palace that ever I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held:
I fanſi'd my ſelf reſtor'd from Death to Life
aſſoon as I enter'd that Reſemblance of a Hog's Stie,
which was as hot as a Stove. In the mean time I
begg'd ſome of my kind Hoſts to compleat their
Charity, by going to relieve the Poor Creature,
whom I had left with my Horſe in the midſt of the
Snow: and their Aſſiſtance came very ſeaſonably,
for he had certainly periſh'd if they had ſtay'd half a
quarter of an hour longer. After I had the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſeeing him alive, I ſtretch'd my weary'd Body
on a Heap of Straw, where I enjoy'd the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Night's Reſt that ever I had in my Life.
The next day I feaſted on a Piece of Bread exactly of
the Colour of Soot, and a little dry and ſalt Cheeſe;
and was in the mean time entertain'd with an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Way of Living in this Place. They
told me that they were impriſon'd in their diſmal
Habitations, and almoſt bury'd in the Snow for the
Space of ſeven Months, every Year; during which
time they linger out a miſerable Life in the midſt of
Stench and Naſtineſs.</p>
               <p>After my Arrival at <hi>Gap,</hi> I ſent back my Horſe,
and hir'd another, which I found there by chance,
to <hi>Siſteron.</hi> But to compleat the Misfortunes of my
diſaſtrous Journey, as I was croſſing a very rapid
Torrent about a League from the laſt of theſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
having occaſion to blow my Noſe, I pull'd
my Handkerchief out of my Pocket, and with that
the Box with my Paſs-Ports, which fell into the
Stream, and was in an inſtant carry'd quite out of
my Sight. If my Purſe with all the Money I was
Maſter of, had been irrecoverably loſt, I cou'd not
have been more ſenſibly vex'd: for when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
with what Rigour I had been every where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51983:48"/>
notwithſtanding my Paſs-Ports, I concluded
that Impriſonment was the mildeſt Treatment I
cou'd expect to receive at <hi>Siſteron.</hi> Theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
kept me for ſome time in an Irreſolution,
whether I ſhou'd go forwards; but ſince the Danger
was equal either Way, I reſolv'd to proceed on my
Journey, tho' I ſhou'd be forc'd to take up my
Lodging in a Gaol. I found, to my Coſt, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of thoſe Melancholick Preſages; for
the Governour laugh'd at my Excuſes, and told me
that I muſt needs have a very mean Opinion of his
Judgment, if I thought to put him off with ſuch
an ill-contriv'd Story. <hi>Confeſs the Truth,</hi> added he,
<hi>you are one of the</hi> Barbets, <hi>and are going to</hi> Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc
<hi>and</hi> Dauphiné, <hi>to perſuade the new Converts in
thoſe Provinces to join with your Party:</hi> I anſwer'd,
That I was too Loyal a Subject to his Majeſty, and
too zealous a Catholick to undertake ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
that I was a meer Stranger to the <hi>Barbets;</hi>
that I came from <hi>Turin,</hi> and was going to <hi>Rome.
What, Sir,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>you came from</hi> Turin? <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau,
you came with the</hi> Barbets: <hi>I'm better acquainted
with your Tricks than you imagine; I ſay you did come
with 'em, and I'll ſhew you preſently ſome of your own
Friends, who will maintain it to your Face.</hi> Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
he order'd two of thoſe unhappy Wretches
that were fall'n into his Hands, to be brought before
him, and aſſoon as they appear'd, <hi>Here is one of your
Officers,</hi> ſaid he to 'em, <hi>whom we have caught ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling.
He wou'd have us believe that he has deſerted
your Party, and left you with a Deſign to ſubmit to the
King; but we have Reaſon to ſuſpect his Sincerity. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
the Truth ingenuouſly, and declare all that you know
concerning him, as the only way you can take to obtain the
King's Mercy.</hi> If I had been guilty of entertaining
a Correſpondence with theſe People, I wou'd have
immediately ſaid ſomething to undeceive 'em, and
prevent their biting the Hook: but ſince I was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51983:48"/>
unacquainted with 'em, I was glad of that
Occaſion to juſtifie my Innocency, and expected
their Anſwer with a Silence that confuted all my
Accuſers: and beſides, the Priſoners affirm'd that
they did not know me. Then the Governour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to examine me more particularly, and with leſs
Prejudice than before: he ask'd me which way I
came, where I receiv'd Paſs-Ports, and who had
any Knowledge of me. In anſwer to the laſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
having nam'd ſeveral Perſons, and among
the reſt the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ambrun,</hi> the Governour
aſſur'd me, that I might conclude my ſelf out of
Danger, if that Prelate wou'd undertake to anſwer
for me; and I reply'd, that I hop'd he wou'd not deny
me his Teſtimony. Then the Governour deſir d me
to write to him, telling me that he wou'd accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
my Letter with another, and that in the mean
time I ſhou'd be confin'd to the Cittadel, where I
was lodg'd with two Lieutenants, from whom and
the reſt of the Officers, I receiv'd all imaginable
Marks of. Civility. Four days after, the Governour
having receiv'd a very favourable Anſwer from the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Ambrun,</hi> ſent for me, and told me
that I was at Liberty to depart when I pleas'd. I
return'd him my very humble Thanks for the Juſtice
he did me, and intreated him to grant me a Paſs-Port,
ſince without that I ſhou'd certainly be ſtopp'd,
and perhaps alſo abus'd by the firſt <hi>Corps de Garde</hi> of
Peaſants on the Road. But he aſſur'd me that there
was no need of a Paſs-Port, and that all the Roads
were free, from <hi>Siſteron</hi> to <hi>Marſeilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since I have had occaſion to mention the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets</hi>
ſo often, I believe it will not be an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Gratification of your Curioſity, to give you
an Account of the Original of that Name, which
the <hi>Piedmontois</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> give to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
that inhabit their <hi>Valleys.</hi> The Word <hi>Barbe</hi> in
their Language ſignifies <hi>Uncle;</hi> and beſides, an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:51983:49"/>
and <hi>Venerable Perſon;</hi> ſo that in ſeveral Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
'tis the uſual Cuſtom to expreſs a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Reſpect to a Perſon by prefixing this Word
before his proper Name, as <hi>Barbe Peter, Barbe John,
&amp;c.</hi> And even by degrees it grew in ſuch Eſteem
among 'em, that they thought they cou'd not give
a more honourable Title to their Miniſters, whom
for that Reaſon they call'd <hi>Barbe du Pleſſis, Barbe du
Menil, &amp;c.</hi> From hence the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
were nick-nam'd <hi>Barbets,</hi> as in <hi>France</hi> they are
call'd <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and in <hi>Flanders, Gueux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Siſteron</hi> is ſeated on the <hi>Durance,</hi> and is ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a Town, that 'twou'd be an uſeleſs Waſte of
Time and Paper to undertake the Deſcription of it.
The Cittadel ſtands on a very ſteep Mountain, and
is conſequently ſtrong, but ſo ſmall that 'tis ſcarce
capable of Lodging three hundred Soldiers.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Vallevoir,</hi> the preſent Governour
of this Place, is an old Officer, very well known,
and much eſteem'd by the Soldiers. The double
Meaning of his Name had once almoſt coſt him his
Life; for as he was walking at Night on the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
of a Town of which he was Governour, a
new Soldier who was then on the Watch, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, ſaluted him with the uſual Queſtion on
ſuch Occaſions, <hi>Qui va là, Who comes there?</hi> to which
he anſwer'd, <hi>Vallevoir.</hi> But the Centinel imagining
he had ſaid in a ſlighting manner, <hi>Va le voir, Go ſee,</hi>
and taking it either as an Affront, or as a Refuſal to
diſcover his Name and Quality, diſcharg'd his Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
and ſhot him into the Belly ſo dangerouſly,
that he had almoſt dy'd of the Wound.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Siſteron</hi> I came in a Day and a half to <hi>Aix,</hi>
which is but five Leagues diſtant from hence, and
was founded by <hi>Caius Sextius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul, who
call'd it by his own Name, in Memory of the <hi>Hot
Baths</hi> he had built there, which are ſtill to be ſeen
without the Walls. 'Tis neither large nor ſtrong,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51983:49"/>
but it may be juſtly ſaid to be a very pleaſant City,
for 'tis ſeated in a lovely Plain, that produces Store
of good Wine; and beſides, 'tis adorn'd with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Number of new Houſes, which are very
fine, and built after the <hi>Italian</hi> Faſhion. The Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>Provence</hi> are, without diſpute, the greateſt
Lovers of <hi>Building</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and are at the greateſt
Charge in gratifying their Inclinations to Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
and there are in this Country a great Number
of admirably well-contriv'd Structures that may paſs
for little Palaces. The Metropolitan Church, call'd
<hi>S. Saviour's,</hi> is particularly remarkable for the Tombs
of four Counts of <hi>Provence,</hi> a ſmall ſubterraneous
Chapel, where 'tis ſaid S. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ended her
Days, and eſpecially the <hi>Baptiſmal Font</hi> of white
Marble, adorn'd with <hi>Reliefs</hi> that are much eſteem'd
by the beſt Judges, and cover'd with a little Marble
Dome, ſupported with Columns of the ſame, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all together a very valuable Piece. The <hi>Place
des Prêcheurs</hi> is the fineſt of all the ſpacious Courts or
Squares in the City, both for its Neatneſs and Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and for the Beauty of the Structures that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
it, among which the ancient <hi>Palace of Juſtice</hi>
deſerves a particular Obſervation. In one of its A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments,
where the Counts of <hi>Provence</hi> kept their
Reſidence, there is a very fine Room, at preſent
call'd, <hi>The King's Chamber,</hi> richly gilt, and hung
round with the Pictures of our Kings. After the
Traveller has ſatisfy'd his Curioſity in this Place, he
may viſit the <hi>Cours,</hi> or publick Walking-Place and
Rendezvous of Coaches, which is 800 Paces long,
and 15 broad, without reck'ning the pav'd Streets on
both Sides for the Coaches. 'Tis enclos'd with Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſters
of Wood, and all over-ſhadow'd with tufty
Trees, whoſe ſpreading Boughs caſt ſuch an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Coolneſs in the Heat of Summer, that one may
walk in this lovely Place without the leaſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
at Three a Clock in the Afternoon: and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51983:50"/>
beſides, at convenient Intervals, there are Benches
of Stone, where thoſe who are weary may reſt
themſelves. The Houſes that environ it are all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fine, and inhabited by Perſons of Quality, who
chuſe to live there for the Pleaſure of the Proſpect,
and the Conveniency of walking without loſing
Sight of their Houſes. This is the general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
of the genteeler part of the Inhabitants of the
Town, who flock hither every Evening, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Pleaſures of the Place with their agreeable
Society and Converſation. You will be eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
to believe that there are ſome handſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to be found among ſo much good Company:
but I'm afraid you'll ſtand in need of all your Faith
to give Credit to another Obſervation I made in this
City. 'Tis perhaps the peculiar Advantage of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of <hi>Aix,</hi> that they are poſſeſs'd of the deareſt
and moſt diſtinguiſhing Privilege of the Beautiful
Sex; Ten or Twelve of 'em eſpecially, who are
ſo many <hi>Adolphus's</hi> and <hi>Jucundus's,</hi> and out-vie the
moſt charming Ladies that ever were admir'd for the
delicate Mixture of Roſes and Lilies in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
the Luſtre of their Eyes, and the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Graces of their Mouth. Theſe wondrous
Youths are ſo many convincing Proofs of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
of the firſt Part of that common Saying
in this Country, which aſcribes the <hi>Preeminence in
Beauty</hi> to the <hi>Men of Aix,</hi> and the <hi>Women of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole Country of <hi>Provence</hi> is under the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Parliament, which was eſtabliſh'd
here by <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. <hi>Ann.</hi> 1501. The Archbiſhoprick
of this Place is remarkable for its Antiquity, and
the Extent of its Juriſdiction: for 'tis the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan
See of a very large Eccleſiaſtical Province, and
the firſt Biſhop was S. <hi>Maximin,</hi> a Diſciple of S. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

Since the County of <hi>Provence</hi> was diſmember'd
from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, it has had the Misfortune
to change its Maſters very often: but inſtead of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
you with a Catalogue of all its Sovereigns,
I ſhall content my ſelf with obſerving that it was
annex'd to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> under the Reig<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. by <hi>René,</hi> Count of <hi>Provence,</hi> and King
of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> and that the Privileges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
to the Inhabitants, by the Conditions of that
Donation, were involv'd in the ſame Fate with
thoſe of <hi>Languedoc, Dauphiné, Burgundy, Bretaign,</hi> &amp;c.
For you know the King has a notable Faculty of
<hi>Judging in his own Cauſe,</hi> and is furniſh'd on all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
with <hi>irreſiſtible Arguments</hi> to demonſtrate,
That <hi>his Will and Pleaſure are the only Limits of his
Royal Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Air of this Province is ſo mild, that 'tis ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or never obſerv'd to be ſubject to Froſts: but
the Advantages of its Climate are conſiderably leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd
by the Boiſterouſneſs of the Winds that reign
in it. And beſides, the Country is generally ſo
mountainous, that one half of it is not cultivated;
and the little fertil Ground that remains, is ſo full
of Stones, that a Man wou'd be tempted to think
they had been purpoſely brought thither. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
take care to remove thoſe that lie in their
way, and, inſtead of Hedges, ſurround their Fields
with Stone-Walls, which are almoſt every where
three Foot high: ſo that if ever this Country be
made the Seat of a War, 'twill not be an eaſie Task
to open a Paſſage thro' it for the Cavalry.</p>
               <p>But, to make amends for the Inconveniency of
the Soil, which is neither proper for <hi>Corn</hi> nor <hi>Paſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi>
it produces very good <hi>Wine,</hi> and great Store of
ſuch excellent <hi>Olives,</hi> that the Oil of 'em is eſteem'd
the beſt and ſweeteſt in <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Wine</hi> is of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sorts; for, beſides the <hi>Red,</hi> which is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and not inferiour to <hi>Burgundy,</hi> there is the <hi>Pale-Red,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51983:51"/>
Red, White,</hi> and delicious <hi>Muſcadin.</hi> The beſt grows

but 'twou'd be needleſs to deſcribe its Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

There is alſo a mix'd Sort of Wine, call'd <hi>Malmſey,</hi>
much eſteem'd by the People of this Country, who
make it, by boyling <hi>Red Muſcadin</hi> with <hi>Cinnamon,

Colour of Feathers; only the Wings of the latter
are ſpotted, <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> their Legs are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

'em when they are dreſs'd, and therefore the
<hi>Cooks</hi> uſually ſtick one of the Feathers of the Wings
into the Body of a <hi>Francolin,</hi> that it may not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for a <hi>Red Partridge.</hi> 'Tis not ſo hard a Task to
know the delicious <hi>Earth-Apples</hi> or <hi>Swine-bread,</hi> that are
ſo cheap in this Country: for tho' they are brought
to the Table cover'd with a Napkin to keep 'em
warm, the whole Chamber is immediately perfum'd
with their odoriferous Scent. You muſt not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
your ſelf to be a competent Judge of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſubterraneous Fruit, becauſe you commonly eat
'em dry'd in <hi>Ragou's</hi> at <hi>Paris:</hi> for they are incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
more pleaſant, when the freſh Pulp is eaten like an
Apple, without any other Preparation than peeling
off the Rind. 'Tis certain, that Maids have reaſon
to complain of the Tyrannical Cuſtom that reſtrains
'em from taſting a Diſh which all the World ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,
under Pretext that 'tis too powerful an Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to Amorous Inclinations.</p>
               <p>

This kind of <hi>Earth-Apple</hi> is neither a <hi>Plant, Herb,</hi>
nor <hi>Muſhroom:</hi> it grows in a very little time, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
equalling a Man's Fiſt in Bigneſs; and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found at the depth of half a Foot under the
Surface of the Ground. 'Twou'd be impoſſible to
diſcover theſe admirable Productions of the Earth,
without the Aſſiſtance of the Hogs, who ſmell 'em
out: The Country People follow theſe Animals,
eſpecially when they perceive 'em buſi'd in digging up
the Ground; and when they have gather'd ſo many,
that the Weight of 'em may amount to five or ſix
Pounds, they carry 'em to the Market, where they
ſell 'em for 7 or 8 <hi>Sous</hi> a Pound. Next theſe you
cannot imagine any thing of a more delicious Taſte
than the <hi>large Grapes</hi> of <hi>Provence,</hi> which the People
of the Country have the Secret to preſerve till <hi>May,</hi>
as freſh as if they were newly pick'd from the Tree,
bringing Baskets full of 'em every Day to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.
But this is not the only Reaſon why <hi>Provence</hi>

its Goodneſs is not anſwerable to its Beauty, for 'tis
full of ſmall Seeds like Sand. Theſe, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Figs</hi> that are ſo common in this Country,
and ſome <hi>Peaches,</hi> are, I think, all the Kinds of
Fruit that are to be found in it. But I muſt

For <hi>Orange, Citron,</hi> and <hi>Pomegranate-Trees</hi> grow as

Theſe Advantages are owing to the peculiar Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages

                  <hi>MArſeilles</hi> is one of the moſt ancient Cities in
<hi>France;</hi> and tho it was famous in all Ages,
'tis not an eaſie Task to trace its Original, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Opinion of ſome Writers, who
pretend that 'twas founded by the <hi>Greek</hi> Exiles,
who were driven out of their Country by <hi>Cyrus
the Great.</hi> 'Twas formerly the ſeat of an Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Aſſembly of learned Senators, and of an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy,
which was the general Rendezvous of
Studious Perſons from all the Corners of the World.
Theſe glorious Advantages made it in a manner
the <hi>Metropolis of the Commonwealth of Learning;</hi> and
inſpir'd the <hi>Romans</hi> with ſo high an Eſteem for it,
that they courted the <hi>Friendſhip</hi> of the Citizens of
<hi>Marſeilles,</hi> while the reſt of the Inhabitants of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence</hi>
were their <hi>Conquer'd Vaſſals.</hi> After the Fall
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, 'twas govern'd as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
by four Counts; till at laſt the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
finding themſelves unable to withſtand the
united force of their Neighbours, put themſelves
under the Authority and Protection of the Kings
of <hi>France.</hi> But the Conditions of this Voluntary
Submiſſion were very Honourable and Advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51983:52"/>
for 'twas concluded, that the City and its
Territory, which comprehends two Leagues round,
ſhou'd be exempted from all manner of Taxes,
Charges, and Impoſitions; that the King ſhou'd
not pretend a Right to any Cuſtoms or Duties
for Goods Exported or Imported; That the City
ſhou'd be govern'd by Four Conſuls, who ſhou'd
hold their Office for Life, and be elected by the
Citizens; only 'twas agreed, That one Judge or
Magiſtrate might be ſent by the King, with the
Title of <hi>Viguier:</hi> That they ſhou'd not be oblig'd
to receive any Garriſon, or be commanded by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Cittadel but that of <hi>Nôtre-Dame de la Garde:</hi>
Beſides ſeveral other Articles of the ſame Nature,
which remain'd in force till the King's Voyage
thither; when he took the occaſion of a Mutiny that
was rais'd againſt the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> General of
his Galleys, to aboliſh all the Privileges of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles.</hi>
You may imagine with what Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and inward Rage they heard of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's
Approach in a Hoſtile manner, with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
at his Heels; and afterwards beheld him enter
the Breach as into a conquer'd City: However
they ſet a good Face on't, and reſolving to make
the beſt they cou'd of a deſperate Game, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Deſtroyer of their Liberty with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
Marks of Love and Reſpect. In the mean
time he order'd ten thouſand Men to march into
the City, who ſeiz'd on the principal Poſts, and
were lodg'd in the Citizen's Houſes; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
told 'em, that he had obſerv'd a great Number
of pretty Buildings in their Territory, and was
ſo well pleas'd with 'em, that he was reſolv'd to
build one more. This Deſign was quickly put in
execution; for the Cittadel was erected at the
Mouth of the Port on the Right-ſide, and <hi>Fort
S. John</hi> on the other. The People of <hi>Marſeilles</hi>
perceiving that <hi>Reaſon</hi> was too feeble a Defence
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51983:53"/>
againſt <hi>Violence,</hi> very tamely ſubmitted to the new
Yoke that was impos'd upon 'em: And their
<hi>forc'd Complaiſance</hi> on this Occaſion, was made
the Subject of a Song; of which theſe are two
Stanza's:
<q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>He told'em he wou'd build a Fort,</l>
                        <l>And ſwore 'twas meerly to protect 'em:</l>
                        <l>They ſwore again they thank'd him for't,</l>
                        <l>Becauſe they durſt not contradict him.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>They vow'd they were his loyal Slaves,</l>
                        <l>With Lives and Fortunes to aſſiſt him;</l>
                        <l>Ready to ſerve him to their Graves,</l>
                        <l>Becauſe unable to reſiſt him.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Whatever were the Sentiments of theſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
People at that time, I can aſſure you that
moſt of the old Inhabitants are ſtruck with ſo
much Horrour at the remembrance of that. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter,
that they never relate the Story of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the deepeſt Marks of a lively Sorrow. And
they ſtill retain ſuch an inconceivable Abhorrence
againſt the <hi>French,</hi> that they ſcarce ever mention
'em but in the moſt reproachful Terms that Spite
or Diſdain can invent. They look upon all thoſe
of that Nation to be contemptible Wretches; and
you cannot do 'em a more provoking Injury than
to call 'em <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> I cannot give you a more
lively Repreſentation of their implacable Hatred
againſt our Nation, than by relating a Story which
I heard t'other Day: When the King concluded
the laſt Peace with <hi>Algiers,</hi> Commiſſioners were
ſent on board all the Galleys, and into the Baths,
to releaſe all the <hi>French</hi> Slaves they cou'd find:
Some of theſe Officers perceiving a Man, whom
they took to be one of their own Nation, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a careleſs manner, without ſhowing the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51983:53"/>
leaſt deſire to be Enroll'd in their Liſt, ask'd him,
<hi>Whether he was a Frenchman: No,</hi> anſwer'd he:
<hi>What Countryman art thou then?</hi> ſaid one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners:
<hi>I'm a Native of Marſeilles,</hi> reply'd the
Slave: <hi>Very well,</hi> ſaid the Commſſioners; <hi>write to
thy King of Marſeilles, that he may ſet thee at liberty.</hi>
This is no contriv'd Story, but ſo certain and
well-atteſted a Truth, that I know ſome Perſons
who were preſent when the Accident happen'd:
Nor will the credibleneſs of this Relation be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd
by any who have had occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with the Inhabitants of this City, or to be
Witneſſes of their extreme Averſion againſt our
Countrymen. If any of 'em gives his Daughter
in Marriage to a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> or makes a Man of
that Nation his particular Friend, he expoſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
infallibly to the Hatred and Scorn of all his
Neighbours: And if a Maid ſhou'd receive a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
from a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> ſhe might for ever deſpair
of finding a Husband in her own Country. To
conclude; The People of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> are in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
diametrically oppoſite to us; only I muſt
except from this general Rule, the Nobility of this
City, and of the Country in which 'tis ſeated,
than whom there are none of their Quality in
<hi>France</hi> that can lay a juſter Claim to Antiquity
of Deſcent, and Politeneſs of Manners; nor any
that are better affected to his Majeſty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>The Language of <hi>Provence</hi> is extremely harſh and
unpleaſant, eſpecially in <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
that belongs to it, where the Pronunciation
is as Guttural as in <hi>Arabia.</hi> You can hardly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
what a vaſt Alteration the very Sound or
Accent makes in a Language: There is ſcarce any
difference at all between the Words of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
that are us'd in <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and
nevertheleſs this is as amorous and agreeable as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51983:54"/>
that is rough and uncouth. A Stranger is never
more ſenſible of the Truth of this Obſervation,
than at his firſt Arrival: And I remember that
the very Day on which I came to this City, I
was aſtoniſh'd at the intolerable Clowniſhneſs
with which a handſome young Lady pronounc'd
theſe Words, to diſwade one of her Kinſmen from
quarrelling with an ordinary Woman: <hi>Hai, mon
Couſin,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>laché ſtata quelle femme, non ſabais
pas qua cau à la teſte dau Diable.</hi> This made me
tell a Gentleman, who, ſome Days after, ask'd my
Opinion of the Women of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> That <hi>I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
their Beauty, but cou'd wiſh they were dumb,
becauſe their Speech was ſuch a Bugbear, that all the
Charms of their Countenance cou'd never retain a</hi> French
<hi>Lover. If you were acquainted with their Humour,</hi>
reply'd he, <hi>you wou'd be eaſily convinc'd, that the very
Reaſon you alledge wou'd make 'em in love with their
Pronounciation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marſeilles</hi> is one of the moſt populous Cities in
<hi>France;</hi> but the third part of thoſe who reſide in
it are Strangers. The old part of the Town is
neither very large nor fair: The Streets are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
crooked, and uneven, by reaſon of its Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
on a Hillock; but 'tis at leaſt double of
what it was thirty Years ago. The <hi>Cours,</hi> or Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Place for taking the Air, is exactly in the
middle of a long and very ſtreight Street, that
reaches from the Gate of <hi>Aix</hi> to that of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and ſeparates the Old from the New Town. 'Tis
1000 Paces long, (which is only the third part
of the length of the Street) and in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
is like to that of <hi>Aix.</hi> Four Men are hir'd
by the City, to Water it twice a Day in Summer,
that the Duſt may not offend the Gentlemen and
Citizens, who flock thither every Evening in ſuch
Multitudes, that a Man can hardly turn himſelf
in the Croud. The Houſes that Border it are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51983:54"/>
built pretty regularly, but are not ſo fine as at
<hi>Aix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The New City is well built; the Streets are
broad, ſtreight, and light; and beſides, 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
for the Quality of its Inhabitants; for
all the Officers of the Galleys, the Gentry,
and the richer part of the Citizens chuſe to live
in it. The Extent of the Walls of the City has
been conſiderably augmented within theſe three
Years; for beſides what they contain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d before,
there is a large Space enclos'd behind the Arſenal
for a <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lace of Arms,</hi> which (when finiſh'd) will be
300 Paces ſquare. The King beſtows the Ground
about this Place on thoſe who will build Houſes
on it, provided they obſerve the Lines mark'd
out for that purpoſe. By means of this new Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
the Abbey of S. <hi>Victor</hi> is advanc'd further
within the Town, being a Monaſtery of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<hi>Benedictines,</hi> who acknowledge no other
Superiour but the Pope, in Eccleſiaſtical Caſes.
There are 50000 Livres a Year annex'd to this
Houſe, for the Maintenance of eighteen or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Monks, who know very well how to enjoy
all the comforts of ſo plentiful a Revenue. The
Neighbourhood of theſe Independent Gentlemen
is ſo great an Eye-ſore to the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi>
that he has ſeveral times endeavour'd to make 'em
conſent to the Re-union of their Monaſtery with
the Chapter of the Cathedral, offering 'em all
the Privileges of the Canons, with the Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip
of the Biſhoprick for their Prior: But
they have hitherto kept themſelves from being
dazzl'd with the ſeeming Advantageouſneſs of theſe
Propoſals. The preſent Biſhop is of the Family of
<hi>Vintimille,</hi> deſcended from the Counts of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi>
and Nephew of Cardinal <hi>Fourbain Janſon,</hi> his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
in the Biſhoprick. He is well-ſhap'd, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
not above thirty Years old, has very much
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51983:55"/>
the Air of the Court, and might be reckon'd a
very handſome Man, if his Teeth were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſmaller, and more evenly ſet. He is a Man
of Sence and good Breeding, of a pleaſant Wit
and agreeable Converſation. He is none of thoſe
moroſe Cenſurers, who affect a certain Surlineſs
and ill Humour on all Occaſions. His Life is a
convincing Argument that the Pleaſures of this
World are not altogether inconſiſtent with Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He plays, hears Opera's, viſits Ladies, and
if we may believe the common Report, is not
hated by 'em: Yet all theſe muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
to be innocent Liberties, ſince he always
preſerves a due regard to the Laws of Decency,
and never ſeems to be guilty of any Criminal
Deſign. I know a Perſon who took the liberey
to deſire the uſe of his Purple Habit and
Golden Croſs, for a Maſque: The Prelate reply'd,
That theſe Accoutrements were Sacred; but very
civilly accommodated him with his Caſſock, ſhort
Cloak, and Perriwig. He has a Niece who is
admitted into the Nunnery of S. <hi>Urſula,</hi> at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi>
and is certainly the moſt amiable Girl in
the World: His Affection to her is ſuitable to
her Merit; and ſince ſhe is yet too young to bear
the Auſterities of a Religious Life, he ſuffers her
to live with her Father, the Marqueſs <hi>de Fourbain:</hi>
In the mean time he viſits her daily, and inſtructs
her in all the Duties of her Profeſſion. Let us
leave 'em in this Holy Occupation, and take a
View of the <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>Marſeilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis inclos'd within the City, which ſecures it
on all ſides from the Violence of the Winds;
and its Mouth that before was not above thirty
Paces broad, is ſtreighten'd by two Moles, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a very narrow Paſſage for the Galleys,
which is ſhut up with a Chain every Night,
and open'd at Seven in the Morning. The Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

of all the King's Galleys, of which there
are forty five, including the old <hi>Patronne,</hi> which

<hi>Patronne,</hi> which is adorn'd with the fineſt <hi>Baſſo-Relievo's</hi>

Devices, and Coats of Arms embroider'd with
Gold: The principal Flag is above forty Foot
long, and ten broad; and all the reſt are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
large: The <hi>Poop,</hi> where the General has
his Chamber, is cover'd with the ſame Stuff, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd
with a Fringe of Gold and Silk.</p>
               <p>All the other Galleys are adorn'd after the ſame
manner, only inſtead of Gold they have Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh
Silk, which is no leſs agreeable to the Sight,
eſpecially at a Diſtance. 'Tis impoſſible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a more ſtately Proſpect than thoſe Galleys
when they appear in all their Magnificence on
Sundays and Holydays. But notwithſtanding all
theſe external Beauties, they are only ſplendid
Priſons to the moſt miſerable Wretches in the
World; the poor Slaves are chain'd together, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
up with Vermin and Scabs, beaten from Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Night, and expos'd to all the Injuries of
Cold. Their only Habit is a ſort of wide and
ſhort Jacket, without Shooes or Stockings, without
a Shirt for Change, without Straw to lie upon,
without any other Food than a little Bread as black
as Soot; and to crown their Miſery, without the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51983:56"/>
leaſt hope of a Deliverance from this deplorable
Captivity, more inſupportable than that of the
<hi>Turks.</hi> There comes not a Perſon of Quality
to <hi>Marſeilles</hi> whom the Intendant does not regale
with this ſight on board the new <hi>Patronne,</hi> which
on theſe Occaſions is embelliſh'd with all its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments.
The Galley-Slaves perform their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
by the Sound of a Fiſquet: Firſt they ſalute
the Intendant and thoſe that are with him, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
out thrice <hi>Hou, hou, hou,</hi> as if they were
Bears in a Humane Form: In the next place they
ſtretch a Rope from one ſide of the Galley to
the other, and then a Sail-Yard; this done, they
ſet up the Tent and take it down again; after which
comes the moſt neceſſary part of their Exerciſe,
they pull off their Jackets and Shirts, ſhaking off
the Lice into the Sea, and ſweeping 'em away
with their Hands: Then they put on their Clothes,
and the Haut-boys entertain their Company; who
at their Departure receive the ſame howling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation
as at firſt. I know not what Pleaſure
ſome Perſons may take in beholding ſo diſmal a
Spectacle, but I aſſure you it had a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Effect upon me: I was altogether unable to

mixt with Horrour; and I'm perſuaded you cou'd
not preſerve the uſual Tranquillity of your Mind
at the reading of a lively Recital of the Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I made on this Occaſion: I ſhall therefore
leave this melancholy Subject, and proceed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
you with ſomething more diverting.</p>
               <p>Theſe Galleys are Mann'd with a Regiment,
compos'd of as many Companies as there are Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
each Company conſiſting of one hundred and
twenty Men, who exceed all the Soldiers in the
King's Service, in Comelineſs of Perſon, and Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Stature; for the Captains never grudge to
advance Ten <hi>Louis d' Or's</hi> when they meet with a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51983:56"/>
Man that pleaſes 'em: And beſides, there are two
conſiderable Encouragements that invite Men to
enter into this Service; for they have a <hi>Sous</hi> a
Day more than in the Land-Army; and the
Campaign, or time of Action, never laſts above
two Months. There is alſo a diſtinct Company,
call'd the <hi>Guards of the Standard,</hi> who are cloath'd in
Red, with a Gold Galoon, and train'd up to be
Enſigns of the Galleys: This Company conſiſted
formerly of fifty Men, but their Number was doubl'd
this Winter, and 'twas order'd that no Perſon
henceforth ſhou'd be admitted into it, without a
<hi>Brevet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> is at preſent General of the
Galleys; but ſince that Office is purely Honorary,
all the Duties of it are executed by the Lieutenant-General,
the <hi>Chevalier de Noailles,</hi> Brother to the
Duke of that Name. This Officer is much envy'd,
if not hated, by ſome old Commanders of Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,
who grumbl'd extremely to ſee him advanc'd
before 'em; yet ſince he is a very brave Man, and
poſſeſs'd of his Maſter's Favour, his Court is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
pretty numerous. Some days ago he viſited
the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> and I took hold of that Occaſion to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
my Curioſity, which I cou'd hardly have done
at another time; for Monſieur <hi>de Montmor,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant,
keeps the Keys of the moſt conſiderable
Places, and never parts with 'em out of his Cuſtody,
but when there is ſomething to be done that requires
the opening of the Doors. Tho' this <hi>Arſenal</hi> was
not begun to be built till about Thirty Years ago,
it may be divided into the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New;</hi> ſince
the Additions that have been made within theſe four
Years, make it at leaſt double of what it was before.
The Length of the <hi>Old Arſenal</hi> is equal to the
Breadth of the Port which it fronts; It contains
particular Magazines for all the Galleys, mark'd
with their reſpective Names, with large Round
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51983:57"/>
Doors. This is the Lower Story on one Side; the
other contains Magazines of Cannon, Bombs, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes,
and Gun-Powder, in which 'tis ſaid there
are Two thouſand Pieces of Cannon, and Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Bombs. The Upper Story is divided into
Rooms, where the Flags, Pendants, Sails, and the
reſt of the Tackling are kept; but moſt of 'em are
empty. Here is alſo a fair Hall of Arms, the Walls
of which are hung with Six thouſand Muſquets,
and as many Sabres, all kept in very good Order:
And near this is another, where there are Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Sutes of Armour, all intire and bright as Silver.
The whole <hi>Arſenal</hi> is one ſingle Maſs of Building, in
the Middle of which there is a Dome with a Clock:
and tho' in the general it may be reckon'd a fine
Building, there is nothing in it that deſerves to be
admir'd. The <hi>New Arſenal</hi> begins where the other
ends, and ſtretches along the Port almoſt to the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel:
'Tis larger than the <hi>Old Arſenal,</hi> tho' not ſo well
built, but when 'tis finiſh'd 'twill exceed the other, not
only in Vaſtneſs of Extent, but in the Beauty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of a fine Canal, thro' which the Galleys
may come to the Doors of their reſpective Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines.
'Tis alſo ſaid that there will be Stoves built
there for the Galley-Slaves, to leſſen the Miſeries
they uſually ſuffer in the Winter. This is the Place
where the Galleys are built, in a certain dry Ditch
or Dock, into which they can let as much Water
as they pleaſe, by a Sluce; ſo that the Galley is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſet a-float, without the leaſt Trouble in
Lanching it. The Place of Arms, of which I took
notice before, will be behind the <hi>Arſenal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is not one fine Church in <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> but
there are ſome very ancient. That of <hi>Nôtre-Dame
des Accoules</hi> was formerly conſecrated to <hi>Pallas,</hi> that
of <hi>S. Saviour</hi> to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the Cathedral or Church
<hi>de la Major,</hi> is ſaid to have been a Temple of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana.</hi>
In the laſt the Body of S. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the firſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51983:57"/>
Biſhop of this City, is kept in a Silver Shrine; and
there are ſeveral other Holy Rarities both in this
and S. <hi>Victor's</hi> Church; where, beſides the Head of
that Saint, they preſerve the True Croſs of S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi>
which is ſeven Foot long, and conſiſts of two
Joiſts join'd croſs-ways, after the Figure of an X.
Here is alſo a <hi>Grotto,</hi> where <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> did Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for ſome time. The whole City is full of
ſuch Places, but none of 'em is ſo much reſpected
as S. <hi>Baume,</hi> where 'tis ſaid ſhe liv'd 33 Years. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the Difficulties and diſcouraging
Rubbs I met with in my Paſſage thro' the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
my Curioſity was ſtill ſtrong enough to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
me to undertake a Pilgrimage to that Place;
and in my next you may expect an Account of the
Obſervations I made there.</p>

               <p>S. <hi>Baume</hi> is a Cave in the midſt of a Rock, which
is ſo extremely high and ſteep, that by taking a
diſtant View of this Place, you wou'd think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to aſcend to it. And certainly the Aſcent
was very difficult at firſt, ſince at preſent, tho' there
are Steps very induſtriouſly cut out of the Rock, it
requires a Man's whole Skill and Agility to mount
theſe artificial Stairs, holding his Horſe by the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le;
and the Pleaſure of arriving at the Top of 'em
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51983:58"/>
is very conſiderably increas'd by the need one has of
Reſt. This Rock is the Top of the higheſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of <hi>Provence,</hi> between <hi>Marſeilles</hi> and <hi>Toulon;</hi>
and you muſt aſcend continually for the ſpace of
two Hours, before you can arrive at the Rock:
The Cave is poſſeſs'd by certain <hi>Jacobin</hi> Friars,
ſent thither by the Prior of S. <hi>Maximin,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
each of 'em a Thouſand Livres a Year for
their Maintenance, without reckoning their Maſſes:
And I'm confident they cannot ſpare much out
of ſo conſiderable a Revenue, ſince they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to be at a vaſt and almoſt daily Charge for
the Carriage of ſuch things as are neceſſary for
their Subſiſtence, the Situation of the Place not
permitting 'em to lay up great ſtore of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
On the right ſide of the Entrance into the
Cave, they have taken Advantage of a piece of
the Rock that jutts out beyond the reſt of it, to
contrive a little Convent, conſiſting of ſeventeen
Cells, and three double Chambers, which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the King, the Biſhop, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Province, or at leaſt are call'd by
their Names. On the other ſide of the Entry
there is an Inn, where we paid dear for
what we eat, beſides the Chaplets and Medals
with which my Companions loaded themſelves.
'Tis Morally impoſſible that ever any Perſon
cou'd have liv'd in this Cave as many Days as <hi>Mary
Magdalen,</hi> according to the Tradition, liv'd Years
in it, by reaſon of the extreme Coldneſs and
Moiſtneſs of the place, occaſion'd by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
dropping of Water from the impending Rock,
which falls in ſuch abundance, that it fills a kind
of Well or Ciſtern below. The Monks pretend
that this perpetual dropping is a miraculous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of the Tears which that Saint ſhed in
this place; and that 'tis naturally impoſſible for
Water to ſpring out of ſo high a Rock. This is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51983:58"/>
a Philoſophical Queſtion, which you may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
at your leiſure; for I'm reſolv'd to ſay
nothing on this Subject that may prepoſſeſs your
Judgment.</p>
               <p>In the bottom of the Cave there is a little
Rock, about three Foot high, which I vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuſpect to be Artificial; for 'tis exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
like a Bed, with the reſemblance of a Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
as if it had been made on purpoſe for that
uſe. 'Tis inclos'd with a great Iron Grate, which
the Monks open, that the Spectators may have a
full View of the Saint's Image of Marble, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and gilt: She is laid at her full length, her
Head leaning on her Right-hand, and in her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
holding the <hi>Pix,</hi> in which ſhe kept conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Wafers or Hoſts. This Image is much bigger
than the Life, being ſeven Foot long; and yet
they pretend that 'tis an exact imitation both of her
Face and Stature. 'Tis ſtrange that the Scripture
ſhou'd neither mention her unuſual Bigneſs, her
Quality, (for they ſay ſhe was a Princeſs) nor
her Voyage: And 'tis ſtill more ſurprizing, that a
Woman of her Stature cou'd charm ſuch a Croud
of Lovers: I know not whether the Men of her
Age had a particular Inclination to Court <hi>Gian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſes;</hi>
but I queſtion very much whether ſuch a
<hi>Bouncing Girl</hi> wou'd find ſo many Admirers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us.</p>
               <p>After a Traveller has ſatisfy'd his Curioſity with
a View of all theſe Rarities, it is the uſual Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
to go up to the Top of the Rock, call'd
S. <hi>Pilon,</hi> whither that Saint was carried ſeven times
a Day by the Angels, that ſhe might have the
Convenience of ſaying her Prayers at that Place.
I will not detain you with the particular Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the reſt of her Adventures: But ſince, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
you may not be unwilling to know how,
and by what odd Accident ſhe came to this Place,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51983:59"/>
I ſhall give you a ſhort Account of that part of
her Hiſtory. After our Saviour's Aſcenſion, there
aroſe a violent Perſecution againſt his Diſciples,
as you may ſee at length in the <hi>Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:</hi>
Among the reſt, the Family of S. <hi>Lazarus</hi>
was involv'd in the common Calamity; but the
<hi>Jews,</hi> unwilling to make Perſons of Quality ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the utmoſt Severities that were uſually inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on others, inſtead of putting 'em to Death,
plac'd <hi>Lazarus</hi> and his Siſter, S. <hi>Maximin,</hi> and ſome
others, whoſe Names I do not remember, in a
Bark, without Oars, Rudder, or Sails, abandoning
'em to the Mercy of the Winds, which by the
Providence of God, brought 'em into the Port of
<hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where they ſpent ſeveral Years in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Goſpel: Their Memory is preſerv'd to
this Day, by a great number of Chapels erected
in the places where 'tis pretended the <hi>He</hi> and <hi>She</hi>
Saints uſually pronounc'd their Sermons; which
had ſuch a prevailing Influence on their Hearers,
that the whole City was converted. After ſuch
happy Succeſs, S. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was made Biſhop, and
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> went to do Penance in the horrid
Cave of S. <hi>Baume.</hi> Her Head, and one of her
Arms are kept at S. <hi>Maximin,</hi> amongſt a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of fine Relicks: Her Head is enchas'd in a
kind of Buſt of Gold, ending a little below her
Shoulders, and enrich'd with a great number of
very fine Jewels, among which there is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Ruby, equalling a Man's Thumb both in
Length and Breadth: This Buſt was preſented by
<hi>Charles</hi> II. King of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> Count of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence.</hi>
The whole Face of this Head is expos'd
to view, contrary to the Cuſtom of other Places,
where the Shrine is only ſhow'd, and the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
muſt imploy his Faith, if it be ſtrong enough,
to diſcover the Relicks: But here one may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
perceive a Death's-Head of ſo vaſt a ſize,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51983:59"/>
that if it be <hi>Mary Magdalen's,</hi> we cannot juſtly
refuſe our Aſſent to the Tradition, that aſſures
us of the unuſual Bulkineſs of the reſt of her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Our Guide made us obſerve a little dry
Scurf about the middle of her Forehead, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
towards her Left Eye, and told us, that
this was the place where our Saviour put his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
when, after his Reſurrection,
he ſaid to her,<note n="*" place="margin">John 20. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Touch me not,</hi> &amp;c. But
ſince I had never obſerv'd in the
Scripture, that Chriſt put his Finger on her Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
when he ſpake theſe Words, I ask'd a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
where I might find that Paſſage: He told
me that it was a Holy Tradition of the Church,
which I was oblig'd to believe, under pain of
Hereſie; adding, upon the Authority of the ſame
Tradition, That during the Forty Days which
Chriſt ſpent with his Diſciples after
his Reſurrection<note n="†" place="margin">This is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the laſt Chapter of S. <hi>Matthew's</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, where 'tis ſaid of the two <hi>Maries,</hi> that as they were going from the Sepulchre, Jeſus met 'em, and that they came and <hi>held him by the Feet,</hi> and worſhipped him.</note>, he never touch'd
any thing but this part of <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen's</hi>
Forehead, and S. <hi>Thomas's</hi> Hand,
both which remain entire to this Day.</p>
               <p>This Head is preſerv'd in a Subterraneous Cave,
clos'd with four Iron Doors; and we were told,
that the Bodies of S. <hi>Magdalen,</hi> S. <hi>Maximin,</hi> S. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi>
and S. <hi>Sidonius,</hi> were put into four Marble
Sepulchres, that are ſtill to be ſeen in this Cave,
which was contriv'd on purpoſe for their Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place;
but that theſe Holy Bodies were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
more honourably lodg'd. In the ſame Cave,
or Subterraneous Chapel, they ſhew alſo a little
Glaſs Vial, containing certain ſmall Flints that were
moiſtened with the Blood that our Saviour ſhed
upon the Croſs; endeavouring to make the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatours
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51983:60"/>
believe that the Blood is ſtill viſible; but
whatever care I took to conſider theſe Flints with
all imaginable Attention, I cou'd not perceive the
leaſt Tincture of Blood. Coming up from hence,
we were deſir'd to take Notice of a Shrine of
Porphyrie, which contains the reſt of that Saint's
Bones, except one of her Arms, which is enchas'd
in Silver, and ſuitable in bigneſs to the Head: Her
Flaxen Hair is in another Reliquary: And there are
in the ſame place many other Rarities of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which 'twou'd be too tedious to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>The Church that belongs to this Convent, is
large, well lighted, and very much eſteem'd for
its Architecture. The Inſide is adorn'd with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
fine Marble Columns, eſpecially the great
Altar, which was built by <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of a Vow; and is reckon'd one of the
largeſt, and moſt magnificent Altars in <hi>France.</hi>
All the reſt of the Church is cover'd with
Paintings, by the moſt celebrated Hands, which
are alſo the Effects of Vows: And every Altar is
enrich'd with all ſorts of Veſſels, Candleſticks,
Lamps, and other Ornaments of Gold and Silver,
in great abundance. This Church was built by
<hi>Charles,</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
it with a very plentiful Revenue; and the
Foundation being ſince encreas'd by the Piety of
our Kings, there is a very honourable Maintenance
for Fifty Monks who live here.</p>
               <p>I'm afraid the Holineſs of the Place will ſcarce
make amends for my detaining you ſo long at
S. <hi>Baume;</hi> and therefore ſince a change of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
is always very acceptable to a cloy'd Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
I hope you will have the leſs Reluctancy
to accompany me in a little Journey to <hi>Arles</hi>
and <hi>Niſmes,</hi> where you might divert your ſelf
with a View of thoſe Admirable Antiquities, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51983:60"/>
Illuſtrious Monuments of the <hi>Roman</hi> Grandeur that
are to be ſeen in thoſe places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arles</hi> is a City of <hi>Provence,</hi> and was formerly
the Metropolis of a Kingdom of the ſame Name.
'Twas adorn'd by its old Maſters, the <hi>Romans,</hi>
with Temples, Palaces, Amphitheatres, and other
magnificent Works, moſt of which were ruin'd in
the ſucceeding Revolutions. The Amphitheatre,
commonly call'd <hi>les Arrenes,</hi> has eſcap'd the Fate of
the reſt, tho' not ſo well as that of <hi>Nîmes;</hi> for
'tis impoſſible to walk on the Top from one end
to the other; ſo that I cou'd not meaſure its
Length and Breadth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Town-Houſe</hi> is very remarkable, both for its
Structure and Antiquities: Among the reſt there
is a Marble Statue of <hi>Diana,</hi> which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pronounc'd Oracles to thoſe who came to
conſult her in her Temple, which was ſeated in
the ſame place where the <hi>Town-Houſe</hi> ſtands at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
as appears by the Foundations that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Clock-Tower. All the Walls of the City
are full of pieces of Statues, Cornices, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns,
which give the Spectatour a great <hi>Idea</hi> of
the Number and Beauty of its Ancient Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Among its fineſt Antiquities, I may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reckon that admirable Obelisk which ſome
Years ago was found entire in the Ground,
and was ſince erected to the Glory of <hi>Lewis the
Great,</hi> by the Care and Contrivance of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the <hi>Royal Academy,</hi> with very beautiful
Inſcriptions on the Pedeſtal, both in <hi>Latine</hi> and
<hi>French;</hi> and a <hi>Golden Sun</hi> on the Top, which you
know is the King's Emblem, and the Soul of his
Device. This Obelisk wants the uſual Ornament
of Monuments of that Nature, and, at leaſt in
this reſpect may be juſtly eſteem'd a Rarity. But tho'
there are no Hieroglyphical Figures upon it, to
determine its Age, and diſcover its firſt Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51983:61"/>
'tis generally reputed a Work of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi>
I know not whether the ſame Opinion
will prevail in After-Ages; for perhaps Poſterity
viewing the Inſcriptions that have been lately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to it, will do our Age the Honour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that 'twas capable of Undertaking and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
ſuch Works; if they be not kept from
falling into that Errour, by the Conſideration of
the <hi>Granite</hi> of which 'tis built.</p>
               <p>This City is the Seat of an Archbiſhop, and
of an Academy of Ingenious Perſons, under the
Name of the <hi>Royal Academy of Arles;</hi> to whom
the Publick muſt own it ſelf oblig'd for many
Curious and Learned Treatiſes. 'Tis ſituated on
the <hi>Rhône,</hi> at the diſtance of ſeven Leagues from
its Mouth: But no Ship, nor great Bark, can
come up to the City, by reaſon of the Banks
of Sand with which that River is peſter'd.</p>
               <p>Having ſatisfy'd my Curioſity at <hi>Arles,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to viſit <hi>Niſmes,</hi> one of the moſt remarkable
Cities in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> for its Trade, Antiquity, and
I may alſo add, for its Largeneſs, tho' 'tis at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
much leſs conſiderable in that reſpect than
when (if we may give credit to Hiſtory) 'twas
founded by <hi>Marius,</hi> who choſe this for the place
of his Reſidence, and built it in imitation of <hi>Rome,</hi>
obſerving an exact Equality in the Dimenſions of
the New City, as well as in its Publick Places
and Buildings. But Time, that impartial Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of all things, has made ſo many Alterations
in both theſe Illuſtrious Cities, that at preſent
there is not the leaſt Reſemblance between 'em.</p>
               <p>The principal Monument of Antiquity at <hi>Niſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi>
is its Amphitheatre, the largeſt and moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Structure of that Nature that is at preſent to
be ſeen in any part of the World. I cannot
forbear complaining that Private Perſons are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to fill it with Houſes, which quite take away
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51983:61"/>
the Proſpect of it, and conſequently all its Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
whereas if it were ſtill empty, as when 'twas
poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> all the Curious part of
the World wou'd come to admire the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of its Structure. 'Tis of a perfectly round
or circular Figure, having only one Door, with
a Tower on each ſide of it: It contains 150 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Diameter, and its Circumference amounts
to 460. The Inſide of the Circle is Pyramidal,
in form of Stairs, where the People ſate to behold
the Fights of Beaſts, and other Publick Sights;
and below there are very fair vaulted Galleries,
where the Spectatours might walk till the Shows
began. This lower Story is adorn'd with fine Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns,
with their Cornices; and from place to place
there are Heads of Animals, Eagles and Faſces in
<hi>Relief.</hi> The whole Amphitheatre is built of large
Free-Stones, ſome of which are three Foot ſquare
on all ſides; and particularly thoſe on the Top
of the Building.</p>
               <p>We went out at the Gate <hi>la Bouquerie,</hi> to ſee
the famous Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> where that Goddeſs
pronounc'd her Oracles. 'Tis an exact Square,
the length of each ſide amounting to Seventy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
The Door is round, ten Foot broad, and
fifteen high. This is a very Maſſive Edifice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ancient manner of Building, and
conſiſts of Stones as large as thoſe of the Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre;
ſo that it might ſerve for a Fort in Caſe
of Neceſſity, and even might hold out for ſome
time againſt Cannon.</p>
               <p>Not far from thence there is another no leſs
remarkable Structure, call'd, <hi>la Tour Magne,</hi> which
we may reaſonably conclude to have been
deſign'd for a <hi>Mauſolaeum,</hi> and built in imitation,
tho' not after the Model, of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
'Tis a high and ſolid Pyramidal Tower,
without any Vault or Concavity; and there are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51983:62"/>
Steps made round it, by which one may aſcend
to the Top, tho' not without Danger; for they
are extremely worn and broken in ſeveral places;
ſo that I choſe rather to content my ſelf with
viewing it from below, than to run the hazard
of going up. From thence I return'd to the
City, and went to ſee an old Palace, call'd, <hi>The
Square Houſe,</hi> which at preſent is the Dwelling-Houſe
of a Private Perſon. 'Tis much longer than
broad, built with great Free-Stones, and adorn'd
on the Outſide with ſeveral fine Columns, with
their Baſes and Cornices. Some think this Houſe
was formerly the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> or Hall of Judgment;
but others are of opinion that 'twas the <hi>Capitol</hi>
of <hi>Niſmes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This City is full of People of Quality and Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and tho' there is ſo ſmall a diſtance between it
and <hi>Provence,</hi> I can aſſure you, that their Cuſtoms
are not only different but oppoſite; and inſtead of
that Scorn and Contempt with which <hi>Frenchmen</hi> are
treated at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> here they are entertain'd with
all imaginable Civility, and with the higheſt Marks of
Love and Friendſhip. You wou'd hardly give Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to ſome Inſtances of this Nature which I cou'd
relate to you: The Ladies take pleaſure to accoſt
a Stranger whom they find walking alone; Their
Converſation is accompany'd with all the Sprightli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and innocent Freedom that can be deſir'd. For
tho' they have as tender a Regard to their Honour
as any of their Sex in <hi>France;</hi> their Vertue is not
barbarous and inhumane; and provided a Man have
an Inclination to Love, and be Maſter of a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Stock of Merit, join'd with ſome external Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments,
he may venture to ingage with thoſe
favourable Enemies with almoſt certain Hopes of
Succeſs. I have heard a hundred Relations of ſuch
amorous Adventures of Strangers, who taking Fire
at firſt ſight, were afterwards bleſs'd with the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51983:62"/>
of the Object of their Flames; and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their Love after Marriage, had never any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to repent of the Suddenneſs of their Choice.
For if I might depend upon the Character I have
receiv'd of the Ladies of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and 'tis almoſt
impoſſible for one who has convers'd with 'em to
doubt of the Truth of it; a Man cannot truſt his
Heart in better Hands, nor make a more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reſignation of his Liberty. They are naturally
Loving, Complaiſant, and Conſtant even to Death;
and beſides they are generally of a very pleaſant
Humour, and all their Actions are accompany'd
with a certain Amorous Air that ſeems always to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a Heart, and puts it out of the Owner's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to refuſe it. 'Tis not without an extreme Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
that I muſt content my ſelf with relating
what I heard on this Occaſion, and that I cannot
add my own Experience to the Teſtimony of others;
but I cannot pretend to the Happineſs of thoſe who
find Fortune ready to compliment 'em with a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
at their firſt Arrival: and ſince the main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of my Travels wou'd not ſuffer me to ſtay long
in this Place, I ſaw my ſelf depriv'd of a Pleaſure of
which I had conceiv'd ſo agreeable an <hi>Idea,</hi> and
left with an extreme Reluctancy, that lovely Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where the Cuſtoms and Manner of Living are
ſo ſuitable to my Genius and Inclinations. But at
my Return to this Place I was ſomewhat comforted
by a late Inſtance of the Misfortunes of Love, and
my Grief was in ſome meaſure abated, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
on all the Troubles and Diſaſters that uſually
attend a Paſſion from which we expect nothing but
the Enjoyment of undiſturb'd Delight and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>Two Young Pilgrims betwixt the Age of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Twenty two Years, paſs'd thro' this City
about three Months ago, and like the reſt of thoſe
miſerable Wanderers, who rove about the World
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51983:63"/>
under the Protection of a Pilgrim's Staff, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to take up their Lodging at the Hoſpital <hi>de
la Charité,</hi> where one of 'em, not longer able to
endure the Fatigues, Cold, Hunger, and perpetual
Want of every thing that is neceſſary for Life, ſunk
at laſt under ſuch an inſupportable Load of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and fell into a Fever, accompany'd with ſo great
a Weakneſs, that the Surgeons began to deſpair
of his Recovery. His Companion ſeeing him in
this Condition, was ſo overwhelm'd with Sorrow,
that the very Servants of the Hoſpital, who were
wont to be unconcern'd Spectators of ſuch Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
were touch'd with Compaſſion: He never
ſtirr'd from his ſick Friend's Bed-ſide, gave him his
Broth, ſerv'd him with a wonderful Zeal and
Aſſiduity, and wou'd not ſuffer any other to come
near him. The ſick Perſon, on the other ſide,
was not pleas'd with any thing but what came
from the Hands of his belov'd Companion, and
receiv'd his Services with all the Marks of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and of a moſt tender Affection. In the mean
time the Sickneſs of the one, and the Grief of the
other were daily and equally augmented: The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate
Mourner embrac'd his dying Friend every
Moment, and bath'd his Face with Tears. At
laſt, on the Ninth Day, the Feaver was ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a violent <hi>Criſis,</hi> and the ſick Pilgrim, after
ſome Convulſions, fell into a Swoon, and was
thought to be dead. His Friend then loſing all
Patience, gave himſelf up entirely to the Exceſs
of his Grief, and throwing himſelf upon the dear
Body, with the Tranſports of a Deſpair, that
melted the Hearts of all the Aſſiſtants, burſt forth
into Lamentations, which diſcover'd his ſecret, and
made 'em know that the Perſon whom they hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
treated as a poor Pilgrim, was a young
Lady: <hi>Alas! my dear N...</hi> cry'd he, <hi>Thou art no
more! Thy fair Eyes are ſhut for ever! 'Tis done—
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51983:63"/>
Thou haſt loſt thy dear Life, and 'tis I who have robb'd
thee of it. Ah! my Love! my Soul!</hi> continu'd he,
<hi>thou haſt paid dear for thy Love to me, who am the
wretched occaſion of thy Death in thy moſt blooming Age.
Ah! fatal Love! cruel Parents! unfortunate, and too-loving
Daughter!</hi> Theſe, and ſuch-like Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he utter'd with unconceivable Deſpair, for
the ſpace of a quarter of an Hour; after which,
perceiving that ſhe ſhow'd ſome Signs of Life,
he ſent immediately for a Phyſician, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf at his Feet, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I conjure you
by all that is dear to you in the World, refuſe not your
Aſſiſtance to this young Maid: She is a Perſon of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and deſerves your utmoſt Care for her Preſervation:
Leave no Means unattempted; ſpare no Coſt, Sir, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, and be confident that you ſhall not loſe your
Labour; you ſhall have whatever you pleaſe to demand;
take my promiſe, and you ſhall find me to be a Man of
Honour.</hi> The Phyſician being mov'd with Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
aſſur'd him that the ſick Perſon ſhou'd not
Periſh by his Neglect: And after he had admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd
ſuch Remedies as were moſt neceſſary in
her preſent Condition, he begg'd her Lover to
inform him who they were, and by what Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they fell into ſuch deplorable Circumſtances.
The young Man told him, that he was a Native
of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and born a Gentleman, tho' with a
very ſmall Fortune; That he fell in Love with
this young Lady, who was of a very Rich and
Honourable Family; That She requited his Love
with a Reciprocal Affection, notwithſtanding the
Oppoſition made by her Father, and all the reſt
of her Family, who deſigning to ſettle her Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly
in the World, wou'd never be perſuaded
to accept of ſo poor a Son-in-Law; That, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
they kept a Correſpendence for two Years,
giving and receiving all the Marks of an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible
Tenderneſs, and confirming by mutual
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51983:64"/>
and repeated Oaths, their reſolution to die, rather than
to be guilty of the leaſt Infidelity; That her Father
having provided a conſiderable Match for her, wou'd
have forc'd her to comply with his Inclinations;
That She rejected the Propoſal with great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
and was very rigorouſly treated by her
Father on that Occaſion; and, That when ſhe
cou'd not reſiſt any longer, they reſolv'd to make
their Eſcape, chuſing rather to live poorly and
miſerably together, than to purchaſe the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a plentiful Fortune at the rate of being
for ever ſeparated. In purſuance of that Deſign,
as he inform'd the Phyſician, he ſeiz'd on one of
her Father's Horſes, and after ſhe had diſguis'd
her ſelf in a Man's Habit, he brought her to <hi>Paris,</hi>
where their Money failing, they were forc'd to ſell
their Horſe; and that little Stock being alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,
they were reduc'd to the miſerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in which he found 'em: <hi>'Yet,</hi> added he,
<hi>we were firmly reſolv'd to ſpend the Remainder of our
Lives like wretched Vagabonds, rather than to ſubmit to
the Tyranny of our Relations, if this fatal Sickneſs had
not made me alter my Reſolution. I cannot longer bear,</hi>
continu'd he, <hi>the ſight of ſo diſmal an Object: My
Conſtancy is overcome by her Sufferings; and if God
wou'd vouchſafe to reſtore her Health, I deſign to carry
her back to her Father; tho' conſidering the extreme
Violence of his Humour, I cannot expect a milder
Puniſhment than Death, for the Injury he pretends I
have done him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Phyſician, who is a very Humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
was ſtruck with Compaſſion at the Recital
of their Miſfortunes, and promis'd to aſſiſt 'em not
only as a Phyſician, but as a Friend. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
he order'd the young Lady to be taken out
of the naſty Couch where ſhe lay, and to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
to a convenient Chamber; where ſhe was
laid in a good Bed, and carefully attended till
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51983:64"/>
her Recovery, which happen'd not long after.
In the mean time, he made their Condition known
to the Biſhop, who, as I told you in my laſt, is
none of thoſe moroſe Cenſurers, who exclaim
againſt the leaſt Breach of the Rules of Decency;
and indeed, he was ſenſibly touch'd with the diſaſt'rous
Condition of theſe ſorrowful Lovers; and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the odd Effects of Love and Fortune, he look'd
upon 'em as Objects of Compaſſion, and aſſur'd
'em, that it ſhou'd not be his Fault, if their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
were not crown'd with the Happineſs they
deſerv'd. They were ſoon ſenſible of the Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Kindneſs; for he joyn'd 'em together
in Marriage, Cloath'd 'em, and entertain'd 'em;
till having written to their Relations, and obtain'd
their pardon, he ſent them back to their own
Country. To keep you from ſuſpecting the Truth
of this Relation, 'twill be ſufficient to acquaint
you, that 'tis not above Fifteen Days ſince that
admirable pair of Lovers departed from this Place.
I am ſo much in Love with the Biſhop's Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
on this Occaſion, and even I think my ſelf
ſo extremely oblig'd to him for it, that I know
nothing ſo difficult, which I wou'd not undertake
for his Service: And I'm confident that a Man
who is capable of performing an Action of that
Nature, muſt infallibly be Maſter of all the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>
Virtues.</p>
               <p>And to convince you that he is no leſs remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for his Prudence, and the ſolidity of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I ſhall add one Story more before I finiſh
my Letter.</p>
               <p>About four or five Months ago, the Convent
of the Monks of S. <hi>Anthony</hi> in this City began to
be haunted with one of thoſe Ill-natur'd Spirits,
who not contenting themſelves with making a
frightful Noiſe, beat and knock down all that
come in their Way. The Monks who came out
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51983:65"/>
of their Chambers at Night, were the chief Sufferers
by theſe Diſorders; for their troubleſome Gueſt
watch'd 'em ſo narrowly, and was ſo exact in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Rounds, that 'twas impoſſible to ſtir abroad
without falling into his Clutches; and he always
beſtow'd ſo furious a Correction on thoſe whom
he caught ſtraggling, that they durſt not venture
out of Doors from ſix a-clock at Night to ſix in
the Morning: And even thoſe who had the Wit
to keep out of harms way, cou'd not eſcape alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unmoleſted; for they were terrify'd with
the Clinking of Chains, and ſuch other Noiſes
that are uſually aſcrib'd to returning Spirits. There
were ſeveral Chapters held on this Occaſion, and
the Fathers ſtill concluded that their deceas'd Prior's
Ghoſt was come either to impart ſome Matter of
Importance to 'em, or to ask ſome Queſtions,
and that there was none of 'em worthy to be
his Confident, or to be acquainted with the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why he gave 'em ſo many unwelcome Viſits.
After ſome time ſpent in Deliberation, 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to ſay a great Number of Maſſes for his
Soul, and to keep as cloſe as they cou'd for the
future, to avoid coming within the reach of his Fiſts.
In the mean time this wondrous Ghoſt was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Subject of the publick Talk, and of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of the Monks, who ſhow'd the print of his
Hand on the Wall of the Refectory, and offer'd
a Reward of 100 Crowns to any Man that wou'd
undertake to lodge there, and ſpeak to the Ghoſt,
that they might know what he wanted. This
was a very welcome piece of News to one <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet,</hi>
a Native of <hi>Paris,</hi> who had ſo much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and ſo little Money, that he might have
been eaſily perſuaded to expoſe himſelf to far greater
Dangers for a leſs conſiderable Summ. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he went to the Fathers, and offer'd 'em his
Service, aſſuring 'em he would talk to the Spirit,

                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:51983:67"/>
and endeavour to procure 'em Satisfaction. The
Monks embrac'd the Propoſal, and the Bargain
was concluded: But the Biſhop, hearing of ſo
groſs an Abuſe, ſent for the Superiour, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reproach'd him with Weakneſs and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
forbid him to ſuffer that Man to lodge
in the Houſe, or to ſhow the print of the Hnad
to any Perſon whatſoever; adding, That ſuch a
Circumſtance was very unſuitable to the Nature
of a Spirit, and that he ought rather to watch
himſelf, than to entruſt the Management of an
Affair of that Nature to another. <hi>Blanchet,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Promiſe, came in the Evening,
arm'd <hi>Cap-a-pee;</hi> but inſtead of his expected Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
he was diſmiſs'd with a Compliment.
Some Days after, my Curioſity prompted me to
deſire a Sight of the Hand; but the Monks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
me that Favour, excuſing themſelves upon
the Biſhop's Prohibition. I applauded his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and took the Liberty to tell 'em, That they
ſhou'd not ſuffer themſelves to be frighted into
the belief of an Apparition, till they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of the Truth of it by a ſtrict Examination
of all the Circumſtances; and that they ought not
to inſtill Superſtition into the Minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſince they were naturally too much inclin'd
to it. The Monk to whom I addreſt my Diſcourſe,
was ſo offended at it, that I was almoſt afraid
he wou'd have pull'd out my Eyes: He wonder'd
what cou'd move me to offer him ſuch Advice,
and ask'd whether I took him, and all his Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Brethren, for a Company of <hi>Enthuſiaſts.</hi>
My Freedom had irritated him ſo extremely, that
he was incapable of Reaſon, and therefore I left
him. But the Biſhop's Conduct, and my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were ſufficiently juſtify'd by an Accident that
happen'd ſome Days after. A certain Captain of
a Galley coming one Night to Sup with another
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51983:68"/>
Captain, whoſe Houſe is very near the Convent,
left his Chairmen below, who being ſurpriz'd with
a violent Shower, carry'd the Chair into the Court
of the Monaſtery, and plac'd it under a Portico;
where one of 'em ſitting down in it, fell into ſo
deep a Sleep that he perceiv'd not when the
Gate was ſhut, and wak'd not till Midnight. His
unwillingneſs to diſturb the Fathers at ſuch an
unſeaſonable Hour, made him reſolve to ſit in his
Chair till next Morning: And an Hour after, he
ſaw a Perſon cover'd from Head to Foot with a
long Black Gown, who having open'd the Gate
of the Court with a Key, began to walk up and
down, and cough'd ſeveral times very ſoftly. The
poor Chairman was at firſt ſtruck with Terrour,
for he was one of thoſe who believ'd the Story
of the Apparition; but being a Man of Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he took Courage, and obſerv'd the Motions
of the Spirit. Not long after one of the Monks
appear'd at a Window, and ask'd ſoftly, <hi>Are you
there? Yes,</hi> ſaid the Ghoſt, <hi>Throw down the Rope.
You have ſtaid very long,</hi> reply'd the Father; and
crying <hi>'ſt,</hi> two or three times, let fall a Ladder of
Ropes, by the help of which, the Spirit got into
the Convent, and three Hours after came down
again, and went out. Next Morning the Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
divulg'd the Secret; and 'twas afterwards
diſcover'd that the pretended Ghoſt was a Whore,
whom one of the Monks brought into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
every Night, having invented that Diſguiſe
to fright thoſe who might ſee his Miſtreſs: And
leaſt any of his Companions ſhou'd come out of
their Cells, and diſturb his Pleaſures, he drag'd
Chains thro' the Dormitory, knock'd at the Doors,
and beat thoſe whom he met ſo unmercifully,
that their Fears were much greater than their
Curioſity. This Accident has ſo extremely leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd
the Reputation of thoſe Fathers, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51983:68"/>
this Diſcovery were thought to live pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
regularly, that at preſent they dare not

without feeling the Inconveniencies of bad Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or being troubl'd with the Noiſy Hurry of
the Mariners, I hope you will be the more eaſily
perſuaded to ſtop a while with me at the Iſles
of <hi>If,</hi> where we ſpent a whole Day at Anchor,
after we came out of the Port of <hi>Marſeilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Iſles of <hi>If</hi> are three ſmall Iſlands about three
Miles diſtant from <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> forming a very ſafe
Harbour againſt any ſorts of Wind, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by two ſtrong Caſtles, where the King
keeps a Garriſon. Theſe Iſlands are of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to ſecure the Trade of <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> for
without the Advantage of their Neighbourhood,
that City wou'd be a kind of Priſon, ſince
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51983:69"/>
'twou'd be impoſſible for any Veſſels to go out
of the Port, without expoſing themſelves to the
Inſults of their Enemies: And beſides, the Storms
that are ſo frequent in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> wou'd
drive many Ships upon the Shoar, if they had not
the Conveniency of ſtanding into this Harbour.
But notwithſtanding the Advantageous Situation
of theſe Iſlands, and the great Importance of the
Harbour for the Security of Trade, they were
mortgag'd by one of our Kings to the Duke of
<hi>Florence,</hi> for ſix hundred thouſand Crowns. Whilſt
the Princes of that Family injoy'd the poſſeſſion
of this Poſt, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> left no means uneſſay'd
to make himſelf Maſter of it; but they were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reſolv'd to keep it in their own Power, or
afraid to incur the Anger of the <hi>French,</hi> ſince 'tis
certain that they rejected all the Propoſals that
were made to 'em upon this Occaſion. Theſe
Iſlands were afterwards reunited to the Crown,
by the Marriage of <hi>Mary de Medicis</hi> with <hi>Henry</hi> the
<hi>Fourth.</hi> And the Succeſs of that Negotiation was in
a great meaſure owing to the Marquiſs <hi>de Pile,</hi>
who was then Governour of the Place; for he
made Duke <hi>Francis</hi> ſenſible, that 'twas better to
comply with the Deſires of that Monarch, than
to engage himſelf in a War with ſo potent an
Enemy. In conſideration of ſo acceptable a piece
of Service, the Marquiſs was continu'd in his
former Poſt, and the Reverſion of his Office was
beſtow'd on his Son, who died there, leaving
two Sons, the elder of whom, who enjoys his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's
Title, ſucceeded in the Government of
theſe Iſlands; and the younger, call'd the Count
<hi>de Forville,</hi> was made Governour <hi>Viguier</hi> of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi>
and Captain of one of the King's Galleys;
the yearly Revenue of theſe two Places amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to 20000 Livres.</p>

To make amends for the leſs favourable part
of the Character I gave you of the Natives of
<hi>Prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce,</hi> I ſhall take this Occaſion to acquaint
you with ſome of their better Qualities: For I
love to do Juſtice to all Men; and beſides, I
wou'd willingly make my Peace with the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
before I leave their Country: They are
very good Mariners, and are famous over all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
for their Induſtry and Diligence: Nor are
they leſs remarkable for their Courage and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
for they are ſo little capable of Fear, that
they wou'd reckon it a piece of Cowardice to
turn their Backs to ten times their Number of
Enemies. Not very long ago, our Captain's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
call'd <hi>Blaiſe Marin,</hi> in a Ship of Forty Guns,
maintain'd a Fight for three Days together, during
a Calm, againſt five <hi>Tripolin</hi> Men of War, with ſo
much Reſolution and Succeſs, that they were forc'd
at laſt to leave him. And a ſmall Bark of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Men, was about a Year ago ſnatch'd out of
the very Jaws of the <hi>Algerines,</hi> by the Prudence
and Bravery of the Pilot. She was chas'd by one
of the largeſt of the Enemy's Ships, in which
there were four hundred Men, till ſeeing no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of eſcaping, that Handful of Men reſolv'd
to board the Ship that purſu'd 'em, without
lowering their Sails, or grappling the Veſſels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
And the Pilot leaping on board the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Ship, with his Curtelas in his Hand, cut
the Rope that ſuſtain'd their Main-Sail, which
they cou'd not hoiſe again in above three Hours.
In the mean time the Pilot jump'd into his own
Bark, and Crying, <hi>Courage, my Boys, we're ſav'd,</hi>
ſteer'd away from the Enemy, who could never
afterwards come up with him. The Merchants at his
Return, preſented him with a Gold Medal; nor
cou'd they in Juſtice do leſs Honour to ſo rare
a Merit. But they will not be ſo kind to a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51983:70"/>
call'd <hi>Curet,</hi> who had the Misfortune to be
taken by the Galleys of <hi>Naples</hi> about three Months
ago: For tho' he had only 24 Guns mounted,
and 100 Men on board, to reſiſt ſeven Galleys
that attack'd him; his Countrymen exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him as the baſeſt of Cowards; and I know
not whether 'twill ever be ſafe for him to ſhow
his Face at <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> But after all, this ſeems to
be a Rodomontade, rather than an effect of true
Courage; ſince it muſt be acknowledg'd that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Galleys are a very unequal Match for the
ſtrongeſt Merchant-Ship in the World.</p>
               <p>Three Days after our departure from <hi>If,</hi> we
arriv'd at <hi>Genoa,</hi> which you know is uſually call'd
<hi>Genoa the Proud,</hi> tho' in my Opinion it cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the leaſt Right to that Title: 'Tis the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City of <hi>Liguria,</hi> and had its Name from <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
the firſt, King of <hi>Italy;</hi> or according to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
from <hi>double-fac'd Janus.</hi> Some make this
<hi>Janus</hi> King of the <hi>Toïans;</hi> and others deduce
the Etymology of the Word from <hi>Janua,</hi> a <hi>Gate,</hi>
or <hi>Door;</hi> becauſe <hi>Genoa</hi> is as it were the Gate of
<hi>Italy.</hi> Authors are generally much divided con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the true Name of this City: <hi>Luitprand,
Tircin,</hi> and ſome others, call it <hi>Janua; Titus Livi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> give it the Name of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua;</hi>
and the latter Opinion ſeems to be better
grounded than the former, eſpecially ſince 'tis
confirm'd by a ſmall Copper-Plate, which is to
be ſeen in this Place, and was found <hi>Ann.</hi> 1507.
by a Peaſant, as he was Tilling the Ground. The
Inſcription is engrav'd in very ſmall, but pretty
diſtinct, <hi>Roman</hi> Characters; and in it the <hi>Genoeſe</hi>
are call'd <hi>Genuates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time of its Foundation is unknown, at
leaſt I never had the Fortune to meet with a
ſatisfactory Account of it in any Author, either
Ancient or Modern. 'Tis ſeated at the bottom
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51983:71"/>
of a little Gulf, on the Declivity, and at the Foot
of a Hill, ſeeming to conſiſt of ſeveral Stories.
The Port lies very open towards the Sea, and
therefore cannot afford ſafe Anchorage for Ships.
The City contains five and thirty Pariſhes; the
Streets are uneven, and very narrow, tho' the
Houſes are extremely high. In the middle of the
<hi>Publick Place,</hi> there is a Marble Statue of an unuſual
bigneſs, repreſenting <hi>Andrew Doria,</hi> the Deliverer of
the Republick, trampling on three <hi>Turks</hi> Heads,
in Memory of the ſignal Victories he obtain'd
over theſe Infidels. The Palaces of <hi>Genoa</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much admir'd; and it muſt be acknowledg'd
that ſome of 'em are very fine Structures; but
the principal Beauty of thoſe few that deſerve
that Title, conſiſts in the <hi>Marble</hi> of which they
are built.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marble</hi> is no Rarity in this Country; all the
Churches are adorn'd with it, as well as the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
Royal,</hi> where his Serenity keeps his Reſidence:
But after all, you muſt not imagine that the
Streets are pav'd with it. Since we ſtaid but
two Days in the City, I cou'd not find an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to ſee the Inſide of any of the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and therefore I cannot ſatisfie your Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with a Deſcription of 'em. You are ſo well
acquainted with the nature of the Government,
that 'twou'd be needleſs to give you any farther
Account of it; only I cannot forbear taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the extreme Decreaſe of the Power and
Grandeur of this Republick ſince thoſe glorious
Days, when they extended their Conqueſts to
the <hi>Tanais,</hi> and made themſelves Maſters of all
the Coaſts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Iſlands of <hi>Cyprus,
Scio, Lesbos,</hi> &amp;c. They ſtill retain a little Iſland,
with the Title of a Kingdom, and are extremely
proud of it, tho', in my Opinion, without any
reaſon. The Habits of the Nobles reſemble thoſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51983:71"/>
of the Counſellors in <hi>France;</hi> they dare not wear
Gold or Silver when they come abroad; but in
their Houſes they have very rich Veſts, and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Night-Gowns.</p>
               <p>Since the late Bombardment of the City, they
cannot endure thoſe of our Nation. They ſhow'd
me a Convent of Nuns, into which there fell
not one Bomb, tho' there were above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſhot at it; and told me, that there was a
Hand ſeen in the Air, which diverted their
Courſe, and threw 'em another way. The <hi>Jews,</hi>
who are deteſted by all the World, were in great
Favour here during thoſe terrible Diſorders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they found out a way to quench the Bombs
with Ox Hides: Yet this is not a new Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for the ſame was practiſed long before by
the Inhabitants of <hi>Groningen,</hi> when they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd
by the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> in 1672: And
ſince that time the <hi>Algerines</hi> made uſe of the ſame
Secret; beſides the covering of their Streets with
Sand. Nor is there any thing wonderful in the
Succeſs of this Stratagem; for one may eaſily and
infallibly ſmother a Bomb if he can come in
time to ſtop the Hole before the Fuſee be ſpent.
At the Aſſault of the Horn-Work at <hi>Philipsburg,</hi>
I ſaw a Soldier take the ſame way to prevent
the Effect of the Granadoes, which the <hi>Germans</hi>
threw among us: For he gather'd 'em as they
fell, and ſtopping the Touch-Hole with his Hand,
either ſmother'd 'em immediately, or threw 'em
back upon the Enemies. But tho' this may be
eaſily done, it cannot be attempted without Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
for the Fuſee is always made as ſhort as
poſſible; and if the Fire ſhou'd happen to reach
the Powder when the Man throws himſelf upon
the Bomb, the ſhutting out of the Air wou'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

But tho' the ſhortneſs of our ſtay at <hi>Genoa</hi>
wou'd not permit me to gratifie your Curioſity
with an Account of the Beauties and Rarities of
that City; I confeſs I cannot pretend the ſame
Excuſe for declining to undertake the Deſcription
of <hi>Rome, Florence,</hi> and the place where I am at
preſent. I have ſpent two whole Months in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
and admiring that infinite Number of
Wonders that ſeem to have been brought from
all the parts of the World, and ſhut up in this
Country, as in a vaſt <hi>Repoſitory.</hi> I have even
wallow'd in Delight, and been kept in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Rapture with the amazing View of ſo many
noble <hi>Structures,</hi> auguſt Monuments of <hi>Antiquity,</hi>
ineſtimable <hi>Libraries, Statues, Pictures,</hi> Works of
<hi>Marble</hi> and <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> and a Thouſand other Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities,
of which there is a prodigious and even
incredible Abundance in theſe places. I have ſeen
all theſe magnificent Rarities; I have view'd 'em
with all imaginable Pleaſure and Attention, and
my Mind is ſtill full of their agreeable <hi>Idea</hi>'s; but
tho' I have not forgot what I promis'd you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Conſideration of your Satisfaction, nor
of my own Engagement, can make me willing
to keep my Promiſe with reſpect to <hi>Italy.</hi> You
muſt e'en give me leave to claim the Privilege
of a <hi>Norman</hi> once in my Life; and you will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpenſe with the Account you expected from
me, if you peruſe the Relations of ſo many <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,</hi>
who have viſited this lovely Country from
one end to the other, eſpecially the late Work of
Monſieur <hi>Miſſon:</hi> For what can be added to ſo
exact a Deſcription? Is there any Corner in <hi>Italy,</hi>
that has eſcap'd his inquiſitive Curioſity, or any
thing remarkable in it which he has not illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
with Learned and Judicious Reflexions?
He is a compleat Traveller; he has forgot nothing
that deſerves to be taken notice of, and has ſo
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51983:72"/>
intirely exhauſted his Subject, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left for future Obſervers. And therefore,
inſtead of deſcribing <hi>Italy,</hi> I ſhall only deſire you
to conſult his Book, by the Aſſiſtance of which,
you may make one of the pleaſanteſt Voyages in
the World without going out of your Cloſet.
But ſince you will perhaps expect that I ſhou'd
at leaſt add ſomething to convince you that I
have ſeen theſe celebrated Places, I ſhall adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to tell you, that among ſo many admirable
Rarities that fill'd me with Wonder and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there is nothing, in my Opinion, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
and ſurpriſing than the Pomp and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of the <hi>Court of Rome.</hi> I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Remark will make amends for my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in other Reſpects: You'll perhaps tell me,
that 'tis a ſtale and trivial Obſervation: However,
you muſt give me leave to aſſure you, that 'tis
not an eaſie Task to repreſent all its Wonders;
and I muſt confeſs, that hitherto I had never any
<hi>Idea</hi> of it, that did not come ſhort of the Truth.
The <hi>Court of Rome</hi> is no leſs Numerous and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
than that of <hi>France;</hi> and perhaps I might
venture to ſay, that the <hi>latter</hi> is exceeded by the
<hi>former.</hi> Every <hi>Cardinal</hi> is a Prince, who receives
daily all the Marks of Honour and Reſpect from
a Thouſand Prelates, and other Eccleſiaſticks, that
look upon him as their Sovereign, and place their
whole Felicity in his Favour. Nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to compleat the Splendor of their Dignity:
Magnificent Palaces, rich Furnitures, delicious
Tables, Pleaſure-Houſes, Gardens, Grotto's, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
numerous Trains of Servants, and, to crown
all, the Converſation and Society of the handſomeſt
Ladies in <hi>Europe;</hi> for you muſt not imagine that their
Character confines 'em to all the Auſterities of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick
Life; and, excepting only ſome <hi>Gray-Bearded
Dotards,</hi> that pretend to the <hi>Popedom,</hi> the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51983:73"/>
reſt are as Gay and Amorous as any young <hi>French</hi>
Prince. 'Twou'd be needleſs to apply this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
particularly to all the Members of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
College;</hi> and therefore I ſhall content my ſelf
with aſſuring you, that none deſerves it more juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than the <hi>Cardinal Patron,</hi> who has acquir'd ſo
Univerſal a Reputation of an accompliſh'd Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
that 'tis generally reckon'd the moſt effectual
way to obtain a Favour of him, to make uſe of
the Interceſſion of a <hi>Lady;</hi> and even he ſcruples
not to declare, that he has not the Force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
any thing to a <hi>fair Petitioner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who love <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi> cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
a more favourable Treatment than they meet
with under the preſent Pontificate. The <hi>Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
encourages 'em by his own Example; his
Table and Furniture are Magnificent, and his
<hi>Nephews</hi> reſemble ſo many Sovereigns. The Prince
<hi>Mark</hi> is attended with a Train of forty Lacqueys,
all clad in a Livery of Cloth of Gold, and his Stable
is furniſh'd with ſixty of the fineſt Horſes in <hi>Rome;</hi>
tho' all this is a manifeſt Violation of the Edicts
that were publiſh'd to regulate the Affairs of the
<hi>Nepotiſm.</hi> 'Tis true, the People grumble extremely
to ſee their Subſtance exhauſted, and the very
Blood drain'd out of their Bodies, to maintain
the extravagant Vanity of thoſe <hi>Upſtart Favourites,</hi>
who about a Year ago were as poor as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
But among ſo many Marks of Splendour,
there is nothing more ſurprizing, than the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
<hi>Gondola's,</hi> built by the Pope's Orders,
which are the firſt that ever grac'd the <hi>Tiber.</hi>
His Holineſs goes thither very often to take the
Air, accompany'd with thoſe that have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Share in his Favour; and 'tis thought he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
to bring the <hi>Venetian Freſco</hi> into Faſhion at
<hi>Rome,</hi> which in my Opinion is a Project that
may be eaſily accompliſh'd, ſince the <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51983:73"/>
love to be ſeen, as well as the reſt of the Fair
Sex.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Luxury and Vanity of
the preſent Pope, gives occaſion to ſeveral well-diſpos'd
Perſons, to make Compariſons between
his Conduct, and that of his Predeceſſour, which
you may reaſonably conclude are not in the leaſt
Advantageous to his Holineſs: For there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a very remarkable Difference between theſe
two Pontiffs: He who at preſent fills the Chair,
makes it his only buſineſs to gratifie his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to Pleaſure, and to Aggrandize his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
whereas the good Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
only to the performance of the Duties of his
Office, reforming the Abuſes that had crept into
<hi>Rome,</hi> viſiting the Hoſpitals, and aſſiſting the Poor.
And beſides, he left no Means uneſſay'd, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
Peace to <hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> And when an unjuſt
Power endeavour'd to extend its Uſurpations to
the Church it ſelf, we had the Pleaſure to ſee
that generous Prelate oppoſe the incroaching Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
with a Reſolution and Piety worthy of
a Common Father. His Private Life, and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Occupations, were no leſs Edifying: He
was eaſie of Acceſs to all Men, and hearken'd
favourably to the Poor when they came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
their Grievances to him, or to beg his
Aſſiſtance. His external Deportment was very
ſimple, and ſo free from the leaſt Appearance of
<hi>Worldly Pomp,</hi> that he might be call'd the <hi>Model of
Humility.</hi> I'm aſſur'd by ſeveral Perſons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtion'd
Credit, that the Expence
of his Table was fix'd at<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>One</hi> Shilling.</note> 
                  <hi>Two Julio's</hi>
a Day, and that the whole Charge
of his Proviſions did not exceed <hi>Fifty Crowns</hi> a
Year. I cannot without Aſtoniſhment reflect on
the admirable Sobriety of a Perſon who might
be juſtly rank'd among the moſt Potent Princes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51983:74"/>
in the World; and am not at all ſurpriz'd that
moſt Perſons here eſteem him a Saint. 'Tis ſaid
that <hi>Miracles</hi> are wrought at his Tomb; and if
that Report continue a while longer, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be the only Object of the People's Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I know not whether the Zeal of his Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
may not one Day procure the deceas'd Pope
a place among the <hi>Canoniz'd Saints:</hi> But conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Reputation of his <hi>Succeſſour,</hi> I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to aſſure you, that he will never be enroll'd
among that Number.</p>
               <p>Under this Pontificat the <hi>Curtezans</hi> have reſum'd
their expiring Courage, and begin to appear with the
ſame Haughtineſs and Inſolency that ſeem'd to
be in ſome Meaſure curb'd under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. That Jovial Society, which
may be reckon'd a <hi>Fourth Order</hi> in the State, and
no leſs conſiderable than any of the reſt, will,
in all probability, maintain its Privileges and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
as long as the Supreme Power is lodg'd in
the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who will never deprive themſelves of
ſo neceſſary a <hi>Diverſion.</hi> And truly, I know not
how ſo many young Perſons that are engag'd in
a Vow which they are not able to perform,
cou'd ſubſiſt, without the comfortable Aſſiſtance
of thoſe <hi>Communicative Ladies.</hi> Honeſt <hi>Matrons</hi> are
daily affronted by thoſe domineering <hi>Strumpets,</hi>
whoſe Inſolence they muſt ſuffer patiently, ſince
'twou'd be in vain to contend with the <hi>Miſtreſſes
of their Maſters.</hi> I'm not in the leaſt ſurpriz'd at
their Haughtineſs and Pride; but I confeſs I
cou'd never have believ'd, without the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of my own Eyes, that they had ſo much
Liberty, and ſo little Shame. We had no ſooner
drop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d Anchor before <hi>Leghorn,</hi> but we were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
boarded by a Dozen of theſe <hi>Female
Pyrates,</hi> who, in ſpite of the Captain, carry'd off
an equal Number of Prizes; for Mariners look
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51983:74"/>
upon this Port as a priviledg'd Place, where
they may ramble without controul. 'Tis true,
they find Pleaſure is not a cheap Commodity in
this place; for theſe Ladies are not ſo Hoſpitable
as to entertain Travellers <hi>Gratis,</hi> and they uſually
ſet a very high price on their Favours, eſpecially
at <hi>Rome,</hi> which may be call'd the <hi>Centre of Whores.</hi>
I will not pretend to warrant the Truth of their
Opinion, who ſay, That at <hi>Rome</hi> Whores may ſue
a Man for their Hire: But I can aſſure you, that
they may and do demand the Aſſiſtance of the
<hi>Corte,</hi> or Watch, who have Orders to protect 'em,
and ſee 'em paid, according to the Quality of the
Perſon. The <hi>Corte</hi> is a Band of <hi>Sbirri's,</hi> who walk
the Rounds every Night, to prevent Diſorders;
but their Authority is ſo ſmall, and the care they
take to ſuppreſs Abuſes ſo ineffectual, that I know
not whether the City receives any Benefit by 'em:
For ſince they are not permitted to Fire at any
Perſon, 'tis eaſie for any Man that has the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of a Nimble Pair of Heels, to avoid fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into their Clutches; and there are ſome roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Hectors, who not only make Head againſt
'em, but even keep 'em in Awe. I might reckon
up a Thouſand Inſtances of ſuch inſolent Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies;
but I ſhall content my ſelf with mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one that happen'd very lately: The City was
never plagu'd with a more deſperate Villain than
a certain <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Lord, call'd, <hi>The Prince de la
Matrice,</hi> who was Ring-leader of Fifty <hi>Bandits</hi> that
were fit Companions for ſuch a Maſter: He and
his Gang made all the <hi>Sbirri's</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> quake,
and continu'd their Inſolences above a Year, till
at laſt the Pope having iſſu'd out an Order to
take him alive or dead, he took Sanctuary in a
Church, where he Capitulated with his Holineſs,
and was permitted to depart with Bag and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
he and all his Companions. 'Tis certainly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51983:75"/>
a very great Abuſe, that Churches ſhou'd ſerve
as places of Retreat for Villains; and ſo long as
theſe Privileges remain, the aboliſhing of the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes</hi>
will never put a Stop to the reigning Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.
But, which is ſtill more intolerable, the
Churches are not only ſo many <hi>Sanctuaries</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Malefactors from Puniſhment, but the <hi>Theatres</hi>
where they act their Villanies. The other Day,
when the People were met to hear <hi>Veſper's</hi> at the
Church of S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and were buſie at their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
Fifteen or Twenty Perſons cry'd out on
a ſudden, <hi>Fly, fly, the Church is falling;</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
run towards the Door, with ſo many
ſigns of Fear, that the People were almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
that the Church was tumbling about their
Ears. And ſince on ſuch Occaſions 'tis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
for a Man to think of ſaving himſelf, before
he conſider the greatneſs or probability of the
Danger, the People in the Church follow'd thoſe
whom they ſaw running out, with ſo much haſte
and confuſion, that ſeveral Perſons were trodden
under Foot, and ſo hurt that they were forc'd to
keep their Beds. In the mean time the Rogues
were not idle Spectatours of the Fright they had
occaſion'd; and ſome began to miſs their Purſes,
and others their Silver-hilted Swords, aſſoon as
the Tumult was appeas'd, and the Cheat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd.</p>
               <p>During my abode at <hi>Rome,</hi> I had the fortune
to meet with the ſame <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who, as I told you
in one of my preceeding Letters, was impriſon'd
at <hi>Maſcon</hi> on ſuſpicion of <hi>Witchcraft:</hi> He makes
his Court to Cardinal <hi>Chigi,</hi> whom he ſolicites ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
earneſtly, and expects to obtain a Benefice from
him; but he is certainly an incorrigible Fool, as
you may perceive by the Account he gave me
of himſelf. He aſſur'd me, that he entertain'd a
moſt intimate Fellowſhip and Correſpondence with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51983:75"/>
certain imaginary Inhabitants of the <hi>Air,</hi> by
whoſe Aſſiſtance he pretends that one may eaſily
ſurmount all Difficulties, and wou'd have perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me, that theſe Spirits open'd the Doors of
the Priſon when he was in danger of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
as a <hi>Sorcerer.</hi> I was ſo ſurpriz'd at the
Novelty and Oddneſs of his Opinion, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to diſcourſe ſeriouſly with him about it,
and ask'd him how he came acquainted with
that Airy People, and why they wou'd not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
themſelves to the reſt of Mankind. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
that they communicated their Favours only
to thoſe who are willing to hearken to 'em, and
to enter into a Society with 'em; adding, that
they have many Correſpondents in the World
who live unknown, and conceal themſelves with
all poſſible Care, to avoid the Fate of ſo many
Honeſt Perſons, that have been burnt alive for
Witchcraft in ſeveral places of the Kingdom.
He deny'd poſitively that there were any <hi>Witches,</hi>
ſaying, That God was too Juſt and Good to give
ſo much Power to the Devil, who, according to
his Opinion, lies bound in Hell, from whence he
ſhall never be releas'd. But I ſoon perceiv'd that
there was as much Confuſion in his Brain as in
his Diſcourſe, and that he was a meer <hi>Fantaſtical
Enthuſiaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not what Credit ye will give to this
Man's Relation concerning his imaginary Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
in the Air; but you may firmly believe
the Story with which I am going to conclude my
Letter, ſince I was an Eye-witneſs of all that
paſs'd. A certain <hi>Florentine</hi> Soldier in this City,
without pretending to be invulnerable, undertook
for a Wager of a Crown to ſtand as a Mark
till four Bullets were ſucceſſively ſhot at him,
and perform'd his Undertaking without receiving
the leaſt hurt, tho' the Man who diſcharg'd the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51983:76"/>
Gun ſtood but fifty Paces from him, and cou'd
neither be ſuſpected of Colluſion, nor want of
Skill, ſince all the four Bullets pierc'd the Door
againſt which the <hi>Florentin</hi> ſtood. You will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
look upon this as a very odd and ſurprizing
Accident: I was ſo amaz'd at it, that I know
not whether I cou'd have believ'd it if I had not
ſeen it: Yet I can aſſure you, that the <hi>Florentin</hi>
is no Magician, and that his Secret only conſiſts
in ſhifting his place aſſoon as he perceives the
flaſhing of the Powder: And the Account he
gave me of the eaſineſs of his Undertaking, has
conſiderably leſſen'd my Surprizal at the Succeſs
of it: However, I wou'd not for 10000 Piſtols
try the Experiment any otherwiſe than by ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Bullet into the Sea. The Soldier found out
this way to give me ſome Satisfaction; and I
obſerv'd that the Bullet remain'd ſo long in the
Air, that a Man might eaſily have avoided it.</p>
               <p>Our Captain having taken in all his Lading,
expects only a fair Wind; and by good fortune,
the third part of the Cargo belongs to <hi>Malta;</hi>
ſo that I ſhall have the pleaſure of ſpending at
the leaſt Fifteen Days in that celebrated Iſland.</p>

               <p>THo' I promis'd in my laſt to excuſe you
from ſharing with us in the Inconveniencies
of the Sea, and to bring you from <hi>France</hi> to
<hi>Turkey,</hi> without meeting with one Storm; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forbear giving you account of one that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
us in the height of <hi>Sardinia.</hi> And I have
even the confidence to think that you will not
complain of my breach of Promiſe, ſince we had
all the <hi>Trouble,</hi> and you will only have the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi>
if there be any truth in the common Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
That Men uſually take delight in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Relation of diſtant Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>The pleaſure of our Voyage was not diſturb'd
for the firſt two Days, tho' we made no great
Progreſs; but on the Third, about ſeven in the
Morning, there aroſe on the ſudden a moſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>North-Eaſt</hi> Wind, which burſt our Sails as if
they had been made of Paper; and between the
Wind on one ſide, and the <hi>South-Weſt</hi> Surges on
the other, our Ship was ſo violently toſs'd, that
our Mariners durſt not ſtir from the Sides of the
Ship, for fear of being waſh'd off by the Waves.
Never was there any Object more capable of
ſtriking Terrour into the Spectatour; never any
Noiſe more frightful and amazing than that
which was occaſion'd by the tumbling of the
Casks and Boxes, the Wind, Thunder, and Sea,
the cracking of the Ship, and the howling of
ſome Women that were on board. A horrid
Gloom turn'd the Day into Night, and was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by a Flaſh of Lightning that cover'd our
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51983:77"/>
Ship for above a Minute, and was accompany'd
with a terrible and ſtupefying Crack. I know
not what we did in the mean time, nor was
there one among my Fellow-Paſſengers that cou'd
inform me what was done in that dreadful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute:
For we were all ſo ſtunn'd, that there
were hardly any Signs of Life left in us. All
the Account I can give you is, that when we
recover'd our ſenſes, we perceiv'd that the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
had left a thick and black Smoak, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
with a ſulphureous and noiſom Stench, that
wou'd have kill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d us if it had laſted a quarter of
an Hour; but it was diſſipated in a Moment.
We found alſo that we were remov'd from the
places where we were when the Lightning fell;
which Change, doubtleſs, proceeded from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Motion and Agitation of the Ship. Among
the reſt, one of the Ship-Boys who lay ſculking
in the Fore-Caſtle, was thrown upon the Hatches
in the other end of the Ship, and ſo bruis'd, and
black with Contuſions, (tho' I may ſay more
properly, that there was only one Contuſion,
which cover'd his whole Body) that we have
ſtill reaſon to doubt of his Recovery. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
concluded that the <hi>Devil</hi> was the Author
of all theſe Diſorders, and that there was ſome
Perſon in the Company under a Sentence of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication:</hi>
For (you know) extraordinary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
are uſually eſteem'd <hi>Miracles</hi> by the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
Vulgar. 'Tis true, the throwing of
the Boy ſo far may at the firſt View ſeem to be
above the Power of Nature; but an attentive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderer
will not be much ſurpriz'd at this Effect
of the Tempeſt, ſince this is not the firſt time
that a <hi>Hurricane</hi> has ſnatch'd up Men, and even whole
Ships. This puts me in mind of a Story almoſt
of the ſame Nature, which I heard at <hi>Guernſey,</hi>
a little Iſland, ſubject to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:51983:77"/>
It happen'd one Day, that during a violent Storm,
a Flaſh of Lightning ſet fire to the Powder in the
Caſtle, and blew it up, with the whole Garriſon.
Only Ten or Twelve Perſons eſcap'd, among whom
the Governour had the good fortune to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in a very ſingular manner: They aſſur'd
me that he was carry'd thro' the Air in his Bed,
and laid down upon the Caſtle Wall, the Foot of
which is bath'd by the Sea; and that not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to get down, becauſe the Wall was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
ſteep on both ſides, he remain'd there till
the Weather began to grow calm, and then made
ſigns to the People of the Town, who came to
his Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>This furious Tempeſt was ſucceeded by pretty
fair Weather, which we enjoy'd during the reſt
of our Voyage to <hi>Malta,</hi> where we arriv'd ſix
Days after, and in nine Days from <hi>Leghorn;</hi> ſo that
we made above a hundred Miles a Day, for
the diſtance betwixt theſe two Places amounts to
about a Thouſand Miles. We had no reaſon to
complain of the ſlowneſs of our Paſſage, tho 'we might
have perform'd the Voyage much ſooner if the Wind
had been conſtantly favourable: For the Captain
aſſur'd me, that the <hi>Great Maſter</hi> of <hi>Malta,</hi> having
ſent an expreſs to <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> the Ship on
which the Meſſenger embark'd, met with ſo ſtrong
an <hi>Eaſterly</hi> Wind, that ſhe was carry'd nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Miles in three Days, and arriv'd at the Port
of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where finding another Ship ready to
ſet ſail for <hi>Malta,</hi> he took Poſt for <hi>Aix,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diſpatch'd his Buſineſs, return'd the ſame
Night to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where he embark'd in that Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
which immediately ſet ſail with a moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<hi>Weſterly</hi> Gale, and in three Days arriv'd
at <hi>Malta:</hi> So that in Seven Days he perform'd a
Voyage of eighteen hundred Miles, travell'd ten
Leagues by Land, and diſpatch'd his Affairs. I
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51983:78"/>
muſt confeſs few Travellers are ſo fortunate;
but that which happens <hi>rarely</hi> may happen <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Iſland was of old call'd <hi>Melita;</hi> and its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Name is an Abbreviation or Corruption of
the former: It lies in the thirty fourth Degree of
<hi>North</hi> Latitude, being ſeventy Miles in compaſs,
twenty five long, and ten broad. Under the Reign
of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and long before, 'twas govern'd by its
own Kings, from whom it was taken by the
<hi>Saracens,</hi> who afterwards loſt it to the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
In the Year 1530, <hi>Charles</hi> V. erected it into a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,
which he beſtow'd on the Knights of
S. <hi>John,</hi> who eight Years before were driven out
of <hi>Rhodes</hi> by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and had till then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rov'd
as <hi>Pyrates</hi> upon the Sea. The Conditions of the
Donation were, That the Nomination of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
ſhou'd belong to him; That the Knights
ſhou'd preſent him Yearly with a <hi>Falcon,</hi> as a
Mark of Homage; and that they ſhou'd not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
into their Ports any Ships or Veſſels at En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> which they pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
obſerve to this Day. But the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
has no reaſon to boaſt of this Cuſtom as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Mark of Honour or Acknowledgment, ſince
his Ships meet with the ſame Treatment with thoſe
of other Princes, and are never admitted into the
Harbours of this Iſland. I'm ſo loth to ſend you
an imperfect Account of this Place, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forbear taking notice of the famous Siege which
it ſuffer'd <hi>Ann.</hi> 1565. tho' I cannot reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you to be ignorant of a Tranſaction that made
ſo great a Noiſe in the World. <hi>Sultan Solyman,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
to extirpate the whole Order, ſent a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Army againſt 'em, under the command
of <hi>Sinan Baſſa,</hi> who poſſeſs'd himſelf of the Iſland,
burnt the Villages, made the Inhabitants Slaves,
and deſtroy'd the whole Country with Fire and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51983:78"/>
Sword. But the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo</hi> put a Stop to
his Fury, and reſiſted all his Attacks, till upon the
News of the approach of the powerful Aids ſent
by the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, he was forc'd to make a
diſorderly Retreat, leaving two great pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
one of which lies at the bottom of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Port; and the other under the Baraque
of <hi>Italy,</hi> commonly call d, <hi>The great Baſilisk,</hi> and
carrying 120 pound Ball. The next Year the
<hi>Great Maſter, de la Valette,</hi> laid the Foundation of
the New City, and call'd it by his own Name.
I may venture to ſay, without an Hyperbole, that
this is the ſtrongeſt City in the World: I never
ſaw ſo many, nor better contriv'd Works; and
beſides, the Strength of the Place is very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
augmented by the Advantages of its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for all the <hi>Half-Moons</hi> and <hi>Baſtions</hi> are cut
out of the Rock, as well as the <hi>Counterſcarp</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
'em; and the Ditches, which in ſome places
are ſixty Foot deep, and proportionably broad.</p>
               <p>The Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo</hi> is in the Old City,
which is ſeparated from the other by a double
Port, conſiſting of two Harbours, divided by a
Neck of Land, which have but one Mouth. At
the end of this <hi>Iſthmus</hi> ſtands the Caſtle of S. <hi>Elm,</hi>
defending the Entry of both Ports, in one of
which the Ships that arrive are oblig'd to perform
their <hi>Quarantain,</hi> having the conveniency of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Iſland, which ſerves as a <hi>Lazaretto</hi> for the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and their Goods. On the other ſide is the great
Harbour, frequented by thoſe who are permitted
to converſe with the Inhabitants. Both theſe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are ſafe and convenient; but the Entry is
extremely dangerous, by reaſon of the Rocks that
lie hid under the Water.</p>
               <p>The New City, call'd <hi>Valette,</hi> is ſeated partly
on the Top, and partly on the Declivity of a
riſing Ground, deſcending to the Shoar. The
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51983:79"/>
Streets are ſtreight, running in parallel Lines both
thro' the Length and Breadth of the City, and
are ſo contriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, that the Aſcent is only diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in four or five, the reſt being exactly level.
The Houſes are generally fair, built after the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Faſhion, with Platforms on the Top; ſo that
the Sketch of the New City reſembles perfectly a
<hi>Rectilinear Amphitheatre.</hi> The Old City is not ſo
beautiful, and is at preſent only inhabited by the
Common People; yet 'tis the Seat of the Biſhop
and his Chapter, which may vie with any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of that Nature in <hi>Italy,</hi> being compos'd of
four and twenty Canons, who wear the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Habit, and have each a Thouſand Crowns a
Year.</p>
               <p>There is but one publick Place or <hi>Square</hi> in the City
<hi>Valette,</hi> which is conſiderable for its Beauty, adorn'd
with a Fountain in the middle, the Water of
which falling into a Basket of Stone ſo artificially
cut, that it ſeems to be tranſparent, makes one of
the pleaſanteſt Caſcades in the World. The Front
of the Great Maſter's Palace makes one intire ſide
of the Square. There is nothing admirable either
in the Inſide or Outſide of this Structure; 'tis of
a Square Figure, and ſeparated from the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Buildings by four Streets. 'Tis divided into
the <hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>Summer</hi> Apartments: The firſt, which
is the moſt ancient and leaſt beautiful, is painted
throughout with the Repreſentations of Victories ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
over the <hi>Turks,</hi> and particularly the raiſing of
the Siege of <hi>Malta,</hi> accompany'd with Explanatory
Inſcriptions. The <hi>Summer</hi> Apartment was built
by the late Great Maſter, <hi>Vignacourt,</hi> who beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
<hi>Malta</hi> with ſo many Ornaments, and wou'd
have certainly made this a very Magnificent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
if Death had not interrupted his Deſigns.
That which is chiefly remarkable in it is the <hi>Hall
of Arms,</hi> where there are 30000 Muskets, as many
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51983:79"/>
Bandaliers, 10000 Cuiraſſes and Helmets, with a
proportionable Number of Swords, Pikes, Piſtols,
and Scimitars, all rank'd in the fineſt Order ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.
There is an incredible number of caſt Pieces
of Cannon in this City; for tho' I never reckon'd
'em my ſelf, I'm aſſur'd by Perſons of unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
Credit, that there are 1060, and all of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
bigneſs.</p>
               <p>The Churches of <hi>Malta</hi> are incomparably beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
the <hi>Italian</hi> Neatneſs reigns throughout, and
they are every where adorn'd with Painting and
Gilding. The principal Church is dedicated to
S. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the Patron of the Order: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of it is not very pleaſant; but to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for the Defects of the Outſide, I never ſaw
any thing that cou'd with Juſtice be compar'd to
the Richneſs and Beauty of the Inſide. 'Tis as
light as an open Field, and all its Ornaments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
with ſo unclouded a Luſtre, and ſo charm
the Eye of the Spectatour, that I believe never
any Man came out of it without Reluctancy.
'Tis pav'd throughout with large pieces of black
and white Marble: The Walls and Columns are
lin'd to the very Cornices, with curious Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcotting,
which hardly obſtructs the Sight; and
the <hi>Life of S. John</hi> is painted <hi>in Freſco,</hi> on the Vault,
by the Hand of the <hi>Chevalier Mathias.</hi> But the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Work of that Nature in the Church is the
<hi>beheading of the Holy Baptiſt,</hi> repreſented in a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of the ſame Name, by the Hand of <hi>Michael
Angelo;</hi> this Picture was preſented to the Order
by one of the Dukes of <hi>Florence,</hi> and may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
a very conſiderable Complement, ſince the
Princes of that Family are ſeldom wont to part
with ſuch rare and beautiful Pieces.</p>
               <p>The many and magnificent <hi>Epitaphs</hi> of the
<hi>Great Maſters,</hi> and <hi>Grand Croſſes,</hi> with their Scutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are none of the leaſt remarkable Ornaments
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51983:80"/>
of this Church; and among the reſt, the <hi>Great
Maſter Vignacourt</hi>'s <hi>Epitaph</hi> is extremely beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>Every one of the <hi>Seven Languages</hi> has a peculiar
Chapel in this Church, which they ſtrive to adorn
in Emulation of one another. There is not a
Church in the World where Veſſels of Gold and
Silver are more common than in this. Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
curious Works, there are two <hi>Angels</hi> of the
laſt of theſe Metals, as big as the Life: But the
moſt finiſh'd Piece is a golden <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Filagram</hi>-Work,
to receive the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> of which the

                  </gap>em; and therefore I ſhall
only tell you, that the fineſt Piece I ſaw in it is
the <hi>Biſhop's Mitre,</hi> ſet all over with the richeſt
Jewels.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Great Altar</hi> in the Nave is eſteem'd one of
the moſt magnificent Works of that Nature in
<hi>Europe:</hi> It ſtands by it ſelf, after the Modern Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
like that of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> which it exceeds both
in Largeneſs and Richneſs. I ſaw the <hi>Grand Prior</hi>
of the Order ſay Maſs here in Ceremony, and
after the ſame manner as the Pope does at <hi>Rome.</hi>
His Habit is not different from that of a Biſhop;
but he is ſerv'd by eight Deacons and Sub-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
with a great deal of State and Ceremony.
The place where he ſits while the Epiſtles and
Goſpels are read, is on the Right-hand as you go to
the Altar, and directly oppoſite to the <hi>Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
who ſits in an arm'd Chair on the Left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
unde a Canopy, two Pages ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
to ſerve him. The <hi>Grand Croſſes</hi> are ſeated
in the middle of the Nave, on a double Row of
Benches, with Rails or Backs, which encloſe the
place. The <hi>Bailiffs</hi> and <hi>Commanders</hi> are plac'd on
the Seats behind; and the reſt of the Knights ſit
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51983:80"/>
either in the Chapels belonging to their Language,
or in any other part of the Church. To return
to their manner of Officiating; I obſerv'd two
Ceremonies I had never ſeen before, ſince they
are Marks of Reſpect that are only ſhow'd to the
Pope: For there are two Clerks who fan the
Grand Prior's Head and Face all the while he ſays
Maſs, with two large Fans of Oſtridge Feathers;
and after he has done, he ſits down in his Chair,
and the ſame Clerks coming in their Surplices,
undreſs him from Head to Foot, pulling off even
his Slippers. The <hi>Prior</hi> is one of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Officers of the Order, and is rank'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Grand Croſſes,</hi> and immediately after the
<hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Great Maſter,</hi> who only preceed him,
tho' he is not choſen out of the Claſſis of <hi>Noble
Knights.</hi> The preſent Poſſeſſour of this Dignity
is a Native of <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> and is a Perſon
of Merit, tho' of mean Birth.</p>
               <p>Since I have inſenſibly enter'd upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
I ſhall take this occaſion to acquaint you
with the various Degrees and Dignities of theſe
Knights; but you muſt only expect a general
<hi>Idea</hi> of the Order, and I believe you deſire no
more.</p>
               <p>The uſual Title of theſe Knights is of no older
date than their Settlement in this Iſland; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Inſtitution they ought to be call'd
<hi>Knights of S. John of Jeruſalem.</hi> The Deſign of
the Foundation was for <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> and for the
Relief and Aſſiſtance of the poor Pilgrims who
came from all the parts of the World to viſit the
<hi>Holy Places.</hi> At firſt the Order was compos'd of
Perſons of mean Rank or Quality, living under a
Superiour, call'd <hi>Gerard,</hi> a <hi>Frenchman</hi> by birth, who
had built a Hoſpital in the ſame Place where they
pretend <hi>Zacharias</hi> us'd to perform his Devotions,
and dedicated it to S. <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> This <hi>Gerard,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:51983:81"/>
who may be reckon'd the Founder of the Order,
was a Man of a very Holy Life, and ſpent his
time in doing all the Offices of Hoſpitality, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Profeſſion. 'Tis ſaid, that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
Bread every Night to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army,
when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was beſieg'd by <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bouillon;</hi>
and that being ſuſpected, he was narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
and at laſt ſurpriz'd in the very act. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
he was ſeiz'd, and carry'd before the
Governour, with a Burthen of Loaves, which
were miraculouſly chang'd into Stones when his
Accuſers began to take 'em out of the Bag; ſo
that he was fully acquitted.</p>
               <p>Sometime after, <hi>Godfrey</hi> having taken the Town,
was not unmindful of his Benefactour; he careſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who confirm'd him and his Religious Company

1113, ordaining that after <hi>Gerard's</hi> Death, the
Rectors ſhou'd be elected by the Members of the
Society. By Virtue of this Bull, they made choice
of one <hi>Roger</hi> for their ſecond <hi>Rector,</hi> whom they
afterwards honour'd with the Title of <hi>Maſter:</hi>
'I was he who contriv'd and eſtabliſh d the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes

<hi>Eight Beatitudes.</hi> This Habit is clos d at the Neck,
and has two Sleeves ending in a Point, which are

Knights were not only ſeparated from the <hi>Nobles,</hi>
but almoſt excluded out of the Order, ſince they
were only ſuffer'd to remain in it in the Quality
of <hi>Chaplains</hi> or <hi>Servants.</hi> This is as properly a
<hi>Religious</hi> Order as that of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine
Friars;</hi> and when the <hi>Great Maſter</hi> writes
to any of the <hi>Knights,</hi> he directs his Letters thus;
<hi>For our Dear and Well-beloved, the Religious Brother</hi>
N... <hi>Knight of the Order of S. John.</hi> And they
are qualify d with the ſame Title in all Publick
Writings at <hi>Malta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the Day of their Profeſſion, they muſt bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
a Sword thrice, as it were to defie the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Name of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Afterwards they take
the Vows of <hi>Poverty, Chaſtity,</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> In
performance of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> they live in the Inns of
their reſpective Languages, enjoying all things in
Common, and the Order inherits their Eſtates:
The <hi>Second</hi> hinders 'em from Marrying; and the
<hi>Third</hi> obliges 'em to come to <hi>Malta</hi> as often as
their Appearance is requir'd by the <hi>Great Maſter,</hi>
and to obey all his Orders by Virtue of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Obedience. Thus they content themſelves with
a ſeeming Performance of theſe Vows, but their
Practice is not in the leaſt anſwerable to their
Profeſſion: For, in the firſt place, their <hi>Poverty</hi>
wou'd ſatisfie my largeſt Deſires, ſince moſt of 'em
receive conſiderable Penſions from their Relations,
beſides Eighty Crowns a Year from their reſpective
Inns, which may be reckon'd a very comfortable
Maintenance. Nor are they more religious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers
of their Second Vow; they are juſt as
<hi>Chaſt</hi> as my ſelf, and I know not what they can
pretend to enjoy in Common but <hi>Women,</hi> whom
they have ſo well accuſtom'd to that way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that a Faithful Wife is a very ſcarce Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51983:82"/>
in <hi>Malta.</hi> And as for the laſt Vow, if
<hi>Obedience</hi> conſiſt in Grimaces, they are certainly the
moſt Obedient Gentlemen in the World; but if,
for Example, the <hi>Great Maſter</hi> ſhou'd take a Fancy
to recall the <hi>Chevalier de Noailles,</hi> I queſtion very
much whether he wou'd obey the Summons. To
conclude, I cannot give you a juſter Character
of 'em, than in their own Words; They are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Poor</hi> when a Curteſan demands her Fees; <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi>
at Table, where they are always invited to
Eat and Drink heartily; and <hi>Chaſt</hi> at Church,
which is their greateſt Penance.</p>
               <p>The Order is compos'd of <hi>four</hi> different <hi>Claſſes;</hi>
or rather there is only one, which tolerates the
reſt out of Charity. The firſt is that of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Knights,</hi> who before their Admiſſion muſt
prove their Nobility in the preſence of certain
Commiſſioners, who are ſent to examine their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree
upon the Place. They wear a Croſs of
Gold enamell'd, hanging at one of their Button-Holes,
as you have doubtleſs obſerv'd in <hi>France.</hi>
The Second is the Claſs of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who for the
moſt part are not noble, yet wear a Croſs, as the
firſt. The Third is that of the <hi>Serving Knights,</hi>
who are not Noble, and only wear a Croſs of
white Sattin ſow'd upon their <hi>Iuſtaucor,</hi> and of a
different Figure from that of the <hi>Nobles.</hi> The
Fourth and laſt is compos'd of the <hi>Great Maſter's
Menial Servants,</hi> or of ſome <hi>indigent Perſons,</hi> to
whom he grants that Favour, which brings 'em
no other Advantage than the uſual Salary of
fourſcore Crowns; and their Croſs is like that
of the <hi>Serving Knights.</hi> Of all the Four <hi>Claſſes,</hi>
the firſt only can aſpire to the Dignities of the
Order, that is, to the Title and Office of <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Grand Croſſes,</hi> and <hi>Great Maſter.</hi> The two firſt
are given in Order, according to their Seniority;
for the oldeſt <hi>Knights</hi> are in Courſe promoted to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51983:82"/>
be <hi>Commanders,</hi> and the oldeſt <hi>Commanders</hi> to be
<hi>Grand Croſſes.</hi> But the Office of <hi>Great Maſter</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obtain d by Election, without the leaſt regard
to <hi>Seniority;</hi> ſo that frequently a ſimple <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
is preferr'd before all the <hi>Grand Croſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Croſſes</hi> are ſo call'd from a large
Croſs of white Sattin, that covers their whole
Breaſt, from their firſt Button-Hole to the Belly.
'Tis ſew'd upon a kind of Sleeveleſs Veſt, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the ſide, which in Winter is made of black
Cloth, and in Summer of Silk. All the reſt of
the Knights wear a red Veſt of the ſame Faſhion
when they go to War, but the Croſs is white, and
of the ſame Figure with that which they wear at
their Button-Holes; but the Croſs of the <hi>Serving
Knights</hi> is of a Circular Figure.</p>
               <p>All the Employments and Offices of Honour
and Profit are at the Diſpoſal of the <hi>Great Maſter,</hi>
who is oblig'd to chuſe one of the <hi>Nobles:</hi> But
there are few even of that <hi>Claſſis</hi> who dare aſpire
to the Dignity of <hi>Captain of the Galleys,</hi> by reaſon
of the vaſt Charge that attends it, ſince the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
only allows him a Set of Plate, which he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
when he quits that Employment. But to
make amends for that Inconveniency, the Captains
of the Galleys are ſoon after promoted to a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandery;</hi>
for tho' I told you that theſe Places are
uſually given to the Senior Knights, yet there are
a conſiderable Number of 'em at the <hi>Great Maſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi>
diſpoſal, who beſtows 'em on his Favourites. Theſe
are call'd <hi>Commanderies of Grace,</hi> or <hi>Favour,</hi> which
exclude not the Poſſeſſors of 'em from enjoying
the Commanderies that fall to 'em by right of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niority:
And beſides, there are certain particular
Offices belonging to each <hi>Language,</hi> ſuch as that
of <hi>Treaſurer, Maſter of the Artillery,</hi> &amp;c. The Three
Sovereign Juriſdictions of <hi>Malta</hi> belong to the
College of the <hi>Grand Croſſes.</hi> The Firſt is the <hi>Great
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51983:83"/>
Council,</hi> compos'd of all the Members of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege:
The Second is the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Treaſury;</hi>
and the Third of the <hi>Marine,</hi> or <hi>Admiralty;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
each of three Members. Beſides, the <hi>Great
Maſter</hi> chuſes every Year a <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Verga,</hi>
who muſt be a Native of <hi>Malta,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no Knight: His Office is to adminiſter Juſtice
to the Inhabitants of the City and Country. This
right of <hi>Seniority</hi> which gives a Title to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of <hi>Commanders</hi> and <hi>Grand Croſſes,</hi> is a great
Mortification to thoſe who are not made Knights
in their Youth: And therefore they who deſign
to obtain that Dignity for their Children, procure
'em to be receiv'd into the Order as ſoon as
they are born, that they may not wait too long
for Preferrment. In the mean time, thoſe who
have no Eſtates live in their reſpective Inns, of
which every <hi>Language</hi> has one. The Seven <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi>
are thoſe of <hi>Provence, Auvergne, France, Italy,
Arragon, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Over every <hi>Language</hi>
there is a <hi>Grand Croſs,</hi> to whom the Order allows
eighty Crowns for each Man.</p>
               <p>The Members of the Second <hi>Claſs</hi> ſerve at the
Altar, and are only capable of Eccleſiaſtical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment:
Thus they may obtain the Offices of
<hi>Vicars, Canons,</hi> and <hi>Grand Prior,</hi> which is the
higheſt Dignity within the reach of their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Serving Knights</hi> are incapable of being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
to the Dignity of a <hi>Grand Croſs,</hi> or of
enjoying a <hi>Commandery</hi> by right of Seniority; but
they may poſſeſs <hi>Commanderies of Grace,</hi> which the
<hi>Great Maſter</hi> ſometimes beſtows on 'em, either as a
particular Mark of his Kindneſs, or as a Reward of
their Valour. They may rigg out <hi>Privateers</hi> under
the Banner of the Order; but none of this <hi>Claſſis</hi>
can be made <hi>Captain of the Galleys,</hi> ſince the <hi>Noble
Knights</hi> wou'd not ſubmit to his Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:51983:83"/>
As for the <hi>Great Maſter's Knights,</hi> who compoſe
the Fourth <hi>Claſs,</hi> they receive no other Honour or
Advantage by their Admiſſion into the Order,
but a Salary of Eighty Crowns a Year, and the
Title of <hi>Knights of S. John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe Four <hi>Claſſes</hi> I might add a Fifth, I
mean the <hi>Knights of the Holy Sepulchre,</hi> who wear a
Croſs of Gold <hi>Potency;</hi> but ſince they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
by the <hi>Knights of Malta,</hi> and have no
other Patents than what they receive from the
<hi>Fathers Obſervants,</hi> who are at preſent Guardians of
the Sepulchre, I will not trouble you with a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Account of 'em.</p>
               <p>Having given you a general <hi>Idea</hi> of the Four
<hi>Claſſes,</hi> and of all the inferiour Offices, I ſhall in
the next place proceed to conſider the Supreme
Dignity of the Order. The <hi>Great, Maſter</hi> is very
careful to preſerve the Reſpect due to his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
and ſeldom Converſes familiarly with the
<hi>Knights,</hi> nor even with the <hi>Grand Croſſes.</hi> When
he goes to Church, all the Knights whom he
meets in the <hi>Square,</hi> and by the Way, join in his
Train; and when he returns they make a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
File, thro' which he paſſes. All the Officers of
his Houſhold are <hi>Noble Knights,</hi> even the very Pages,
of whom he entertains twenty four. His princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Officers are the <hi>Maſter of the Horſe,</hi> the <hi>Major
Domo,</hi> and the <hi>High Chamberlain.</hi> The preſent <hi>Great
Maſter</hi> is deſcended from the Illuſtrious Houſe of
<hi>Caraffa:</hi> He is a large and thick Man, of a good
Mien, but very old: He keeps a Table for a hundred
Knights, whom he chuſes to be partakers of his
Bounty, and who by that means may ſave the
Penſion they receive from the Order.</p>
               <p>The Habits of the Knights are very different
at <hi>Malta:</hi> The <hi>French, Italians,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Modes of their reſpective Nations.
The Garb of the laſt is ſo odd, that I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51983:84"/>
giving you ſome Account of it: They wear
a Doublet ſlit before and behind, and the Sleeves
are alſo ſlit, and cloſe at the Wriſts; an old-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion'd
Collar, narrow Breeches faſten'd with But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons;
and, in a Word, I cou'd not chuſe a more
Comical Habit if I were going to act the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
in a Mask. The <hi>Italians</hi> are dreſs'd exactly
like ſo many <hi>Scaramouchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Order takes care to preſerve ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Marks of Hoſpitality, which, as I told you,
was the Deſign of their Inſtitution: They keep a
Magnificent Hoſpital, endow'd with a Revenue of
50000 Livres. The Commandery of it belongs to
the <hi>French Language,</hi> and is one of the principal
Offices of the Order: The Magnificence of the
Structure does not appear on the Outſide, but the
Apartments are very fine. There are five Halls,
capable of containing four hundred ſick Perſons,
who are ſerv'd by the Knights when they Eat or
Drink, the Servants of the Hoſpital taking care of
the reſt. The Veſſels are generally of Silver; the
Beds are good, and the Linen is chang'd pretty
often. And beſides, the diſeas'd are ſo plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furniſh'd with all things that are proper for
their Entertainment and Cure, that the Knights
themſelves ſcruple not to lodge here when they are
ſick. 'Tis true, they are not laid in the ſame
Rooms with ſo many dead and dying Perſons,
whoſe Company alone wou'd infect the ſoundeſt
Man in the World with their Diſtempers: For
they lie in ſeparate Halls, and are ſerv'd apart.
<hi>Catholicks</hi> of all Nations, without exception, are
receiv'd into the Hoſpital; but theſe Acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
are not very Chargeable to the Order,
ſince their Gueſts are ſeldom very Numerous.</p>
               <p>Theſe few Obſervations may ſuffice to give you
an <hi>Idea</hi> of the Order of <hi>Malta.</hi> My next ſhall
contain an Account of the Iſland in general, and

of the Manners and Cuſtoms of its Inhabitants:

Mouth. Tho' it be expos'd a whole Day to the
Sun-Beams, it remains as freſh as if it had been
kept in Snow. There are two ſorts of it, one
red, and the other white: The firſt is the beſt; but
the Buyer muſt take 'em at a venture, as well as
Melons. 'Tis the uſual Cuſtom when five or
ſix Citizens meet on the publick Place, to open

                  <hi>Malta</hi> is hotter than <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other place

ſo much the more inſupportable, becauſe there are
no cool Breezes to temper it; and the Brow of

Peaſants are as black as <hi>Egyptians;</hi> for they take
no care to preſerve themſelves from the Sun;
and the moſt ſcorching Heat is not able to drive
'em into their Houſes, or even make 'em leave
off working. This is an evident Demonſtration
of the Power of Nature in performing things
that ſeem to be impoſſible: For there are few
things which a Man may not ſuffer if he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd

are in this caſe, who inure the Bodies of
their Children to Heat, by making 'em go ſtark
naked, without Shirt, Drawers, or Cap, as ſoon
as they are taken from their Mother s Breaſt, to
the Age of Ten Years; ſo that their Skin grows
as hard as Leather. You will eaſily perceive that
I ſpeak of the Peaſants, and Meaner ſort of the
Inhabitants; for all the reſt cloath their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

There is alſo a ſmall ſilken Cord faſten'd to it,

where a Man may lie and enjoy the Pleaſure of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as long as he pleaſes: And ſometimes one
of 'em is plac'd on the Table, both for Coolneſs,

that reigns here ſerves only to encreaſe
the Pleaſure of being fann'd, and of drinking
cold Liquors, with which this Iſland is always

               <p>The firſt had a young, handſom, and loving
Wife, yet (according to the Cuſtom of all his
Countrymen, both Batchelors and marry'd Men,)
he kept a Whore, who poſſeſs'd his Heart and
Soul, and was ſo abſolutely the Miſtreſs of his
Affection, that without regarding his Duty to his
Wife, he lay every Night at her Houſe. This
malicious Woman made uſe of the Power ſhe had
over him to irritate him againſt his injur'd Wife,
telling him, that he had reaſon to ſuſpect her Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
ſince he gave her ſo many inviting Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of repaying him in his own Coin; and
his guilty Conſcience prompting him to conclude
that the might be as vicious as himſelf, he reſolv'd to
bring her along with him every Night, and made her
lie in the ſame Bed with him and his Concubine,
ſince there was not another in the Lodging.
Judge, Sir, with what Grief and Horrour this poor

that he reſolv'd once in his Life to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with her Deſires: But ſhe had little reaſon
to be ſatisfy'd with the Succeſs of her Propoſal,
for ſhe liv'd in a perpetual Hell with her pityleſs
Tormentour, and his inſolent Strumpet. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of making a tedious Relation of all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
they put upon her, I ſhall only acquaint
you with the Tragical Concluſion of the Story.
He had a Son, about nine Years old, who having
ſeen his Mother at Church ſpeaking to one of her
Brothers, who was newly come from <hi>Italy,</hi> and
whom the Boy did not know, went immediately
to tell his Father, that his Mother was diſcourſing
with a Stranger: And that inhumane Villain,
without enquiring farther into the Matter, or ſo
much as accuſing her of her Crime, ſtabb'd her
with his Poniard as ſoon as ſhe came home.</p>
               <p>The other, who retir'd to the Church of S. <hi>Lewis,</hi>
was as unmerciful to his <hi>Whore</hi> as the former was
to his <hi>Wife.</hi> He knew that ſhe intended to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and had often with horrible Threatnings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
her to proſecute that Deſign. But ſhe was
ſo weary of her infamous way of Living, that
ſhe reſolv'd, notwithſtanding his repeated Menaces,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51983:87"/>
to provide herſelf a Husband, and was even actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
engag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d with a certain Tradeſman. Her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
hearing of this new Intrigue, and having ſeen
her two or three times talking with the young
Man's Siſter, ran to her Houſe in a Tranſport of
Fury, and immediately told her, that <hi>he was come
to kill her.</hi> She being ignorant of the cauſe of his
Rage, and imagining that he only intended to
laugh at her Fear, threw her Arms about his Neck,
and embracing him, <hi>And why, my Heart,</hi> ſaid ſhe,
<hi>wou'dſt thou kill me? Becauſe thou art an impudent
Where,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>and wou'dſt Marry in ſpite of me;

he ſtabb'd her in the Breaſt with his Poniard, and
repeated the Blow four times, till he laid her dead
upon the Spot. The Barbarity of theſe Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
is ſo prodigiouſly inhumane, that theſe two

               <p>The Number of the <hi>Curteſans</hi> is extremely great;
their Trade is not at all reputed ſcandalous; and
when they have earn'd a little Money, they may
Marry, and are eſteem'd as honeſt Women as if
they had kept their Maidenhead for their Husbands.
No Perſon whatſoever dares offer 'em the leaſt
indignity; for they are look'd upon as Publick
Perſons that ought to be Sacred; and there are
even ſome Ladies of Honour who diſdain not

Cuſtom in this Place, for the conveniency of
Strangers, who having no Acquaintance, and for
the moſt part ſtaying but two or three Days in
the Iſland, might be ſometimes oblig'd to leave it
without taſting its moſt delicious Fruit: For 'tis
not the Faſhion here to viſit Strangers in their
Ships, as at <hi>Leghorn. Malta</hi> is a Land of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
where Pleaſure is not forc'd upon any
Man: But they who have a mind to divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
may eaſily find a Play-fellow by walking
about the Streets with a <hi>Sequin</hi> in their Hand,
holding it ſo that it may be ſeen; for this is a
never-failing Signal, which will procure 'em twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Invitations in a Moment.</p>
               <p>The Habit of the Women in this Place is as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholic
and Diſmal when they go abroad, as 'tis
Wanton and Laſcivious when they are at home. In
the Streets you ſee nothing but a long black Veil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a Woman, which covers 'em ſo intirely from
Head to Foot, that ſuch a ſight wou'd coſt a <hi>Low
Briton</hi> at leaſt twenty <hi>Signs of the Croſs:</hi> for the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in this City look juſt like ſo many <hi>Ghoſts</hi> wrapt
in Shrowds, ſtalking about the Streets. But if
they are <hi>Ghoſts</hi> in the Street, they are <hi>Angels</hi> at
home; for tho' the Peaſants are tawny, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who live in the City have the faireſt Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the World. I can only give you an Account
of their Summer Dreſs, ſince I never had occaſion
to ſee 'em in the Winter. They wear a fine White
Smock, plaited at the Neck like a Man's Shirt;
but the Opening is ſo wide, that it leaves their
Shoulders and Breaſts intirely expos'd to the View of
the raviſh'd Beholder: the Sleeves are very large,
and tuck'd up to the Neck-band of the Smock to
which they are faſten'd with a Pin, ſo that one may
ſee their whole Arms. This Smock is almoſt their
intire Habit, for they wear nothing above it but a
very little Pair of Boddice about their Waſte under
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51983:88"/>
their Breaſts, which being not above a Span long,
ſerves only to ſet off the Fineneſs of their Shape,
and rather expoſes than conceals thoſe alluring
Charms that ſtrike the Eyes and Hearts of the
Spectator with a ſweet but irreſiſtible Violence. The
Mens Habit is not different from ours, at leaſt they
endeavour as much as they can, to imitate it.</p>
               <p>Almoſt all the <hi>Malteſe</hi> are ſerv'd by <hi>Slaves,</hi> who
are ſuffer'd to walk freely about the Streets all day,
as well as thoſe who belong to the Order; but they
are all oblig'd to retire in the Evening to the publick
Baths, as at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> and if any of 'em ſhou'd fail
to come at the time appointed, he wou'd be put
to death as a Fugitive. The <hi>Galley-Slaves</hi> are the
moſt miſerable Wretches in the World; yet there
are ſome Perſons here who have ſo little regard to
their own Happineſs, as to ſell themſelves for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Crowns to the Order: they continue Slaves
during their whole Life without any Pay, rowing
naked and chain'd as the reſt, without any other
Mark of Diſtinction than the Title of <hi>Bonne Vogue,</hi>
whereas the <hi>Turks</hi> are call'd <hi>Slaves.</hi> I know there
are alſo ſome of theſe voluntary Slaves at <hi>Venice,</hi>
where they are call'd <hi>Gallioti,</hi> and even the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
finds leſs Difficulty in levying 'em than in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Soldiers: but they are only engag'd to ſerve
three Years on the Galleys, whereas the <hi>Bonne Vogue</hi>
at <hi>Malta</hi> are perpetual Slaves, without the leaſt hope
of recovering their Liberty.</p>
               <p>There are only ſeven <hi>Galleys</hi> belonging to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which are ſent every Year under the Command
of a General to aſſiſt the <hi>Venetians.</hi> The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is conſtantly employ'd about raiſing new

               <p>There are Three <hi>Languages</hi> ſpoken in the City;

               <p>The <hi>Holy Office of the Inquiſition,</hi> that dreadful Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
famous for its Injuſtice and Cruelty, reigns
more Tyrannically here than at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. I have
heard a hundred remarkable Stories of its Barbarity;
but I'm too much your Friend to diſturb the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
of your Mind with ſuch diſmal Relations.
And therefore inſtead of entring on ſo Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
a Subject, I ſhall only obſerve that <hi>Confeſſors,</hi>
who in any other Country would be burnt if they
ſhould divulge the Secrets with which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted,
are oblig'd here to reveal 'em, as often as
the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is concern'd in the Diſcovery. 'Tis
true, they do not own this Maxim, for fear of
ſpoiling their Trade; but the Truth of it is too
well known to be call'd in queſtion: In the mean
time, to prevent Suſpicion, they are ſometimes ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for a Year or two, after which the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi>
ſends for the Party accus'd, and asks him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he knows the reaſon why he is brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. Then muſt the poor Wretch call to
mind all that ever he ſaid; and if he has either
forgot his Fault, or refuſes to own it, confiding
in the Secrecy and Fidelity of his Confeſſour,
whom he knows to be his only Confident,
he's a dead Man, and muſt not entertain the leaſt
hope of Mercy: For they ſtrangle him in Priſon,
and ſome time after tell his Relations that they
may forbear ſending him Proviſions. Happy are
they who are not ſubject to this Yoke!</p>
               <p>I ſaw a Church, t'other day, in which there
is a little <hi>Grotto,</hi> where 'tis ſaid S. <hi>Paul</hi> liv'd three
Months: But 'tis ſo ſmall, and contriv'd in ſuch
a manner, that I'm much enclin'd to ſuſpect the
Truth of this Tradition. However, every one
that comes, carries away a piece of it, as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative

againſt the biting of Serpents: And they
pretend that by a perpetual Miracle, the Rock is
never diminiſh'd. I will not diſpute the Truth of
the Matter of Fact, tho' I can aſſure you that
there are viſible Gaps or Notches in the Rock,
and that they ſtill continue to break off Pieces of
it: But ſuppoſing it to be as big as ever, I ſee
no reaſon why we ſhou'd have recourſe to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
on this Occaſion, ſince 'tis generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
that there are ſome Rocks which grow

And our Mariners, who are no very able Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,

But this is not the only <hi>Miracle</hi> in <hi>Malta:</hi> They

and wou'd have us believe that this Privilege was
the Effect of a Viper's biting the ſame Apoſtle,
as you may read in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi> For
my part, I muſt confeſs, I'm as little ſatisfy'd
with this Sotry as with the other; for ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
aſſure me that there are Serpents in <hi>Malta:</hi> But
ſuppoſing there were none, I had occaſion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
another Iſland in my laſt, which may boaſt
of the ſame Advantage; and why ſhou'd the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
be greater here than at <hi>Guernſey,</hi> where tis
certain there is neither <hi>Toad, Scorpion,</hi> nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WE ſail'd from <hi>Malta, June...,</hi> and leaving
<hi>Sicily</hi> on our Left-hand, enter'd the <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago.</hi>
After a Voyage of fifteen Days, without
any remarkable Diſturbance, we arriv'd at the
Height of <hi>Troy,</hi> and our Veſſel ſtanding in to
<hi>Tenedos,</hi> both by reaſon of the contrary Wind,
and to take in ſome freſh Proviſions, I took this
Occaſion to viſit the Ruines of that famous City,
which are at preſent ſo obſcure and inconſiderable,
that unleſs a Man's Mind were full of the <hi>Idea</hi> of
it, he might view it all over without perceiving
the leaſt reaſon to conclude that ever any Town
ſtood in that place. Yet by a Curious Search, an
inquiſitive Traveller may find enough to convince
him, that 'twas formerly of a prodigious Extent:
And I obſerv'd ſome Marks of it in four or five
different Places, two of which were about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Miles diſtant. The next Day we ſet ſail with
a favourable Wind, and enter'd the Canal of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
otherwiſe call'd the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> at the Mouth
of which we found two Caſtles, one in <hi>Europe,</hi>
and the other in <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſeparated by the Canal or
Strait, which is about a Mile and a half broad
in this Place, and retains the ſame breadth almoſt
throughout. The <hi>European</hi> Caſtle is a Maſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of three great Towers, ſurrounded with a
weak and inconſiderable Wall, after the manner of
a <hi>Falſe-bray,</hi> at the Foot of which there are twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Pieces of Cannon level with the Water. 'Tis
ſaid that they carry a fifty Pound Ball of Stone;
and indeed their Mouths are ſo wide, that the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51983:90"/>
very ſight of 'em is terrible: Nevertheleſs, I'm apt
to believe that they are not fit for Service, and
even that they cou'd not bear above one diſcharge,
both by reaſon of their thinneſs, and becauſe
they are not mounted on Carriages. There is
a Mountain behind the Caſtle that overlooks and
commands it.</p>
               <p>The other Caſtle, which is ſeated upon the
<hi>Aſian</hi> Shore, is of a Square Figure, according to the
Ancient manner of Building, defended only with
ſome ſmall Towers join'd to the Wall; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
there is a Battery of Cannons behind a Wall,
as in the other. The Captain was oblig'd to ſtop
at this place, and one of the Officers of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-Houſe
came on board our Ship, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
us to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Having paſs'd the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
we enter'd into the Sea formerly call'd the
<hi>Propontis,</hi> and at preſent <hi>Marmora,</hi> from the Name
of an Iſland which contains a great quantity of
very fine Marble. Twenty Miles from thence we
diſcover'd <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and had the pleaſure of
viewing the fineſt Landskip that ever I beheld;
for it ſtrikes all thoſe who look upon it with
Wonder and Aſtoniſhment. Imagine you ſee a
great City ſtretch'd along the Shore for above ſix
Miles, and ſo ſituated ſloping towards the Sea,
that you perceive at once an infinite Number of
Moſquees, adorn'd with little Domes cover'd with
Lead, and high Turrets, which altogether make
one of the moſt lovely Proſpects in the World:
Whilſt the Eye is buſy'd in contemplating this
charming Variety of Objects, 'tis agreeably divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ſight of the <hi>Caſtle of the Seven Towers,</hi>
and of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which are particularly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
not only for their largeneſs, but for a vaſt
Number of gilt Globes and Spires, reſembling lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Steeples. The nearer I approach'd, I ſtill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
new Ornaments; and after I had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51983:91"/>
at leiſure ſo many Wonders, I was at laſt
agreeably ſurpriz'd with the Beauty of the Port:
'Tis three Miles long, and almoſt one broad, clean
and deep throughout, even to the Shoar, the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
Ships coming up cloſe to the Land, ſo that
one may go on board without making uſe of a
Boat. 'Tis ſtrange that the Harbour is never fill'd
up, eſpecially near the Shore, ſince all the Filth
of the City is caſt into it, without the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a Tide to carry it away. At the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Port there is a high ſquare Tower,
commonly call'd <hi>The Tower of Leander,</hi> from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that Name, who, according to the Story,
us'd to ſwim thither every Night to ſee his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
who was impriſon'd in the Tower. There
is a Fountain on the Rock, with ſome Pieces of
Cannon, which might defend the Entry in caſe of
Neceſſity.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as we arriv'd, I went with the Captain
to ſalute the Baron <hi>de Chaſteau-neuf,</hi> Ambaſſador
of <hi>France,</hi> who receiv'd me very civilly. He has
a good Mien, and is Maſter of a great deal of
Wit: He was formerly Councellor in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Paris,</hi> and was ſent to the Port about the
end of the laſt Year, in the room of Monſieur
<hi>de Girardin,</hi> who died here. He is a <hi>Savoyard</hi> by
birth, but a very zealous Promoter of the Intereſts
of <hi>Franee:</hi> He ſpares nothing to gain the <hi>Turks;</hi>
he endeavours to win 'em with Preſents, Careſſes,
and Entertainments; his Table is always full of
'em; but his principal Care is to oblige thoſe
whom he knows to be the Favourites of the great
Officers. I know one among the reſt, call'd <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman
Aga,</hi> who is extremely debauch'd, and ſince
he always finds excellent Win<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> at the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
Table, he goes thither very often, and is ſtill
receiv'd with all imaginable Demonſtrations of
Love and Kindneſs. After I had the Honour to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51983:91"/>
Sup with the Ambaſſadour, I went to lodge at
a Tavern, or Victualling-Houſe. If I had reſolv'd
to have ſtay'd long in the Country, I wou'd have
boarded in ſome Family, for Strangers are very
ill accomodated in theſe Publick-Houſes. Every
Nation is permitted to have three; ſo that there
wou'd be nine in all, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
thought fit to make uſe of their Privilege: 'Tis
ſtill more difficult to obtain a Permiſſion to keep
an Oven: One muſt procure a ſpecial <hi>Mandamus</hi>
from the <hi>Sultan</hi> for that effect, and pay a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Avanies</hi> to the <hi>Baſſa</hi> and <hi>Cadi;</hi> and there is
only one allow'd for the uſe of each Nation in
every Town; for the <hi>Turks</hi> are ſo extremely afraid
of Fire, that they ſuffer very few Ovens to be
kept in their Cities. They are alſo very careful to
prevent the Exportation of Corn; for 'tis a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Crime to carry it out of the Country, or
even to ſell it to private Families: And for the
more effectual Execution of theſe Orders, there
are certain Officers appointed to over-ſee the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
who ſuffer no Man to buy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<note n="*" place="margin">Somewhat more than 20 Quarters.</note>
                  <hi>Four Muids</hi> at a time, nor even
the leaſt quantity, without a Licence
from the <hi>Nais.</hi> Offences of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are puniſh'd with ſo much Rigour, that if a
Peaſant were convicted of ſelling his Corn to a
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> 'twou'd coſt him more than 500 Baſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's.
But before I proceed to deſcribe the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Cuſtoms of the Inhabitants, I ſhall give
you a ſhort Account of the City of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis ſeated in <hi>Europe,</hi> on a Point or Tongue of
Land that juts out into the Sea of <hi>Marmora,</hi> in
a Triangular Figure, ſix Miles long, and fourteen
in compaſs, two of its ſides being waſh'd by the
Sea. 'Twas founded by <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi>
who gave it the Name of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51983:92"/>
till <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> reſolving to make
it the Metropolis of the World, order'd it to be
rebuilt with all imaginable Magnificence; after
which it took the Name of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine's
Town;</hi> but the <hi>Turks</hi> call it <hi>Stambol.</hi> The
<hi>French,</hi> in Conjunction with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> took it
in 1203. and fifty Years after <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>twas re-taken by
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who remain'd Maſters of it till the
Year 1453, when it fell into the Hands of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
II. 'Tis at preſent the Capital City of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, as it appears by the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's</hi>
Titles, who ſtiles himſelf, <hi>The Ruler of Kings,
Diſtributer of Crowns, Lord of the</hi> White <hi>and</hi> Black
<hi>Seas, of</hi> Bagdat, Grand Cairo, Aleppo, <hi>&amp;c. and
particularly of the fain City of</hi> Stambol the well-defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>which is the Deſire of the Kings and Princes of
the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Air</hi> is extremely pure, and ſo wholſome,
that the Inhabitants are never ſubject to any
reigning Diſeaſe but the <hi>Plague,</hi> which viſits 'em
every Year, and makes a dreadful Havock among
'em. I'm apt to think that they wou'd live till
they dropt into their Graves through meer
Age and Weakneſs, if their Days were not
ſhorten'd by this Infectious Malady; and they are
ſo little acquainted with any other mortal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
that when a <hi>Frenchman</hi> aſſures 'em that
the <hi>Plague</hi> is hardly known in his Country, they
uſually cry, <hi>What d'ye die of then?</hi> The <hi>Climate</hi> is
ſo Temperate, that the Winters are never exceſſively
Cold, and the Summer-Heats are uſually allay'd
with a pleaſant Brieze, beſides the drinking of
cool Liquors, which, in my Opinion, is one of
the greateſt Pleaſures of this Life.</p>
               <p>In the Account I have given you of the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and Bigneſs of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I ſpeak only of
the City which properly bears that Name; for
there are four other Towns join'd together, call'd
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51983:92"/>
                  <hi>Caſſum Pacha, Galata, Pera,</hi> and <hi>Tophana,</hi> which may
be conſider'd as a part, or rather as the Suburbs
of the City, ſince they are only ſeparated from it
by the breadth of the Port, which is ſo ſmall a
diſtance, that a Man who cries aloud, tho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
extending his Voice to the utmoſt, may be
eaſily heard on the other ſide. In theſe Towns,
and particularly in <hi>Pera,</hi> the Ambaſſadors and all
the <hi>Franks</hi> live; for they are not permitted to
reſide at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And 'tis to be obſerv'd,
that the Name of <hi>Franks</hi> is given indifferenly to
Men of all Nations who wear Hats. Theſe four
Cities are about eight Miles in compaſs; ſo that
if they, together with the Village of <hi>Scutaret,</hi> and
ſome other Suburbs, be added to the City of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
and all join'd together to make one vaſt
Town, <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in this ſenſe, wou'd be found
to be double of <hi>Paris.</hi> But there is a great variety of
Opinions in this Caſe: Some comprehend all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mention'd
places under the Name of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
others cut off the four Cities; and there
are ſome who include the City within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of its own Walls; ſo that almoſt every Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
gives a different Account of its Extent from
all others.</p>
               <p>The Walls with which 'tis at preſent ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
are the ſame that were built by <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
the Great,</hi> except in ſome places where they
have been repair'd. They are double on the ſide
next the Land, with Battlements, after the <hi>Oriental</hi>
faſhion, and Towers from place to place; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
they are defended with a lin'd but ſhallow
Ditch: Theſe, with the <hi>Caſtle of the Seven Towers,</hi>
are all the Strength of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> for the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of its Inhabitants deſerves not to be reckon'd
among its Advantages, ſince thoſe <hi>Turks</hi> who are
never accuſtom'd to War, are ſo unfit to reſiſt
an Enemy, that they wou'd only ſerve to conſume
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51983:93"/>
the Proviſions, and haſten a Famine: And beſides,
I'm perſuaded that Bombs wou'd do more execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here than in any other City in the World;
for the Houſes are generally of Wood, and the
Streets ſo narrow, that in the greateſt part of
'em two loaded Horſes cannot go a-breaſt. But
this is not the greateſt inconvenience of their
manner of Building; for their Houſes jut out ſo
far near the Top, that in ſeveral places one may
ſtep from one Window to another, and croſs the
Street without going down from his Chamber.
This Contrivance of their Houſes does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from want of Room, for the City is full of
Gardens, and large Courts, that are perfectly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
But tho' I cannot acquaint you with the
reaſon that makes 'em ſo fond of this manner of
Building, I can aſſure you that it expoſes 'em to
all thoſe fatal Inconveniencies that are occaſion'd
by <hi>Fire,</hi> which breaks out very frequently, and
proceeds with irreſiſtable Fury, till it meets with
ſome Garden, or empty Place, where there are
no Houſes to be burnt. Among ſo many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this Nature, I ſhall only take notice of one
that happen'd in the Year 88, which made ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
a Havock in the City, that there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
3000 Houſes laid in Aſhes. But beſides the
dangerous Conſequences of this kind of Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
'tis alſo very offenſive to the Eye; for the
Streets are extremely disfigur'd by this Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Nor are there any external Ornaments on the
Houſes to make amends for this Defect, ſince they
are only daub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d over with a naſty red Paint, laid
upon the rough Wood, which is neither plan'd,
nor cut with any other Inſtrument than an Axe
or Saw; ſo that the Houſes are all very ugly.
Judge, Sir, what reaſon I had to be ſurpriz'd,
when after I had view'd with Amazement the
magnificent Proſpect of the City from the <hi>Sea of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51983:93"/>
Marmora,</hi> I ſaw all my Expectations baulk'd, and
inſtead of ſo many Wonders, found only ſome
<hi>Moſques,</hi> and a few Monuments of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> Not
that I wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d diſcourage any Curious Perſon from
undertaking this Voyage; for tho' the Manners
and Cuſtoms of the Inhabitants ought never to
be propos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d for Imitation, they are ſo odd and
ſingular, that an Inquiſitive Traveller may employ
his Time and Curioſity with a great deal of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in obſerving 'em. The <hi>Turks</hi> are oppoſite to
us in almoſt all reſpects: We content our ſelves
with one Wife, They marry ſeveral Wives; Our
Habit is ſhort, Theirs long; We wear our Hair
long, and our Beards ſhav'd, They ſhave their Hair,
and ſuffer their Beards to grow; We write in a
ſtreight Line from Left to Right, and They in a
crooked from Right to Left. I cou'd eaſily add
ſeveral other Inſtances of the ſame Nature, ſince
the Oppoſition reaches even to the meaneſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſuch as the eaſing of Nature; for they crouch
down to Piſs, like Women, and when they have
done, rub their Privities on a Wall, which they
think purifies 'em.</p>
               <p>Two Days after our Arrival at <hi>Galata,</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and I went to ſee <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with the <hi>French</hi>
Interpreter, who accompany'd us on purpoſe to
ſhow us all the Curioſities. There are always ſo
many Boats paſſing from one ſide to another, that
the Port is uſually cover'd with 'em, and their Fare
is only an <hi>Aſper.</hi> We took Boat at the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi>
and enter'd the City at the Gate of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
or the next Gate to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which we
kept on our Left-hand, and went ſtreight to the
<hi>Beſeſtin,</hi> which is a diſtinct Canton of the City,
enclos'd with Gates and Walls, where all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
keep Shops. This is the fineſt and moſt
regular place in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> not unlike to the
places that are appointed for the keeping of <hi>Fairs</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:51983:94"/>
among us, ſuch as that of S. <hi>Germain</hi> at <hi>Paris:</hi>
The Streets are divided after the ſame manner, and
cover'd above with Planks join'd together upon
Rafters, which form a kind of Roof, ſufficient to
ſecure the place againſt all the Inconveniences of
bad Weather, tho' there are Holes left to let in
the Light. Here all the fineſt and moſt precious
Wares of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> are to be ſeen; for every
Merchant keeps a Shop in this Place, as it were
for a Pattern of all the Goods contain'd in his
Ware-houſe; and the Shops are rank'd and diſpos'd
in ſuch excellent Order, that the Buyer may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch
his Buſineſs in leſs than a quarter of an
Hour; for all the Trades are ſeparated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to their proper places. Thus one part of the
<hi>Beſeſtin</hi> is poſſeſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by the <hi>goldſmiths,</hi> whoſe Work,
indeed, is not ſo fine, nor their Shops ſo well
furniſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d as in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England;</hi> but I only ſpeak
here of their Order and Regularity: Another
place is ſet apart for the <hi>Drapers,</hi> or thoſe who ſell
<hi>Dutch, French,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth: Not far from
thence are the Sellers of Silk Stuffs, and Gold and
Silver Brocado's; the Makers of <hi>Talpo,</hi> or Head-Dreſſes
for Women, which are very magnificent;
the <hi>Babouchi,</hi> or <hi>Shoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>-makers,</hi> the <hi>Taylors, Grocers,</hi>
and all ſort of Shopkeepers, have alſo their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Streets. The Gates are ſhut every Evening
at Ten a Clock, by Perſons who are hir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d for
that purpoſe, and thoſe who have occaſion to paſs
this way later, muſt give two or three Pence to
the Porters, who wait conſtantly at the Gates.
This is the only place in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> where there
are Shops; for the reſt of the City conſiſts only
of little and narrow Streets, which for the moſt part
are ſo deſolate that one may paſs thro' the Town
without meeting ſo many Perſons as Streets, unleſs in
the Publick Places, ſuch as the <hi>Hyppodrome,</hi> whither we
went after we had view'd the <hi>Beſeſtin.</hi> This ſpacious
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51983:94"/>
Place was built by the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> for
Exerciſes on Horſe-back, and is ſtill call'd by the
<hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Place of Horſes.</hi> 'Tis an Oblong Square,
400 Paces long, and about 200 broad. Towards
the End oppoſite to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> there are two
<hi>Obelisks;</hi> the firſt conſiſting of one Stone, is ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Foot high, adorn'd with ſeveral Hieroglyphical
Figures in <hi>Relief,</hi> and plac'd on a ſquare Marble
Pedeſtal. On one of the Faces of the Pedeſtal,
there is a <hi>Latin</hi> Inſcription, ſo ancient and worn,
that all that can be learn'd by it is, that it was
built by <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> The ſecond contains a like
Inſcription in <hi>Greek:</hi> The third is adorn'd with
the Figure of the Emperour ſeated on a Throne,
and accompany'd with his great Officers; and in
the fourth there is a Repreſentation of a Battle,
in Memory of ſome Victory obtain'd over that
Prince's Enemies. The other <hi>Obelisk</hi> is a ſharp
pointed <hi>Pyramid,</hi> built of Free-Stones, without any
Inſcription, and begins to decay extremely. Near
theſe <hi>Obelisks</hi> there is a Brazen Pillar of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
height, commonly call'd the <hi>Serpentine Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn,</hi>
becauſe it conſiſts of three Serpents wreath'd
and twiſted together, with their Tails faſten'd in
the Ground, and ending at the Top in three ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Heads, which ſeem to hiſs, and threaten the
three parts of the World that were known in
that Age. Some pretend that this Column is a
Hieroglyphical Repreſentation of the united Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> extending their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over the whole Univerſe: But the moſt
common Opinion is, that in the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Leo Iſaurus,</hi> who was a great Magician,
there were three Monſtruous <hi>Serpents,</hi> who made
ſo prodigious a Havock in the Country about
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that the People were forc'd to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
their Habitations; and that the Emperor
drew theſe Serpents by Enchantment into a large
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51983:95"/>
Ditch, which he made in the middle of the <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drome,</hi>

Misfortune for the future, this Column was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the ſame Prince, as a <hi>Taliſman</hi> againſt
Serpents, of which there are at preſent very few
in the Country. One of theſe Heads wants the

much of the wonderful Strength of that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,

               <p>The Story of the <hi>Serpentine Column</hi> is not the only
fabulous Tradition concerning the Emperour <hi>Leo.</hi>
The <hi>Greeks,</hi> eſpecially, who are without Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
the moſt ſuperſtitious People in the World,
and moſt addicted to Miracles, take pleaſure in
relating a Thouſand Wonders of the Life of that

the Boughs were fill'd with a hundred <hi>Magical
Birds</hi> of different kinds, who upon the leaſt breath
of Wind, warbl'd out their various Notes, and all
together made a moſt charming Melody. Theſe
are ſome of the Tales with which the <hi>Greeks</hi> are
wont to talk Men aſleep.</p>
               <p>There are two other Columns in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:51983:95"/>
one call'd the <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> and the other the <hi>Burnt
Column;</hi> for the laſt was actually burnt. Adjoining
to theſe we ſaw a large Court, appointed for the
uſe of <hi>Archers:</hi> The Maſter of the Sport preſented
us with a Bow, and we had the Pleaſure to ſhoot
ſome Arrows at the Mark, which was faſten'd on
a Wall, and contain'd ſeveral leſſer Marks, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
decreaſing, ſo that the leaſt was not big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than a <hi>Dutch Skelling;</hi> and yet I ſaw ſeveral
Perſons who hit at every Shoot, tho' they ſtood
100 Paces off.</p>
               <p>In our return to <hi>Galata</hi> we paſs'd by <hi>Sancta So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi>
which is at preſent the principal <hi>Moſque</hi> of
the City. There are ſeveral Doors that lead into
a Portico, which brought us immediately into the
Moſque. 'Tis 120 Paces long, and 80 broad: The
Walls are Square, but the Vault or Roof is Round,
and ſo artificially contriv'd, that ſo large a Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
is ſupported without any Columns; for thoſe
Rows of Columns that form the two lower Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico's,
ſerve only for Ornament, and are ſo plac'd
that they cannot be ſuppos'd to carry any other
weight than that of two Galleries; and even the
greateſt part of theſe Columns are ſo old, that they
are forc'd to bind 'em about with great Iron Hoops,
to prevent their falling. I know not what cou'd
occaſion all thoſe Chinks that are obſerv'd in 'em,
for they are built of a very hard and poliſh'd Stone,
which ſome think is a kind of Marble, tho' others
believe it to be the <hi>Serpentine Stone.</hi> There are
thirty on each ſide, about ſixteen Foot high, with
very fine Cornices: The Vault of the Moſque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
almoſt all its ancient Beauty; 'tis enrich'd
with a very fine <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work, conſiſting of little
gilt Stones ſo exactly join'd together, that they
remain almoſt perfectly entire after ſo many Ages.</p>
               <p>At the four Corners of the Building where the
Vault begins to be round, the <hi>four Beaſts</hi> mention'd
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51983:96"/>
in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> are painted in <hi>Moſaick;</hi> only the
<hi>Turks</hi> have disfigur'd their Faces, as they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
done to an Image of <hi>Our Saviour,</hi> which is over
the principal Door, repreſented after the <hi>Greek</hi>
Faſhion, upon a Throne, with his Hand lifted,
and two of his Fingers ſtretch'd out, to bleſs a
<hi>Saint,</hi> who lies proſtrate before him, with his Face on
the Ground, the <hi>Virgin</hi> appearing on the other ſide.
Over the ſame Door there is alſo a <hi>Baſſo-Relievo,</hi>
repreſenting the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the form of a <hi>Dove,</hi>
which the <hi>Turks</hi> have not in the leaſt disfigur'd.
The Tomb of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> remains alſo intire, which
the <hi>Turks</hi> hold in great Veneration; as well as the
Stone on which the <hi>Virgin</hi> waſh'd <hi>Our Saviour's</hi>
Linnen. This Temple is pav'd with very fine
Marble, and the Floor is cover'd with Mats; not
to keep it from being foil'd, for they always put
off their <hi>Babouche's,</hi> or Shooes, before they enter;
but by reaſon of the coldneſs of the Marble, which
might incommode thoſe who come to perform their
Devotions in this place, eſpecially ſince they kneel
or crouch down, almoſt after the ſame manner as
they ſit upon their <hi>Sopha's.</hi> The Keeper of the
Temple was eaſily brib'd to permit me to ſatisfie
my Curioſity with a diſtinct view of all the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities
I have deſcrib'd: But theſe Officers are
not always in ſo good a Humour; for ſometimes
they are very civil, and ſoon prevail'd with to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a Stranger into the Temple; but at other
times they are ſo Surly and Obſtinate, that one
can hardly procure that Satisfaction at the rate of
ten Piſtoles. 'Tis true, indeed, they are expreſly
forbidden to grant that favour to <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and
the permiſſion which is ſometimes given to <hi>Franks,</hi>
is only an effect of their Indulgence: For if a
<hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Iew</hi> were found in the <hi>Moſque,</hi> he wou'd
either be immediately put to Death, or conſtrain'd
to ſave his Life by renouncing his Religion.</p>

                  <hi>Sophia</hi> is a <hi>Greek</hi> Word, ſignifying <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and
this Temple was ſo call'd by the Emperor <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian,</hi>
who conſecrated it to the <hi>Sovereign Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
I ſhall briefly acquaint you with the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of its Foundation, as I had it from the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
You may depend upon the fidelity of my Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but I dare not undertake to juſtifie the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of my Authors.</p>
               <p>The Emperor <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> being dangerouſly ſick, his
Phyſician, call'd <hi>Samſon,</hi> whoſe Mind was no leſs
enlighten'd by the Inſpirations of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
than by the Knowledge of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and of the
Art which he profeſs'd, told him, that his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
was of ſuch a Nature, that it cou'd not be
cur'd by the Precepts of Phyſick, and that he muſt
depend wholly upon the Aſſiſtance of Heaven,
adviſing him to make ſome Religious Vows, and
encouraging him with ſome Aſſurances that God
wou'd hear his Prayer. The Devout Prince cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
embrac'd his Counſel, and vow'd to build a
Temple which ſhou'd ſurpaſs all the Churches of
the World in Magnificence. God was pleas'd with
the ſincerity of his Devotion; he rewarded his
Faith, and reſcu'd him from the Jaws of Death:
Nor was <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> unmindful of his Duty to his
Gracious Deliverer. In order to the performanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of his Vow, he fram'd the Model of the Church
of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> ſuch as 'tis at preſent, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
a vaſt Number of Workmen on the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Building: But he had the Misfortune to ſee all
his Treaſures exhauſted before the third part of
the Work was compleated; ſo that he cou'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proſecute his Deſign, nor ſo much as pay 50
Days Wages which he ow'd to the Workmen;
for <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperors had not then aſſum'd the
power of impoſing Taxes on their Subjects, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an indiſpenſable Neceſſity. He was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with Sorrow when he ſaw that he cou'd
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51983:97"/>
neither finiſh ſo pious a Work, nor, do Juſtice to
the poor Men whom he had imploy'd, that he
burſt forth into Tears, and retir'd to his Cloſet,
where he was breathing out his Complaints in the
preſence of his God; when a ſudden Light ſhone
thro' the Room, and diſcover'd a Youth of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Beauty, who aſſur'd the ſorrowful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
that God had ſeen his Tears, and heard his
Prayers, and told him that he might quickly be happy
if he wou'd ſend ſome of his Servants and 50 Camels
along with him. <hi>Juſtinian's</hi> Heart was fill'd with
Joy at the hearing of ſuch welcome and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Tidings: He commanded twenty of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
with fifty Camels, to attend the bright Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,
who carry'd 'em out of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to a
Field, where they found a ſtately Palace, tho'
there was never any Building ſeen in that place
either before or ſince. The Beauteous Youth, or
rather Angel, (for ſo it ſeems he was) open'd the
Gates of this Magnificent Structure, and led 'em to
a Hall, where they ſaw vaſt Heaps of Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and all ſorts of Jewels: He orderd 'em to
load their Camels; and then both he and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
diſappear'd, only the Treaſure remain'd, which
the Emperor receiv'd with all the Marks of a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Gratitude, and employ'd it in building and
adorning the Church of <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi> in ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a manner, that the <hi>Temple of Solomon</hi> in its
higheſt Glory, was neither more Beautiful nor Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent.
He built alſo with the ſame Money a
large and ſtately <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> where Perſons of all
Nations were charitably entertain'd. And ſince
there was ſtill a great quantity of Treaſure left,
which the Emperor's Piety wou'd not ſuffer him
to employ in prophane Uſes, he order'd the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
to be ſamp'd to Powder, and the Gold and
Silver to be melted, and mixing 'em all together,
he made the moſt precious Table that ever adorn'd
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51983:97"/>
a Temple, and plac'd it on the High Altar, to
ſerve at the daily Conſecration of the Sacrament,
where it remain'd till the <hi>Venetians</hi> carry'd it away
with thoſe admirable Brazen Gates, which are at
preſent to be ſeen at S. <hi>Mark's.</hi> But God wou'd
not ſuffer ſo Holy a Piece to become a Prey to
thoſe who cou'd not pretend any right to it;
the Galley that carry'd it open'd miraculouſly at
the Mouth of the Canal, in the Sea of <hi>Marmora,</hi>
where it ſunk, and was never afterwards found.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, (if you have Faith enough to believe
it) is the Original of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
a <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> and is now a <hi>Turkiſh Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quee.</hi>
'Tis at preſent the only Ancient Structure
of that Nature in <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> for all the reſt
were built in this and the laſt Age, by the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
or <hi>Sultaneſſes,</hi> whoſe Names they bear. There
are ſeven or eight particularly remarkable, I mean
thoſe of the <hi>Sultans Mahomet, Achmet, Solyman,</hi> and
<hi>Selim,</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Chazadet,</hi> and <hi>Validé,</hi> and ſome
others, built after the ſame Model, and differing
only in the largeneſs of the Structure, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Fountains, and variety of the Painting;
ſo that the Deſcription of one will give a juſt
<hi>Idea</hi> of all the reſt, and therefore I ſhall make
choice of that of <hi>Valide,</hi> which is the neweſt and
moſt beautiful Moſque I have yet ſeen: 'Twas
built by the <hi>Sultaneſs Validé,</hi> Mother of <hi>Sultan Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
IV. and is ſeated in the midſt of a large
ſquare Court, reſembling a vaſt Cloyſter, becauſe
of the arch'd Roofs that inviron it in form of
Portico's; under which there are many Fountains
with Cocks, where thoſe who are polluted may
waſh themſelves before they enter the Moſquee.
It has but one Gate, ſurrounded with a Portico
of a conſiderable height, pav'd with white and
black Marble, and ſupported by ſixty four Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
of red Marble, eight of which are of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrie,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51983:98"/>
plac'd near the Entry, but of no very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Deſign, becauſe the bigneſs of the Pieces is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
entire: The Plafond is adorn'd with Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Figures, after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner, of which
afterwards you may expect a more particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
The Portico is cover'd with little Domes,
with a very large one in the middle, over-topping
the reſt; the whole Structure conſiſting of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's-Work
cover'd with Lead. At the four Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Building there are four Turrets, call'd
<hi>Minarets,</hi> built of Free-Stone, and ſo ſmall that
there is juſt room enough within for a little Winding-Stair-caſe,
reaching to three fourth parts of the
Height, which the <hi>Muezans,</hi> or <hi>Marabouds,</hi> aſcend
every Morning and Evening, to give the People
notice of the appointed times of Prayer, ſhouting
till they are out of Breath, with an extremely
harſh and diſagreeable Tone; for they begin with
a very low Voice, and raiſing it by degrees, end
in a very loud Shriek, ſo that 'twou'd be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to underſtand 'em, if the People were not
already acquainted with what they ſay. As they
cry, they clap their Hands upon their Ears, and
go round the Turret in a little Balcony, that their
Voice may be heard thro' the whole Town, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
theſe Words; <hi>Allah ekber, allah ekber, allah
ekber, eſchadou in la illah, illallah, hi alle ſalla, hi alle
ſalla, allah ekber, allah ekber, allah ekber, la illah, illal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah.
God is Great, God is Great, God is Great; give
teſtimony that there is but One God: Come yield your
ſelves up to his Mercy, and pray him to forgive you
your Sins. God is Great, God is Great, God is Great,
there is no other God but God.</hi> Theſe Turrets are very
high, and for the moſt part end in a Globe or Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent,
which is ſometimes Gilt. This is a brief
Repreſentation of the external Architecture of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and conſequently of the other Moſquees.
Within they are either vaulted, or cover'd with a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51983:98"/>
Plafond: That of <hi>Validé</hi> is vaulted, and adorn'd
with a great Number of Lamps, and Globes of
Glaſs. When they ſay Prayers, they turn their
Face towards a large Frame at the end of the
Moſque, in the ſame place where the High-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
ſtands in <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Churches. There is
no Figure repreſented on this Frame or Table,
only the Name of GOD is written on it in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi>
Characters; and over-againſt it ſtands two
Brazen Candleſticks, with a Taper of Virgin-Wax
in each, bigger than a Man's Thigh. In the Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quees
that are founded by Emperôrs, there is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
a <hi>Turbé,</hi> or little Chappel, in which they are
bury'd. Some <hi>Sultans</hi> have built <hi>Turbe's</hi> apart, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
little Moſquees. Thoſe of <hi>Amurat</hi> and
<hi>Solyman</hi> I. are thè fineſt: The Body of the laſt
lies in a Coffin, like thoſe that are us'd in <hi>France,</hi>
cover'd with a large piece of Tapiſtry, with a
Turbant on his Head, in which there are two fine
<hi>Aigrets.</hi> In the <hi>Turbé</hi> of <hi>Amurat</hi> there are Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of his Children plac'd round him, with two
of his Wives; and at the Head of the Coffin
there is a little Cupboard or Preſs, where his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer-Books
are kept, which, are adorn'd with
Gold and Precious-Stones, appearing thro' a Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Grate, and all <hi>Muſſulmen</hi> are permitted to read
there, for the Repoſe of the Souls of the deceas'd.
The Keepers of the <hi>Turbé</hi> are alſo oblig'd to pray
for 'em at certain Hours of the Day. This Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre
is not very magnificent.</p>

               <p>THere are ſo few Palaces or other remarkable
Buildings in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that in two Days
I compleated my Walk thro' the City; and the
Obſervations I made are ſo inconſiderable, that I
ſhall eaſily be able to finiſh, in this Letter, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
which I began in the laſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Signior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Arſenal</hi> is at the End of the
Port, beyond <hi>Caſſum Pacha</hi> and <hi>Galata.</hi> I found the
Building better than I expected, after what I had
ſeen in the reſt of the City; and beſides, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a conſiderable extent of Ground: The Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
are laid up under 120 Arches, and 'tis ſaid
there are Arms in it for 60000 Men. But the
Magazins are inacceſſible to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and they are
only permitted to ſee the Baths where the <hi>Sultan's</hi>
Slaves are ſhut up; the Number of theſe Wretches
amounts to ſeveral Thouſands; and their Lodgings
are ſo miſerable, that I repented the Curioſity
that engag'd me in ſo unpleaſant a Viſit. The <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Baſſa</hi> lives in the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> with all the Officers
of the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> that they may be always ready
upon the Spot to receive his Orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is full of certain Houſes, which the
Poverty and ill Cuſtoms of the place have render'd
neceſſary, I mean the <hi>Hans</hi> and <hi>Karavanſeraïs.</hi>
The <hi>Hans</hi> conſiſt of four Sides of Building, enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a large ſquare Court, in which there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a Fountain, either in the midſt, or in ſome
other part of it. The Walls are very ſtrong, and
the Windows well barr'd, to ſecure the Goods that
are laid in the Ware-Houſes. The Roof conſiſts
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51983:99"/>
of little Domes cover'd with Lead, like thoſe of the
Moſquees. Theſe Houſes are appointed for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of Foreign Merchants: They contain
only two Stories, divided into Rooms, which have
not the leaſt Communication with one another.
The lower Story is compos'd of Ware-Houſes for
the Goods, and the upper is divided into little
Chambers, where the Merchants Lodge, but they
muſt take care to furniſh themſelves with Beds, Pots,
Diſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they are only accommodated here
with four bare Walls; and after they have provided
their Furniture, they muſt buy their Meat at the
Market or <hi>Bazar,</hi> and Dreſs it themſelves, ſince o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
they might ſtarve with their Pockets full
of Money. And, in the general, the way of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
in this Country is ſo inconvenient and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome,
that this Conſideration alone may ſerve to
diſcourage any Man that loves his Eaſe from viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it out of pure Curioſity. For in the firſt place you
muſt neither expect Coach, Waggon, Boat, Horſes,
nor any other convenient Carriage. If your Affairs
oblige you to undertake a Journey, tho' not above 100
Leagues, you muſt wait three Months for a <hi>Caravan,</hi>
which, after all, will not Travel above four Leagues
a day, and carry no other Proviſions but Rice,
Bisket, and Salt Beef, on which you muſt make a
ſhift to live, and encamp every Night till you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at your Journies end, where, if you have not
the conveniency of Lodging with a particular Friend,
'twill be in vain to enquire for the <hi>King's-Head,</hi> the
<hi>White-Croſs,</hi> or the <hi>Golden-Lyon:</hi> You muſt e'en creep
into a <hi>Han</hi> with a hundred Wretches, whoſe Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs
is altogether inſupportable, and reckon your
ſelf happy when ye can find ſuch a Lodging,
which, after all, is better than Encamping with the
<hi>Caravan.</hi>

               <p>You will, perhaps, think it impoſſible to repreſent
a more frightful Idea of Travelling; but I can aſſure
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51983:100"/>
you, that all theſe Inconveniencies are not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to thoſe which they who Travel to <hi>Perſia,</hi> or
croſs the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> muſt reſolve to undergo.
They muſt Travel ſix Months together expos'd to all
the Inconveniencies of bad Weather, and for the
moſt part in burning Sand, where there is neither
a Stalk of Graſs, nor a Spring to quench their
Thirſt. Beſides, they are perpetually in danger of
being ſurpriz'd by the <hi>Arabs,</hi> who rob and kill all
that come in their way. But all theſe Incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may be either more eaſily avoided or ſupported
than thoſe terrible Diſtempers that uſually ſeize <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi>
Travellers, who are not accuſtom'd to ſuch
hot Climates and fatiguing Journeys. I ſhall take
this occaſion to relate a Story of one of my Friends
who return'd, not long ago, from <hi>Poland,</hi> whither
he went about the beginning of the laſt Year by
the King's Order, in the quality of an Interpreter
with Monſieur <hi>de Chateauneuf's</hi> Chancellor, call'd
<hi>Beaucheſne.</hi> He was ſeiz'd by the way with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Fever and Looſeneſs, which brought him ſo
low, and made him ſo troubleſome to the <hi>Caravan-Bachi,</hi>
or Captain of the <hi>Caravan,</hi> that his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
wou'd have left him to periſh without aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
if that Officer had not been afraid to run
the hazard of offending the Ambaſſador; yet he
aſſur'd me that all their reſpect to Monſieur <hi>Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf</hi>
cou'd not have protected him, if the Fever had
ſeiz'd on his Head, and ſo made him incapable of
ſitting on Horſeback. But theſe are not the only
diſadvantages which Travellers ſuffer in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
they are expos'd to a thouſand other vexatious
Accidents, and are conſtantly plagu'd with the
Brutiſh Humours of the <hi>Camel-drivers.</hi> We are
wont to complain of the Sawcineſs of Carriers and
Coach-men; but I aſſure you they wou'd be reckon'd
very mild and tractable in this Country, where
every <hi>Camel-driver</hi> is as haughty as a Lord, and the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51983:100"/>
poor Traveller muſt keep in his Poſt under pain of
a <hi>Baſtanado,</hi> which he muſt take very patiently, for
if he ſhou'd offer to return the Blow, I wou'd not
enſure his Life for all the Money in the <hi>Caravan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thought my ſelf oblig'd to give you a faithful
Account of all theſe Inconveniencies, which moſt
Travellers ſtudy to conceal; that, if any of your
Friends have a mind to undertake the ſame Voyage,
they may at leaſt have the advantage of knowing
what they are to expect, which they cou'd not have
done if I had only given you a view of the pleaſant
and bright ſide of a Traveller's Entertainment. For
my part, I muſt confeſs I had ſo ſtrong an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Travelling,</hi> that I know not whether I ſhou'd
have ſtopt on this ſide <hi>China,</hi> if I had not met with
ſo many diſcouraging Rubs: But my Curioſity is
wonderfully abated of late, and I'm ſo perfectly
cur'd of my gadding Humor, that I'm reſolv'd to
confine my ſelf hereafter to <hi>Europe,</hi> and to Travel
only in ſuch Places where I may find, at leaſt, a
piece of <hi>Beef,</hi> and a pair of clean <hi>Sheets</hi> at Night.</p>
               <p>Since I had occaſion to mention <hi>Beaucheſne's</hi> Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Poland,</hi> 'twill not be improper to give you a
ſhort account of the cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> being informed of the great Loſſes
which the <hi>French</hi> ſuſtain'd during the Campaign of
1689. and of the ill-fortune that attended His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Arms in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where the Mareſchal <hi>D' Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miere</hi>
was unſucceſsful in the only attempt he made,
began to give leſs credit to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador's
ſmooth Harangues, and to deſire a Peace with the
Emperour. The Grand Viſier ſpoke of it ſeveral
times to Sir <hi>William Trumbal</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Collier,</hi>
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors, and ſent Orders
to His Maſter's Envoys at <hi>Vienna</hi> to haſten the deſir'd
Accommodation. And certainly the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
had reaſon to wiſh for a Peace, for his Affairs were
in a very hopeleſs condition. At the beginning of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51983:101"/>
the Campaign his Troops ſuffer'd a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
in <hi>Croatia,</hi> where they loſt above 2000
Men, with ſeveral Enſigns, and the Baſſa who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
'em. The Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> afterwards
Routed 'em thrice in three memorable Battels, and
they ſaw themſelves expos'd to all the Inſults of the
Imperialiſts, who talk'd of nothing leſs than of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging
<hi>Conſtantinople. Temeſwaer, Caniſſa,</hi> and <hi>Wara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi>
the only places they poſſeſt in <hi>Hungary,</hi> were
cloſely Block'd up without any hope of Relief.
Thus 'twas plainly the Intereſt of the <hi>Turks</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the Propoſals that were made by their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
Enemies: But the King's Intereſt was on
this occaſion directly oppoſite to that of his Allies.
He dreaded the fatal conſequences of ſuch a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and left no means uneſſay'd to prevent its
taking effect. He cajol'd the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> more
than ever, and flatter'd him with the hope of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a ſeparate Peace with the <hi>Polanders,</hi> ſince they
had already enter'd into a Negotiation with the
<hi>Tartars,</hi> and had ſent Deputies for that effect to
Count <hi>Tekeli,</hi> who was to perform the Office of a
Mediator between 'em. This Stratagem produc'd
the deſir'd effect, and the <hi>Turk</hi> was the more eaſily
deluded, becauſe he knew that not long before there
happen'd a ſort of Quarrel between the Courts of
<hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Vienna.</hi> For the Emperor had granted
his Protection to the <hi>Moldavians,</hi> and on that ſcore
was to receive the ſame Tribute which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
paid to the <hi>Turks.</hi> The King of <hi>Poland</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
a right to that Province, as an ancient Fief
of his Crown: But the Emperor wou'd not give
him any ſatisfaction, and even refus'd to anſwer the
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſador's Remonſtrances on that ſubject.
In the mean time the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ambaſſadors
at the Court of <hi>Poland,</hi> were not idle Spectators of
ſo favourable a Juncture, they endeavour'd to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the difference, and <hi>Beaucheſne</hi> was diſpatch'd
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51983:101"/>
thither with ſeveral Inſtructions both from the King
his Maſter, and from the <hi>Grand Viſier.</hi> But all their
Negotiations were unſucceſsful, for they cou'd not
prevail with the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to break his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
with the Emperor.</p>
               <p>I will not trouble you with an Apology for the
length of this digreſſion, into which the way of
Travelling in <hi>Turkey</hi> has inſenſibly engag'd me.
For ſince at the beginning of our Correſpondence
I reſolv'd to entertain you from time to time with
a familiar account, not only of my own Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but of what I ſhou'd learn from others; I
ſee no reaſon why the proſecution of that deſign
ſhou'd oblige me to a nice obſervance of an exact
and regular Method.</p>
               <p>I have already told you, that there are two ſorts
of <hi>Public Houſes</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> the <hi>Hans,</hi> and the
<hi>Karavanſeraïs:</hi> And I ſhall take this occaſion to add
a ſhort deſcription of the <hi>Second</hi> to the larger account
I gave you of the <hi>Firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are both built after the ſame manner, only
the <hi>Hans</hi> are enclos'd with good thick Walls, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Stone-work in the <hi>Karavanſeraïs</hi> reaches no
higher than the firſt or lower Story, the ſecond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
built of Wood, and cover'd with Bricks. They
have only one Gate, as well as the <hi>Hans,</hi> and ſerve
to lodge poor Strangers, and the Servants of the
<hi>Caravans;</hi> for which reaſon they are call'd <hi>Kara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanſeraï,</hi>
or the Houſes of the <hi>Caravans.</hi> All Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Perſons reſort to 'em, paying from half a
Crown, to a Crown a Month, according to the
fineneſs of the Houſe, or the advantages of its
Situation.</p>
               <p>After we had taken a ſlight view of ſeveral of
theſe Houſes, we went to the <hi>Grand Signior's Seraglio,</hi>
which I cannot deſcribe exactly, ſince I was not
ſuffer'd to go further than the ſecond Court, tho'
I was accompany'd by an <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51983:102"/>
whom I had been effectually recommended, and
without whoſe aſſiſtance I muſt have contented my
ſelf with a view of the firſt. The <hi>Seraglio</hi> is built
on a Point of Land that juts out into the Sea,
which I had occaſion to mention when I deſcrib'd
the ſituation of the City. 'Tis ſurrounded with
high Walls of a greyiſh Stone, with a Parapet at
the top, and Battlements like thoſe of the City. It
contains a vaſt extent of Ground, almoſt four Miles
in compaſs, the greateſt part of which is taken up
with Gardens. The Structure is irregular, and very
unſutable to the boaſted Magnificence of its Maſter:
For 'tis only a vaſt heap of Buildings not unlike to
ſome old Caſtles in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and you ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on the outſide but a confus'd medley of
Houſes, adorn'd with thoſe little gilt Spires and Globes
I mention'd in my laſt, in which all its Beauty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.
The reſt of the Building is ſo mean, that a
Man wou'd never imagine it to be the <hi>Seraglio,</hi>
that admir'd Palace of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Entry is near <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> and exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
the Gate of an old paltry Town, without
either Architecture or Ornament: Yet 'tis carefully
guarded by the <hi>Capigi,</hi> who keep their Court of
Guard under it, and ſit on Benches of Stone. This
Gate led us into a large Court, where on the right
hand we obſerv'd the Apartments for the Sick, with
large Matted <hi>Sopha</hi>'s along the Walls, where the
Diſeas'd Perſons are plac'd, and lodg'd as poorly as
if they were in a Hoſpital. On the left hand are
Magazines containing Arms for a Thouſand Men,
that in caſe of neceſſity the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> may arm
his Domeſtic Servants for the ſecurity of his Perſon.
But notwithſtanding this Precaution, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was
Strangled, <hi>Mahomet</hi> Dethron'd, and <hi>Solyman</hi> Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd,
not to mention the Tragical Ends of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Princes of the ſame Line, whoſe Guards
cou'd not protect 'em from the fury of a Seditious
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51983:102"/>
Multitude. From this Court we paſs'd into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
border'd with two large Portico's. The <hi>Grand
Signior's</hi> Kitchens are on one ſide, which are not
kept very hot at preſent, ſince he chuſes to reſide at
<hi>Adrianople:</hi> Yet I obſerv'd ſome Perſons preparing
<hi>Pilo, Paſties,</hi> and <hi>Fiſh,</hi> for the Women in the old <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio.</hi>
On the other Side are the Stables, where
there is Room and Accommodation for a hundred
Horſes. If your Curioſity be not ſatisfy'd with ſo
imperfect an Account of ſo famous a Place, you
muſt conſult thoſe who were permitted to enter
farther.</p>
               <p>Very near this <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and within the ſame En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure,
there is another Edifice, commonly call'd
<hi>The Old Seraglio.</hi> 'Twas erected by one who was no
Lover of ill-contriv'd Structures, I mean <hi>Conſtantine
the Great;</hi> and yet 'tis certainly a very ugly Maſs
of Building, ſurrounded with Walls of an unuſual
Heighth, without any Windows on the Outſide. I
will not undertake to juſtifie the Deſign of the
Founder, tho' we may be allow'd to ſuppoſe that
he had ſome ſecret Reaſons for contriving it after
this Manner. Beſides I only ſaw the Back of it,
and perhaps the Front may be more regularly built.
Here the reigning <hi>Sultan</hi> ſhuts up the Wives of his
Predeceſſours, who at their Entrance into this
Place may bid adieu to all the Pleaſures of this
Life.</p>
               <p>The preſent <hi>Sultan's</hi> Wives are lodg'd in a Third
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> which is join'd ſo cloſe to that of the <hi>Grand
Signior,</hi> that he may paſs from one to the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
expoſing himſelf to the Rain. I need not tell you
with what ſeverity they are guarded by the white and
black Eunuchs, who never permit 'em to enjoy the
leaſt Shadow of Liberty. All the Relations of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
are full of Stories and Reflexions on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and therefore inſtead of repeating the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of others, I ſhall only add, that 'tis a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51983:103"/>
Crime to look upon one of theſe Women. I ſaw
a <hi>Turk</hi> at <hi>Galata</hi> whoſe Father was ſtrangl'd for ſo
dangerous a piece of Curioſity, under the Reign of
<hi>Amurath,</hi> whoſe Memory will not be eaſily forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Places that were ſubject to his Dominion;
for he was certainly one of the ſevereſt and moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
Princes in the World. 'Twas his daily Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
to walk in Diſguiſe thro' the City, that he
might be an Eye-witneſs of the Care that was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to put the Laws in Execution; and he ſeldom
or never walk'd the Rounds without leaving ſome
headleſs Monuments of his Juſtice: beſides he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
obſerv'd what was done in the City from
his <hi>Seraglio,</hi> by the help of ſome excellent Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive-Glaſſes,
with which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had preſented
him. One day as he was making his uſual. Obſervations,
he perceiv'd a Man in <hi>Pera,</hi> who had alſo a Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive-Glaſs,
and was viewing the <hi>Sultaneſſes,</hi> who
were walking in the Garden. Immediately he call'd
a <hi>Capigi,</hi> and commanded him to go with four
<hi>Mutes</hi> to ſuch a Houſe, and hang a Man, whom
he deſcrib'd, at the Window; which the <hi>Capigi</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted,
and <hi>Amurath</hi> ſaw him and was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd.</p>
               <p>From the Account I have given you of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>'s
Palace, you may reaſonably conclude that the
great Officers of the Empire are but meanly lodg'd.
Moſt of their Houſes are inclos'd in a kind of Park,
which contains a Garden, and a large Court bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
with Stables on one ſide, and Kitchens on the
other. The fineſt I have yet ſeen is that of <hi>Haly
Baſſa, Kaimacan</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whither I attended
the Ambaſſadour, when he receiv'd the firſt Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of that Miniſter, which was perform'd with
the following Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>Firſt march'd ſixteen <hi>Livery-Men,</hi> in Red Coats,
with a broad Gold Galoon on the Seams, the <hi>Steward</hi>
walking before 'em. They were follow'd by the
<pb facs="tcp:51983:103"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:51983:104"/>
                  <figure>
                     <p>The Audience which the Caimakan of Conſtantinople gave to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. de Chateau-neuf the French Ambaſsador P. 169</p>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:51983:104"/>
                  <hi>Valets de Chambre, Cooks, Clerks</hi> of the <hi>Office,</hi> and
<hi>Commiſſaries</hi> of the <hi>Chancery.</hi> After 'em walk'd ſix
<hi>Interpreters,</hi> follow'd by as many <hi>Janiſaries;</hi> and at
laſt came the <hi>Ambaſſadour,</hi> accompany'd with his <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,</hi>
and <hi>Chancellour,</hi> the moſt conſiderable Perſons
of the Nation marching ſome Paces after him. In
this Order he walk'd to <hi>Tophana,</hi> where he embark'd
with all his Train, the <hi>Kaimacan</hi> having ſent Boats
to attend him, and a very fine gilt one for himſelf,
with twelve Rowers. There were a conſiderable
number of <hi>French</hi> Veſſels in the Port, who ſaluted
him with all their Guns. At his Arrival on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide he found his Led-Horſes very richly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſs'd,
with Silver Bridles, and Embroider'd Foot-Cloths
trailing on the Ground. Immediately he
mounted his Horſe, and all his Attendants falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſame Order, as before, he rode thro' the City
to the <hi>Kaimacan</hi>'s Houſe, who ſent his <hi>Kiaia,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him at the Foot of the Stairs, accompany'd
with two other Officers, who led him under the
Arms to the Chamber of Audience, where there
was a kind of Chair with a Back, plac'd for him on the
<hi>Sopha:</hi> Immediately after the <hi>Kaimacan</hi> enter'd, and
ſate down upon the <hi>Sopha</hi> over-againſt him. At firſt
the Diſcourſe was only general; but after ſome
Compliments to the <hi>Kaimacan</hi> on his late Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they began to talk of the preſent Poſture of
Affairs: and that Miniſter inſiſted very long on the
<hi>Grand Viſier</hi>'s happy Succeſs in <hi>Hungary,</hi> informing
the Ambaſſadour, that in leſs than two Months he
made himſelf Maſter of the Cities of <hi>Niſſa, Widin,
Semendria,</hi> and <hi>Belgrade</hi> it ſelf, which he took by
Storm after a Siege of eight Days, and put the
whole Garriſon to the Sword, except 300 Men who
made their Eſcape. He related alſo the particular
Circumſtances of Count <hi>Tekeli</hi>'s Engagement with
4000 <hi>Tranſylvanians,</hi> who were entirely routed,
ſcarce 200 of 'em eſcaping, and General <hi>Heuſter</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:51983:105"/>
himſelf being taken Priſoner. The Ambaſſadour
receiv'd this agreeable News with the higheſt Marks
of Joy, and reply'd in theſe very Words, <hi>That it
ſeem'd there was a Sympathy between the two Empires,
ſince while the Emperour his Maſter was triumphing over
their common Enemies beyond the</hi> Rhine, <hi>he had the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to be inform'd of the Glorious Succeſs of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's
Arms in</hi> Hungary; adding, <hi>That this was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
an Effect of that entire Correſpondence which had
united the two Empires for ſo long and uninterrupted a
Series of Years.</hi> The <hi>Kaimacan</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>That he had
taken delight in making the ſame Obſervation, and that
he lookt upon it as a happy Preſage.</hi> Then the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour</hi>
took occaſion to intreat him <hi>to employ all
his Intereſt for the Eſtabliſhment and Confirmation of an
Union that was of ſuch high Importance for the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of both the Empires; for 'tis plain,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that the
Intereſts of both our Emperours are the ſame. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
break the Union that links 'em together, without
weakening themſelves: and it ought to be acknowledg'd
as a Fundamental Maxim, That the Grandeur of the
Emperour my Maſter confirms that of his Highneſs, which
reciprocally contributes to the Glory and Safety of my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</hi>
The <hi>Kaimacan</hi> reply'd as one who was of
the ſame Opinion; he ſpoke ſeveral times of an
<hi>Alliance</hi> between the two Emperours, adding, That
<hi>'twou'd not be the firſt time the</hi> Ottoman <hi>and</hi> French
<hi>Armies had carry'd on the ſame Deſign, and even obey'd
the ſame Orders.</hi> But the <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> declin'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
a poſitive Anſwer, becauſe he could not rely
upon the Fidelity of all that were preſent, and
perhaps I was one of thoſe whom he doubted
moſt, for they begin already to ſuſpect my <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then putting ſome odoriferous Matter into a
Cenſer, they perfum'd his Head and Cloaths, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a large Cloth or Napkin above him to keep the
Fumes from evaporating. After this Ceremony was
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51983:105"/>
over, they brought <hi>Coffee, Sherbet,</hi> and at laſt the
uſual Preſents, conſiſting of <hi>Twenty five Veſts,</hi> which
were laid before the <hi>Kaimacan.</hi> The firſt was for
the <hi>Ambaſſadour,</hi> and the reſt for his twenty four <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,</hi>
who were call'd in Order by his <hi>Steward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According as our Names were call'd, we ſtept
forwards to receive the <hi>Veſts</hi> from one of the <hi>Kai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macan</hi>'s
Officers, who firſt ſpread it before the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,</hi>
and then put it on our Shoulders. Theſe
Veſts are ſuch inconſiderable Trifles, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
of 'em ſeems rather an Affront than a Mark
of Eſteem; for they are not worth above three
<hi>Half-Crowns</hi> a-piece. They are made of <hi>Cotton,</hi>
branch'd with a little <hi>Silk</hi> of ſeveral Colours, after
a very odd and phantaſtical Manner. The <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour</hi>'s
was not finer than the reſt, only ſpangl'd here
and there with a little paltry <hi>Gold.</hi> I'm inform'd
that this Cuſtom of preſenting <hi>Veſts</hi> is an uſual Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
among the <hi>Turks,</hi> proceeding from their
extream Deſire of Preſents, which is the uſual Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of their Kindneſs and Affection: for 'twou'd
be reckon'd as ridiculous, as 'tis in vain, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to acquire their Friendſhip, or convince 'em of
the Sincerity of our Love by Proteſtations and other
Marks of Affection, if they be not accompany'd
with Preſents. I can aſſure you that all my <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Acquaintances are of the ſame Humour: and this
Cuſtom prevails ſo univerſally that every one is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to comply with it.</p>
               <p>After we had receiv'd our Veſts, his <hi>Excellency</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
with the <hi>Kaimacan</hi> to a private Chamber, to
diſcourſe of ſecret Affairs. In the mean time we
had leiſure to view the Apartments of the Houſe,
which were all open'd to us; tho' we might have
contented our ſelves with the Sight of one, ſince
there is no difference between 'em; and therefore
'twill be an eaſie Task to gratifie your Curioſity
with a Deſcription of 'em. You muſt not expect

a long Catalogue of rare Pictures, magnificent Beds,
large Looking-Glaſſes, ſilver Tables, curious Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and other rich Furniture: for there are no
ſuch Ornaments in the Houſe. Four bare Walls,
a <hi>Plafond</hi> or Cieling, and a <hi>Sopha</hi> are all the Riches
and all the Beauty of their Rooms. 'Tis true their
Plafonds are very fine, and painted all over with
<hi>Cochineel, Gold,</hi> and <hi>Azure:</hi> their way of deſigning
is peculiar to themſelves, but its Oddneſs does not
make it leſs pleaſant; 'Tis a kind of <hi>Moreſco,</hi> the
Figures entering into one another, and appearing
the ſame on all ſides; and it muſt be acknowledg'd
that the <hi>Turks</hi> have very fruitful Inventions, for, I
believe, there are a Million of ſeveral Sorts of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.
The middle of the Plafond is uſually richer
than the reſt, both in Gilding and Painting; but
'tis impoſſible to make you comprehend either of
'em, unleſs you had ſeen ſomething of a like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which, I believe, you never did, ſince there
is not one Room in <hi>France</hi> thus adorn'd. The Walls
are alſo cover'd with the ſame ſort of Paint inſtead
of Hangings: and as for the <hi>Sopha,</hi> I cannot repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
it better than as a Bench about two Foot high,
reaching from one end of the Chamber to the
other, on the Side next the Street, under the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
which begin a Foot higher in the Wall: 'tis
always between ten and eleven Foot broad, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with <hi>Turkiſh</hi> or <hi>Perſian</hi> Tapeſtry; beſides which
there are Mats laid along the Wall, 4 or 5 foot broad,
cover'd with Cloth or Velvet, and over theſe there are
large Cuſhions, ſtuff'd with Hair or Wooll. Theſe
Cuſhions in great Mens Houſes are either curiouſly
embroider'd, or made of a rich Cloth of Gold: and
'tis here that the <hi>Turks</hi> ſit night and day croſs-legg'd
like Taylors, ſmoaking <hi>Tabacco,</hi> and drinking <hi>Coffee,</hi>
without any other Diverſion than playing with
Shells, and ſometimes a Game at <hi>Tric-trac,</hi> or the
<hi>Gooſe.</hi> But ſince I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51983:106"/>
ſpeak of their Recreations, I ſhall at preſent only
give you an Account of their Houſes.</p>
               <p>While the Ambaſſadour was diſcourſing in private
with the <hi>Kaimacan,</hi> I went down to the Garden,
which is not above 100 Paces long, and 60 broad:
the Walks are gravell'd, border'd in ſome places
with Orange-Trees, and in others with Fruit-Trees.
The ſquare Beds in the Garden are not cut and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
like our Flower-Plots, but only ſeparated with
Diviſions, and fill'd with Flowers, of which the
<hi>Turks</hi> are very curious. In the Middle there is a
pretty large Baſon of Water, from the Centre
of which there riſes a little Marble Spire, gilt
and painted after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Manner, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth Water thro' four Pipes. There are alſo
two other Baſons at each End of the Garden,
which are more remarkable for the peculiar Odd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Structure, than for their Beauty. They
are fram'd almoſt like Centinels woodden Boxes,
only they are not quite ſo deep, and there is a kind
of Chapiter on the Top, adorn'd with Gilding and
Figures. The Inſide is cut into the Form of Scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop-Shells,
on which the Water falling makes a great
number of little Caſcades that run into a Baſon,
and form another large Caſcade, the Water of
which is receiv'd into a Sort of Tub or Vat, and
from thence thro' ſeveral Holes, runs into little Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
about the Breadth of four Fingers, cut out of
a large Marble Pavement that reaches from theſe
Fountains to the Baſon in the Middle of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
The Pavement was contriv'd on purpoſe for
the Conveniency of cutting out theſe little winding
Canals, which forming a vaſt number of regular
and very pleaſant Figures, fall at laſt into the great
Baſon. This, Sir, is the beſt Account I can give
you of the <hi>Kaimacan</hi>'s Garden, which may ſerve
for all the reſt I have hitherto had occaſion to ſee,
ſince there is no great Difference between 'em. As
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51983:107"/>
for the Houſe, 'tis a great Maſs of Building, the
Front conſiſting of a high and broad Stair-Caſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by two Galleries that reach from one end of
the Houſe to the other; and the whole is dawb'd
over very coarſly with a ſort of Red and Green
Paint. Under the Stair-Caſe there is a large ſquare
Gate, that leads into a Court ſurrounded with Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries
like the firſt, and ſupported with woodden
Pillars. Here the <hi>Kaimacan's</hi> Servants lodge,
whoſe number may amount to fifty or ſixty, all
cloath'd after the ſame manner, with a <hi>Cafetan</hi> or
white Coat, that covers 'em from Head to Foot.
From thence I went to view the Stables, which in
this Country is uſually the beſt furniſh'd part of the
Houſe; and in theſe I obſerv'd forty good Horſes.
After I had ſatisfi'd my Curioſity with a View of
all that was remarkable below, I went up again to
my Companions, and ſate drinking <hi>Sherbet,</hi> till the
<hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> came out. The <hi>Kiaia</hi> accompany'd
him to the Foot of the Stairs, where he receiv'd
him at his coming, with the ſame Officers that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
him under the Arms; but the <hi>Kaimacan</hi>
came not out of his Chamber, which in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was a little too ſtately for a Perſon of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
The <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> did not pull off his Hat,
either at his coming in or going out: not that he
ſlighted the <hi>Kaimacan,</hi> but out of pure Compliance
to the Manners of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who never uncover
their Heads before Perſons for whom they have
the leaſt Reſpect. I had forgot to tell you, that
when he enter'd the Chamber all the <hi>Kaimacan's</hi>
Servants bellow'd out thrice, <hi>Is alla Malec allec is
alla:</hi> and at his Departure he was ſaluted with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hollow; which is the uſual <hi>Welcome</hi> and <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
of the <hi>Turks</hi> to Perſons whom they intend to
treat with particular Marks of Honour. I am,</p>

               <p>MY unexpected ſtay in this City has procur'd
me the ſplendid, or rather the mortifying
ſight of <hi>Sultan Solyman</hi>'s Triumphant Entry into <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
at the end of ſo ſucceſsful a Campaign.
The <hi>Turks</hi> are ſo puff'd up with the advantageous
Progreſs of their Arms this Summer, and both their
Contempt and Hatred of the Imperialiſts are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
heighten'd that they look upon 'em as <hi>dead
Doggs,</hi> ripe for deſtruction, and flatter themſelves
with the Chimerical Hope of ſeeing <hi>Vienna</hi> once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
Beſieg'd the next Campaign. The ſight of ſo
great a quantity of Booty which was brought from
<hi>Hungary,</hi> and is ſold almoſt for nothing in this City,
has ſwoln their Pride to ſuch a height, that they
uſually treat Chriſtians with intolerable Inſolence,
except the <hi>French,</hi> whom they call their <hi>Friends</hi> and
<hi>Allies.</hi> When they accidentally meet a <hi>Frank,</hi> whom
they know not, their firſt Queſtion is, <hi>What Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
are you?</hi> and if he anſwers,</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">I'm a <hi>French</hi>-man.</note> 
                  <hi>Sono Franceſe,</hi> immediately they
embrace him, and patting him gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the Shoulder, reply,<note n="†" place="margin">We are Brothers.</note> 
                  <hi>Siamo
Fratelli.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of this City have not ſeen theſe
many Years a more Magnificent Ceremony than the
late Entry of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> which was made in
the following Order: Firſt march'd 200 <hi>Capigi,</hi> or
Keepers of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Gate, with tapering
Caps, and a Cone, or ſharp-pointed piece of Cloth
hanging down to their Noſes; they were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the <hi>Capigi-Bachi.</hi> After 'em came the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51983:108"/>
                  <hi>Sorlaques,</hi> or <hi>Foot-Guards of the Body,</hi> conſiſting of,
old pick'd Soldiers who expect Preferment: They
wore tuck'd up Gowns, carrying their Bows in their
Left-hand, and Quivers on their Shoulders: Their
Caps were of Cloth, like thoſe of the <hi>Capigi,</hi> but
inſtead of a Cone they were only adorn'd with
Plumes of Feathers. A Thouſand <hi>Janiſaries</hi> march'd
after 'em, Clad in Red, with <hi>Zercola's</hi> on their
Head, made of a large piece of Felt a Foot broad,
which falls back on their Shoulders, with a Cone or
ſharp point like that of the <hi>Capigi:</hi> Every one of
'em carri'd a great Reed or Cane, eight foot long
and three round, with an Ivory Ball on the top,
and their <hi>Aga</hi> walk'd before 'em.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Janiſaries</hi> were follow'd by 500 <hi>Chiauox</hi>'s
which are <hi>Horſe Guards,</hi> the laſt of 'em carrying the
Standards and Colours that were taken from the
<hi>Imperialiſts.</hi> They had large Caps or Turbants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
two Foot in circumference: They were very
well Mounted, and led by the <hi>Chiaoux-Bachi.</hi> After
'em march'd the <hi>Mutefaraca</hi>'s, who are a ſort of
Officers that never go to the War, almoſt like our
<hi>Reformades.</hi> Next came the <hi>Kiſler Aga,</hi> accompani'd
by the <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Black Eunuchs,</hi> who walk'd on each
ſide of him, to Guard the <hi>Sultaneſſes,</hi> who rode in
eight very fine Coaches, but cou'd not be ſeen by
reaſon of a piece of Silk with which the Glaſſes
were cover'd.</p>
               <p>After them appear'd the unfortunate Prince <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
IV. who, with his two Sons, was plac'd in a
Coach cloſe barr'd like a Priſon-Window, and
guarded by twelve <hi>Chiaoux</hi>'s. Immediately after
came the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Great Officers, to the number of
above 200 Perſons, all richly Cloath'd in Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
Veſts, and Turbants, enrich'd with precious
Stones: Their Horſes were alſo adorn'd with Silver
Bridles, and very fine Foot Cloaths, either Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
or of Cloth of Gold, trailing on the Ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:51983:108"/>
The ſeven <hi>Viſiers of the Bench</hi> brought up the Rear
of this Magnificent Troop, and were follow'd by the
<hi>Mufti,</hi> who was mounted on a white Horſe (but not
ſo ſtately as the reſt) and attended by four Officers
on Foot. Then came the <hi>Selictar</hi> carrying the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi>'s Sword bare. At laſt the <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
ſeated in a triumphal Chariot, open on all
Sides, and cover'd all over with ſilver-gilt Plates,
enrich'd with counterfeit Jewels, which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
caſt a great Splendour. The Chariot was drawn
by Eight ſpotted Horſes, cover'd with Red Velvet,
embroider'd with Gold, and adorn'd with gilt Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles.
The Inſide of the Chariot was lin'd with Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
of the ſame Colour, embroider'd alſo with Gold;
and in it there was a little <hi>Sopha,</hi> with a large Cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a very rich Stuff, on which the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſate.
This place of the Chariot was cover'd with a very
rich Canopy, like that of a Coach, and rais'd ſo
high, that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> might be eaſily ſeen by
the Spectatours. He is about fifty Years old, of a
ſevere Aſpect, and no very fine Shape. He wore
a large <hi>Turbant,</hi> almoſt like that of the <hi>Chiaoux</hi>'s,
adorn'd with two very magnificent <hi>Aigrets,</hi> enrich'd
with precious Stones: His <hi>Veſt</hi> was of a very fine Stuff
adorn'd with Pearls, but much inferiour to the Coat
that coſt Fifteen Millions, which the King puts
on when he receives Ambaſſadours. About and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Chair march'd a hundred <hi>Aga's</hi> on Foot,
with their Officers and Commanders; and in the
laſt place came Three hundred <hi>Spahi's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At Night there were great Illuminations in the
<hi>Seraglio</hi> and all the <hi>Moſquees:</hi> and the People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
their Joy by Feaſts, Bone-fires, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Shouts, crying, without Intermiſſion, <hi>Long
live our Emperour, the Reſtorer of Monarchy, and the
Prophet's Darling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur de Chateauneuf,</hi> who omits no occaſion of
pleaſing the <hi>Turks,</hi> gave 'em ſo many and ſo expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51983:109"/>
Marks of the Share he took in their Joy, that
his Charge cou'd not be much leſs than theirs.
His Palace was almoſt cover'd with Garlands of
Myrtle; and at Night almoſt all the People of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
flock'd thither to admire the Beauty of his
Fire-Works. The <hi>French</hi> Ships ſignaliz'd their Zeal and
Affection to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Intereſt, according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
they receiv'd from the Ambaſſadour, both by the
Illuminations of which their Maſts and Ropes were
ſo full, that they ſeem'd at a diſtance to be on fire,
and by repeated Diſcharges of their Artillery. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Ambaſſadour prepar'd a ſplendid Feaſt for
ſeveral <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Lords; among whom was the Prince
of <hi>Moldavia:</hi> There were two Tables for twenty
Perſons each, thoſe who ſate at one being enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by himſelf, and thoſe at the other by his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
<hi>Pelleran.</hi> The Gueſts were regal'd with all
imaginable Magnificence both at Dinner and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
and two Fountains run Wine in the Court,
all the while the Feaſt laſted, whither all the <hi>Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado's,
Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Mariners,</hi> came to drink the
Healths of the <hi>Two Glorious Emperours,</hi> Lewis <hi>and</hi>
Solyman, <hi>ever Great, and ever Victorious,</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Word <hi>Vivat,</hi> according to the Cuſtom of
the Country, with loud and repeated Acclamations,
which is the ſame thing with the <hi>Engliſh Huzza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But among all thoſe Expreſſions of Joy, that
which ſcandaliz'd me moſt, was a Pyramid of Fire,
forty Foot high, which burnt in the Court till the
Morning. For there was an Illumination on the
Top of it repreſenting on one Side the <hi>Arms of
France,</hi> and on the other, a <hi>Shield</hi> charg'd with <hi>Three
fiery Creſcents.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> were extremely pleas'd
to ſee with how much Ardour the <hi>French</hi> eſpous'd
their Intereſts; and ſince that time have look'd more
favourably upon our Countrymen than before. 'Tis
true that they have been of late ſo much oblig'd to
<hi>France,</hi> that they might juſtly be reckon'd the moſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51983:109"/>
ungrateful People in the World, if they were not
ſenſible of ſo many good Offices. For without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
on the powerful Diverſion made by our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which has contributed ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to the Succeſs of their Arms; they have, to
my certain Knowledge, receiv'd Supplies of Money
from them, which, without pretending to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the preciſe Sums, I can aſſure you amount to a
very conſiderable Value; for it has been obſerv'd
in Ships that brought 100000 <hi>Piaſters,</hi> there were not
20000 for the uſe of the Merchants.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadour has the moſt convenient way
that cou'd be deſir'd, to receive the Sums that are
deſign'd for ſecret Service: for all the Money that
comes over to the Merchants muſt be carry'd to his
Houſe, where the Owners muſt afterwards receive
it; ſo that People are not at all ſurpriz'd, when at
the Arrival of a Ship they ſee Cheſts of Gold and
Silver carry'd to him. And beſides, who knows
whether the King ſends not over Engineers, Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and Officers: I have ſeen ſeveral Perſons of
that Character here, and I my ſelf refus'd a Place
which <hi>Monſieur de Chateauneuf</hi> wou'd have given me
in a Company of <hi>French Granadiers,</hi> conſiſting of
200 Men, who are publickly levy'd in this City.</p>
               <p>This puts me in Mind of a remarkable Accident
that happen'd lately at <hi>Theſſalonica.</hi> Two <hi>Engineers</hi>
arriv'd in that Port, pretending to be <hi>French</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and that they travell'd purely out of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity:
the <hi>Conſul</hi> receiv'd 'em with the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of Civility, and invited 'em to lodge at
his Houſe; for 'tis the uſual Cuſtom of all the <hi>Conſuls</hi>
in the <hi>Levant</hi> to ſhew a great deal of Reſpect and
Kindneſs to Strangers that ſeem to be Perſons of
Note or Quality. But having other conceal'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
they addreſs'd themſelves two Days after their
Arrival, to a <hi>Greek</hi> that wore a <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ruggoman</hi>'s Cap,
and pray'd him to carry 'em to the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſſa,</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51983:110"/>
for 'em, without acquainting the <hi>Conſul.</hi>
The <hi>Greek,</hi> who was glad of any Opportunity to
earn Money, embrac'd their Propoſal very chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and accompany'd 'em to the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Houſe,
where they declar'd their Profeſſion, and offer'd
him their Service, but without intimating in the leaſt
that they were willing to renounce their Religion.
The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officer receiv'd 'em very favourably,
and promis'd to recommend 'em to ſome Perſon at
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who wou'd quickly procure 'em an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
ſuitable to their Inclinations. Thus they
return'd to the <hi>Conſul</hi>'s Houſe very well ſatisfy'd
with the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Civility: but the Interpreter's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
not permitting him to have a Hand in aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
the declar'd Enemies of his Religion, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the whole Intrigue to the <hi>Conſul,</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
the Arguments and earneſt Intreaties they
us'd to oblige him to Secreſie. Immediately the
honeſt <hi>Conſul</hi> believing that 'twou'd be an acceptable
Piece of Service both to God and the King, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the wicked Deſigns of his Gueſts, order'd 'em
to be apprehended, and ſent back to <hi>France</hi> in Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
'Tis plain that his Intentions were good, and
that he could not be juſtly blam'd for taking that
Courſe; but he quickly found, to his Coſt, that
they had more potent Friends than he imagin'd, for
after they had made their Complaints, he receiv'd a
ſevere Reprimand from the Marqueſs <hi>de Seignelay,</hi>
and was in danger of being turn'd out of his
Office.</p>
               <p>The Number of <hi>Deſerters</hi> that come over to the
<hi>Turks</hi> is almoſt incredible. There are at preſent ſo
many of 'em in the Service, that there might be
ſeveral compleat <hi>French</hi> Regiments in the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Army. I know that ſuch a Deſign has been ſeveral
times propos'd to the Ambaſſadour by the <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier,
Kopergli Oglou,</hi> but the little Regard he ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
to the external Rules of Decency, has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51983:110"/>
to reſtrain'd him from giving his Conſent. Neither
do I ſee any Reaſon why the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhou'd be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at his ſeeming Niceneſs, ſince 'tis not at all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to their Intereſt: For while their main Deſign
is ſerv'd, they may very well diſpenſe with a needleſs
Piece of Formality, and the <hi>French</hi> Soldiers fight as
well when they are diſpers'd among the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Troops, as if they were all united in a diſtinct
Body. That which allures 'em to come over in
ſuch vaſt Numbers, is the favourable Treatment
they receive at their Arrival: about eight Days ago
I ſaw a hundred and fifty of 'em march thro' this
City, with Drums beating, and Colours flying, I
mean a Piece of White Cloth, which in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
as well as upon the Sea, is reckon'd the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>France.</hi> Priſoners of all Nations, except the
<hi>Germans,</hi> enjoy the ſame Priviledges, provided they
claim his Majeſty's Protection. 'Tis true there are
ſeveral pretended Deſerters, who carry on their hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Deſigns under ſo ſpecious a Diſguiſe: Nor have
the <hi>Turks</hi> yet learn'd Circumſpection, tho' they have
been ſo often deceiv'd. I cou'd tell you twenty
Stories of this Nature, but I ſhall content my ſelf
with relating one Inſtance, to convince you that
the <hi>Emperour</hi> has as good <hi>Spies</hi> as the King of
<hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the End of the laſt Year, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Death of the Ambaſſadour <hi>Girardin,</hi> one
<hi>Vanel</hi> came over as a Deſerter to the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi>'s
Army in <hi>Hungary,</hi> pretending to be a <hi>French</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who was taken Priſoner on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and
forc'd to ſerve as a <hi>Voluntier</hi> in the Emperour's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which he left, aſſoon as he found a favourable
Occaſion to make his Eſcape. But not contenting
himſelf to remain as a Spy in the Army, he had
the Confidence to aſſume the Character of <hi>Agent of
France,</hi> till the Arrival of the Ambaſſadour
whom the King had nam'd. The <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51983:111"/>
a Man whoſe very aſpect ſeem'd to anſwer for
his Honeſty; and beſides, perceiving that he made
a great Figure, was ſo far from ſuſpecting him, that
he own'd him as Agent: So that during the whole
Winter he manag'd the King's Affairs with as much
Authority as if he had been empower'd with a
Commiſſion from <hi>Verſailles.</hi> 'Tis true, he ſeem'd
to be very jealous of the Honour and Intereſt of
the Nation; but in private he endeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> that the only way to preſerve
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, was to haſten the concluſion
of a Peace with the Emperour; and in the mean
time he found out ways to acquaint the Court of
<hi>Vienna</hi> with all the Tranſactions at the <hi>Port.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This cunning Spy had the Art to play ſo difficult
a Game with ſo much dexterity and ſucceſs, that he
gain'd the eſteem and affection both of the <hi>Grand
Viſier</hi> and <hi>Sultan,</hi> from whom he receiv'd conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Preſents. And even the <hi>French</hi> had at laſt ſo
good an Opinion of him, that they ſcrupl'd not to
addreſs themſelves to him on all occaſions, as they
wou'd have done to an Ambaſſador. So that he
thought his Credit ſo well eſtabliſhed, that he might
boldly expect the arrival of Monſieur <hi>de Chateauneuf,</hi>
who was coming to perſwade the <hi>Viſier</hi> to continue
the War againſt the Empire. <hi>Vanel</hi> went to meet
him a days Journey beyond <hi>Sophia,</hi> and told him,
that ſince Fortune had engag'd him in the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Service, during the Vacancy of the Embaſſy, he
thought himſelf oblig'd by the Honour he had to
be a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, to do what Service he cou'd
to the Nation, as he had actually done for ſeveral
Months, and was ready to give him an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all his Proceedings. Afterwards he went
with the Ambaſſador to the <hi>Viſier,</hi> who gave him ſo
favourable a Character, that Monſieur <hi>de Chateauneuf</hi>
either did not, or ſeem'd not to doubt of his Zeal
and Affection to the King's Service. However, 'tis
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51983:111"/>
probable, that he was not entirely ſatisfi'd with his
Conduct, and that he wrote to ſeveral Places for
better Information concerning him. For having
one Evening receiv'd a Pacquet in <hi>Vanel</hi>'s Preſence,
that ſubtle Spy fearing that the Intelligence might
concern him, adventur'd to peep over the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's
Shoulder, while he was reading the Letters,
and perceiving that they gave a very ſuſpicious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of him, he reſolv'd to prevent the danger that
threaten'd him by a ſudden Flight. Next Morning
he roſe as ſoon as the day began to appear, and went
immediately to one <hi>D' Etanchot,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Captain in
Count <hi>Teckely</hi>'s Troops, who was his intimate Friend:
He accoſted him with a Melancholic Air, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him to carry him to Count. <hi>Teckely</hi>'s Army,
where he had ſome buſineſs to diſpatch that requir'd
all poſſible expedition. <hi>D' Etanchot</hi> reply'd, That
he was ready to ſerve him, and that he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
go along with him after he had receiv'd
the Ambaſſador's Orders. <hi>Vanel,</hi> who dreaded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than the diſcovery of his Deſign, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
his Friend not to inſiſt on that piece of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality;
and to engage him the more effectually to
comply with his Deſires, he offer'd him 1000 Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoles,
promiſing to give him as much more at the
end of his Journey. <hi>D' Etanchot</hi> was extreamly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at his Earneſtneſs and Impatience, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by the great Offers he made him, that the
buſineſs was of greater Importance than at firſt he
imagin'd: His Fidelity to his Prince was ſtronger
than his Affection to his Friend, and at laſt he told
him plainly, that he wou'd not go with him unleſs
he wou'd ſuffer him to ask the Ambaſſador's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
before his departure. Then <hi>Vanel</hi> ſeeing
himſelf diſcover'd, and fearing Torture more than
Death, which he knew was inavoidable, leſt he ſhou'd
not be able to endure the extream violence of the
Pain, without divulging his Secret, he reſolv'd to be
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51983:112"/>
his own Executioner; and ſuffering <hi>D' Etanchot</hi> to
walk ſome paces before him, without ſpeaking a
Word, he pull'd a Piſtol out of his Pocket, charg'd
with three Bullets, and ſhot himſelf thro' the Head.
His Friend ſurpriz'd at the unexpected noiſe, look'd
back, and ſeeing him lie groveling on the Ground,
and wallowing in his own Blood, run immediately
to acquaint the Ambaſſador with the Tragical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
who at firſt cou'd not believe him, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
ſuſpecting him to be the Murderer, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him to be ſecur'd: Then he went with ſeveral
of his Servants, to the place where this unfortunate
Perſon lay, and finding him ſtill alive, tho' very
weak, he ask'd him, How he was; <hi>Optimé,</hi> reply'd
<hi>Vanel,</hi> for they us'd to diſcourſe in <hi>Latin.</hi> Then the
Ambaſſador enquir'd, who put him in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>I did,</hi> anſwer'd he: What mov'd you to
ſuch an act, reply'd the Ambaſſador; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaid
he, <hi>I was weary of Life.</hi> Afterwards the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
ask'd him ſeveral Queſtions concerning the place
of his Birth, and his deſign in coming hither, but
cou'd not obtain any ſatisfactory Anſwer; and
(which is hardly credible) he endur'd the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely
cruel Torments they cou'd invent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making the leaſt diſcovery, and even was ſo
little daunted, that while he lay under the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the Torture, <hi>'Tis in vain,</hi> ſaid he to the
Ambaſſador, <hi>to torment me thus, you ſhall never know
more than I have already told you.</hi> In ſhort, he gave
ſo many Marks of an invincible Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
that I cou'd hardly forbear comparing
him to <hi>Socrates,</hi> or <hi>Minutius Scaevola,</hi> if I had not a
natural reluctancy to praiſe Men of his Profeſſion.
Thus he died of his Wounds, and left no Papers of
conſequence, that cou'd diſcover his Intrigue: But
the Ambaſſador and his Men ſeiz'd on ten or
twelve good Horſes, and above 25000 Livres in
Gold that were found in his Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>

I ſhall conclude this Letter with telling you, that
I'm reſolv'd to depart with the firſt fair Wind for
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> in a Veſſel belonging to <hi>Ciotad,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

ſtand in need of all his Experience to bring us
ſafe to our deſign'd Harbour; for this is the moſt

to the <hi>Bad</hi> Weather we met with about eight days

Iſland of <hi>Scio,</hi> where we ſtill continue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks,</hi> and in general all the Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
enjoy ſo many Priviledges, and retain
ſo many Marks of their ancient Liberty, that if I
did not ſometimes ſee a <hi>Turbant,</hi> I ſhou'd almoſt
forget that I am ſtill in <hi>Turkey.</hi> The whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of the Iſland does not amount to 100 Miles;
yet there are above 200 Churches in it, and at
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51983:113"/>
leaſt 30 Monaſteries belonging to the <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latin</hi> Chriſtians, who perform their ſeveral Rites
without the leaſt diſturbance. They are ſuffer'd
to walk in Proceſſion about the Streets, as in <hi>France;</hi>
tho' there is nothing more odious to the <hi>Turks</hi> than
that Ceremony: And which is ſtill more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who, in all other parts of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire are reputed Slaves, live here under the
Protection of a Magiſtrate, who has the Title of
<hi>Conſul.</hi> This Happineſs, which ought to be ſo
much the dearer to the <hi>Greeks</hi> of this Iſland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis peculiar to themſelves, is only a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Favours beſtow'd on 'em by <hi>Mahomet</hi> II.
when he made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Greece.</hi> For the
<hi>Sciots</hi> perceiving that 'twou'd be in vain to reſiſt
an Enemy who had lately taken <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> from
the <hi>Palaeologi,</hi> and was ſtill Victorious in all his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
reſolv'd to mitigate his Fury by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
ſubmiſſion, and own'd themſelves his Subjects,
perhaps before he thought of Attaking 'em. <hi>Mahomet</hi>
was ſo well ſatisfi'd with this Mark of their Affection,
that he granted 'em ſeveral advantageous Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
which they ſtill enjoy. For the <hi>Turks</hi> are
very Religious obſervers of their Promiſes to their
own Subjects; tho' they ſcruple not to violate
Treaties concluded with Neighbouring Princes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Heretical Mahometans,</hi> ſuch
as the <hi>Perſians,</hi> of whom the <hi>Turks</hi> have almoſt as
bad an Opinion as the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> have of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants;</hi>
becauſe the <hi>Perſians</hi> embrace the Doctrine
of one <hi>Haly,</hi> who pretended to reform the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi>
Religion, as <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> have Reform'd
the <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that time the Iſland was poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiniani,</hi>
with the Title of a <hi>Principality,</hi> under the
Protection of the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> who were then Maſters
of many fine Countries in <hi>Natolia,</hi> as it appears
by the Eſcutcheons and Arms of the Republic,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51983:113"/>
which are ſtill to be ſeen almoſt at every end of a
Field.</p>
               <p>There is but one City in the Iſland, and that
a very ſmall one, tho' it has eight Gates. The
Streets are broad enough for Coaches; and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the old Houſes is a ſign of the richneſs and
ſplendor of their ancient Poſſeſſors. The Caſtle
is not much leſs than the City, and Commands
both that and the Port: Yet ſome Years ago the
Marquis <hi>Du Queſne</hi> had the Courage to attack ſome
Pirates who retir<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d under its Walls, and fir'd above
fifty Broad-ſides into the City, becauſe the Baſſa
made a ſhew of reſiſting him. This attempt caus'd
ſo great a Conſternation among the Inhabitants,
that their fears continue even after the Marquiſs's
Death, and they ſtill tremble when they hear his
Name mention'd. The <hi>French</hi> are very proud of
this Expedition, tho' 'tis certain they have no great
reaſon to boaſt of it, ſince it coſt the Nation
100000 Crowns, which <hi>Fabre,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Agent,
pay'd to the <hi>Grand Viſier.</hi> This was, in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a ſufficient reparation to the <hi>Turks;</hi> and there
was no Honour got by ſo vigorous an Action, but
that which is due to the Memory of the brave Man
that perform'd it.</p>
               <p>'Tis equally difficult to enter the Port, and to
get out of it, as our Captain has found to his coſt:
For the charge of maintaining the Ships Company
amounts at leaſt to 60 <hi>Livres</hi> a day, and I believe
he wou'd willingly give 30 <hi>Louis d' Ors</hi> to be at
Sea again.</p>
               <p>The Government of <hi>Scio</hi> is a very conſiderable
Poſt, and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> is oftentimes advanc'd to the
Dignity of <hi>Grand Viſier.</hi> 'Tis not above a Year
ſince <hi>Kopergli Oglou</hi> was remov'd from this place, and
made <hi>Viſier</hi> after the Death of <hi>Iſmael.</hi> He has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him a <hi>Kiaia,</hi> a <hi>Kady,</hi> a <hi>Vaivoide,</hi> and a <hi>Receiver
of Cuſtoms,</hi> as all other Baſſa's have. The Laſt of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51983:114"/>
theſe Officers has more Employment here than in
moſt other places, by reaſon of the <hi>Maſtic</hi> that
grows in this Iſland, better and more plentiful than
in any other part of the World. There are above
a Thouſand Cheſts of it gather'd every Year, each
of which contains Three Hundred Weight, and
the total Value amounts to above 200000 Crowns.
But the Inhabitants are not much enrich'd by ſo
conſiderable a Trade: For they are not only oblig'd
to pay one half of the <hi>Maſtic</hi> by way of Tribute,
but muſt ſell the reſt at a very low rate to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
of Cuſtoms. 'Tis a white odoriferous
Gumm, that runs in the Spring out of little holes
which are made in the Bark of a ſmall, weak, and
twining Shrub that creeps along the Ground, as
<hi>Vines</hi> wou'd do if they were not ſupported.</p>
               <p>I have not hitherto had occaſion to ſee any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Church in this Iſland, but that which is
call'd <hi>Niaomai:</hi> 'Tis a very ancient Building, and
adorn'd with a piece of <hi>Moſaic</hi> Work, like that of
<hi>Sancta Sophia.</hi> I will not trouble you with the Story
of its <hi>Miraculous Image,</hi> ſince all theſe Legends are
only the ſame Tale, repeated with ſome ſmall alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
The <hi>Greeks</hi> believe and maintain theſe
Impoſtures with a great deal of Zeal; and even the
<hi>Turks</hi> who abhorr the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> worſe than
<hi>Magic,</hi> are ſometimes cheated by 'em: For when
they hear that one of the Saints cures ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
they procure Maſſes to be ſaid, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Candles with as much Devotion as the moſt Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
<hi>Greek.</hi> I ſhall take this occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
an accident that happen'd not long ago in this
place; and perhaps you will not think your time
ill imploy'd in reading ſo odd and diverting a
Story. You have doubtleſs heard of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of
<hi>Padua,</hi> who is the <hi>Padrone Singularo</hi> of all the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>
and has acquir'd ſo great a Reputation of
working Miracles, that tho' he was a declar'd
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51983:114"/>
                  <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and more than that, a Monk of the Order
of St. <hi>Francis;</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> have plac'd him among
their <hi>Tutelar Saints,</hi> and ſing <hi>Kyrie Eleiſon's</hi> to him
with as much Devotion as to St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> himſelf.
He has a Magnificent Chapel in this place, and in
it a Wooden Image, which is very well painted,
gilt, and crown'd, and wants neither <hi>He</hi> nor <hi>She</hi> Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in abundance. His Miracles are the only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the common Talk. Some own themſelves
oblig'd to him for Husbands, and others for Wives;
ſometimes he heals a broken Leg, and ſaves others
from Ship-wrack; and, in a word, I know not
one Perſon here who has not receiv'd ſome Marks
of his Favour. 'Tis true, he's apt to grow ſullen,
and woe be to the poor Suppliants when little
<hi>St. Anthony</hi> takes the pet, for he'll e'en let 'em cry
their Eyes out, without deigning to take notice of
'em: However, there is no Diſeaſe without its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
and a few ſmart Laſhes about the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
uſually cures him of the <hi>Spleen.</hi> But when the
Diſtemper is very ſtubborn, and the Doſe of the
<hi>Whip</hi> proves ineffectual, they either turn him out of
his Lodging, and make him lie abroad in the Wind
and Rain, or dip him ten or twelve times in Water,
with a great Stone at his Neck, which always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
the deſir'd effect, and makes the little Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
as Complaiſant as they can wiſh. One of the
<hi>Turks</hi> in the Caſtle, who had ventur'd all his Stock
on Board a <hi>Saique,</hi> and was afraid of loſing it either
by Storm or Piracy, reſolv'd to ſteal <hi>St. Anthony,</hi> of
whom he had heard ſo many Wonders, and either
by fair or foul means to make him preſerve his
Goods. He waited ſome time for a convenient
opportunity to put his deſign in execution; and
one day perceiving that there were none in the
Church but himſelf, he hid the miraculous Image
under his Veſt, and carri'd it away undiſcover'd.
As ſoon as he came home he ſet it in the moſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51983:115"/>
honourable Place of his Houſe, adorn'd it with
Flowers, and kept two Wax Candles perpetually
burning before it; addreffing himſelf to it every
day with a great deal of Reverence, and humbly
acquainting it that his whole Eſtate was on board
the Saique; and that the Loſs of that wou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ruine him and his Family. Thus he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
as long as he might reaſonably hope that the
Saique was ſafe; but when the time was expir'd,
in which he expected to hear of its Return, he
took away the Flowers and Candles, and began to
treat the Image very roughly, beating it every day,
and threatning a worſe Uſage, if he ſhou'd find
that it had neglected his Saique. <hi>Thou infamous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>think'ſt thou to mock a</hi> Muſulman,
<hi>whoſe Slave thou art not worthy to be? By</hi> Mahomet,
<hi>if thou doſt not reſtore my</hi> Saique, <hi>I'll beat thee to
Pieces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time both the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romaniſts</hi>
were extremely griev'd for the Loſs of their Saint:
and their Conſternation was the greater, becauſe
they cou'd not imagine him to be ſtoll'n away, ſince
he was only made of Wood. The <hi>Cordeliers</hi> had
not the leaſt Share in the common Affliction; but
ſince they have an admirable Faculty of improving
every thing to the beſt Advantage, they declar'd
publickly that the Saint was not able longer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the Coldneſs of the Peoples Devotion, and had
therefore withdrawn his Preſence from among 'em.
And even an old Father dream'd that S. <hi>Anthony</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to him, and ſaid, <hi>My Son, I have left this
City, becauſe I was no longer able to be a Witneſs of
the Crimes that are daily committed in it, and the Want
of Love to God, and Zeal to his Service.</hi> The good
Man related his Dream to the People, and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
'em to recall the Saint by Prayers, Vows, and
above all, by a great number of <hi>Maſſes.</hi> At laſt the
<hi>Turk</hi> heard of the ſafe Arrival of the <hi>Saique</hi> with
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51983:115"/>
his Goods, ſo that thinking himſelf oblig'd in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to releaſe the Saint out of his Priſon, he
carry'd him back with a great deal of Honour, and
told the whole Story. The Image was very joyfully
receiv'd by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who look'd upon this as
a New Miracle; which re-kindl'd their Devotion
to ſuch a Degree, that it can never be more ardent
than 'tis at preſent: the <hi>Turk</hi> alſo gave 100 <hi>Piaſters,</hi>
as an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Acknowledgment of the Favour he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
and the Fathers order'd the Money to be
caſt into a ſilver Chain, with which they faſten'd
the Image, to prevent its being ſtoll'n hereafter:
for they conſider'd that People are always apt to
follow a bad Example, and that they might perhaps
miſs their Saint when they ſhou'd have moſt need of
him.</p>
               <p>This Accident has convinc'd me of a Truth I
cou'd never believe before, I mean that Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may bear ſuch an abſolute Sway in the Minds
of thoſe who are under its Power, that even <hi>Turks</hi>
and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> may join together in ſome Rites of
Devotion. I confeſs I was ſo far from giving Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to Relations of this Nature, that I could hardly
believe my own Eyes on a like Occaſion at <hi>Lampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſa,</hi>
where we touch'd in our Voyage to <hi>Malta.</hi>
But ſince I am now of another Opinion, I ſhall take
this Occaſion to acquaint you with an Obſervation
I made there, which I durſt not mention ſo long as I
thought it impoſſible.</p>
               <p>There is in that Iſland a little Chapel dedicated to
the <hi>Virgin,</hi> in which there is an Altar, and a Coffin
with a <hi>Turbant</hi> laid upon it, which is uſually call'd
<hi>Mahomet's Tomb.</hi> Both <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have ſo
great a Veneration for this Chapel, that they never
paſs it by without leaving Money, Victuals, or ſome
other Offering. At our Arrival we found two large
and freſh <hi>Paſtaiques,</hi> a <hi>Sequin</hi> of Gold, ſome ſilver
<hi>Aſpers,</hi> and ſmall Coin of <hi>Malta,</hi> to which our
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51983:116"/>
Captain added a <hi>French</hi> Piece of <hi>Three-pence half-peny.</hi>
Our Pilot told me that theſe Offerings were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for the Relief of poor Slaves, who oftentimes
eſcap'd thither from <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Afric;</hi> adding that
the Place was ſo Sacred and Miraculous that none
but Slaves durſt take any of theſe things from the
Altar; or, if they did, that they could not poſſibly
get out of the Iſland. He related alſo ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of theſe Miracles, but all his Arguments and
Stories could not hinder me from eating one of the
<hi>Paſtaiques;</hi> for the Weather was very hot, and you
know that thoſe who are not accuſtom'd to the Sea
are uſually very deſirous of Fruit. To return to
<hi>Scio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I went t'other day to ſee a Place call'd the
<hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> tho' according to all probability
there were never any Schools in it. I incline rather
to believe that 'twas formerly a Place where Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were offer'd to the God <hi>Pan,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
Deity: for I ſaw nothing but a ſquare Altar cut
out of a Rock, on the Shore, with ſome decay'd
<hi>Baſſo-Relievo's</hi> on the Sides, among which you may
diſtinguiſh the Repreſentation of an <hi>Oxe, Wolf, Sbeep,</hi>
and <hi>Rabbet,</hi> beſides ſome other Beaſts which are leſs
diſtinct. Not far from thence I ſaw a paltry Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
where they aſſur'd me <hi>Homer</hi> was born: but
<hi>Smyrna</hi> pretends a better Title to the Honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Birth-place of that great Man.</p>
               <p>I obſerv'd nothing elſe remarkable in this Iſland,
except their Manner of Living, which is extremely
free: for they give and receive Viſits, make Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
and the Women ſit at the Doors of the
Houſes, and walk with Young Men to the Fields,
with as much Liberty as if they were in <hi>France.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
they are of a very ſociable Humour, and any
<hi>Frenchman,</hi> who is Maſter of a tolerable Stock of
Wit, may quickly find a Miſtreſs, and even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
an advantageous Match in this Place. For
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51983:116"/>
'tis the higheſt Ambition of the Women of this
Iſland to marry a <hi>Frank;</hi> both becauſe they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
of a freer Temper than the Men of the
Country, and are not ſubject to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
nor conſequently pay any Avanies, Taxes, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts;
which are two very conſiderable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
               <p>This is the only Iſland in the <hi>Levant,</hi> where the
Cuſtom of wearing <hi>long Garments</hi> does not prevail:
for the <hi>Sciots</hi> retain'd the Faſhion us'd by the <hi>Franks,</hi>
after their Subjection to the <hi>Turks.</hi> They ſtill uſe
Doublets or Waſt-coats, Breeches, and Shooes; and
beſides they wear their Hair long: but we have
chang'd ſo many Faſhions ſince that time, that they
who have ſtill kept that which was then in uſe
appear very ridiculous at preſent. Their Hats have
broad Brims, not cock'd up, and tapering Crowns,
ſomewhat reſembling a Sugar-Loaf: the Sleeves of
their Doublets are wide and open, but cloſe at the
Wriſt: their Breeches are open below, edg'd with
Ribbons, and their Drawers appear under 'em: their
Shooes have large open Ears, and are ſharp-pointed
at the Toe, as they were uſually made in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
about Twenty Years ago. The Womens Habit
is not different from that which is us'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People in <hi>Bretagne, Maine, Normandy,</hi> and
ſome other Parts of <hi>France.</hi> For they wear a kind
of ſhort Caſſock, faſten'd with a Lace before, and
over that another of Silk Stuff, of which there is a
great deal made in the Iſland. This Caſſock, which
the Maids of my Country wou'd call a Waſte-coat,
reaches not below the Middle of the Thigh, and
the Sleeves which are not very long, are tied up a
little below the Bending of the Arm, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of wearing Silken Gloves, which are alſo
made in <hi>Scio,</hi> and are not unhandſome. Beſides
they have a kind of Petty-Coat, in which there
are (I believe) thirty Ells of Stuff, for 'tis pleited
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51983:117"/>
quite round, except on the Fore-part, and theſe
Foldings are all of an equal Depth, and ſew'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
this Petty-coat is ſo ſhort, that it hides not
above one half of their Legs: and they are always
very careful to wear fine and tight Stockins, leſt
that which appears ſhou'd give a Man an ill Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of what is conceal'd. In their Head-Dreſs
they differ both from the <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>Levantines;</hi> for
it conſiſts only in a Piece of Cloth wrapp'd about
their Heads.</p>
               <p>There are in this Iſland ſeveral Families that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to <hi>Nobility,</hi> and even ſome that draw their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree
from the <hi>Juſtiniani;</hi> but their Education,
and Way of Living, is ſo unſuitable to their
high Birth, that 'twou'd ſeem altogether incredible,
if it were not atteſted by all the Inhabitants of the
Iſland.</p>

               <p>WE ſet ſaid from <hi>Scio</hi> on the 20<hi>th.</hi> of the laſt
Month, and two Days after were in the
Height of <hi>Stanchio,</hi> a little Iſland, famous for the
Birth of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and the celebrated <hi>Apelles;</hi> and
for a Tree of ſuch prodigious Bigneſs, that its Shadow
is large enough to cover 150 Men. I cannot give
you a more particular Account of that Iſland, ſince
we ſtopt not there, but kept on our Courſe till we
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51983:117"/>
arriv'd at <hi>Rhodes</hi> on <hi>Chriſtmaſs-Day:</hi> Inſtead of a
large Deſcription of this Iſland, you muſt content
your ſelf with an Account of what Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I could make in the narrow ſpace of half a
Day.</p>
               <p>The Iſland of <hi>Rhodes</hi> is a hundred Miles in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs:
'Twas taken from the <hi>Saracens</hi> by the <hi>Knights</hi>
of <hi>S. John of Jeruſalem,</hi> on the Day of the <hi>Virgin's
Aſſumption, Ann.</hi> 1309. and retaken by <hi>Solyman</hi> II.
Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> in the Year 1522. by the
Treachery of <hi>Andrew d' Amaral,</hi> one of the <hi>Knights,</hi>
and <hi>Chancellour</hi> of the Order; who aſpiring to the
Dignity of the <hi>Great Maſter;</hi> and being diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of his Hopes to attain it, by the Election of
<hi>Monſieur de Villiers l' Ile Adam</hi> to that Office, was
ſo enrag'd, that he ſhot an Arrow into the Enemy's
Camp, with a Letter diſcovering the only Place
where the Town cou'd be ſucceſsfully attack'd.</p>
               <p>The City is little, but extremely ſtrong, both by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of its Situation on a Rock, and the great number
of Baſtions and Towers that command one another
very advantageouſly. The <hi>Great Maſters</hi> Houſe, and
the Inns of the <hi>Seven Languages</hi> remain ſtill entire,
and the ſame may be ſaid of the Church of S. <hi>John,</hi>
tho' the <hi>Turks</hi> have turn'd it into a Moſquee, for
they have not ſo much as defac'd the Images of
our <hi>Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Virgin,</hi> repreſented over the
Door in <hi>Baſs-Relief.</hi> Tho' I had not known that
this Iſland belong'd formerly to the <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
I ſhou'd have eaſily diſcover'd it by the great
number of Inſcriptions, and Scutcheons of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that are over the Gate of the City, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every where elſe. And beſides there are ſo
many other ancient Monuments of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that I never ſaw ſo vaſt a number of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
in ſo ſmall a Spot of Ground.</p>
               <p>'Tis related in the Hiſtory of the Order, that this
Iſland was formerly infeſted by a horrible Dragon,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51983:118"/>
above thirty Foot long, who abode in a Cave not
far from the City, and made ſuch a dreadful Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
all around, that there was no Safety in the
Country. The Story adds, that his very Breath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
all the Neighbourhood of his Cave, and that
his Skin was ſo hard, that no Arrow cou'd pierce
it, but that he was kill'd at laſt by a <hi>Knight</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi>
call'd <hi>Dedoat de Goſon.</hi> I always ſuſpected the
Credit of this Relation, but mine Eyes have now
convinc'd me of the Truth of it: for the Monſter's
Head is on one of the Gates of the City towards
the Land, and I had time to take a full View of it.
I cannot repreſent it better than by comparing it to
the Head of a Hog; only 'tis longer and bigger,
and hath no Ears; the Jaws are very large, and
arm'd with long and ſharp Teeth.</p>
               <p>Since I am not over-fond of believing any thing
that ſeems ſtrange and unaccountable, I muſt beg
leave to perſiſt in my Incredulity, concerning the
Famous <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> which was formerly the Glory and
Ornament of this Iſland.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, <hi>Strabo, Pliny,</hi> and ſeveral other Grave
Writers, ſeem to believe this Story: but Authors as
well as other Men, take Pleaſure in relating Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
This was the uſual Cuſtom of the Ancients,
eſpecially <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who have ſtuff'd their
Writings with ſuch lofty Fables, as the Reader may
eaſily perceive by a tranſient View of their Works.
And beſides when an Author of any conſiderable
Reputation in the Learned World relates a Matter
of Fact, 'tis always confirm'd by the Teſtimony of
thoſe who follow him. Nevertheleſs in this Caſe,
the Opinions of Authors are very different; for
<hi>Chares</hi> according to ſome, erected the <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
others aſcribe that Honour to <hi>Lacches:</hi> ſome with
<hi>Strabo</hi> relate, that 'twas <hi>ſeventy Cubits</hi> high; and
others affirm that its Height amounted to <hi>Eighty;</hi>
ſo that the Story is at the beſt doubtful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51983:118"/>
But to examine the Matter more narrowly,
the largeſt Computation of the Heighth of the <hi>Coloſſus</hi>
will hardly amount to what is requir'd by the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the Story: for the Breadth of the Port of
<hi>Rhodes,</hi> between the oppoſite Shores, where the Feet of
the <hi>Coloſſus</hi> are ſaid to have been fix'd, amounts to 324
meaſur'd Feet, ſo that the whole Figure muſt have
been 500 Foot high. And beſides how is it poſſible
to conceive that a Maſs of ſuch a Prodigious Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
cou'd be caſt. I know ſome pretend that
'twas built by Pieces, and that it conſiſted only of
Stone lin'd with Braſs; but this Opinion as well as
the other is clogg'd with unſurmountable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as 'twill appear from the following Reflexions.</p>
               <p>The talleſt of the <hi>Egyptian Pyramids,</hi> which are
juſtly reckon'd among the <hi>Wonders of the World,</hi> cou'd
not be rais'd above 520 Foot high; and the Tower
of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> which has not (and perhaps never
had) its equal in the World, does not exceed 560 Feet.
Now theſe admirable Buildings have ſufficient Baſes
or Foundations, to ſupport the Weight of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure;
whereas this enormous Figure muſt
have been four times bigger above than below,
without reck'ning the Arms that hung down, or
at leaſt one of 'em which carry'd a Lanthorn, and
(if the Story be true) could not be made but by
the <hi>Architects</hi> whom <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſent to King <hi>Nectanebus.</hi>
I will not inſiſt upon the equal poiſing of ſo great
a Maſs, which was both abſolutely neceſſary, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
difficult in this Caſe; but ſhall proceed to
more obvious Reaſons. 'Tis ſaid that after this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſus</hi>
was overthrown by an Earthquake, it remain'd
where it fell till the Year 656, or according to
others 952, which is a new Controverſie; and that
the <hi>Saracens</hi> broke it to pieces, and ſold the Braſs to
a <hi>Jew,</hi> who carry'd it to <hi>Antioch.</hi> And here we
meet with another Variation in the Relations of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
for tho' moſt are agreed that 900 Camels
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51983:119"/>
were loaded with the Braſs, there are ſome that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Number to 800, but neither of theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
is well grounded.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, I wou'd gladly be inform'd where the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſus</hi>
fell; and they who maintain the Truth of this
Story, will perhaps find this to be a more puzzling
Queſtion than they imagine. For conſidering the
Situation of its Legs, they cannot pretend that it
fell towards the Land, and conſequently they muſt
acknowledge that it tumbl'd into the Sea, where it
cou'd not lie without ſtopping the Mouth of the
Harbour; nor cou'd that be done without ruining
the Trade of the City, on which all its Riches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.
But theſe neceſſary Conſequences of this
Suppoſition, are directly contradicted by Hiſtory,
which aſſures us, that <hi>Rhodes</hi> was a very flouriſhing
City, and that its Port was as good and as much
frequented, as ever, at the Arrival of the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not the only Abſurdity that deſtroys
the Credit of the Story. Tis well known that a
Camel's Burthen never exceeds five or ſix hundred
Weight, eſpecially when the Journey is conſiderably
long: and how then cou'd 900 of thoſe Animals
carry away ſo prodigious a Quantity of Braſs. For
you will find by Calculation, that every Foot in
the Heighth of the <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> (reckoning 'em one
with another) weigh'd above 3000 Pounds; ſince
'tis computed that a ſquare Foot of that Metal,
containing an Inch in Thickneſs, weighs above fifty
Pounds. Now 'tis plain, that the very encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ody of the <hi>Coloſſus</hi> wou'd require much
more than ſixty ſuch Pieces, which according to the
above-mention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Computation, amount to 1500
Pounds, without reckoning the Overplus; and by
the ſame Proportion you may gueſs at the
Quantity of Braſs that wou'd have been neceſſary
for lining the whole Figure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:51983:119"/>
This <hi>Coloſſus</hi> puts me in mind of the extravagant
Propoſal made to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great by an Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
call'd <hi>Dinocrates,</hi> who undertook to build a City
on Mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> and to cut it into the Shape of a
Man, with a Cup in his Hand diſgorging a River.
Cou'd ever a more ridiculous <hi>Chimaera</hi> enter into a
diſtemper'd Brain? But the Ancients cou'd eaſily
ſwallow the greateſt Abſurdity, and there are ſtill
too many profeſs'd Adorers of thoſe fabulous Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who defend all their Lies and Miſtakes with a
ſtupid Obſtinacy. As for my part, I confeſs my
Faith is ſo weak on ſuch Occaſions, that I cannot
forbear ſuſpecting the Truth of the Story of the
<hi>Rhodian Coloſſus.</hi> At leaſt ſince I have ſo much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
to the Authors that atteſt it, as to keep
my ſelf from denying it abſolutely; I hope they
will give me leave to think that 'twas ſomewhat
ſmaller, leſs wonderful, and ſituated in another
Place, than they imagine: for a much leſs incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Bulk will ſuffice, if we ſuppoſe that 'twas
plac'd at the Mouth of the Harbour for Galleys.
However I dare not venture to aſſure you that I have
ſeen the Place where the <hi>Coloſſus</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> ſtood,
but only where 'tis believ'd it ſtood: for thus I ſhall
be ſure to keep cloſe to the Truth, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
made the Standard of my Relations.</p>
               <p>We ſtay'd part of a Day at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and ſet Sail
the ſame Night with a fair Wind; but a ſudden
Change of Weather oblig'd us to ſtand in to the
Road of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprus</hi> is an Iſland almoſt of the ſame Bigneſs
with <hi>Rhodes.</hi> The Air is ſo ſweet, clear, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
that the Weather is perpetually fair; at leaſt
I can aſſure you, that during the little time we
ſpent in it, I cou'd not perceive the leaſt Sign of
Winter. It produces great Abundance of Sugar,
Cotton, and delicious Wine: beſides 'tis the beſt
Country in the World for Hunting, and Proviſions
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51983:120"/>
are ſo incredibly cheap, that, as the <hi>French Conſul</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
me, the greateſt Lover of his Belly cannot
ſpend Forty Piaſters a Year in Eating and Drinking.
The Town is neither large nor neat, inhabited by a
Medley of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as all other Places
under the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Dominion. I ſaw a Man
in it that had four Arms, two on each Side, one
above the other, but he cou'd only uſe the lower.
The 27<hi>th.</hi> in the Morning we ſet Sail, and arriv'd at
<hi>Alexandria</hi> on the 8<hi>th.</hi> inſtant towards Noon.</p>
               <p>The Land lies ſo extremely low, that tho' the
Sun ſhone very bright, we cou'd not diſcover the
Coaſt, till we were very near it. At the ſame time
we perceiv'd a Saique making towards us, with a
Pilot and four Officers of the Cuſtom-Houſe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
moſt of us wou'd have willingly diſpens'd with
the laſt of our Viſitants; but we ſtood very much
in need of the Pilot's Help, for both the Road and
Harbour are extremely dangerous, by reaſon of the
lurking Rocks that can hardly be avoided without
the Aſſiſtance of a Seaman of the Country. At
laſt having caſt Anchor very happily, I went a-ſhore
in the Saique. As I paſs'd by the Cuſtom-Houſe,
I was ſomewhat ſurpriz'd at the unuſual Exactneſs
of the Officers; for they ſearch'd me all over, and
even thruſt their Hands into my Breeches, to know
whether I had brought any Gold or Silver, which
pay a conſiderable Impoſt to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call'd <hi>Gold-Duty.</hi> But I was much more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at Night, when they came to ſhut us up like
ſo many Priſoners, as they do every Night in the
Week, and on <hi>Fridays</hi> at Noon; by reaſon of a
fooliſh Prophecy, that foretells the Conqueſt of the
City by the <hi>Franks.</hi> For ſince 'twou'd be very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
to ſhut as many Doors as there are
<hi>Franks</hi> in the Town, all thoſe who bear that Name
are oblig'd to lodge in certain ſpacious <hi>Hans,</hi> call'd
<hi>Fondies,</hi> which having but one Gate or Door, are
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51983:120"/>
quickly ſecur'd. The <hi>French, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
have each a diſtinct <hi>Han,</hi> where they live, without
medling in the leaſt with one another's buſineſs,
either in Peace or War. The Merchants who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
here are for the moſt part only Factors to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the Commiſſions of their Correſpondents in
<hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> Nor can this City be reckon'd as a
place of Commerce, unleſs by the bye, for no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<hi>Caravans</hi> come hither, and <hi>Aleppo</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
the Seat of Trade, and Reſidence of the
Conſuls.</p>
               <p>The famous City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> admir'd in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages for its Extent and Beauty, is now a
wretched heap of Cottages, that ſeem to have been
built on purpoſe to inſult over the deplorable fate
of the Ruins on which they are founded. There
cannot be a more lively Inſtance of the frailty of
human Grandeur, than thoſe rich Fragments of
<hi>Marble, Porphyry,</hi> and <hi>Granite,</hi> that are every where
to be ſeen mixt with Earth, Wood, and Stone.
The whole City is as it were buri'd under the Ruines
of overturn'd Palaces; and 'tis impoſſible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
that magnificent Rubbiſh, without reflecting
with a certain Melancholic Pleaſure on the ancient
Splendor of theſe celebrated Structures. But ſince
I have reaſon to believe that ſuch general Remarks
wou'd not ſatisfie your Curioſity, I ſhall proceed to
give you a more particular account of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Remains of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It appears by the Walls (which are not ſo rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
as the Houſes) that the compaſs of the City
amounted to Ten Miles: But they are infinitely
more remarkable for their Beauty and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
than for the largeneſs of their Extent.
They are 20 Foot thick throughout, and join'd
with a certain Cement as hard as Stone: From
ſpace to ſpace they are flank'd with great ſquare
Towers, which are ſo ſtrong and maſſive that they
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51983:121"/>
appear like ſo many Caſtles; and within each
Tower there are Ciſterns, Halls, and a ſufficient
number of Chambers to lodge at leaſt 100 Men.
But, which is ſtill more convenient and uſeful,
there are Caſemates under the Walls round the
whole City, in which, together with the Towers,
there was room enough to lodge 50000 Men, who
were always ready either to appear in Arms on the
Walls in caſe of neceſſity, or to march upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to any place in the City. The Walls are alſo
ſurrounded with good Falſe-brays, which are ſtill
entire; and if you add to theſe a broad, deep, and
well-lin'd Ditch, I think there cou'd not be more
deſir'd in that Age, for the ſecurity and defence of
any City.</p>
               <p>Among all the ruinous Beauties of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
there is none more remarkable than <hi>Caeſar's Palace.</hi>
'Twas certainly a very large Building, and if I may
be allow'd to judge of the reſt by the Front which
remains ſtill entire, I may venture to aſſure you that
'twas a noble and compleat Work. I obſerv'd alſo
ſeveral Columns of <hi>Pophyry</hi> and ſpotted <hi>Green Marble,</hi>
which heighten'd the Idea I had already conceiv'd
of its Magnificence. Near theſe ſtately Ruines
there are others equal to 'em in all reſpects, and no
leſs rich in <hi>Porphyry</hi> and <hi>Granite,</hi> which are ſaid to
be Fragments of the Ancient Palace of the <hi>Ptolomies:</hi>
Beſides a great number of others as admirable as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the former. But 'tis ſo long ſince the City
was demoliſh'd, and the confuſion is ſo great at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that 'tis impoſſible for the moſt curious Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary
to diſtinguiſh the Foundations of ſo many
Palaces and Temples. The only entire pieces that
have eſcap'd the common Fate of the reſt, are the
<hi>Column of Pompey,</hi> and four <hi>Obelisks</hi> of <hi>Granite.</hi>
'Tis ſaid the firſt was erected by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of <hi>Pompey:</hi> Some think 'tis a kind of <hi>Marble,</hi>
but others incline rather to believe that 'twas built
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51983:121"/>
of <hi>melted Stone,</hi> caſt in Moulds upon the place.
The latter Opinion ſeems moſt probable, for there
is not the leaſt piece of that Stone to be found in
any part of the World, and the Pillar is ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
big and high, that it cou'd hardly be erected
without a Miracle. I know 'tis alledg'd by thoſe
who believe the Story of the <hi>Rhodian Coloſſus,</hi> that
the Ancients had the advantage of admirable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines
to raiſe ſuch bulky Pieces: But I ſhou'd
reckon my ſelf extreamly oblig'd to theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
if they wou'd ſhow me any probable reaſon
why among ſo great a variety of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Antiquity there is not one of <hi>Marble,</hi>
and by what an accountable accident the Stone
call'd <hi>Granite,</hi> which was then ſo common, is now
grown ſo ſcarce, that the moſt curious Inquirers
into the Works of Nature cannot find the leaſt
Fragment of it; that was not employ'd in ancient
Structures. And even tho' I ſhou'd ſuppoſe with
my Adverſaries, that the Quarries out of which this
Stone was dug were by degrees ſo entirely exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
that there is not the leaſt Footſtep of 'em
left; and that Nature her ſelf has loſt ſo much of
ancient Vigour and Fecundity, that ſhe is not able
to produce new ones: I may ſtill be allow'd to ask
why <hi>Granite</hi> was only us'd in Obelisks or Columns
of a prodigious bigneſs: For if it were really a ſort
of Stone or <hi>Marble,</hi> I ſee no reaſon why we might
not find ſmall pieces of it, as well as of <hi>Porphyry,</hi>
and other precious kinds of <hi>Marble.</hi> Theſe reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in my Opinion, may ſerve to confirm the
Hypotheſis of thoſe who believe that all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Monuments were actually caſt in a Mould:
And if they wou'd take the pains to view this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
attentively, they wou'd ſoon be convinc'd by
the teſtimony of their own Eyes, that 'tis only a
kind of Cement, compos'd of Sand and calcin'd
Stone, not unlike to Mortar or Lime, which grew
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51983:122"/>
hard by degrees. I will not pretend to determine
by what Artifice thoſe ancient Workmen kept the
Cement from yielding or ſliding till the Pillar was
compleated; tho' perhaps it might be probably
alledg'd, that they made a Mould of Stone or
Wood, beſmear'd on the Inſide with ſome fat or
unctuous Subſtance, to hinder the Matter from
ſticking to its cover; and that after the Work was
finiſh'd, and the Column almoſt dry, they broke
the Mould that preſerv'd the regularity of its Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
and kept it from falling.</p>
               <p>This Column is 80 Foot high, and 24 in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs:
'Tis plac'd on a Marble Pedeſtal eight Foot
ſquare, and crown'd at the top with a Chapiter of
the ſame <hi>Granite,</hi> of which the Pillar conſiſts. I
know not what Opinion you may have of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Engines, but for my part I muſt confeſs,
whether I conſider the weight or bulk of ſo vaſt a
Maſs, I find it equally impoſſible to conceive that
it cou'd be rais'd by the ſtrongeſt and beſt contriv'd
Machines that ever were Invented. The four <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisks</hi>
are alſo of <hi>Granite,</hi> and adorn'd with Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphic
Figures in <hi>Relief,</hi> like that at <hi>Rome:</hi> Some
of 'em are ſtanding, and the reſt fall'n.</p>
               <p>I cannot comprehend the reaſon that mov'd the
Founders of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to chuſe ſuch an uninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Country for the Seat of ſo ſtately a City.
The Heat is ſo inſupportable in the Summer that it
makes all the Inhabitants as Tawny as they can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be, without being quite Black. And, which
is ſtill more incommodious, they have no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to qualifie the ſcorching Heat of the Climate:
For the only Springs in <hi>Egypt</hi> are two that are at <hi>Cairo,</hi>
of which I may perhaps give you an account, after
I have ſeen 'em. To ſupply, in ſome meaſure, theſe
natural defects, the Natives have contriv'd ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous
Buildings, which are no leſs admirable than
the Palaces that formerly adorn'd <hi>Alexandria.</hi> For
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51983:122"/>
there are vaſt Ciſterns under Ground, Vaulted and
under-prop'd with ſtrong <hi>Marble</hi>-Pillars that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the weight of the Houſes, and of the City,
which is wholly built on theſe Caves. All the
Ciſterns are border'd with Streets, as if they were
Houſes, ſo that they ſeem to form a ſubterraneous
City.</p>
               <p>This puts me in mind of the <hi>Roman Catacombs,</hi>
tho' they are much inferiour in beauty to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrian</hi>
Ciſterns: For the former are narrow, low,
and unadorn'd; whereas the latter are ſpacious,
enrich'd with <hi>Marble,</hi> and in ſome parts with <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry:</hi>
Theſe Ciſterns were fill'd with Water at the
overflowing of the <hi>Nile,</hi> by a large Canal call'd
<hi>Khaalis,</hi> which ſtill brings Water from the River,
for the uſe of thoſe few Inhabitants that are left in
the City. The Canal is border'd with Gardens,
which are not beautiful, tho' they contain a vaſt
number of very large <hi>Orange, Citron,</hi> and <hi>Limon</hi>-Trees.</p>
               <p>If you reflect on the uſual Cuſtom of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
to imitate the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in every thing, you will
find your ſelf oblig'd to acknowledge that 'tis at leaſt
a probable conjecture, that the <hi>Catacombs</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
were built after the Model of certain large Caves,
without the Walls of this City towards the Palace.
Theſe ſubterraneous Vaults are fifteen Foot ſquare,
and eight or ten Foot high: And there are Tombs
in the Walls cut out of the Rock, like thoſe in the
<hi>Roman Catacombs,</hi> but more artificially contriv'd,
and rank'd in better Order, in which there are
many entire Skeletons, tho' tis perhaps above 2000
Years ſince they were laid there. The Entry of
the Caves is very low and narrow, for you muſt
creep into a little hole, and ſlide ſeveral paces
downward before you come to the Vaults.</p>
               <p>This Country is Inhabited by a medley of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Nations; natural <hi>Turks, Moors, Arabs, Greeks,</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:51983:123"/>
and <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Arabs</hi> are generally Free-booters,
infeſting the Roads, and rifling all the Paſſengers
without Mercy, ſo that 'tis extreamly dangerous to
Travel without a numerous Company. Yet there
are ſome of that Nation who live in the Cities, and
are more Civil than their Country-men in the
Fields: But they all pretend to be Magicians, and
are ſo intoxicated with ſuch Chimera's, that one
wou'd almoſt think they were ſeiz'd with a ſort of
Epidemical Madneſs. They have ſeveral ways of
Divination; for ſome of 'em pretend to <hi>Inſpiration,</hi>
others Prophecy by <hi>Viſions,</hi> and there are ſome who
throw <hi>Beans</hi> into a Bag, and after they have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
'em, return anſwers to thoſe who conſult 'em.
Among all theſe Fortune-Tellers, thoſe who Divine
by way of <hi>Viſion,</hi> are reckon'd the moſt skilful, and
are feweſt in number: As for the reſt, the Streets
are full of 'em. I have heard ſeveral Inſtances of
their Predictions, both in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and in this
Countrey, without giving Credit to any of 'em,
becauſe they were for the moſt part only ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
Stories: But I'm extreamly puzl'd what to
think of an account I had from the Maſter of our
Ship, for my Author is a Man of Honour, and
part of the Matter of fact is atteſted by all the
<hi>French-men</hi> in <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The Story is this.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Carbonneau,</hi> Maſter of the Ship, call'd
<hi>St. Auguſtin,</hi> bound for this City, was entruſted at
<hi>Marſeilles</hi> with a Bag of 200 <hi>Piaſters</hi> of <hi>Sevil,</hi> which
he receiv'd without counting 'em, and oblig'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to make good the Summ. At his Arrival he
deliver'd the Bag to the Perſon to whom it was
directed, who told the Money immediately, and
finding 50 <hi>Piaſters</hi> wanting, refus'd to receive it,
and entred an Action againſt the Captain for the
Overplus. In the mean time <hi>Carbonneau</hi> made a
diligent ſearch on Board his Ship, to diſcover who
had ſtoln the 50 <hi>Piaſters;</hi> for he ſuſpected his
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51983:123"/>
Clerk and Surgeon as the only Perſons who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
his Chamber: But finding that all his Inquiries
were unſucceſsful, he reſolv'd to conſult an <hi>Arabian
Sooth-ſayer,</hi> who was of the <hi>Viſionary</hi> Tribe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
very skilful. After ſome time ſpent in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
Grimaces, the <hi>Arab</hi> told him, that he ſaw
a Man, whoſe Perſon he deſcrib'd, tell 150 <hi>Piaſters</hi>
into a Bag of ſtrip'd Ticking, and afterwards tye
it up. The Captain perceiv'd that theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
agreed exactly to the Bag and the Perſon
who gave it him; but not being entirely ſatisfi'd,
he entreated the Diviner to tell him poſitively, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there were only 150 <hi>Piaſters</hi> put into the Bag,
or 50 of 'em afterwards taken out. After ſome
new Ceremonies, the <hi>Sooth-ſayer</hi> told him, that he
ſaw the ſame Perſon endeavour to put 200 <hi>Piaſters</hi>
into the Bag, which not being large enough to
hold them all, there remain'd 20 that cou'd not be
put in for want of room. 'Tis plain then, added
he, that the compleat Summ neither was nor cou'd
be put into the Bag: And if you make the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
you'll be convinc'd of the truth of what
I ſay. Nor was he miſtaken, for 'twas found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
trial, that the Bag was not large enough to
contain 200 <hi>Piaſters,</hi> and <hi>Carbonneau</hi>'s Adverſary
was ſo honeſt as to put a ſtop to the Action. This
accident made a great noiſe among thoſe of our
Nation; and the Captain was ſo extreamly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at his Fortune-Teller's Skill, that ſome days
before his departure, he went again to conſult him
concerning the Succeſs of his Voyage. The <hi>Arab</hi>
anſwer'd, that he ſaw neither Fight, Ship-wrack,
nor Arrival, but only four Mariners, whom he
deſcrib'd, carrying Fire in their hands; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
advis'd him to have an Eye upon 'em, and to
prevent any accidents that might happen in his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.
Six days after the Captain having put out to
Sea, and intending to ſet Sail the next Morning,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51983:124"/>
the four Seamen, whom the <hi>Arabian</hi> repreſented,
ſmoaking Tabacco between the Decks, ſet Fire to
ſome Bales of Wool that were part of the Lading,
and the Ship was entirely conſum'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> were formerly very Learned, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in <hi>Medicine,</hi> and our <hi>European</hi> Surgeons have
found very uſeful Secrets in their Books: But at
preſent they apply themſelves wholly to Divination,
which, in their Opinion, is the only ſublime Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
They are perfect Strangers to the knowledge
of Religion, and their only Trade is to Rob Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers:
Nevertheleſs, it muſt be acknowledg'd to
their praiſe, that they kill none but <hi>Turks,</hi> and
theſe only when they are diſoblig'd by the <hi>Grand
Signior.</hi> They are divided into Tribes, commanded
by their particular <hi>Captains,</hi> who are all ſubject to
a kind of <hi>Duke</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> whom they call <hi>Skeick el
Kebir.</hi> They Encamp in the Deſerts, where they
ſpend their whole Lives; for when they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
the Graſs in one place they remove to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
They are lean and black; their Aſpect is
Grim and terrible: They are uſually cloath'd with
the Skins of wild Beaſts, and feed upon Milk, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Honey, and ſometimes a little Camel's Fleſh
parch'd in the Sun-Beams, or Roaſted in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
But when they go out on Parties to Attack
<hi>Caravans,</hi> or private Travellers, they carry no
other Proviſions but a little Fleſh, which they lay
under 'em upon their Horſe's backs till it grows hot
and tender.</p>
               <p>They have the beſt Horſes in the World, for
they are incredibly ſwift, and will ride a whole
day without tyring. 'Tis the Cuſtom of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi>
to Gallop perpetually, without ſtopping to
Dine: At Night they tye their Horſes to Stakes,
and feed 'em with Milk, Fleſh, and Wheat, as they
do themſelves. They eſteem a good Horſe above
all things in the World; and to prevent Deceits,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51983:124"/>
they keep their Pedigrees in Writing. When they
have occaſion to ſell or exchange a Horſe, they
produce his Genealogy, proving him to be lineally
deſcended from ſuch a Stallion and Mare of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Memory.</p>
               <p>This wandring Nation owes the preſervation of
its Liberties to the weakneſs of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
and of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s of <hi>Cairo</hi> and <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who not only
connive at 'em, but gratifie the <hi>Sheck el Kebir</hi> with
a Penſion, which very much reſembles Tribute;
For upon the leaſt delay of Payment, they burn and
pillage the Country in ſo barbarous a manner, that
I cannot give you a livelier <hi>Idea</hi> of the havock they
make on ſuch occaſions, than by putting you in
mind of the <hi>French</hi> Campaign in the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have done with the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and ſhall in the
next place proceed to give you a brief Account of
the <hi>Turks</hi> that live in <hi>Egypt,</hi> before I finiſh my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
They are ſo extreamly Superſtitious, that
when they go abroad in the Morning, if the firſt
Perſon they meet be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> they return im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
and having waſh'd themſelves, ſtay at
home all the reſt of the day; for they believe that
ſome great Misfortune wou'd certainly befall 'em,
if they ſhou'd venture to go abroad again.</p>
               <p>Their hatred and ſcorn to all that profeſs the
Faith of Chriſt, is extended even to the <hi>Franks,</hi>
who meet with a thouſand Indignities, which
the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves can hardly bear. For not to
mention the Cuſtom of Impriſoning us every Night,
we are not permitted to appear on Horſeback in
the City, but are oblig'd to ride on Aſſes; and if
a <hi>Frank</hi> were found taking a particular view of a
Fortification, 'twou'd coſt him at leaſt 500 <hi>Piaſters,</hi>
and he might reckon himſelf very Fortunate if he
eſcap'd with ſo mild a Correction. 'Tis ſtill a more
hainous Crime to enter into a Moſquee, and wou'd
be puniſh'd with greater Severity: And therefore
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:51983:125"/>
I hope you will not expect that I ſhou'd acquaint
you whether the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Moſquees are different
from thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have already told you, that the Men of this
Country are very black; but I'm inform'd, that the
Women are not tann'd in the leaſt with that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
ſo careful are they to preſerve their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions,
and to keep themſelves out of the reach
of the Sun. I cou'd tell you ſome very diverting
Stories of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Women, if I were fully
convinc'd of the truth of 'em. 'Tis true, my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
are very poſitive, but the Thing is ſo odd, that
I dare hardly venture to relate it upon their Credit;
and eſpecially in this caſe, I ſhou'd be glad I cou'd
ſpeak as an Eye-witneſs. However, Sir, ſince the
mentioning of the Subject may perhaps raiſe your
Curioſity, 'twou'd be ill Manners to take leave of
you without giving you ſome account of it.</p>
               <p>I'm inform'd there are Schools here where Maids
learn to give and receive the Pleaſures of Love with
more than ordinary delight. This pretty Art is
taught by Women, who acting the part of Men,
make their fair Scholars exerciſe the moſt laſcivious
Poſtures imaginable. Maids of Quality are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
at home, and I'm aſſur'd that this is an
Accompliſhment which uſually recommends young
Ladies to the moſt advantageous Matches.</p>
               <p>I intend to Embark to morrow on a <hi>Tartane</hi> of

               </opener>
               <p>I Cannot expreſs my Amazement at the ſight of
thoſe ſtately Monuments that make <hi>Cairo</hi> the
moſt admirable City in the World, and convince
the Beholder of ſo many Wonders, that the ancient
Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> were the moſt powerful Monarchs
in the Univerſe. We are uſually fill'd with a high
Idea of the <hi>Roman</hi> Grandeur, becauſe we view it at a
leſs diſtance: But how vaſtly inferiour are the <hi>Pantheon,
Collieſeum, Capitol,</hi> and all the other celebrated Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of <hi>Rome,</hi> to theſe Magnificent Sepulchres
which have for ſo many Ages ſtood firm againſt all
the Attacks of Time and Age, and piercing the
Sky with their lofty Tops, ſeem to be Copies of
the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi> At leaſt 'tis plain, that the
Founders of theſe <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monuments were acted
by the ſame Deſigns that mov'd <hi>Nimrod</hi> to erect
that famous Tower. They ſaw that all things were
ſubject to the irreſiſtible Power of Fate, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
in a Moment the moſt illuſtrious and potent
Empires, and annihilates even the Memory of their
Grandeur. Their Souls were too elevated to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the common Deſtiny of other Mortals; and
the ſublimity of their Courage inſpir'd 'em with
the noble and glorious Reſolution of making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Immortal in ſpite of Death. This was the
deſign of thoſe <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hero's, and 'tis to their
Heroical Ambition that we owe the Poſſeſſion of
theſe Wonders of the World. How often do I wiſh
you had been an Eye-witneſs and Partaker of my
Happineſs, when I ſtood gazing on ſo many Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that are not to be found any where elſe, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51983:126"/>
might juſtifie the Curioſity of a Traveller, tho' he
ſhou'd come from the remoteſt part of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
to admire 'em.</p>
               <p>Theſe Monuments are of ſeveral kinds, but there
are none ſo admirably magnificent as the <hi>Pyramids,</hi>
which are ſo highly celebrated by ancient Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Two of the three principal Pyramids are ſhut,
the other which appears biggeſt is open: 'Tis ſeated
(I mean the laſt) very near the other two, three
Leagues from <hi>Cairo,</hi> if that name be confin'd to the
<hi>New</hi> City, or two Leagues and a half, taking in the
<hi>Old.</hi> 'Tis a vaſt artificial Mountain, compos'd of
Free-Stones of different bigneſs; for we cannot
ſuppoſe it poſſible, that there cou'd have been a
ſufficient quantity of Stones found exactly of the
ſame Dimenſions, for the building of ſo prodigious
a Maſs; but the ſmalleſt are a Foot thick, and
two Foot long; ſome being three Foot thick, ſix
long, and four broad. Its heighth amounts to
520 Feet, and the breadth of each Face to 682.</p>
               <p>The Aſcent conſiſts of between 200 and 210 Steps.
The Top appears like the point of a Spire to thoſe
that are below; but when they go up to it, they
are ſurpriz'd to find a Platform 24 Foot ſquare;
and their Wonder is ſtill encreas'd, when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that ſo large a ſpace is pav'd only with 12
Stones; for 'tis hardly conceivable how Stones of
that Bulk cou'd be rais'd to ſo vaſt a heighth.
From thence you have the Proſpect of <hi>Boulac,</hi> old
and new <hi>Cairo,</hi> the Ruines of <hi>Memphis,</hi> the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and the Deſarts of <hi>Egypt:</hi> But he who can
look to the bottom of the Steps without Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may juſtly boaſt of the ſtrength of his Head;
for my part, I muſt confeſs I was ſtruck with ſo
much horror when I caſt my Eye downward, that
I was hardly ſenſible of any Pleaſure in viewing ſo
great a variety of Objects. There were formerly
Steps on every ſide, but Time that conſumes all
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51983:126"/>
things has ſo waſted ſome of the Stones, that in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Parts there are dreadful Precipices; and
therefore Strangers dare not venture to aſcend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the aſſiſtance of Guides that are acquainted
with the ſafeſt ways. At the bottom of the Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid
there is a heap of Sand that reaches to the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
ſtep, where there is a little door, thro' which
(after you have drunk a refreſhing Cup) you may
enter into a ſort of deſcending Alley, 30 paces
long, about three Foot and a half high, and of
equal breadth, ſo that a Man cannot walk in it
without bowing his Body extreamly. At the end
of this Alley you muſt lie down upon your Belly,
and creep thro' a little Wicket, which is even with
the Ground, and brings you into another little
Alley like the former, only in this you muſt aſcend,
whereas you deſcended in the other. This Alley
ends in two others; that on the Right-hand has
no inclination, and leads to a little Vaulted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
18 Foot long, and 12 broad. At the entrance
into this Alley there is a very deep Pit or Well
without Water: Some Travellers go down into it,
but I did not follow their Example: For I thought
I had already done enough to ſatisfie my Curioſity,
by creeping thro' thoſe Caves which are darker
than Hell it ſelf, and in all reſpects a fit Habitation
for the Dead. Beſides, they are ſo full of Bats
that flutter about perpetually, and blow out the
Candles, that 'twou'd be very dangerous to venture
in without a Tinder-Box. Directly oppoſite to the
laſt Alley, there is another which begins ſo high in
the Wall, that we were forc'd to climb up to it;
but to make amends for that inconveniency, 'tis
much higher and broader than any of the reſt.
After I had walk'd 70 Paces, ſtill aſcending, I
found a ſort of Hall 32 Foot long, and 16 broad,
pav'd with nine Stones, the length of which is equal
to the breadth of the Room. The Walls are of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51983:127"/>
a very fine and precious kind of <hi>Porphyry;</hi> and at
one end there is an empty Tomb of the ſame <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry,</hi>
ſeven Foot long and three broad.</p>
               <p>I went afterwards to take a view of the two
other Pyramids, the leaſt (and according to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
the moſt ancient) of which was formerly
over-laid with <hi>Porphyry.</hi> 'Tis only 150 Foot high,
and each of its Sides or Faces is 200 Foot broad.
The common Opinion is, That 'twas Founded by
a Young Woman call'd <hi>Rhodope,</hi> who was <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s
Fellow-Slave in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and that the Munificence
of her Lovers enabl'd her to build ſo vaſt a Work.
The other is almoſt as great as the firſt; for its
height amounts to 510 Feet, and the breadth of
each Face to 630. Theſe three Pyramids are of a
quadrilateral Figure, and I obſerv'd the Ruines of
an ancient Temple before each of 'em; for 'tis not
at all probable, that there were ever any Palaces in
that Place; and the huge <hi>Idol</hi> of Stone that ſtands
very near thoſe decay'd Structures, is, I think, an
evident confirmation of the truth of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.
The People of the Country ſay, that
'twas heretofore famous for Oracles, and I believe
'tis no fabulous Tradition; for there is a very deep
Hole in the Head of the Idol, where the Prieſts
might lie conceal'd, and return anſwers to thoſe
who came to propoſe Queſtions. 'Tis a <hi>Coloſſus</hi> cut
in the Rock, repreſenting a Woman, and is 26
Foot high, tho' it ſcarce reaches down to her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
ſo that 'tis one of the moſt monſtrous Figures
in the World.</p>
               <p>Three hours Journey from thence there is a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
call'd <hi>Sacara,</hi> in which there are <hi>Catacombs</hi> or
Sepulchral Vaults, but of a different Contrivance
from thoſe at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> For theſe are
diſtinct ſubterraneous Chambers, built of Free-Stone,
without the leaſt Communication between
one another: There is an opening above, thro'
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51983:127"/>
which you are either let down with a Rope, as into
a Well, or muſt go down a Ladder, according to
the various Depth of the Caves. They were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
full of the Bodies of ancient <hi>Egyptians,</hi> ſo
skilfully embalm'd, that they were preſerv'd entire,
perhaps above 4000 Years, with their Epitaphs,
Coffins, and curious and magnificent Dreſſes. The
Coffins were enrich'd with <hi>Hieroglyphics,</hi> and the
Figure of the Deceas'd in <hi>Relievo;</hi> and ſometimes
there were Idols and Jewels found in 'em. But the
Curioſity of the <hi>Franks</hi> has at laſt exhauſted 'em;
tho' 'tis thought there are ſome that were never
open'd, and that the difficulty of finding 'em pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the Avarice of the <hi>Moors,</hi> who only
know where they are, and keep the Price of ſuch
Rarities very high. Yet I made 'em let me down
into two or three, where I ſaw ſome Pieces of <hi>Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
but ſo ſpoil'd, that 'twas impoſſible to preſerve
any of 'em.</p>
               <p>This Place is ſo full of <hi>Pyramids,</hi> that I believe
there are above a hundred; but they are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to thoſe I mention'd. Yet I obſerv'd one
that wou'd be as big as the firſt, if it were finiſh'd:
there are alſo aſcending and deſcending Alleys in it,
at the end of which there are three Rooms in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Places. I will not trouble you with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of it, ſince the only remarkable Difference
between it and the firſt, is, that this is only rais'd to
half the intended Heighth, if I may judge by its
Proportion to the reſt, whereas that is compleatly
finiſh'd.</p>
               <p>On the other Side of the <hi>Nile,</hi> directly oppoſite
to this Place, are the Ruines of the ancient City of
<hi>Memphis,</hi> extended along the River, till you come
overagainſt <hi>Old Cairo.</hi> They are ſo confus'd at preſent,
that I ſpent half a Day in viewing 'em, without
finding any thing remarkable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:51983:128"/>
I confeſs, Sir, that in purſuance of the Niceties
of an exact Method, I ſhou'd have made you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the City of <hi>Cairo,</hi> before I had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
you to viſit the Rarities in its Neighbourhood.
But I cou'd not forbear giving the firſt place to that
which I moſt admir'd; and beſides an Account of
<hi>Cairo</hi> will be as uſeful and perhaps as acceptable to
you at the End, as in the Beginning of my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The Obſervation I made concerning the Variety
of Opinions about the Extent of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> is
equally applicable to this City, which is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
three Parts, <hi>Boulac,</hi> and <hi>Old,</hi> and <hi>New Cairo.</hi>
Some Travellers ſcruple to comprehend theſe three
Towns under one Name, becauſe they are ſeparated
by Gardens and Fields: but if thoſe Gentlemen
were to write to an Inhabitant of any of theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
they wou'd certainly direct their Letters to
<hi>Cairo,</hi> and not to <hi>Boulac,</hi> &amp;c. And 'tis as imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
a Piece of Nicety to make a Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Places that are divided by ſo ſmall a Diſtance;
as 'twou'd be abſurd and improper, according to that
Opinion, to give the City the Title of <hi>Grand Cairo.</hi>
But not to trouble you with more Arguments, I
ſhall only tell you that I think fit to join all the
three Parts together; and that in this Senſe <hi>Cairo</hi>
contains four large Hours Journey in Length, and
twelve in Compaſs.</p>
               <p>'Twas taken from the <hi>Soldans</hi> of <hi>Egypt, Ann.</hi> 1517.
by <hi>Sultan Selim</hi> I. who put to death all the <hi>Mamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucks</hi>
with their <hi>Soldan:</hi> and ſince that it has been
ſtill ſubject to the <hi>Turks,</hi> who in all probability will
not be ſoon nor eaſily driven out of it. 'Tis the
<hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the moſt conſiderable Baſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
in <hi>Turkey:</hi> and ſince 'tis a City of a vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
the three Parts that compoſe it are differently
ſituated. <hi>Boulac</hi> is the Port of <hi>Cairo</hi> on the <hi>Nile,</hi>
and is alone as large as <hi>Rennes</hi> in <hi>Bretagne,</hi> or the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51983:128"/>
                  <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> The <hi>New</hi> City lies further in the
Country, at the Foot of a great Hill, and the <hi>Old
Cairo</hi> a little beyond it, on the Banks of the <hi>Nile.</hi>
Thus the <hi>New</hi> City is depriv'd of the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
Neighbourhood of the River, and receives
all its Water by a <hi>Khaalis</hi> or Canal, like that of
<hi>Alexandria.</hi> All the reſt of the Cities of <hi>Egypt</hi> are
alſo furniſh'd with ſuch Aqueducts, without which
they wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d be wholly deſtitute of Water. This is
the Inconveniency, or rather the Miſery of the
Country; for the Heat is very troubleſome during
the Summer: and ſo much the more inſupportable,
becauſe all the Ground is cover'd with Sand, which
grows burning hot, and makes the Air ſo ſultry,
that one can ſcarce breathe in it. Judge, Sir, what
a Pleaſure 'twou'd be in that Seaſon, to drink a
Cup of cold and freſh Water; and yet the poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
muſt content themſelves with the naſty
Puddle that has ſtood about a Year in the Ciſterns,
or (which is almoſt as bad) with the Water that
is carry'd about the Streets to be ſold in Pitchers
made of Goats Skins, by the <hi>Moors.</hi> For the <hi>Khaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
is dry for the Space of ſix Months, and begins
not to be fill'd till the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when the
<hi>Nile</hi> is almoſt come to its greateſt Heighth. Then
they cut the Dam or Bank, that kept out the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which immediately guſhes into the Canal, and
continues to flow during the Encreaſe of the River,
that is, till near the End of <hi>October,</hi> after which it
decreaſes by degrees. The Day of the Opening of
the <hi>Khaalis</hi> is obſerv'd in this City as a Feſtival, with
extraordinary Marks of Joy: but ſince I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeen, nor am like to ſee that Ceremony, you
may conſult ſome other Travellers for an Account
of it. The <hi>Khaalis</hi> paſſes thro' the <hi>New</hi> City, and
fills a vaſt number of Ciſterns and Baſons for Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.
The Inundation of the <hi>Nile</hi> is the only Cauſe
of the Fruitfulneſs of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for without that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51983:129"/>
'twou'd be one vaſt Deſart, as thoſe Parts are, which
are depriv'd of that Advantage by reaſon of their
Diſtance from the River. Theſe Floods, which are
occaſion'd by the Melting of the Snow in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
fatten the Soil more effectually than the beſt
Dung in the World cou'd poſſibly do: and indeed
thoſe Spots of Ground that are waſh'd by the Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
are admirably fertil. I cannot leave this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
without taking Notice of the Vulgar Errour,
That it never <hi>rains</hi> in this Country; for during the
little time I have ſpent in it, I have obſerv'd ſome
Showers; tho' I muſt confeſs it rains not ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here as in other Countries.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nile</hi> is very near as broad as the <hi>Rhine:</hi> it
croſſes the whole Country of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and during
the time of its Inundation, it overflows for the ſpace
of two Months, all the neighbouring Fields, which
only are inhabited, the reſt of the Land being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with dry and burning Sands. It falls into the
<hi>Mediterranean</hi> by two Mouths, about 80 Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.
'Tis famous over all the World for its <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles,</hi>
and it muſt be acknowledg'd that it contains
a great number of very large ones, but they are
neither venomous, nor ſo terrible as they are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
repreſented.</p>
               <p>If I ſhou'd tell you that there are 23000 <hi>Moſquees</hi>
in this City, you'd certainly laugh at my Credulity,
that cou'd ſwallow ſuch a monſtrous Fable. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
Sir, 'tis held by all the Inhabitants as a moſt
certain Truth; and they are no leſs firmly perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that there are as many diſtinct Quarters or
Wards, containing ſeveral Streets each, according
to which Computation there are at leaſt 100000
<hi>Streets</hi> in the City. 'Tis true, they are extremely
ſmall and narrow, but I dare not poſitively aſſure
you that there is ſuch a prodigious Number of 'em,
eſpecially ſince I never counted 'em. 'Tis alſo ſaid
that when the Plague rages in this Place, it ſweeps
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:51983:129"/>
away 10000 Perſons a-day; nor do I think this
Story ſo incredible as the other: for the City is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
populous, and there is as great a Concourſe
of People at the <hi>Bazar</hi> or Market every <hi>Thurſday,</hi> as
at the moſt crowded Fairs in <hi>Europe.</hi> This <hi>Bazar</hi> is the
only to lerable Street in <hi>Cairo,</hi> and the <hi>Beſeſtin</hi> at one
of the Ends of it is at leaſt as fine and rich as that
of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> At the other End there is a Market
of Slaves, where a Man may be always accommodated
with a pretty Girl, at the Rate of 100 or 150 <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters.</hi>
All the Houſes are of Wood, with Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
on the Top, after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Faſhion: The
Outſide is as mean, as the Inſide is ſaid to be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.
'Tis true, I never view'd 'em within, and
therefore will not deſire you to believe that they
deſerve the laſt part of that Character; for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
entirely upon the Teſtimony of the <hi>Franks,</hi>
who are guilty of an unaccountable Prejudice, in
magnifying the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Magnificence. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a very great and inexcuſable Weakneſs; and
I know not whether it is more unreaſonable to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
all things or nothing. We ought indeed to do
Juſtice to every thing that is either Good or Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
but I know no Reaſon that obliges us to extoll
the moſt ordinary Beauty, or rather Deformity it
ſelf, eſpecially in a Place that may juſtly boaſt of
ſo many incomparable Wonders, among which I
may venture to reckon the ancient and vaſt Caſtle
of <hi>Cairo.</hi> 'Tis true, it may be ſaid to be a mere
Heap of inhabited Ruines: but theſe Ruines are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
Magnificent, and ſuitable to the Glory and
Power of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who is reputed to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
both of this Structure, and of the great open
Pyramid. It ſtands directly in the Middle of the
City, between the <hi>Old</hi> aud <hi>New</hi> Town, on ſo large
and ſteep a Rock, that one wou'd think it was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
fram'd by Nature to ſecure and command
<hi>Grand Cairo.</hi> 'Tis above two Miles in Compaſs, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51983:130"/>
was formerly ſurrounded with thick Walls, like
thoſe of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> flank'd at the end of every
hundred Paces with great and very ſtrong Towers.
It has four Gates which lead into a fine open Place,
and from thence to ſeveral Streets; ſo that it ſeems
rather to be a Town than a Caſtle. The <hi>Turks</hi> have
profan'd theſe venerable Monuments, by disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
'em with their Cottages, which look like ſo
many Rats-Neſts. Some Parts of <hi>Pharaoh's Palace</hi>
remain ſtill to be ſeen: The Room call'd <hi>Joſeph's
Hall,</hi> is enrich'd with Gold and Azure, and adorn'd
with thirty fine Columns of Porphyry. That of
his Steward or Intendant, is not ſo entire, and is
only remarkable for twelve Columns of <hi>Thebaic</hi>
Marble, which are not much inferiour to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
in Beauty. But the entireſt and moſt admirable
Work in this Place, is the celebrated <hi>Well</hi> of <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
'Tis cut or hollow'd in the hard Rock, a hundred
and ſix Foot deep, of a ſquare Figure, each Side
containing eleven Feet, without reckn'ning the Stair-Caſe,
which is ſeven Foot broad, and cut out of the
ſame Rock. It turns round the Well, and conſiſts
of twelve ſeveral Windings, ſix of which contain
eighteen Steps a-piece, and the other ſix, nineteen;
ſo that the total Number of the Steps amounts to
to Two hundred twenty two. The Stairs are ſo
eaſie and commodious, that they make two Oxen
go down every day to the Bottom of the Well,
which is dry, and from thence to a little ſquare
Room, where there is a Spring, out of which
they draw Water continually, by a certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of Wheels hung round with Buckets, that
diſcharge the Water into a Baſon or Ciſtern in the
midſt of the dry Pit or Well; from whence 'tis
rais'd up in Buckets faſten'd to Ropes, that are let
down and drawn up again by the turning of other
Wheels. Round the Stair-Caſe on the Inſide there
are Walls that ſerve inſtead of Rails, and ſecure
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:51983:130"/>
thoſe that go down from falling. At the Bottom
of the Well there is a Door on the Right-hand, and
another on the Left, both cut out of the Rock: and
'tis commonly believ'd that one of 'em leads to the
Red-Sea, and the other to the Pyramids. The firſt
is impoſſible, for the Sea is above thirty Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant:
but the ſecond is not at all improbable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the great Works that were undertaken and
perform'd by the ancient <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the Care
they took to dig ſubterraneous Paſſages to ſecure
their Retreat in caſe of Neceſſity. 'Tis true, the
Greatneſs of the Diſtance, and Hardneſs of the
Rock cou'd not but make this Attempt very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult;
but after all 'tis not near ſo vaſt a Work as
the Pyramids, and there muſt be ſome Paſſage that
begins at this Place: for tho' the Doors are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
wall'd up, 'tis plain they were deſign'd for ſome
Uſe. You will not be ſurpriz'd at the Magnificence
of this Well, nor wonder what made the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
beſtow ſo much Time, Pains and Coſt on the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of it, if you conſider how precious and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Water is in this Country. For (as I told
you in my laſt) there are but two Springs in all
<hi>Egypt,</hi> This, and That of <hi>Maltharea,</hi> of which I
ſhall give you ſome Account before I finiſh my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And it ſeems the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monarchs were
afraid that theſe two Fountains ſhou'd at laſt be
dry'd up; for they took care to bring Water from
the <hi>Nile</hi> in a very fine Aqueduct, beginning betwixt
<hi>Old Cairo</hi> and <hi>Boulac,</hi> and reaching as far as the
Caſtle. Not far from <hi>Joſeph's Palace</hi> there is a
dreadful <hi>Priſon,</hi> conſiſting of ſeveral Dungeons cut
out of the Rock. It bears the Name of the ſame
Patriarch, becauſe 'twas here, according to the
common Opinion, where he interpreted the Dreams
of the <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ler</hi> and <hi>Baker:</hi> if this Tradition be true,
it muſt be acknowledg'd, that he was in a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Condition, for this is certainly a very diſmal
Place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:51983:131"/>
                  <hi>Maltharea</hi> is a Place about a large League diſtant
from the City, whither the <hi>Franks</hi> often walk to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the pleaſant Shade of its fine Orange-Trees, and
refreſh themſelves with its delicious Water. There is
alſo a little Chapel in the ſame place, which, 'tis ſaid,
the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> choſe for her Abode, when ſhe fled
to <hi>Egypt</hi> with her Son <hi>Jeſus;</hi> but the Circumſtances
of the Story are ſo improbable, that it ſeems to be
of the ſame Stamp with other fabulous Legends.
For they pretend that while ſhe liv'd in that little
Houſe, perceiving at a great diſtance the Men whom
<hi>Herod</hi> had ſent after her, and, not knowing where
to flee, an old Sycamore burſt open to receive
her and the little <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and cloſing again ſecur'd
'em from the Rage of their Enemies. Aſſoon as
the Danger was over the miraculous Tree let 'em
forth, and remain'd open ever afterwards; but 'tis
extremely decay'd at preſent, and part of it is fall'n
away. However I ſpent two Hours near it with a
great deal of Pleaſure; for the Sun ſhone very
bright that Day, and the Verdure of the Myrtle,
Orange, and Limon-Trees was extremely agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>There is another little Chapel in <hi>Old Cairo,</hi> where
the Virgin reſided for ſome time: and near that
there are large Store-houſes for Corn, which are
thought to be the ſame that <hi>Joſeph</hi> built when he
laid up Proviſions againſt the ſeven Years of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, I have entertain'd you with an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of ſome of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Rarities. 'Tis true,
there are many other remarkable Monuments in
this Country, that are worthy of a Traveller's Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity;
but the very Sight of thoſe howling De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts
deterr me from undertaking a Journey that
wou'd expoſe me to ſo many Dangers and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies.
Beſides 'twou'd require a great deal of
Money, and I begin already to perceive that I muſt
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51983:131"/>
take more than ordinary care to Husband my Stock.
I find alſo that the ſame conſideration will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me to proſecute my deſign of viſiting the <hi>Holy
Land,</hi> tho' 'tis not without an extream reluctancy
that I'm forc'd to deprive my ſelf of the fight of a
place which the Saviour of the World hallow'd with
his preſence. But the Journey is prodigiouſly
chargeable, and I'm reſolv'd to deny my ſelf that
ſatisfaction rather than to put my ſelf in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that might oblige me to return to <hi>France.</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
then to Embark on a <hi>Greek Saique,</hi> which in
few days will ſet Sail for <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where, I hope, I
may eaſily find an occaſion for <hi>Venice.</hi>

               <p>AFter a very troubleſome Voyage that laſted a
whole Month, I arriv'd at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> a City of
<hi>Natolia,</hi> a hundred Miles from <hi>Scio,</hi> where you
may remember I ſtay'd ſo long that I found Matter
enough for a whole Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Smyrna</hi> was formerly ſeated on two Mountains,
ſeparated by a pleaſant Valley that divided the City
into two Parts, one of which was not above a
quarter of a League diſtant from the Sea. This
Mountain is ſo high that you cou'd not go up or
rather climb the ſteep aſcent in leſs than a full quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour: And on the top of it was a large
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:51983:132"/>
Caſtle fortifi'd both by Nature and Art; for beſides
the advantages of its Situation, 'twas ſurrounded
with high and thick Walls, on which there was a
Parapet embattel'd after the Oriental faſhion; and
certainly 'tis not eaſily conceivable how ſo many
Stones cou'd be carry'd up ſo high. The Gate of
the Caſtle is defended by two round Towers join'd
to the Wall: And in the Stone-work of the Tower
that ſtands on the right hand as you enter, there is
a Figure of a Woman's Head and Neck, a Foot
and a half high, which is ſaid to repreſent a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Amazon call'd <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who having Conquer'd
the City, call'd it by her own Name, and built the
Caſtle. The inſide is a meer heap of Ruines, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
which I obſerv'd a very fair Ciſtern twenty
Paces long and twelve broad, Vaulted and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by ſix fine ſquare Pillars which are all entire.
Beſides, there is a little Chapel built like a Moſquee,
but it ſeems not to be very ancient. This Caſtle
commanded the City on one ſide, and the Port on
the other; and from thence you have an unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
Proſpect of the Sea. 'Tis at preſent only
Inhabited by a <hi>Turk</hi> with his Wife and Daughter,
who is oblig'd to keep Watch, and give notice to
the Merchants when he diſcovers a Veſſel. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
from thence we ſaw the Ruines of an
Amphitheater, about which there are Ditches
where the Lions were kept; and ſomewhat higher
are the Niches where the Magiſtrates ſate. 'Twas
here that S. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> the firſt Archbiſhop of <hi>Smyrna</hi>
was crown'd with Martyrdom. He was one of
St. <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, and yet even then the Schiſm
of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church was begun; for he was ſent to
the Pope to Negotiate an Accommodation, tho'
with very little Succeſs. The City was heretofore
very large, as it appears by the compaſs of its Walls;
for if any Man will give himſelf the trouble to
take an exact view of their Ruines, as I have done,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51983:132"/>
he will be quickly convinc'd, that 'twas above
twelve Miles about: And the Error of thoſe who
contract its Dimenſions, is only an effect of their
Careleſneſs.</p>
               <p>There is a very fine Aqueduct ſtill to be ſeen,
which brought Water to the part of the City next
the Sea. It reaches from one Hill to the other, and
contains 300 Paces in length. In the ſame part of
the Town there are very ancient Burying-places,
which at preſent belong to the <hi>Jews:</hi> And adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to theſe are the Burying-places of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Dutch,</hi> where there are very magnificent Marble
Tombs, enrich'd with fine <hi>Relievo's.</hi> This Place is
call'd St. <hi>Veneranda,</hi> from the Name of a <hi>Greek</hi>
Church, near which there is a Spring, fam'd for
curing Fevers miraculouſly; tho' I'm confident its
Vertue conſiſts only in quenching the Thirſt, which
it does very effectually, for 'tis extreamly cold and
clear, and may for that reaſon be reckon'd one of
the Rarities of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where the Water is generally
bad.</p>
               <p>This City was ruin'd in the time of <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi>
who caus'd it to be rebuilt at the foot of the Hill on
the Sea-ſide, where it ſtands at preſent, ſtretching
in length about two ſhort Miles, and a little above
one Mile in breadth. This ſituation is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for Trade than the former, and beſides, the
Heat of the Summer is agreeably temper'd by a
cool Breeze that blows every day. But theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
are counter-balanc'd by the <hi>Earthquakes</hi>
that happen ſo frequently in this place, and make
ſuch a terrible havock that the Inhabitants often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wiſh that their Town were plac'd again on
the Hill, where they think the danger wou'd not be
ſo great. For 'tis generally believ'd, that the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
are occaſion'd by the vaſt and deep Conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
made by the ſubterraneous Streams that fall
from the Mountain, where the Wind and Vapours
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:51983:133"/>
being pent up, and endeavouring to break forth
impetuouſly, cauſe thoſe dreadful Jolts that are felt
here ſo often. However I can aſſure you, that the
Hill is much leſs ſubject to <hi>Earthquakes</hi> than the
place where the City ſtands at preſent: For ſince I
came hither there happen'd four in one day, and
all of 'em ſtrong and violent enough to ſtrike a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
into thoſe that are not accuſtom'd to 'em. Nor
does their frequency make 'em leſs dreadful to the
Inhabitants of this place; for as ſoon as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the leaſt ſhaking of the Earth they run out of
their Houſes with all the ſigns of Fear and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and call upon God, every one according to
the Rites of his Religion. Nor can this be juſtly
call'd a Panic Terror, for they were ſo roughly
handl'd by an <hi>Earthquake</hi> three Years ago, that I
I wonder how any of 'em durſt afterwards venture
to repair their ruin'd Habitations. About Noon,
when they were all at Dinner, the Earth began to
ſhake ſo furiouſly as if the whole Machine of the
Univerſe had been falling to pieces. A thouſand
Houſes were over-turn'd in an Inſtant with a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
dinn, and 3000 Perſons were buried under the
Ruines. The reſt who had the good Fortune to
eſcape, were ſeiz'd with a terrible Conſternation,
and ran wildly about, not knowing whither to flee,
nor where to hide themſelves; for they were ſtill
alarm'd with repeated Jolts. And beſides, the lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fires that lay hid among the Ruines were fann'd
and blown up ſo violently by a ſtrong Gale, which
accompany'd the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> that the Flame cou'd
not be extinguiſh'd for the ſpace of two days, till
the very Rubbiſh of the Houſes was conſum'd.
Add to this diſmal Spectacle the howlings of thoſe
Wretches that were not quite kill'd by the fall of
the Houſes, and you'll find your ſelf oblig'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that never any accident produc'd a
more lamentable Scene of Miſery. At laſt the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:51983:133"/>
that were on Board the Veſſels in the Port,
came a-ſhore, and found above 500 Perſons alive
under the Ruines, ſome with broken Legs, and
others with broken Arms; ſome were bruis'd all
over, and all in general were Objects of Pity and
Compaſſion. The Captains of the Ships carry'd
thoſe who were Hurt or Wounded on Board, with
the moſt conſiderable Perſons of their reſpective
Nations: But the reſt of the Inhabitants were
forc'd to lie abroad till they had prepar'd new
Lodgings, which were only ſome paltry Huts of
Straw. That part of the City where the <hi>Franks</hi>
live was moſt violently ſhaken, ſo that they were
all Sufferers, and moſt of 'em loſt in one day the
fruit of many Years Labour. Some that had ſtrip'd
themſelves to the very Shirt to enjoy with greater
Pleaſure the Coolneſs of the Wind, were reduc'd to
the neceſſity of begging Coats to cover their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.
As for the Societies of Merchants, tho'
they were conſiderable Sharers in the common Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
the greatneſs of their Stocks kept 'em from
falling into ſuch an exceſs of Miſery. The <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Dutch</hi> particularly are ſo rich, that they can
eaſily ſupport the loſs of 50000 Livres: But every
Man ſuffer'd proportionably to his Eſtate, and it
may be ſaid that the Poor loſt more than the Rich,
becauſe they were depriv'd of their All.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Fabre</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Conſul periſh'd under
the Ruines, notwithſtanding all the Endeavours
that were us'd to ſave him; and ſeveral Rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
had the ſame Fate. Next Year the <hi>Plague</hi>
broke forth among thoſe whom the <hi>Fire</hi> and the
<hi>Earthquake</hi> had ſpar'd; and the laſt Year may be
reckon'd as Calamitous as either of the former, by
reaſon of the horrible Diſorders that were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
here by the <hi>Algerines</hi> and <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Thus,
within the compaſs of <hi>Three Years,</hi> this City has
ſuffer'd <hi>Four</hi> of the ſevereſt <hi>Judgments</hi> that are uſually
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:51983:134"/>
inflicted by Heaven. Theſe Misfortunes wou'd
have ruin'd a poor Town, but there are hardly
any Footſteps of 'em left in this; for 'tis almoſt
quite Rebuilt already, and the Street where the
<hi>Franks</hi> live is fairer than 'twas before.</p>
               <p>This is the moſt conſiderable ſeat of Commerce
in the <hi>Levant,</hi> and the Dignity of the <hi>Conſuls</hi> who
reſide here is next to that of <hi>Ambaſſadors.</hi> Their
Juriſdiction is extended over <hi>Natolia, Scio, Metelin,</hi>
and ſeveral other Iſlands of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> in which
they appoint <hi>Vice-Conſuls,</hi> who govern under their
Authority. This is a very Honourable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thoſe who are poſſeſt of it are much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
even by the <hi>Turks,</hi> who have as great a
Veneration for Conſuls as for Ambaſſadors, and
receive 'em at Audiences with the ſame Ceremonies.
When they go thro' the Streets, the <hi>Turks</hi> draw up
in Files, and open a Paſſage for 'em, as for a Baſſa:
Nor do they ever walk abroad without two Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
and as many <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> who march before
'em, and ſerve inſtead of a Life-Guard; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
they are accompany'd with two or three
Merchants, and follow'd by their Servants in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
But on the days of Audience their Train is
more numerous and ſplendid, for they are always
preceded by ſix Interpreters, and a like number
of <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> with <hi>Zercola's</hi> on their Heads; and
follow'd by all the moſt conſiderable Perſons of the
Nation, whoſe number ſometimes amounts to above
forty. Nor does the Grandeur of this Poſt conſiſt
meerly in external Pomp; for their Power is as
conſiderable as their State, and their Authority
over their reſpective Nations exceeds that of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Governors, ſo much the more as they are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſtant from the Court. 'Tis true, that in the
management of Affairs that meerly regard Trade,
they are oblig'd to call a Meeting of the Principal
Merchants, who decide the Matter by plurality of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:51983:134"/>
Voices, and the Conſul is only Preſident of the
Aſſembly. But in all caſes that relate to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of Juſtice or the Government of a City,
he repreſents the Perſon of the Sovereign, and is as
exactly obey'd. He is the abſolute Judge of all
Suits or Actions, whether Criminal or Civil; and
has under him a <hi>Chancellor,</hi> who performs the Office
of a Clerk and Notary, a <hi>Secretary,</hi> and a <hi>Treaſurer,</hi>
who receives all the Money that is ſent either on
the publick Account, or by way of private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
The Dignity of his Function is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
in the Church, where he ſits in an arm'd
Chair, with a Cuſhion of Crimſon Velvet to kneel
upon. But the main advantage of this Office is in
my Opinion the largeneſs of its Revenue, which
ſeldom or never amounts to leſs than 18000 <hi>French
Livres.</hi> All <hi>Franks</hi> are oblig'd at their Arrival to
addreſs themſelves to their reſpective Conſuls, and
deſire their Protection, or otherwiſe muſt expect to
be ſeiz'd, and ſent back to their own Country.
Yet, without any regard to that Cuſtom, I have
put my ſelf under the Protection of Monſieur <hi>de
Hochepied,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Conſul: For when I went to
ſee him, and acquainted him with my deſign, he
offer'd me that Favour with ſo much Generoſity,
that I neither cou'd, nor was willing, to refuſe it.
Nor did his Civility ſtop there, for he oblig'd me
to accept of a Lodging in his fine Houſe, where I
need not be afraid of my Countrymen's Indignation.
However, to avoid any accident that might happen,
I ſeldom or never go abroad but in his Company,
tho', conſidering the kindneſs he expreſſes to me on
all occaſions, I believe I might walk alone without
any danger. For he is ſo much honour'd, reſpected,
and belov'd by all the Nations who reſide here,
and even by the <hi>French</hi> themſelves, that there is not
one Perſon, ſmall or great, who wou'd not run to
<hi>Japan,</hi> rather than diſoblige him. He is uſually
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51983:135"/>
call'd, <hi>The Conſul,</hi> without any Addition, as if he
were the only Perſon in <hi>Smyrna</hi> who cou'd pretend
to that Character: The reſt of the <hi>Conſuls</hi> are
known by the Names of their reſpective <hi>Nations,</hi>
but he is <hi>The Conſul</hi> by way of Eminency. And,
to give you a better Idea of him, I can aſſure you
that ſo univerſal a Love and Eſteem is purely the
effect of his Merit; for he is Maſter of a vaſt Wit,
his Temper is ſweet, civil, and obliging, and in one
world he is a <hi>compleat Perſon,</hi> which I think is the
juſteſt and moſt expreſſive Account I can give you
of him. There are ſo many Perfections requir'd
to make a Man worthy of that Character, that a
<hi>Compleat</hi> Man is certainly one of the greateſt Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of this Age: But all theſe Qualifications are
united in him. He is deſcended of a Noble and
Ancient Family in <hi>Holland,</hi> which can boaſt of an
uninterrupted Succeſſion for above 300 Years, and
is Ally'd to the Principal Houſes in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
Among the reſt I ſhall only mention its late Alliance
with the moſt ancient Family of the <hi>Collier's,</hi> which
is originally of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Their<note n="*" place="margin">Advance.</note> Device
is the fineſt that ever I ſaw, nor do
they bear it in vain. For they have upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ſignaliz'd their Courage in Military Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and there are at preſent three of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
in the King's Service, who ſeem to make Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
their Favourite Vertue, and are known and
eſteem'd by the whole Army, both for that and a
thouſand other no leſs glorious Endowments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam de Hochepied</hi> is the Siſter of the preſent,
and Daughter of the late <hi>Dutch Ambaſſador.</hi> She's
a finiſh'd Beauty, and has the Air of a Princeſs;
and beſides (which is as true as it ſeems incredible)
ſhe is abſolutely Miſtreſs of <hi>Seven</hi> of the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and oppoſite <hi>Languages</hi> in the World. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which is her natural Tongue, ſhe
ſpeaks the <hi>French, Italian, Greek, Ruſſian, Turkiſh,</hi> and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:51983:135"/>
                  <hi>Arabian</hi> Languages, and ſpeaks 'em all ſo perfectly
well, that I have often heard her explaining to
Interpreters the true ſenſe of certain hard Words,
of which they were ignorant before. In ſhort,
ſhe's in all reſpects an admirable Perſon. Judge,
Sir, whether I can think the time tedious which
I ſpend in ſuch agreeable Company, and in a
Houſe where I'm ſo kindly entertain'd; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you can blame me for not haſtening my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.
I'm reſolv'd to expect an occaſion for
<hi>Venice,</hi> and I believe 'twill be a long time before
I can find one; becauſe the <hi>Venetian</hi> Veſſels never
venture to appear in this part of the Sea, till the
<hi>Turkiſh Fleet</hi> be laid up, tho' they have no great
reaſon to dread it, ſince the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> for all
his <hi>Grandeur,</hi> is Maſter only of <hi>Eleven Ships of War.</hi>
'Tis true, if all his Galleys wou'd put to Sea,
their number might at leaſt amount to 200; but
as Affairs are manag'd at preſent, his Navy
makes no great Figure. You may expect a more
particular Account of theſe things in my next.

               <p>YOU might juſtly accuſe me of Lazineſs, or
want of Complaiſance, if I ſhou'd not employ
the leiſure I enjoy at preſent in recollecting my
Obſervations concerning the Government, Religion,

therefore to ſatisfie your Curioſity, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
you with a ſhort account of theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
avoiding all impertinent Repetitions of thoſe
obvious and common Remarks that are to be met
with in almoſt every Book of <hi>Voyages.</hi> And I hope
the Points I propoſe to handle will furniſh me with
ſufficient Matter for <hi>Three Letters;</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> of which

               <p>The <hi>Turkiſh Empire,</hi> according to the primitive
and fundamental Conſtitution of the Government,
is abſolutely and entirely <hi>Deſpotic;</hi> that is, a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
and Arbitrary Power is lodg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in the Perſon
of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> whoſe <hi>Will</hi> is the only <hi>Law</hi> by
which he Rules, and who acknowledges no other
Maxim of Government than <hi>Sic volo, ſic jubeo.</hi> He
is not curb'd by any written Law or Cuſtom, and
thoſe whom he Oppreſſes have not ſo much as a
right to Complain. He may take away any Man's
Eſtate, and either keep it, or give it to another.
Sometimes he paſſes by the moſt ancient <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s,
and in one day advances a ſimple <hi>Chiaux,</hi> or even
a <hi>Cook,</hi> to the Dignity of <hi>Grand Viſier.</hi> He ſends
for the Heads of thoſe whom he has a Mind to be
rid of, who are Murder'd without any Trial or
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51983:136"/>
Form of Juſtice, and even without knowing the
Reaſon of his Diſpleaſure. In one Word, his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is the ſupreme and uncontroulable Law. This
unlimited Power of the <hi>Sultan</hi> is founded on the
<hi>Mahometan Religion,</hi> which enjoins a blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to all his Commands under Pain of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But the <hi>Turks</hi> of late have render'd their Slavery
more tolerable; for tho' they have made no Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the Conſtitution of the Government,
their Practices are very different from what they
were heretofore.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> is the Chief Miniſter of State,
and is call'd <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Turks,</hi> to ſhew how much
the <hi>Sultans</hi> ſlight and undervalue that Title, in Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Old <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> who beſtow'd
Kingdoms on their Favourites. This is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ſtiles himſelf <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of Perſecuted Kings,</hi> and the <hi>Diſtributer of
Crowns;</hi> tho' he wears none himſelf, not even on
the Day of his Public Inauguration, for the only
Badge of his Imperial Dignity is a magnificent <hi>Sabre,</hi>
enrich'd with precious Stones, which the <hi>Mufti</hi> girds
to his Side. The <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> is entruſted with the
whole Management of Affairs, and his Power is
almoſt equal to the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s. He is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the Arbiter of Peace and War, and creates the
Fortune of all the Great Officers in the Empire.
'Tis true, he ought not to do any thing without the
Advice of a Council, compos'd of ſeven <hi>Baſſa's,</hi>
call'd the <hi>Viſiers of the Bench:</hi> but they have only a
Shadow of Authority, which ſcarce deſerves to be
mention'd.</p>
               <p>The next in Order, are the <hi>Baſſa's,</hi> who are a
ſort of Vice-Roys in the Provinces. Their Office
is to adminiſter Juſtice exactly, and to keep the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in Subjection to the Government. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
oblig'd to pay a yearly Tribute to the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi>
both of Money and Slaves, without reck'ning
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:51983:137"/>
the <hi>Carache,</hi> Cuſtoms, and other Impoſts that are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
exacted. This is the utmoſt Extent of the Legal
Authority of the <hi>Baſſa's;</hi> but they commonly abuſe
their Power, and are more arbitrary Tyrants than
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> himſelf. Their principal Aim is
to raiſe their Fortune ſpeedily; and in order to that
they rob the Widow and Orphan, and fill the Land
with Spoil and Oppreſſion, never ſcrupling to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a gainful Crime, tho' attended with the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
Circumſtances. The <hi>Sultan</hi> is forc'd to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
his Knowledge of theſe Diſorders, for want of
Power to ſuppreſs 'em: for every <hi>Baſſa</hi> maintains
ſome ſtanding Forces at his own Charge, whoſe
Aſſiſtance he may command upon all Occaſions, if
their Payment be not wholly neglected. Whereas
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who for the moſt part wants Money to
pay his Army, and perhaps does not ſhew himſelf
twice in his Life to the Soldiers, is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Maſter of 'em, that he is almoſt always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to ſubmit to their Authority. This is the
fatal Source of all thoſe Seditions that have ſo often
ſhaken, and will at laſt overturn the Empire. For
how can we ſuppoſe that Subjects will either love
or fear a lazy Prince, that takes no Share in the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of State or War: a Prince, that contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with a Chimerical Show of Grandeur and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and ſeems rather to be a <hi>Mock-King</hi> in a <hi>Farce</hi>
than a <hi>Ruler</hi> of <hi>Kingdoms?</hi> 'Tis plain both from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Experience, that a great Monarch, who wou'd
be the <hi>abſolute</hi> Maſter of his Subjects, ought to apply
himſelf to the Execution and Reformation of the
<hi>Laws,</hi> and above all, to gain the Eſteem and Affection
of his <hi>Soldiers,</hi> whom he ought to look upon as the
ſureſt Prop and Support of his Authority. An <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
in a State cannot remain indifferent; they muſt
and will have a Maſter; and will either continue
faithful to the <hi>Crown,</hi> or eſpouſe the Intereſt of
ſome deſigning <hi>Subject:</hi> And therefore it ought to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:51983:137"/>
be the Prince's Care to diſcover their Inclinations, and
to act accordingly. <hi>Kings</hi> are as feeble <hi>Creatures</hi> as other
Men, and as unable to perform any Great Action by
their own Power: but when they are at the Head of
100000 Men, all devoted to their Intereſt, 'tis then
they become the Terrour of the World, and their
<hi>Power</hi> is almoſt as boundleſs as their <hi>Ambition.</hi> The
Fate of Monarchs depends on their Armies, and
without theſe neither <hi>Alexander, Caeſar,</hi> nor <hi>Lewis</hi>
XIV. cou'd have gain'd one Inch of Ground. This
is ſo evident and certain a Truth, that never
any Perſon had the Confidence to controvert it:
and I believe the <hi>Ottoman Emperours</hi> are of the ſame
Opinion, tho' all their Actions ſeem to be grounded
on very different, and even oppoſite Maxims. A
Prince that wou'd ſecure the Loyalty of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
muſt take care of 'em himſelf, viſit 'em of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
give out all Orders, preferr Men of known Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
keep both the Officers and Soldiers under an exact
Diſcipline, and pay 'em as punctually as he can. The
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> obſerves not one of theſe Maxims,
and therefore he may blame himſelf for the Unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of his Army. But the Government is guilty
of another Blunder, which, in my Opinion, is no
leſs fatal than the former; I mean the uſual way of
appeaſing Seditions, which break forth oftner than
once a Year. For every Tumult that ſhakes the
<hi>Sultan</hi>'s Throne, coſts him the Heads of a hundred
of his Principal Officers: The <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
made the firſt Sacrifice, and afterwards that
important Charge is entruſted to ſome young and
unexperienc'd Perſon, as if a <hi>Miniſter of State</hi> cou'd
ſpring up in a Night like a <hi>Muſhroom.</hi> This Cuſtom
is directly oppoſite to common Sence, which teaches
us that no Man ought to be advanc'd to ſo high a
Poſt, but one that has been long accuſtom'd to State-Buſineſs,
and has ſpent his whole Life in fitting
himſelf for the Management of ſo great a Truſt.

Theſe Conſiderations give me an <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Turkiſh
Empire,</hi> which I cannot expreſs better than by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it to a <hi>Coach</hi> drawn by a Sett of <hi>ungovernable
Horſes,</hi> each of which pulls a contrary Way.</p>
               <p>If we deſcend lower, and take a more particular
View of the Government, we ſhall every where
find the diſmal Effects of theſe Diſorders. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
of the <hi>Head</hi> are uſually communicated to
the <hi>Inferiour Members:</hi> And I never ſaw a Country,
where Juſtice is ſo often and ſo impudently pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by thoſe who are entruſted with the Execution
of it. I know 'tis the Cuſtom of ſome Travellers
to magnifie the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> way of adminiſtring Juſtice:
but ſuch a groundleſs Conceit is only the Effect of
the powerful Inclination moſt Men have to admire
every thing that is unuſual or extraordinary. And
I'm confident that a bare Account of their Method
of Judging <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Criminal</hi> Cauſes, will give you
a very different Notion of their boaſted Juſtice;
You, I ſay, who are not tainted with thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prejudices, but are always wont to judge of
things as they <hi>are in themſelves,</hi> without conſidering
whether they are <hi>rare</hi> or <hi>common.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have no <hi>written Laws</hi> but what are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which they hold to be the
<hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Standard</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and every
thing that it forbids is eſteem'd unlawful and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable.
Nevertheleſs the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and <hi>Cadi's</hi> judge
as they pleaſe, for the Book is very ſhort, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a great deal fuller of Dreams and Abſurdities
than of Laws or Moral Precepts; and thoſe few it
contains are ſo ambiguouſly expreſs'd, and deliver'd
in ſo looſe a Manner, that theſe greedy Officers
cannot deſire a more favourable Opportunity to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their Avarice. Beſides they judge without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
and cauſe the Sentence to be executed upon
the Spot. 'Tis true, ſome highly injur'd Perſons
have recourſe to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s <hi>Divan;</hi> but
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:51983:138"/>
then the Injuſtice muſt be very plain and inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or 'tis in vain to expect Satisfaction; and that
is ſo ſeldom obtain'd, that few prudent Men will
venture on ſo troubleſome and expenſive a Journey:
for ſince 'tis not the Cuſtom to record either the
Pleadings, or the Sentence, the Judge may eaſily
elude all the Arguments of his Accuſers. 'Tis true,
the Number of the Plaintiffs is uſually ſo great, and
the Informations of other Officers ſo poſitive, that
the Truth is at laſt diſcover'd, and the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are puniſh'd. But tho' few <hi>Cadi's</hi> leave the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
with Honour, there is not the leaſt Care taken
to repair the Loſſes of thoſe whom they have ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd.
For, beſides what I intimated before, that
their Proceedings are not regiſter'd, the new <hi>Cadi</hi>
is uſually as great a Rogue as his Predeceſſour; ſo
that the poor oppreſs'd People muſt bear their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
as patiently as they can, without the leaſt
hope of Redreſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cadi's</hi> are mere Beggars when they are firſt
advanc'd to that gainfull Poſt, and their Commiſſion
laſts but a Year: yet in leſs than three Months
theſe tatter'd Scoundrels exchange their Rags for
gawdy Habits, and a magnificent Equipage, and at
the End of the Year are Maſters of vaſt Eſtates.
We exclaim againſt our <hi>Lawyers</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and will
not ſuffer thoſe who have ſpend 20 or 30 Years in
a perpetual Hurry of Buſineſs, to enjoy the Fruit of
their Labours in Peace, tho' the Fortunes they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
are for the moſt part ſo ſmall, that they can
hardly ſubſiſt without Employment. But I'm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
a little Acquaintance with the Cuſtoms of
this Country wou'd quickly ſtop the Mouths of our
Grumblers: for if the <hi>Cadi</hi> of a conſiderable City
were permitted to hold his Office <hi>Ten</hi> Years, he
wou'd be richer than a <hi>Preſident au Mortier.</hi> He
that went laſt from <hi>Smyrna</hi> gain'd above 40000
Crowns; and you may eaſily judge how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:51983:139"/>
the Inhabitants were oppreſs'd by a Judge that
cou'd in one Year heap up ſo great a Treaſure. 'Tis
true he durſt not expect the Coming of his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour,
but march'd off eight days before, without
ſtaying to take leave of his Friends, according to
the prudent Cuſtom of his Brother-Rogues. For they
are oblig'd to give an Account of their Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the ſucceeding <hi>Cadi's,</hi> who make a Report
to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s <hi>Divan,</hi> and even ſecure their
Perſons when the Comlaints againſt 'em are very
numerous and grievous. But they are too conſcious
of their Guilt, to ſtand a Trial which they know
wou'd infallibly ruine 'em; and therefore to avoid
ſo terrible a Danger, they go immediately to their
Patron at the <hi>Port,</hi> who receives his Share in the
Booty, and grants 'em his Protection, without which
they wou'd be puniſh'd without Mercy. Yet ſome
of 'em chuſe rather to buy their Peace of the new
<hi>Cadi,</hi> who, for 8 or 10 <hi>Purſes,</hi> which amounts to 12
or 15000 <hi>Livres,</hi> gives 'em as favourable a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
as they can deſire.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Civil</hi> Affairs are judg'd by the <hi>Cadi</hi> according
to the Depoſition of <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> without any regard
to <hi>Writings.</hi> For ſuppoſe you had lent 1000 <hi>Piaſters</hi>
to a Man upon his Note or Bond, if he can but
ſuborn two Men to affirm that they ſaw him pay
you ſuch a Summ, you muſt infallibly loſe your
Money. This Cuſtom gives a fair Opportunity to
Men of diſhoneſt Principles to abuſe their Creditors;
ſince they may eaſily find Witneſſes to prove any
thing, and even without giving themſelves the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to enquire after 'em. One word, or a Sign to
the <hi>Cadi</hi> is ſufficient, who always keeps a Score of
Knights of the Poſt ready to ſerve him or any of
his Friends on ſuch Occaſions. After the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
Parties have pleaded their own Cauſe as
well as they can, for there are no Barriſters in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi>
one of 'em clutches his right Fiſt, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51983:139"/>
ſtretches out one, two, or three of his Fingers, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying,
that he intends to preſent the <hi>Cadi</hi> with a
like number of <hi>Purſes:</hi> Then his Adverſary makes
the ſame Sign, and offers more or leſs, as he thinks
fit. At Night the <hi>Cadi</hi> ſends for the higheſt Bidder,
and having receiv'd his Preſent, requites his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
very civilly the next Day, with a favourable
Sentence; after which he that is caſt muſt either
pay the Debt immediately, or go to Priſon. And
(which is ſtill more unjuſt) if you are not able to
maintain him, and pay the Fees of thoſe who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
him, you muſt reſign the third Part of your
Debt; in Conſideration of which the poor Wretch
is kept rotting in the Gaol, till an exact Enquiry
be made into his Eſtate. And if it be found
that the Debt exceeds the Value of his Goods and
Poſſeſſions, the Payment is chang'd to a Corporal
Puniſhment, and he receives as many <hi>Baſtinadoes</hi>
on the Soals of his Feet as he owes <hi>Piaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rs,</hi> unleſs
the Summ exceed 500; for they ſtop there, becauſe
the ſtrongeſt Man cou'd not endure a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Blows without manifeſt Danger of his Life.</p>
               <p>The Judgment of <hi>Criminal</hi> Affairs belongs to the
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> who proceeds after the ſame manner: for
<hi>Money</hi> clears the moſt barbarous Malefactor, and
without that, Juſtice degenerates to Cruelty. The
<hi>Stake</hi> and the <hi>Gibbet</hi> ſeem to be only made for <hi>poor
Villains;</hi> nor can there be a greater Sign of Poverty,
than when a Man is proſecuted for Murder or Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery:
for ſince the <hi>Baſſa</hi> and <hi>Vaivode</hi> are always ſure
of 40000 <hi>Aſpers,</hi> the uſual Price of Blood, which
they exact of thoſe before whoſe Doors the Murder
was committed; they ſeldom or never take care to
execute Juſtice on the Murderer. I have ſeen a <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſary,</hi>
who had kill'd above 30 Men, walk thro'
the Streets unmoleſted, and with as much Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as the moſt innocent Perſon in Town. Nor
are theſe corrupt Tribunals leſs favourable to the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:51983:140"/>
Robbers that infeſt the Country, and commit ſuch
frequent Diſorders, that no wiſe Man will venture
to travel one day's Journey without being compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arm'd, and extremely well accompany'd. 'Tis
true, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> from time to time ſends ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
<hi>Baſſa's,</hi> attended with ſome Companies of
Soldiers, to ſearch after unpuniſh'd Malefactors. 'Tis
not above two Months ſince one of 'em came to
this City, and put to Death about 20 Criminals: but
after all, theſe <hi>Great Inquiſitors</hi> are only terrible to thoſe
who are unable to buy their Favour, and even he
whom I mention'd had above fifty Cuſtomers of
this Sort. Among the reſt I ſhall only take notice
of one Inſtance of his mercenary Clemency; and
I hope I ſhall eaſily obtain your Pardon for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
which will not only divert you, but give
you a clearer <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>A Man that us'd to work in a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant's
Garden, was ſeiz'd for a Murder, which he had
committed 7 or 8 Years before, and finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be in a very hopeleſs Condition, ſent to beg
the Merchant's Aſſiſtance, who was too generous to
ſuffer one that had ſerv'd him to be hang'd for wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of 2 or 300 <hi>Piaſters.</hi> The poor Man relying upon
his Maſter's promis'd Kindneſs, began immediately
to treat with the <hi>Baſſa</hi> for his Ranſom, which at laſt
was fix'd at 100 <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pieces of Gold, commonly
call'd <hi>Scherifi,</hi> worth 2 1/4 <hi>Piaſters</hi> each. The Bargain
being thus concluded, the Merchant gave the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Scherifi</hi> to the <hi>Baſſa's Kiaia,</hi> who deliver'd but
<hi>ninety</hi> to the Treaſurer, having kept the other <hi>ten</hi>
for himſelf. Now you muſt know that there are in
<hi>Turkey</hi> a ſort of Men who pretend to be <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s
<hi>Kinſmen,</hi> and are highly reverenc'd by all Perſons:
They wear green <hi>Turbants,</hi> and are call'd <hi>Scherifi,</hi>
which (you may remember I told you) is the
Name of the <hi>Pieces of Gold.</hi> When the Trial came
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51983:140"/>
on, after the Witneſſes were examin'd, the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
perceiving that there were <hi>Ten</hi> Pieces wanting of the
promis'd Summ, and imagining that Defect to be
a deſign'd Breach of the Agreement, ſeem'd to be
very nice and inexorable, and proteſted that he
cou'd not acquit a Man who was poſitively charg'd
with Murder by ſo many Witneſſes. But the <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
who by good Fortune was acquainted with the
whole Tranſaction, told him, That <hi>tho' theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
declar'd him Guilty, there were</hi> 100 Scherifi <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
who aſſerted his Innocencey, and that their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
was much more convincing. I thought,</hi> ſaid the
<hi>Baſſa, I ſaw but 90; 'Tis true,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Secretary,
but there were</hi> Ten <hi>more, who by reaſon of their great Age,
could not come up to your Preſence, and therefore ſtaid
below with the</hi> Kiaia. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who was neither
Deaf nor Dull, underſtood the Meaning of thoſe
Expreſſions, and declar'd the accus'd Perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Puniſhments</hi> inflicted on
Malefactors in this Country; ſuch as <hi>Beheading,
Drowning, Hanging, Strangling, Burning, Impaling,</hi>
and the <hi>Strappado.</hi> The two <hi>laſt</hi> are the moſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
and are appointed only for <hi>Turks</hi> that renounce
the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Faith, or <hi>Renegado's</hi> that return to the
Profeſſion of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, or for thoſe
who are convicted of ſome very enormous Crimes.
<hi>Robbers</hi> and <hi>Murderers</hi> are <hi>hang'd, Women</hi> are <hi>drown'd,</hi>
thoſe who are found <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>Rebellion</hi> or <hi>Sedition</hi>
are <hi>beheaded,</hi> and <hi>Burning</hi> is the Puniſhment of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
for <hi>blaſpheming</hi> againſt <hi>Mahomet</hi> or the <hi>Alcoran,</hi>
or for <hi>lying</hi> with a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Woman. Not long ago
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> very narrowly
eſcap'd Suffering for the laſt of theſe Crimes. He
kept a fair <hi>Turk</hi> with all imaginable Secrecy, and
never ſaw her at his own Houſe. To prevent Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he procur'd a very pretty Yacht, in which he
went with her almoſt every day, to take the Air
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51983:141"/>
on the Sea of <hi>Marmora,</hi> or in the Canal of the
<hi>Black Sea,</hi> and uſually ſtaid abroad till Night. But
at laſt the whole Intrigue was diſcover'd by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion
of a Servant; and they were both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by an Order from the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> who
at firſt threaten'd to burn the Merchant, but was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
prevail'd with to accept a Fine of 10000
<hi>Piaſters,</hi> which he paid upon the Spot. Several
Travellers have particularly deſcrib'd the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
call'd <hi>Impaling,</hi> and the <hi>Strappado,</hi> as well as
the Manner of giving the <hi>Baſtonnado;</hi> and therefore
I ſhall forbear troubling you with an Account of
what I ſuppoſe you know already.</p>
               <p>The Government of the Cities is manag'd by Five
Kinds of <hi>Officers,</hi> the <hi>Baſſa, Sub-Baſſa, Vaivode, Cadi,</hi>
and <hi>Receiver of the Cuſtoms.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> is properly the
Governor, and judges criminal Cauſes; and the <hi>Sub-Baſſa</hi>
is as it were his Deputy. The <hi>Vaivode</hi> takes care
of regulating Affairs in the City; he walks the Round
twice a-week, to examine the Weights and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
to obſerve whether unlicens'd Tipling-Houſes
are kept, to puniſh Drunken Perſons, and all thoſe
in the general who commit any Diſorders in the
City. Thoſe who are found guilty of theſe or any
other Abuſes, muſt immediately ſubmit to the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonnado,</hi>
eſpecially <hi>Drunkards,</hi> who are always very
roughly handl'd. The Function of the <hi>Sub-Baſſa</hi> is
not much different. The <hi>Cadi</hi> is the Judge of all Civil
Suits; and the <hi>Receiver of the Cuſtoms,</hi> who in <hi>France</hi>
is only a private Perſon without any Authority, is
in this Country empower'd to take Cognizance of
all fraudulent Practices relating to Pecuniary Duties,
in all which Caſes he is both <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jealouſie that reigns among theſe Officers is
ſo furious and extravagant, that they make it their
principal Buſineſs to diſcredit and ruine one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
'Tis a Pleaſure to hear the Characters which
they mutually give of each other; and aſſoon as
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51983:141"/>
they are acquainted with a Man, they begin to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
him with a Harangue on that Subject. The
<hi>Vaivode</hi> of this Place, with whom I have contracted
a ſort of Friendſhip, has told me a thouſand Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and <hi>Cadi's,</hi> which, as diverting as
they are, I ſhall rather chuſe to relate, than to write
to you: and therefore you muſt even content your
ſelf at preſent with one, for a Taſte of the pleaſant
Entertainment you may expect at our next Meeting.</p>
               <p>One who had as little Money as Honeſty, that is,
none at all, was ſent in the Quality of a <hi>Cadi,</hi> to a
certain Town, where he hop'd the Wranglings of
the Inhabitants wou'd quickly ſupply all his Wants.
But, as ill Luck wou'd have it, his Predeceſſors had
quite ſpoil'd his Market; and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> which
makes ſome <hi>wiſe</hi> Men <hi>mad,</hi> had made theſe <hi>Fools,
wiſe.</hi> They heard he was a very hungry Devil,
and they reſolv'd to ſtarve him out-right; wiſely
conſidering that 'twas both their Duty and Intereſt
to live in Peace, or at leaſt to refer all their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
to the Arbitration of honeſt Friends, rather
than by tearing out their own Bowels to feed
their Greedy Devourer. And it ſeems they ſhow'd
as much Firmneſs in purſuing, as Wiſdom in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſo advantageous a Reſolution: for the <hi>Cadi</hi>
ſpent ſix Weeks or two Months after his Arrival,
without any Employment but Fretting, Curſing, and
biting his Thumbs out of meer Spite, becauſe he
could find nothing elſe to exerciſe his Teeth upon.
One day as he was walking in the Streets, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
no doubt on his wretched Fate, he perceiv'd a
Baker, who was drawing a good Fat Gooſe out
of his Oven; and the ſavoury Vapours aſſaulting
his Noſe, rais'd a furious Commotion in his empty
Stomach: his Mouth water'd at the delicious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct,
and his Guts began to rumble with a more than
ordinary Violence. In a Word, he was ſo little
Maſter of himſelf, that he cou'd not forbear beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51983:142"/>
a Piece; but the Baker told him that the Gooſe
belong'd to one of his Neighbours, who had ſent it
to him to be bak'd. <hi>Come,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Cadi, take
my Advice: We'll eat the Gooſe, and when the Man
comes to fetch it, tell him that as thou wert bringing
it out to ſee whether 'twas ready, a Flock of Geeſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to fly by the Door, and that his Gooſe perceiving
its old Companions, wou'd not be perſuaded to ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
'em. If he will not be ſatisfy'd with ſo fair an
Anſwer, let him e'en take his Courſe; for he muſt
bring thee before me, and I'll find a Way to ſave
thee harmleſs.</hi> There was no need of more Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for the Baker's Stomach was on the <hi>Cadi</hi>'s
Side, and his Conſcience made no long Reſiſtance:
and therefore aſſoon as he had ſignify'd his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
the <hi>Cadi</hi> began to beſtir his Chaps ſo vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that by the Aſſiſtance of his Friend the Buſineſs
was diſpatch<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in an Inſtant. Two Hours after the
Man came for his Gooſe, and the Baker repeated
his Leſſon very gravely: but the Jeſt was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
too groſs, and the Man was ſo offended at
the Baker<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Inſolency, that he took him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
by the Neck, and told him that he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reſtore his Gooſe, or go before the <hi>Cadi;</hi> for
there are no Sergeants or Bailiffs in this Country.
Theſe Threatnings made no great Impreſſion upon
the Baker, ſince he knew that he was to be judg'd
by his Fellow-Rogue; ſo that he was as free from
Fear, as the other was full of Anger and Revenge
and walk'd very peaceably along with his Accuſer.
But they had not gone far when they were ſtopp'd
by the Lamentations of a poor Mule-Driver, whoſe
Mule was fall'n under her Load, and lay ſprawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Ground. The Baker was mov'd with
Compaſſion at the poor Man's Misfortune, who
came to beg his Aſſiſtance, and took hold of the
Mule's Tail, while the Man himſelf endeavour'd t<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:51983:142"/>
the Baker finding more Reſiſtance than he expected,
and pulling with all the Force of a Brawny Arm, at
laſt pluck'd the Tail off at the Root. The Owner of
the Mule was ſo enrag'd at this unlucky Accident,
which made him incapable of following his uſual Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation,
that not regarding the Baker's charitable
Intention, he ſeiz'd him by the Collar, and help'd
the other Man to hale him along, for he was ſo
far from going willingly as before, that conſidering
the <hi>Cadi</hi> was not at all concern'd in this Affair,
and not daring to rely too much on his Friendſhip,
leſt he ſhould be oblig'd to pay the Price of
the Mule, he made a ſhift to get looſe; and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make his Lſcape, ran into a Houſe not far
from the place where he met the Mule-Driver. But,
as Miſchances never come ſingle, it happen'd that
there was a Woman ſix Months gone with Child,
ſtanding in the Court of the Houſe where he
thought to ſecure himſelf, who was ſo terrify'd at
the ſight of a Man running, with two others pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
him furiouſly at his Heels, that ſhe miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
immediately. Thus the poor Baker had the
Mortification to ſee the Number of his Enemies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd;
for the Woman's Husband join'd with the
other Two, and all together carry'd him before the
<hi>Cadi,</hi> whom they acquainted with the Reaſon of
their Coming, expreſſing their ſeveral Complaints
in a very mournful Tone, to move their Judge to
Compaſſion.</p>
               <p>I'm a very poor Man, <hi>ſaid he who had receiv'd
the firſt Injury,</hi> and all the Town knows that I had
but one Gooſe, which I intended to eat with my Wife

Bleſſing of the Prophet. But alas! this wicked Man
has ſtoll'n her from me, and wou'd put me off with a
ridiculous Story: he has the Impudence to tell me that

I had but one Mule, <hi>cry'd the Second,</hi> which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
me and all my Family; I had but one, and now,
alas! I may ſay I have none: for the poor Creature
had the Misfortune to fall under her Burden, and this
Man happen'd to paſs by as I was endeavouring in vain
to relieve her. I intreated him to help me, but inſtead
of raiſing her up, he pluck'd off her Tail.</p>
               <p>Ah! Wou'd I had no more Reaſon to complain than
either of the reſt, <hi>ſaid the Third.</hi> I have but one

of the Prophet I did the Feat, and in a little time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to ſee the Fruit of my Labours. But that Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
has this Day deſtroy'd what I cou'd hardly get in
three Years: he put my Wife into ſuch a Fright, that
ſhe miſcarry'd three Months before the Time.</p>
               <p>Judge, Sir, with what Impatience and Fear the
Baker expected his Doom, and how the <hi>Cadi</hi> was
puzzl'd to bring him off in Spite of ſo many cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Accuſers. Yet the Difficulty of the Caſe
ſerv'd only to ſhow the Dexterity of the Judge, as
you will eaſily perceive by his Anſwers to the <hi>Three</hi>
Plaintiffs.</p>
               <p>I cannot, <hi>ſaid he to the Firſt,</hi> oblige a Man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
a Gooſe, which, he affirms, flew out of his hands.
I confeſs the Story is very ſurprizing and improbable,
but we muſt always give credit to an honeſt Man's
Word: And therefore ſince thou canſt produce no Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
to diſprove it, thou muſt e'en reſolve to bear thy
Mifortune patiently.</p>
               <p>As for thee, <hi>ſaid he to the Second,</hi> 'tis another
Caſe: He has pluck'd off thy Mule's Tail, and made
her unfit for Service. And therefore 'tis juſt that be
ſhou'd be oblig'd to keep her at his own Charge till
her Rump be heal'd.</p>
               <p>But thou, poor Man, <hi>ſaid he, turning to the Third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

ſay'ſt (and I believe thee) that it coſt thee three Years
Labour to get a Child: and after all thy Toil, this
Man by an unlucky Accident has made thy Wife caſt
her Bantling three Months before the Time. I condemn
the Rogue to take her home with him, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

again, and to keep her till ſhe be in the ſame Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Child as old as when he made her miſcarry.</p>
               <p>I will not ask your Opinion of this Story, till
you have heard both Parties: for the <hi>Cadi</hi> thinks
himſelf as honeſt a Man, and as worthy of your Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
as the <hi>Vaivode;</hi> and therefore you muſt e'en be
ſatisfy'd to hear his Tale next.</p>
               <p>A very Rich Man dy'd, and left his Son Heir to
his whole Eſtate, except 1000 <hi>Piaſters,</hi> which he
bequeath'd to the <hi>Tyrant of the Country.</hi> Now you
muſt know that the <hi>Turks</hi> are very religious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the <hi>Laſt-Wills</hi> of their Relations: and this
Young Man it ſeems was very nice in that Point.
His Ignorance of his Father's Meaning made him
extremely uneaſie; for he concluded that if he
ſhou'd detain another Man's Right, againſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
poſitive Command, 'twou'd certainly bring
the Curſe of the <hi>Prophet</hi> upon him. After he had
ſpent ſome time in conſidering where to beſtow the
Legacy, he reſolv'd to carry it to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> whom
he addreſs'd thus: <hi>Sir, My Father order'd me by his
Laſt-Will, to give</hi> 1000 <hi>Piaſters to the Tyrant of the
Country, without mentioning the Name of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Perſon. I was extremely troubl'd at the Obſcurity
of theſe Words, and not being able to unriddle the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
I thought my ſelf oblig'd to bring the Money to
you not as to a Tyrant, but as to the moſt powerful
Perſon in the Country.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who by chance was
an honeſt Man, reply'd very calmly, <hi>My Son, I neither
am, nor will be a Tyrant, carry the Money to the</hi>
Cadi, <hi>for he has more Right to it than I.</hi> The Young
Man perceiving that 'twou'd be in vain to urge him
to accept it, went according to his Advice, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:51983:144"/>
made the ſame Complement to the <hi>Cadi,</hi> whom he
found to be as generous as the <hi>Baſſa;</hi> for he told
him he cou'd not take it without injuring the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for whom it was deſign'd, and deſir'd him to
carry it to the <hi>Receiver of the Cuſtoms.</hi> But that Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
was as jealous of his Honour as either of the
reſt, and ſent the young Heir to the <hi>Vaivode,</hi> who
hearing that he had been with the other three, and
what Anſwers he had receiv'd from 'em, told him that
as his Conſcience oblig'd him to eaſe a Neighbour of a
Burthen that ſeem'd to be ſo troubleſome to him, ſo it
wou'd not permit him to receive it abſolutely <hi>gratis.
Let us,</hi> added he, <hi>make a feign'd Bargain; you ſhall
buy all the Snow in my Court for</hi> 1000 Piaſters, <hi>and
then I can take the Money with a ſafe Conſcience.</hi> The
Young Man, who had been bandy'd about ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and was glad to be rid of the Money on any
Terms, conſented immediately to the Propoſal. As
ſoon as the Bargain was concluded, and the Deed
of Conveyance written, the <hi>Vaivode</hi>'s Secretary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Fees; for in this Country the Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
muſt always pay for the Contract. The Young
Man was both vex'd and ſurpriz'd at the Impudence
of theſe Blood-ſuckers, and upbraided 'em with
their Injuſtice and Barbarity; adding, That he did
not expect to be troubl'd with their litigious Tricks
after he had freely preſented 'em with ſo conſiderable
a Summ: But neither his Anger nor Arguments cou'd
prevail, for he was forc'd at laſt to give the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
<hi>Ten Piaſters</hi> more; after which he went
home with a Reſolution to return no more to a
place where he had been ſo ill treated. But three
Days after the <hi>Vaivode</hi> ſent to acquaint him that
'twas time for him to remove his Commodity. The
Young Man imagining that they intended only to
put a Jeſt upon him for his fooliſh Bargain, bid the
Meſſenger tell his Maſter, that he might keep both
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:51983:144"/>
the Goods and the Money. But he was quickly
convinc'd, that he had beſtow'd the Legacy on the
Man who had the beſt right to it: For the <hi>Vaivode</hi>
forc'd him to remove all the Snow that was in his
Court.</p>

               <p>IN purſuance of the Method I propos'd in my
<hi>laſt,</hi> I ſhall in <hi>this</hi> Letter give you a brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Turkiſh Religion,</hi> which, in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe who profeſs it, is a <hi>New Law,</hi> Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by GOD, in the room of the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD, they ſay, has ſent <hi>Four Prophets</hi> to reveal
his Will to Mankind, and inſtruct us in the way to
Salvation. The firſt was <hi>Enoch,</hi> who Preach'd and
Propheci'd, but did not commit his Doctrine to
Writing. For, in thoſe Days, GOD communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Himſelf to Mankind in ſo ſenſible a manner,
that there was no need of a Written-Law. After
this Prophet had executed his Commiſſion, he was
taken up into Heaven, both Soul and Body. In
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:51983:145"/>
the mean time, GOD ſeeing that Men perverted
their Ways, and made the want of a Written-Law,
a Cloak and Pretext for their Tranſgreſſions, ſent
<hi>Moſes,</hi> who brought the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and gave 'em the Law which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from GOD. This was the ſecond Prophet,
whoſe Diſpenſation was to continue till the coming
of <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> whom they call the <hi>Breath
of God,</hi> acknowledging, that he was Conceiv'd by
Divine Operation, in the Womb of his Mother,
who remain'd a <hi>Virgin,</hi> even after his Birth. He
alter'd and reform'd the Law, according to the
Power with which God had entruſted him, and for
that reaſon incurr'd the hatred of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who
ſought to put him to Death, and hir'd the Traytor
<hi>Judas</hi> to betray him. But when he came to the
<hi>Oliv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>-Garden,</hi> they were ſeiz'd with ſo ſtrange an
Illuſion, that they Crucifi'd <hi>Judas</hi> inſtead of his
<hi>Maſter,</hi> who was, in the mean time, tranſlated to
Heaven, where he remains with the two former
<hi>Prophets.</hi> They ſay, this Opinion ſerves much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to diſplay the Glory of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> than the
<hi>Chriſtian Doctrine;</hi> and brand us with Folly and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
for believing that He whom we adore as God,
was ſhamefully Crucify'd. The very ſight of a
<hi>Crucifix</hi> fills 'em with Anger and Rage, pretending
that 'tis a horrid Injury to <hi>CHRIST,</hi> to repreſent
him in a State of Ignominy and Suffering. They
believe alſo that He will come to judge the World
at the laſt Day; but that He will firſt Reign upon
the Earth, and Marry, and beget Children. They
affirm, that He was a Holy Man, and a choſen
Veſſel; but they will not be perſwaded to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a <hi>Trinity</hi> of Perſons in the Godhead, ſaying,
That ſuch an Opinion wou'd abſolutely deſtroy
the <hi>Unity</hi> of that Sovereign Being, without which
He cou'd not be GOD.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:51983:145"/>
                  <hi>CHRIST</hi> was ſucceeded by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> after
whom there ſhall come no other <hi>Prophet.</hi> 'Twou'd
be an endleſs Task to reckon up all the Glorious
Titles they beſtow upon him.</p>
               <p>They differ not much from us in their Opinions
concerning the <hi>Divine Attributes.</hi> Only they have
ſuch a peculiar Fondneſs for <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> that they
extend it even to the moſt Indifferent Actions, yet
with ſome Limitations and Circumſtances which
'twou'd be very difficult to explain, and which they
themſelves do not well underſtand. Thus they are
firmly perſwaded, that under the Reign of ſuch an
<hi>Emperor,</hi> the State will infallibly and perpetually
have either a diſaſt'rous or happy Fate: And 'tis
this Perſuaſion that makes 'em ſo inclinable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
their <hi>Sultans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They believe, that there is an infinite number of
<hi>Angels,</hi> ſome <hi>Good</hi> and others <hi>Bad.</hi> The firſt are
call'd <hi>White,</hi> and the others <hi>Black</hi> Angels or Devils.
They imagine that every Man has two Angels that
attend him continually, and that one of 'em writes
down all his Good, and the other all his Bad Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
They addreſs their Prayers to the <hi>Black</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
as well as to the <hi>White,</hi> that they may ſecure
the Friendſhip both of the Inhabitants of <hi>Paradice</hi>
and <hi>Hell,</hi> tho', in their Opinion, the Souls of the
Damn'd enter not into the laſt of theſe Places till
the Day of Judgment. For 'tis an Article of the
<hi>Turkiſh Faith,</hi> that the Spirits of the Wicked remain
in their Graves, where they are tormented by the
<hi>Black Angels</hi> till the laſt Day, when they ſhall be
ſent to <hi>Hell,</hi> together with their Bodies, and ſuffer
very cruel Puniſhments, for the ſpace of One or
Two Thouſand Years, according to the Crimes
they committed in this Life; after which they
ſhall be releas'd, and admitted into <hi>Paradice,</hi> where
they ſhall enjoy the ſame Happineſs that is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Souls of Good Men. They think 'tis
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:51983:146"/>
inconſiſtent with the Divine Goodneſs, and blame
us for believing that GOD will puniſh a Man
<hi>Eternally</hi> for the Offences of ſo <hi>ſhort</hi> a Life: Yet,
ſince they are extremely afraid of <hi>Hell,</hi> they pray
very devoutly to the <hi>Black Angels</hi> that they wou'd
be pleas'd not to write down all their Ill Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Since you will doubtleſs look upon their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of the Soul's reſting in the Grave after Death,
to be very Abſurd and Ridiculous, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to give you a clearer Idea of their Thoughts
on that Subject.</p>
               <p>They differ from us in the account they give of
the manner how the Soul <hi>Informs</hi> and Animates the
Body. For whereas we believe, that theſe two
Subſtances are <hi>Hypoſtatically</hi> united, and that Death
conſiſts in their Separation; they imagine that the
Soul and Body have no dependance on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that the abſence of the Spirit (which,
for Example, may take a Journey to Paradice) is
not neceſſarily attended with the Deſtruction of the
Corporeal Machine; tho' they acknowledge that
the Body is always depriv'd of Reaſon, during its
Separation from the Soul. Thus they believe, that
the only reaſon why a <hi>Fool</hi> or <hi>Ideot</hi> acts and ſpeaks
abſurdly, is becauſe his Soul (and conſequently his
Reaſon) has forſaken him. As for <hi>Lunatic</hi> and
<hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> Perſons, who have ſome lucid Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
and are only depriv'd of their Reaſon by Fits,
they endeavour to ſolve the Difficulty, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
that the Soul leaves her Manſion at certain
times, and returns again after a ſhort Abſence:
And this, they ſay, is an effect of Providence,
either for the Puniſhment of the Diſtemper'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or for ſome other hidden Deſign. When a
Chriſtian tells 'em, that theſe Fits of Madneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the Diſorder and Indiſpoſition of the
Organs, which hinders the Soul from performing
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51983:146"/>
her Functions, they upbraid him with the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of his Opinion; for, ſay they, the Soul of
Man is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and therefore cannot be ſtopt or
obſtructed in the exerciſe of her Faculties by <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
which is a Subſtance of another, and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
different Nature. From this Principle they infer,
that neither the Preſence nor Abſence of the Soul
can produce any alteration in the Machinal courſe
of the Body, which is only mov'd by Springs:
And that when one of the principal Springs fails,
or is ſpoil'd, the Soul cannot prevent the Ruine of
the whole Engine. This, they pretend, is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Truth, and confirm'd by daily Experience:
And therefore we muſt not be ſurpriz'd, that a
dead Body neither Walks, Breathes, nor performs
any Operation, tho' the Soul be ſtill lodg'd in it:
For ſince ſhe is not the Author of the Machine
which ſhe Inhabits, 'tis beyond her Power either
to keep it entire, or to repair it after it falls to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.
GOD alone, who made and contriv'd it,
can reſtore it, and renew its motion, as he will do
at the laſt Day. To confirm this Hypotheſis, they
cite, with a great deal of Confidence, what <hi>Pliny</hi>
relates of a Man whoſe Soul and Body were wont
to be ſeparated every day, ſo that the Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
without any appearance of Life or Motion,
till the return of the Soul, which afterwards us'd
to give an Account of all the wonderful things ſhe
had ſeen in the remoteſt Countries. This, you
know, is one of that Author's fabulous Stories, and
yet the <hi>Turks</hi> pretend to draw from thence an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and irrefutable Proof of their Opinion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
they give the Soul a <hi>Figure</hi> exactly like that
of the Body, and upon this Principle maintain,
that the Souls of the Damned are beaten in the
Grave, and ſuffer Torments, which a pure Spirit
ſeems incapable of feeling. They believe alſo,
that the <hi>Beaſts</hi> ſhall not be depriv'd of the benefit of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:51983:147"/>
the Reſurrection, and that at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they will give an Account before <hi>CHRIST,</hi>
of all the Kindneſſes and Injuries they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from Men. And this Conceit makes 'em
ſo charitable to <hi>Irrational</hi> Creatures, that ſome of
'em buy little <hi>Birds</hi> and live <hi>Fiſhes,</hi> that they may
afterwards ſet 'em at liberty.</p>
               <p>They fanſie themſelves <hi>polluted</hi> by ſeveral Things,
ſuch as <hi>Sleeping,</hi> the touching of a <hi>Woman,</hi> and of
all ſorts of <hi>Excrements;</hi> and therefore after any ſuch
Accident, they perform their Ablution or <hi>Abdeſt,</hi>
waſhing their Face, Hands, Ears, and Feet, and
looking towards <hi>Mecca.</hi> In the Day they content
themſelves with waſhing their Mouth, which they
repeat as often as they have occaſion to obey the
neceſſities of Nature: But after <hi>Copulation</hi> their
Ablutions are much more Ceremonious, for they
waſh their whole Body in a Bath, as they do alſo
when a drop of <hi>Wine</hi> falls upon their Garments. I
have ſeen ſome of 'em ſo extreamly Superſtitious,
that they wou'd never afterwards wear a Veſt that
was pulluted with <hi>Wine;</hi> tho' there are others of
leſs ſcrupulous Tempers who never refuſe to taſte
that ſpirituous Liquor, and even ſome that continue
Tipling till they have quite loſt their Senſes.</p>
               <p>They <hi>Pray</hi> five times a Day, in the Morning at
the break of Day, at Noon, at Three a Clock in
the Afternoon, at Six in the Evening, and an hour
after the cloſe of the Evening. But they go only
twice to the <hi>Moſquee,</hi> to the <hi>Sabah</hi> in the Morning,
and to the <hi>Quindy</hi> at Three in the Afternoon: And
even many of 'em perform their public Devotions
only on <hi>Friday,</hi> which is their Feſtival-Day, as
<hi>Sunday</hi> is ours. On that day an <hi>Iman,</hi> or Prieſt of
the Law, ſays a Prayer, and delivers a kind of
Sermon or Exhortation to the Hearers: But the
Men are too jealous to ſuffer any of the Fair Sex
to come to the Public Places of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>

The <hi>Turkiſh Lent</hi> is ſhorter, but much more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
than that which the Catholicks obſerve; for
they neither Eat, Drink, nor Smoak Tobacco
while the Day laſts; ſo that this may be juſtly
reckon'd a very mortifying Seaſon, eſpecially when
it happens to fall out it Summer, conſidering the
violent Heat that reigns throughout all <hi>Aſia.</hi> This
Faſt is call'd <hi>Ramadan,</hi> and laſts <hi>Thirty</hi> Days, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time the <hi>Turks</hi> are oblig'd by the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choran</hi>
to begin their Faſt every Morning aſſoon as
they can diſcern a Black Thread from a White, and
to continue their Abſtinence till the ſame Hour at
Night, which is proclaim'd by the <hi>Muezins</hi> and
<hi>Marabouts</hi> from the top of the <hi>Minare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s.</hi> Then they
let looſe the Reins to their wild Deſires, ſpending
the whole Night in Gluttony and Drunkenneſs,
and roaming about the Streets: For during this
Month they turn the Day into Night, and the
Night into Day, and greedily hunt after all ſorts
of Pleaſures, to allay the ſeverity of the Faſt,
which, notwithſtanding all the Pains they take to
ſweeten it, is very diſagreeable to Fleſh and Blood.
It ends with the <hi>Moon,</hi> and every one is ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to ſee the <hi>New-Moon</hi> that releaſes 'em from
this loath'd Conſtraint, that they run up to the
Tops of Houſes and Mountains to ſee their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
riſe, and aſſoon as they perceive her gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Horizon, they ſalute her with ſeveral Bows,
and the Caſtles proclaim the glad Tidings with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Diſcharges of their Artillery. The Three
ſucceeding Days are ſpent in Mirth and Jollity;
every Man puts on his beſt Cloaths, and entertains
his Friends. This is properly the <hi>Turkiſh Eaſter,</hi>
and is call'd the <hi>Great Bairam,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from
ſeveral Feaſts or <hi>Bairams</hi> of leſs conſequence, ſuch

'Twou'd be needleſs to tell you, that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Atonement for Sins, they neglect no occaſion of
buying their future Peace. 'Tis this Principle that
excites 'em to leave conſiderable Legacies at their
Death, which, according to the Will of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd,
are employ'd in repairing public Fountains,
building Bridges, or paying the Portions of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Maidens. I have already told you, that their
Charity extends even to <hi>Beaſts;</hi> and I ſhall take this
occaſion to add, that they are particularly kind to
<hi>Dogs,</hi> tho' naturally they do not love 'em, and
keep none in their Houſes. Yet the Cities are full
of 'em, where they wander about the Streets, and
perpetuate their Kind like Wild Beaſts. They are
ſo mangy, lean, and miſerable, that one wou'd
think they cou'd not live a day; and I have
ſeen ſome of 'em at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſo near Starving,
that they wou'd jump into the Sea for ſome Bits of
Carrion which they perceiv'd at the bottom. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſince they cou'd not poſſibly live on what
they find in the Streets, the richer ſort of <hi>Turks</hi>
buy Proviſions for 'em, and feed 'em every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at their Doors with Eleemoſinary Bread and
Fleſh. They reckon it a heinous Crime to kill
a <hi>Dog, Cat, Horſe,</hi> or any other Creature that
is not appointed for the Food and Nouriſhment
of Mankind: For they pretend that ſince Man is
not the Author of their Life, he ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
'em of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:51983:148"/>
I ſhall take this occaſion to relate the Story of an
Accident that happen'd in this place, not above
eight days ago. There was a <hi>Dog</hi> that us'd always
to howl, when he heard the <hi>Muezin</hi> calling the
People to Prayers from the <hi>Minaret.</hi> The <hi>Turks,</hi>
who are Superſtitious, even beyond Imagination,
cou'd not behold their moſt Holy Rites profan'd
by an Impudent Cur, without an extream Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
Yet they durſt not kill him for fear of
offending GOD. However, they found out a
way to chaſtiſe the daring Criminal, without
provoking the Wrath of Heaven: For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all their Veneration for his Perſon, they
were loath to allow him greater Privileges than they
claim for themſelves. After mature deliberation
on ſuch a weighty and important Caſe, they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
at laſt to ſeize him, and carry him before
the <hi>Cadi,</hi> where they Indicted him as a <hi>Dgiahour,</hi>
or <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who derided the Law of the <hi>Prophet.</hi>
The Evidence was ſo plain, that after a full Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poor <hi>Towzer</hi> was condemn'd to be Cudgel'd to
Death, and the Sentence was immediately execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Perhaps the oddneſs of this Relation may
make you ſuſpect my Veracity ſo far as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that I Invented it on purpoſe to divert you:
But, in ſhort, you muſt either believe it, or in
plain Terms give me the Lye. 'Tis true, I dare
not warrant the truth of the Story I'm going to
tell you, but ſince it relates to the ſame Subject,
you muſt e'en be content to read it.</p>
               <p>Beſides the <hi>ordinary Dogs</hi> that wander about the
Streets, there are others call'd <hi>Jaccals,</hi> or <hi>Chacaly,</hi>
that run in the Fields, where they make a hideous
noiſe every Night. They do not Bark like other
Dogs, but have a kind of ſharp or yelling Cry,
peculiar to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now (if you'll believe the <hi>Turks</hi>) the <hi>Chacaly</hi>
or <hi>Wild-Dogs,</hi> in ancient Times, Inhabited the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:51983:149"/>
Cities, and the other <hi>Dogs</hi> liv'd in the Fields.
They were perpetual and irreconcilable Enemies
to each other, and fought many bloody Battles, in
one of which the <hi>Chacaly</hi> were Victorious, and the
Forces of the <hi>Dogs</hi> were ſo ſhatter'd that they
were oblig'd to beg a Peace, which was granted
by their Generous Enemies on theſe favourable
Terms; That the <hi>Dogs</hi> might ſtay in the City till
their Wounds were heal'd, during which time the
<hi>Chacaly</hi> ſhou'd retire to the Country; but that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
both Parties ſhou'd return to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Habitations. Theſe Conditions were pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
perform'd by the <hi>Chacaly,</hi> but the <hi>Dogs</hi>
growing luſty and ſtrong, reſolv'd to maintain
their Poſt, and have ever ſince remain'd in the
City. 'Tis the remembrance of this Injury that
makes the <hi>Chacaly</hi> call to the <hi>Dogs</hi> every Night in
their yelling Language, and ſummon 'em to reſign
a Place which they uſurp'd ſo unjuſtly; and they
anſwer as they Bark, crying ſtill, <hi>Yock, Yock,</hi> which,
in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language ſignifies <hi>No, no.</hi> But, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of inſiſting longer on theſe inſipid Fables, I
ſhall return to the <hi>Turkiſh Religion,</hi> which is little
leſs abſurd and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>They are ſo beſotted with their Conceits about
<hi>Predeſtination,</hi> that they uſe no manner of precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to preſerve themſelves from Infectious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
and are offended at the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for taking
care of their Health on ſuch occaſions. A <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
told me the other Day, that during the time
of a very violent Contagion, he perceiv'd at a
diſtance ſome <hi>Turks</hi> in the Street, who were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
the Body of a Man that dy'd of the Plague
to his Grave. As he was turning another way on
purpoſe to avoid meeting 'em, one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
ran after him, and claſp'd him in his Arms,
rubbing his Body upon him ſeveral times; after
which opening his Veſt, and ſhowing him a large
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:51983:149"/>
Plague-Sore under his right Pap, <hi>Learn,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>not to forſake dead and dying Men.</hi> And indeed, if
we reflect ſeriouſly on the little care they take to
ſtop that raging Diſeaſe, we may reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that none of 'em cou'd eſcape without a
kind of Miracle, if the Diſtemper were as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
as 'tis generally thought to be. For they
never avoid the Converſe of thoſe who come from
an infected Place, and there are few Ports where
there are not ſome Veſſels that left the Plague
reigning in the Towns from whence they came.
Yet this neglect of the Cautions us'd by other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on ſuch occaſions, is never attended with
the leaſt ill-conſequence, unleſs when the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the Air has a ſort of natural tendency
to promote and ſpread the Contagion, for then it
burſts forth impetuouſly like Gun-Powder ſet on
Fire. But this is not the Opinion of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
for they abſolutely deny that the Infection depends
either on the Conſtitution of the Air, or of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Bodies, pretending that it proceeds wholly
from a ſupernatural Cauſe, and that when GOD
deſigns to execute the fury of his Vengeance on
obſtinate Sinners, he ſends an Army of <hi>black An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
to deſtroy 'em. They add, that every Angel
receives of Bow and two ſorts of Arrows, to inflict
either <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> with orders to ſhoot their
mortal Arrows at thoſe whom they find under the
Power of <hi>Sin,</hi> and to direct the others at ſuch who
are only tainted with ſome <hi>Pollution.</hi> 'Tis then that
Men ſtand moſt in need of the Protection of their
<hi>White Angels,</hi> who intercede for 'em, and do what
they can toward the Blows that are aim'd againſt
'em, ſometimes covering a Man entirely, when
they perceive a great number of Enemies ready
to attack him. Yet notwithſtanding all their Care,
their Aſſiſtance proves oftentimes ineffectual; and
therefore 'tis the Intereſt of every Man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:51983:150"/>
his own Safety, to ſecure himſelf againſt the
Vengeance of thoſe deſtroying Spirits, by leading
a ſinleſs Life. The <hi>Turks</hi> pretend, that they infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
perceive the Blow, when the Arrow pierces
'em: And even ſome <hi>Franks</hi> who have been two
or three times ſeiz'd with the Plague, aſſure me,
that they felt a certain <hi>Pricking</hi> in the place where
the Carbuncles break forth; which is not at all
improbable, ſince 'tis uſual for ſuch a troubleſome
Senſation to accompany all ſorts of Tumors. But
to conclude this Subject with my Letter, I ſhall
only add, that the Plague which rages ſo often in
theſe Oriental Countries, and ſweeps away ſuch
vaſt numbers of the Inhabitants, is in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
neceſſary for their Preſervation. For the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the People is augmented Yearly by at leaſt
a fifth Part, and you will be the leſs inclin'd to look
upon this as a Paradox, if you conſider that they
are allow'd to marry four Wives, and to keep ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Concubines, and that there are 50000 Slaves
brought every Year into <hi>Turkey.</hi> So that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
wou'd be quickly over-ſtock'd with Inhabitants,
and in all probability, the People wou'd be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Starving, if their numbers were not leſſen'd
by Peſtilential Diſtempers. And notwithſtanding
the terrible Havock it makes, the Land is ſtill ſo full
of People, that a Man wou'd think their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
ſhou'd make 'em forbid the Exportation of
<hi>Corn,</hi> eſpecially ſince they have none to ſpare.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Proceed now to give you an account of the
<hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which (you
may remember) was the laſt of the three Subjects I
undertook to Diſcourſe of. I told you once before,
and I ſhall take this occaſion to repeat it as an
undoubted Truth, that they are oppoſite to us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in every thing: And this Oppoſition appears
in nothing more plainly, than in their obſtinate
adhering to their ancient Cuſtoms. In our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
we are never at reſt till we have Invented ſome
new faſhion; and Beauty it ſelf wou'd hardly
pleaſe us without the Charms of Novelty. Hence
the <hi>Turks</hi> accuſe the <hi>Franks</hi> of Fickleneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy,
and boaſt of their own ſtrength of
Mind that fixes ſteddily on ſolid Enjoyments,
without deigning to take notice of Trifles. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I was at firſt ſomewhat ſurpriz'd at the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
I obſerv'd between their Temper and ours,
but after I had taken all poſſible care to free my
ſelf of thoſe Prejudices that are wont in ſuch caſes
to put a biaſs upon the Judgment, and ſeriouſly
conſider'd the Genius of that Nation; I found that
what they call <hi>Strength of Mind, Conſtancy,</hi> or <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi>
is at the bottom nothing elſe but a pure <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility,</hi>
and a <hi>Weakneſs</hi> that is altogether inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
in any reaſonable Creature. And you will
certainly be of the ſame Opinion when I have told
you, that they are ſo far from ſtudying to improve
their Underſtandings, that in a manner they profeſs
and glory in their Ignorance; and that their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
is confin'd within ſo narrow a compaſs, that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:51983:151"/>
they never undertake a Voyage without ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
or ſordid Deſign. Beſides, their Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Unconcern'dneſs for the Public Intereſt;
the almoſt Monaſtical Solitarineſs of their Life,
and the Lazineſs of their Temper are convincing
Proofs of the truth of my Aſſertion. 'Tis true
indeed, this Character muſt not be extended ſo far
as to comprehend the Principal Officers of State,
or thoſe who are engag'd in Court-Intrigues: But
as for all the reſt, they ſcarce ever look beyond the
Sphere of their own Families: And provided their
Wives be handſome, their Horſes well Curry'd, and
their Servants Submiſſive and Reſpectful, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
give themſelves the trouble of enquiring after
the Affairs of the reſt of the World. Contented
with their Lot, they ſit whole Days on a <hi>Sopha,</hi>
without any other Occupation than drinking <hi>Coffee,</hi>
ſmoaking <hi>Tobacco,</hi> or careſſing their <hi>Wives:</hi> So that
their whole Life is a continual Revolution of
<hi>Eating, Drinking,</hi> and <hi>Sleeping,</hi> intermixt with ſome
dull <hi>Recreations.</hi> Yet they cannot be accus'd of
Luxury in Eating, for a Hen boil'd with Rice,
Coriander-ſeed, and Sugar is the beſt Diſh that
comes before a Man of 20000 Livres a Year, and
'tis this they call <hi>Pilo.</hi> The reſt of the Meal is
made up with a Diſh of Fiſh, and ſome Sweet-Meats,
in which there is always more Honey than
Sugar. When the Hour of Dinner comes, they
lay upon the <hi>Sopha</hi> an Octangular or Hexagonal
Table of Olive-Wood or Walnut-Tree, inlaid with
Ivory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and uſually not above a Foot and a
half in Diameter. Then having laid the Cloath,
they ſerve up all the Diſhes one after another:
There are no Napkins laid upon the Table, but a
Servant ſpreads 'em on his Maſter's-Knees', and
ſtands behind him to cut his Meat; for 'tis beneath
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Grandeur to do any thing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
All their Veſſels are of Earth; only the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51983:151"/>
Great Men uſe Porcelain: For they reckon it a
very heinous Sin to eat in Silver, tho' the Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
of their Horſes are uſually of that Metal.
They never drink at Meals, tho' they are wont to ſit
a conſiderable while; but aſſoon as the Table is
remov'd, the Servants bring a Cup of <hi>Sorbet,</hi> and
then <hi>Coffee,</hi> and <hi>Tobacco,</hi> with which they divert
themſelves all the reſt of the Day, unleſs they
take a fancy to go to the Women's Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or to play at <hi>Shells</hi> with one of their
Servants, who muſt always ſuffer himſelf to be
beaten, as he wou'd avoid a worſe Beating with
a Cudgel. At Night there is a Mat brought, with
Sheets and a Coverlet; and they Sleep all Night in
the ſame place where they Eat, Drunk, Play'd, and
Doz'd all the Day: For they are altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the uſe of dark <hi>Alcoves,</hi> and Beds with
double Curtains. This is their conſtant manner of
Living, after they ceaſe to be <hi>Youths;</hi> for betwixt
the Years of <hi>Fifteen</hi> and <hi>Twenty,</hi> they ſpend their
Time in <hi>Riding, Archery,</hi> throwing <hi>Darts,</hi> and other
Exerciſes of that nature in which they uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to a great Perfection. I do not think that we
have any Grooms or Jockeys in <hi>Europe</hi> that exceed
'em, tho' if you ſaw 'em on Horſeback, you
wou'd think they cou'd not ſit a moment. For
their Stirrups are ſo ſhort, that they muſt almoſt
bend their Legs as much as when they ſit upon a
<hi>Sopha:</hi> Their Boots are of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>Goat's</hi>-Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo wide and ill-made, that nothing can be
more troubleſome to a Horſeman: and all the
Furniture of their Horſes is ſtill more incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.
Their Saddles are as large and high as a
Pack-ſaddle, eſpecially before, and faſten'd on the
Horſe's back, with a broad Girth or Surcingle
drawn over it, without which 'twou'd be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to keep it from falling off, by reaſon of its
weight. Inſtead of Bridles they uſe Snaffles that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:51983:152"/>
wou'd be thought bad enough for a Cart-Horſe in
<hi>France,</hi> if they were not richly gilded. Judge, Sir,
what a Figure a Man can make on the back of a
Horſe Trapp'd after ſuch a manner, and what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
he can have over him. Yet I aſſure you the
<hi>Turks</hi> rule their Horſes as they pleaſe, without either
Spur or Whip, inſtead of which they only uſe a
Stick or <hi>Batoon</hi> three Foot long, and as big as a very
large Cane, which they hold in the middle, ſtriking
the Horſe ſometimes with one end, and ſometimes
with the other, according as they wou'd have him
turn to either ſide. I never ſaw Horſes run ſo faſt
as theſe, nor ſtretch their Bodies to ſo great a
length, for their Belly almoſt touches the Ground.
The <hi>Turks</hi> have an admirable dexterity at throwing
Darts on Horſeback; for riding at a full Gallop,
they Dart their Sticks at a <hi>Turbant,</hi> which is ſet up as
a Mark, without once miſſing their Aim. And
which is ſtill more ſurprizing, they throw their
<hi>Batoon</hi> as far before 'em as they can, then putting
their Horſe to the ſwifteſt Gallop they take it up
with their Hand without ſtopping. You will eaſily
perceive the extraordinary difficulty of ſtooping ſo
low to take the Stick from the Ground, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what I told you of the extraordinary
heighth of their Saddles and lowneſs of their Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups.
None but <hi>Turks</hi> are able to perform this
Feat of Activity, for the <hi>Franks</hi> are ſo far from
being capable of Learning it, that they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ride the Horſes of this Country. One of our
Merchants, newly come to this place, met with
an Accident t'other Day, that confirms the truth of
what I was ſaying; for his Horſe ran away with
him ſo furiouſly, that he cou'd not poſſibly pull in
his Head; and I believe he wou'd have certainly
broke his Neck, if he had not been ſtop'd by a
<hi>Greek</hi> who happen'd to meet him. This proceeded
from his Ignorance of the way of ſtopping a Horſe
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:51983:152"/>
in this Country; for when a Horſe runs away with a
Man, he muſt never pull the Bridle, ſince that wou'd
only make him go the faſter; but take hold of one
of the Reins, and turn his Head to the Right-hand,
ſtriking him with the Rod on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>'Tis none of the leaſt Conveniencies of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that the Keeping of a <hi>Horſe</hi> is ſo cheap, that the
Charge of one does not amount to above 30 <hi>Piaſters</hi> a
Year: 'Tis true they muſt be very carefully tended,
and the <hi>Turks</hi> make it their principal Buſineſs to look
after 'em. They viſit 'em very often, and when they
find 'em in a good Condition, the <hi>Saïs</hi> is always
rewarded with ſome Careſſes; but if there be any
thing amiſs, he may certainly expect the <hi>Baſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor are their <hi>Servants</hi> more chargeable to 'em
than their Horſes. Their <hi>Valets de Chambre</hi> coſt 'em
not above 40 <hi>Piaſters</hi> a year, for Wages, beſides
their Entertainment, which is inconſiderable: and
the Servants without the Houſe, ſuch as the <hi>Saïs,
Porters,</hi> and <hi>Gardeners,</hi> have but 25. As for their
Entertainment, the Rate of their Board-Wages is
fixt at a <hi>Paras</hi> a day, beſides Bread. The <hi>Paras</hi> is a
ſmall Piece of courſe Silver, not exceeding the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of five <hi>Dutch Liards:</hi> and yet ſome of 'em are
ſuch admirable Husbands, that they make a ſhift to
ſave part of ſo poor an Allowance.</p>
               <p>I ſhall in the next place proceed to give you an
Account of the uſual <hi>Habit</hi> of the <hi>Men.</hi> Their
<hi>Breeches</hi> are long and wide, reaching down to
their Heels, and cloſe both behind and before, with
leathern Stockings or Socks faſten'd to the lower
part of 'em: and all this is call'd the <hi>Chaſcir.</hi> Their
<hi>Shirts</hi> are of very fine Cotton Cloth, made exactly
like a Woman's Smock, only they are much wider,
eſpecially at the Sleeves, which are always left open.
Over this, inſtead of a Waſt-Coat, they wear a
<hi>Cafetan,</hi> which is a kind of a long Caſſock with
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:51983:153"/>
narrow Sleeves, button'd at the Wriſts, like the
Sleeves of our Doublets. In the Summer the <hi>Cafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
are made of very white Cotton Cloth, and in
Winter of Silk Stuff quilted with Cotton. Beſides,
they are girt about the Waſte with a Silken Scarf,
reſembling Brocard, that ſerves to hang their <hi>Gangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are</hi>
or Poniard, the Handle of which is pretty large,
and oftentimes made of Ivory, the Teeth of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Fiſh, or Silver, and enrich'd with Jewels either
true or counterfeit. They never appear with a
<hi>Sword</hi> or <hi>Sabre,</hi> but when they go into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
nor are the <hi>Franks</hi> ſuffer'd to wear one, except
the Ambaſſadours and Conſuls.</p>
               <p>Their upper Habit is a Cloth Gown, which they
call a <hi>Veſt.</hi> In Summer 'tis only lin'd with <hi>Taffeta;</hi>
but in Winter 'tis furr'd with a Skin, call'd <hi>Samour,</hi>
which is ſo coſtly that Great Perſons have ſome that
are worth 1000 Crowns a piece. The Hair of it
is black, fine, and ſo long, that one may hide
an Egg in it; I ſpeak only of the beſt ſort; for
there are ſome of all Prices. Beſides they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
furr their Veſts with Ermins, or with the
Skin of a bluiſh ſort of Weaſel, or of the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
Fox; and the poorer ſort with Kid, Foine,
or Lambs Skin. They never put any <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi>
on their Cloaths, unleſs on Days of Ceremony,
ſuch as the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s publick Entry, their Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Day,
or ſome ſuch Solemnity: and even then
'tis the peculiar Privilege of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s and Grandees
of the Port, to wear Ornaments of that Nature.
You ſee what a Difference there is between the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of this Place, and of <hi>France,</hi> where even the
<hi>Footmen</hi> are gilt all over from Head to Foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beauty</hi> is the Object of the reigning Paſſion of the
<hi>Turks:</hi> and when they ſpeak of a <hi>handſome Woman</hi>
they ſeem to be all tranſport and extaſie. Yet they are
oblig'd to court their Miſtreſſes by Proxy, and even
muſt be contented to take a Character of 'em from
<pb facs="tcp:51983:153"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 page">

Continency, are forc'd to make uſe of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of Keeping <hi>Concubines,</hi> or buying <hi>Slaves.</hi> For
a Man muſt not expect to live upon Charity here,
tho' the Women are not at all guilty of Cruelty:
but want of Opportunity hinders 'em from beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Favours, and 'tis impoſſible for a Gallant
to thrive among ſuch cautious Husbands. There is
no Slavery equal to that of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Women;
for a Servant may live Twenty Years in a Family
without ſeeing the Face of his Miſtreſs. The Door
of the Womens Apartment is a <hi>Ne plus ultra</hi> for
every thing that looks like a Man, and the utmoſt
Limit of the Womens Liberty; I mean Women of
Quality, who have Baths in their Houſes; for the
meaner Sort muſt go to the public Baths at leaſt once
a Week. Notwithſtanding this cloſe Confinement,
I'm inform'd that they ſometimes venture upon a
little Recreation; but they are ſeldom ſo bold, and
the Motion muſt always proceed from themſelves.
When they are in the Humour, and have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
a promiſing Play-fellow, they ſend him a
Declaration of Love by ſome old Confident. But
wou'd you not be ſurpriz'd inſtead of a <hi>Billet-doux</hi>
to find nothing but Bits of <hi>Charcoal, Scarlet Cloth,
Saffron, Aſhes,</hi> and ſuch like Traſh, wrapt up in a
Piece of Paper. 'Tis true theſe are as ſignificant as
the moſt paſſionate Words; but 'tis a Myſtical Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
that cannot be underſtood without a <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Interpreter. I know a <hi>Frank</hi> that once receiv'd ſuch
an Invitation, and was extremely puzzl'd to know
the Meaning of it. After ſeveral ſucceſsleſs Trials
to unriddle the Myſtery, he entruſted the Secret to
one of the Ambaſſadour's Interpreters, who told
him that ſuch a <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Wife deſir'd him to viſit her
ſuch a day, when her Husband wou'd be gone
from home, and that the Woman who brought him
the Meſſage wou'd introduce him to her Apartment.
At the ſame time he advis'd him not to go, and us'd
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:51983:154"/>
all the Arguments that his Experience or Prudence
cou'd ſuggeſt to diſſwade him from expoſing himſelf
to ſo terrible and unavoidable a Danger. But the
<hi>Frank</hi> had ſuch a longing deſire to taſte ſo delicious a
Bit as he fanſi'd his Unknown Miſtreſs to be, that
he reſolv'd to ſacrifice all to the Dear Expectation,
and went boldly to the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Houſe at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
where he really found a kind and beautiful
Lady, who put him in poſſeſſion of his expected
Delight, and entertain'd him with all the Joys of
Love, for two days; at the end of which his
Strength being quite exhauſted by the laborious Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and finding himſelf altogether unfit for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he ask'd leave to be gone, and was extremely
ſurpriz'd when his Requeſt was deny'd, in a very
harſh and uncivil Manner. Then beginning to reflect
on the Interpreter's wiſe Admonition; he walk'd
about the whole Apartment, ſearching in every Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
for a place where he might eſcape unperceiv'd.
At laſt he came to the <hi>Laundry</hi> or Waſhing-Houſe,
where he found a Woman-Slave, who perceiving
his Melancholy, and gueſſing the Cauſe of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to condole his Misfortune in a manner that
made him utterly deſpair of Relief. For ſhe told
him that 'twas her Miſtreſs's conſtant Practice to
ſecure her own Reputation by the Death of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
adding, that to her certain Knowledge above
<hi>Twenty</hi> of 'em had been ſtrangl'd ſince ſhe came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Family, and that he cou'd not reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a milder Treatment than his Predeceſſors had
met with before him. <hi>Yet,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>ſince we are both</hi>
Chriſtians, <hi>I'll endeavour to ſave your Life, if you do
not force me to hate you by refuſing to grant me one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
I have been ſhut up in this place theſe Twenty
Years, and in all that time have not ſeen the Face of
a Man:</hi> Oblige <hi>me but once, and afterwards I ſhall
find a way to ſet you at Liberty.</hi> The Terms were
ſomewhat hard for a Man in his Condition; but
ſince his Life was at ſtake, he made a Vertue of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:51983:155"/>
and <hi>perform'd</hi> as well as he cou'd. The
poor Woman, who had been a Stranger ſo long to
the Pleaſure of Love, was raviſh'd with the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd
Delight; and having given him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Bleſſings, help'd him to make his Eſcape thro'
the Chimney, which brought him to a Platform,
from whence he leap'd into the Street, and has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſince found the leaſt Inclination to make Love to
a <hi>Turkiſh Lady;</hi> which is certainly the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Recreation that a <hi>Frank</hi> can chuſe. The <hi>Turks</hi>
require ſo much Modeſty and Diſcretion in their
Wives, that they wou'd never pardon 'em if they
ſhou'd ſuffer a Man to <hi>ſee</hi> 'em, or <hi>ſpeak</hi> to 'em:
and I ſhall never forget what an <hi>Aga</hi> once ſaid to
<hi>Monſieur de Chateauneuf</hi>'s Secretary. This Gentleman
was telling the <hi>Aga</hi> after the <hi>French</hi> way, that is very
<hi>indiſcreetly,</hi> that he had ſeen and ſpoken with one
of <hi>Mahomet the Fourth</hi>'s <hi>Odaliſche's,</hi> who was turn'd
out of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> after that Prince's Misfortune.
The <hi>Turk,</hi> who cou'd not hear him longer with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
reply'd very angrily, that ſhe was a baſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and unworthy of her former Dignity. Then
the <hi>Secretary</hi> endeavour'd to perſuade him that ſhe
had no ill Deſign in what ſhe did, and that 'twas
only an innocent Curioſity that made her willing to
be inform'd of the <hi>French</hi> Cuſtoms, of the Beauty
of the Ladies in that Country, and of their Way
of Living. But the <hi>Aga,</hi> inſtead of being pacify'd,
continu'd to rail again the <hi>Odaliſche</hi> ſo vehemently,
that the <hi>Secretary</hi> began to repent his Freedom, and
to ſwear and proteſt that ſhe was one of the moſt
vertuous Perſons in the World, and that ſhe was not
guilty of the leaſt criminal Thought. At laſt the
<hi>Aga,</hi> loſing all Patience, reply'd in a Rage; <hi>Sir, All
that you have ſaid ſignifies nothing. If ſhe had been
honeſt, ſhe wou'd never have ſuffer'd you to ſee her,
much leſs to ſpeak to her. If a Man ſhou'd put his
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:51983:155"/>
Hand into your Pocket, wou'd you excuſe him for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he did it out of pure Curioſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since I have had occaſion ſo often to mention the
<hi>Turkiſh Women,</hi> 'twill not be improper to give you
ſome Account of their <hi>Habit,</hi> which is not much
different from that of the <hi>Men,</hi> only 'tis a great
deal richer. They wear a <hi>Cafetan</hi> of Gold-Brocard,
faſten'd before with large Pearls, or little Knots of
Diamonds. It covers their Shoulders entirely, but
'tis cut ſo deep before, that their whole Breaſts
wou'd remain naked, if their <hi>Smock,</hi> and a little
fort of <hi>Waſte-Coat</hi> that comes over it, did not hide a
part of 'em. This <hi>Waſte-Coat</hi> ſits very cloſe to the
Body, and keeps up the Breaſts, which is a great
Conveniency to thoſe whoſe Breaſts are naturally
looſe and ſwagging: ſo that all Defects are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd,
and the moſt curious Eye can perceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>enchanting Beauties.</hi> Above the <hi>Cafetan</hi>
they wear a <hi>Leathern Girdle,</hi> cover'd with Plates and
Studs of Gold and Silver, and enrich'd with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Stones that caſt a great Luſtre. Their <hi>Smock</hi> is
always of the fineſt flower'd Silk, and hangs over
their <hi>Chacſir,</hi> which in Summer is only made of the
ſame Silk, by reaſon of the exceſſive Heat. Every
prudent <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ought to keep his Eyes from glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
that way; if it be poſſible for any Man to
preſerve his Reaſon at the Sight of the enflaming
Object, for this Stuff, which is no thicker than Tif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fany
or Gawze, gives the raviſh'd Beholder an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
unclouded View of all the moſt charming
Beauties that are ſo carefully conceal'd by our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Their upper <hi>Veſt</hi> is either of Cloth or Velvet
embroider'd, or of ſome rich ſort of Cloth of Gold:
In Summer 'tis furr'd with <hi>Ermin,</hi> and in Winter
with <hi>Samour.</hi> Their <hi>Head-Dreſs</hi> is ſo magnificent
and becoming, that you can hardly form a ſuitable
Idea of it unleſs you had ſeen it; tho' the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Deſcription may in ſome meaſure ſatisfie your
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:51983:156"/>
Curioſity. Their <hi>Talpo</hi> is a pretty long Velvet-Cap,
made of Eight Pieces, the outward Circle being
juſt large enough to receive the Head; but it widens
by degrees towards the Top, not unlike to a cloſe
Crown. 'Tis adorn'd with the richeſt Embroidery
of Gold, Silver, and Pearls: and is ſo long, that it
wou'd fall back upon the Shoulders, if it were not
very artificially rais'd above the Head, where they
pleit and fold it with as much Care as our Ladies do
their <hi>Fontanges</hi> and <hi>Top-Knots.</hi> 'Tis alſo enrich'd
with long Strings of Pearls curiouſly interwoven,
and ſtrew'd with Diamonds, Rubies, and all ſorts
of Jewels, beſides one or two <hi>Aigrets</hi> of Diamonds.
To keep it up they bind it about the Head with a
<hi>Frontlet,</hi> about two Fingers breadth broad, and ſo
rich, that it may be fitly call'd a <hi>Diadem;</hi> for 'tis
cover'd all over with Gold and Precious Stones.
Round this <hi>Frontlet</hi> there are little Gold Chains,
with a Diamond hanging at one, an Emerald at
another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which dangle upon the Forehead, and
on both ſides of the Face. I need not tell you that
ſuch magnificent Dreſſes are only us'd by <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s
Wives, for tho' Jewels are cheaper here than in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
they are ſtill ſo chargeable, that it requires a
very conſiderable Eſtate to make ſo great a Figure.
However I can aſſure you that every Woman, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her Ability, decks her ſelf to the beſt
Advantage; and the whole Dowry, or the Money
that is given by the Father, is laid out on Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the Bride. But when a Woman's Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not ſufficient to purchaſe ſo many Jewels, ſhe
muſt content her ſelf with a plain <hi>Frontlet</hi> of Gold,
or Silver-gilt; and ſome that cannot reach ſo high,
only tye an embroider'd Handkerchief about their
<hi>Talpo's,</hi> which is the Dreſs of the pooreſt Sort, and
even the meaneſt <hi>Cobler</hi>'s Wife will not appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. As for their <hi>Hair,</hi> they make it up into a
long Treſs, about the breadth of four Fingers, that
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:51983:156"/>
falls backward, and ſometimes reaches to their
Heels; and they whoſe Hair is not becoming, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſupply that Defect, by mixing falſe
Hair among it. Beſides, there is a little Curl on
each ſide of the Forehead, that runs along the Face:
And they are very careful to keep theſe Curls in
Order, and to dye 'em Black with a certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
that ſerves alſo to dye their <hi>Brows,</hi> which
are always extremely handſome: For they take
care to have 'em ſhap'd with a Razor, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
apply to the ſhav'd Parts a certain Paſte,
call'd <hi>Pilo,</hi> which hinders the Hair from grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Turkey,</hi> as well as in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Women generally
<hi>Paint;</hi> for tho' they're aſham'd to acknowledge it, I
met with a <hi>Greekiſh</hi> Woman, who ſcrupl'd not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that few of her Sex abſtain from that Cuſtom.
Their <hi>White Paint</hi> is a ſort of very thick Greaſe, which
I cannot deſcribe, ſince I had not the Curioſity to
enquire how they make it. But as for their <hi>Red
Paint,</hi> 'tis nothing elſe but <hi>Cochineel,</hi> prepar'd with
<hi>Cream of Tartar,</hi> and boil'd ſo long till there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
only a Tenth Part of the Compoſition.
They uſe it with ſo much Succeſs, that I believe it
might ſerve for <hi>Spaniſh Vermilion,</hi> and even is, in
my Opinion, more natural. They alſo Paint their
Nails Red, but not with <hi>Cochineel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Women are the moſt charming
Creatures in the World: They ſeem to be made
for Love; their Actions, Geſtures, Diſcourſe, and
Looks are all Amorous, and admirably well fitted
to kindle a ſoft and laſting Paſſion. Since they
have nothing elſe to do, they make it their only
Buſineſs to <hi>Pleaſe;</hi> which they do ſo ſucceſsfully,
and in ſo natural and eaſie a Manner, that few
Husbands take the benefit of the Law, that allows
'em to divorce their Wives when they pleaſe. This
ſeems ſo ſtrange and ſurprizing, that I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:51983:157"/>
reckoning it a ſort of Prodigy, when I reflect
on the <hi>Genius</hi> of all other Nations: For Men are
uſually quite cloy'd with the Pleaſures of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in three or four Years; and if a Maid had
nothing elſe but her Perſon to recommend her to
a Husband, ſhe might e'en deſpair of ever taſting
the lawful Joys of the Bed. Whereas in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
inſtead of enriching or maintaining their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
they put 'em to ſo prodigious a Charge,
that none but Perſons of high Quality are able to
keep four Wives. The extreme Neatneſs of the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Women is none of their leaſt conſiderable
Charms; and this extraordinary Cleanneſs is an
effect of their Bathing at leaſt once a Week; for
the nicer ſort bathe twice. I think I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Women of Quality have the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Bathing at Home; and that the reſt go to
the common Baths. I muſt now add, that the
Virtue, and even the Modeſty of a Woman is as
ſecure in the Public, as in the Private Baths; for
Men are forbidden to enter into theſe Sacred Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
under pain of Death. Theſe Baths are large
Halls built of Marble, and cover'd with vaulted
Roofs in form of <hi>Domes;</hi> on the Top of which there
are Glaſs-Windows to let in the Light, without
ſuffering the Heat to evaporate. There are no
Windows in the Walls, that the Women may
undreſs themſelves without fear of expoſing their
Naked Beauties to the Obſervation of ſome Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Enquirer into the Works of Nature; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
they take care to cover their Diſtinguiſhing
Parts with a Cloth wrapt about their Belly, and
tied on the Back. Then they Sweat a quarter of
an Hour or longer; and for the Conveniency of
thoſe who are deſirous to bathe in Water, there
is in the ſame Place a Va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or Bathing-Tub,
which they fill with hot Water by turning a Cock,
tempering and allaying it when 'tis exceſſively
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:51983:157"/>
hot, by turning another Cock that lets in cold
Water. There are Waiting-Women always ready
to attend thoſe who come to bathe, who for a
ſmall Reward crack all the Joynts of their Arms,
Legs, and Thighs. At the ſame time they anoint
the hairy Parts of the Body with <hi>Pilo,</hi> which makes
the Hair fall off, and leaves the Skin extremely
white and ſmooth. The Men have their Baths
apart, and are ſerv'd after the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>There are three ſorts of <hi>Recreations</hi> us'd by the
<hi>Turks; Gaming, Muſick,</hi> and <hi>Dancing.</hi> You may
perceive by the Account I gave you of their <hi>Games,</hi>
that they are neither Pleaſant nor Ingenious: And
I ſhall take this occaſion to tell you, that their <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi>
is rather a hideous Dinn than a regular Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and reſembles exactly the howling Shrieks
of a tortur'd Wretch. The firſt time I heard a
<hi>Turk</hi> ſing, I cou'd not forbear ſtopping to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, concluding that he was certainly Mad:
For I cou'd not imagine that a Man who had the
uſe of his Reaſon, wou'd take pleaſure in diſtort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Body, and rolling his Eyes in ſo odd and
extravagant a manner; tho' they pretend that all
thoſe unuſual Motions are only the Marks and
Effects of a tender and violent Paſſion. Their <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
Inſtruments</hi> are extremely ſuitable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their Harmony: For they have a kind of
<hi>Violin</hi> with three Strings, a Neck as long as a Man's
Arm, and a great Belly like the Block of a Hat;
ſome ill-contriv'd <hi>Flutes;</hi> little <hi>Timbrels</hi> about the
bigneſs of one's Fiſt, a <hi>Drum,</hi> ſome paultry <hi>Haut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bois,</hi>
and ſeveral little Brazen <hi>Targets,</hi> which they
hold in their Hands, and knock againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Judge, Sir, what a mad Conſort they make
with the confus'd jangling of ſo many inharmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Inſtruments. The only tolerable Inſtrument
they have is the <hi>Pſalterion,</hi> which is cover'd with
Latten Strings, ſtretcht as upon a <hi>Harpſical;</hi> and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51983:158"/>
they ſtrike upon 'em with little Sticks, which
they hold betwixt their two Fingers. All the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
play admirably well on this Inſtrument, for
'tis their uſual Diverſion in their Chambers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whoſe Muſick may be heard
with Pleaſure, ſince 'tis a great deal more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than that of the <hi>Turks.</hi> I ſhall only add on
this Subject, that neither of 'em ſing the Notes
without the Words; and our way of ſinging
Tunes ſeems ſo ridiculous to 'em, that they uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laugh at the <hi>Franks,</hi> and ask 'em what their
<hi>Tartara lera</hi> ſignifies.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Dances</hi> are alſo of different kinds. Thoſe
which are us'd by Perſons of Quality are taught by
Maſters and Miſtreſſes, the firſt being appointed to
teach Men, and the others Women. Tho' they
are all very grave, there is a great deal of Action
requir'd in the Hands and Arms; and the fineſt
part of the Dance conſiſts in the graceful and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Motions of thoſe Parts: For the Beauty
and Niceneſs of the Step cannot be well diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
by reaſon of thoſe troubleſome <hi>Chacſirs</hi> that
hide the whole Legs. The <hi>Turks</hi> never give any
Balls, for they always Dance ſingle; and the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of two Perſons together wou'd be reckon'd
a Crime, or at leaſt an indecency among 'em.
Thus after one Perſon has entertain'd the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for ſome time, the Spectators expreſs their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
by repeated clapping of Hands. Beſides
'tis to be obſerv'd, that the Women never Dance
but when they are invited to the Wedding of ſome
of their Relations, or when they make a familiar
Viſit to ſome of their She-Friends, which happens
very unfrequently. Yet there are ſome Publick
Dancing-Women, who go to Private Families
when they are call'd, and Dance before 'em in
the moſt Laſcivious manner imaginable: For they
wriggle their Backs, roll their Eyes, ſeem to ſwoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

away, and put their Bodies into a Thouſand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene
Poſtures, which the moſt ſhameleſs Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
in <hi>Europe</hi> wou'd hardly be perſuaded to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dancing</hi> is moſt in uſe among the Peaſants, who
without pretending to Art, or learning any regular
Steps, put their Bodies into ſuch odd and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Poſtures, that the nimbleſt Dancing-Maſter
wou'd be extremely puzl'd to imitate. They ſeem
to be actually poſſeſs'd with a Devil, and from
Time to Time break forth into ſuch loud and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Shouts, that one wou'd certainly conclude 'em
to be acted by ſome <hi>Daemon,</hi> if he did not know
that all theſe Motions are only feign'd Tranſports.
They uſually hold a great Stick in their Hands,
with which they beat the Walls and Ground in a
furious and terrible Manner, and continue thoſe
violent Agitations of their Feet, Hands, and Head,
till their Wearineſs and want of Strength oblige
them to give over; and even ſometimes they Dance
till they fall down in a ſort of Extaſie or Fit of
Dizzineſs. I had the Pleaſure to ſee all thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
kinds of Dances at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in Monſieur
<hi>de Chateauneuf</hi>'s Houſe, on the Day appointed to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize
the Publick Joy for the advantageous Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the Campagne againſt the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And
theſe Diverſions were ſucceeded by a certain odd
kind of Show, perform'd by the <hi>Jews.</hi> Since all
ſorts of Figures are an abomination to the <hi>Turks,</hi>
there were <hi>Puppets</hi> repreſented in Shadows on the
Wall, which Danc'd and Sung to the Satisfaction
of all the Company, as it appear'd by their Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and pleaſant Humour. I cou'd not underſtand
the Words of their Songs, but if I may be allow'd
to judge of their Expreſſions by their Poſtures,
they were certainly very obſcene; for I never ſaw
any thing ſo brutiſh as the Repreſentations of thoſe
Shadows. Nor will this appear ſtrange to thoſe
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:51983:160"/>
who conſider that the <hi>Turks</hi> are more addicted to
that infamous Vice for which <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi>
were deſtroy'd, than any other Nation in the
World; and that the Advancement of one half
of the great Officers in the Empire, is an Effect of
their baſe Complaiſance to their beaſtly Patrons.
Thus the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Songs are doubly naufeous to
the <hi>Franks,</hi> who are not accuſtom'd to ſuch horrid
Impurities.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Puppet-Show</hi> was follow'd by another of
almoſt the ſame Nature. Four <hi>Jews</hi> ty'd certain
Sticks croſs-wiſe to their Wriſts and Feet, and
clothing them like Men and Women, plac'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
all under one Covering; then the firſt ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out one of his Arms, made the half Figures
Dance and Sing; after him came another; then a
third; and at laſt the eight Arms of the four <hi>Jews</hi>
perform'd ſeveral extravagant Motions on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
accompany'd with a confus'd Din; after
which they ſtood upon their Heads, and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eight larger Figures that were faſtned to their
Feet, entertain'd the Company with another Show
exactly like the former.</p>
               <p>I had occaſion in ſome of my former Letters to
mention the reſt of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cuſtoms; and you
may conclude that what I have omitted is either
inconſiderable, or very particularly deſcrib'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Travellers. And therefore I ſhall conclude this
Subject after I have added one or two Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning their <hi>Civility.</hi> They ſeldom make
any Viſits, but when they come to treat of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and thoſe who do are always entertain'd
with <hi>Perfumes, Coffee,</hi> and <hi>Sherbet,</hi> as in the Account I
gave you of Monſieur <hi>de Chaſteauneuf</hi>'s Reception at
the <hi>Caimacan</hi>'s Houſe. The Left-hand is reckon'd
the Place of Honour, becauſe 'tis next the Heart;
and when they ſalute, inſtead of pulling off their
Turbants, they lay their Hands upon their Breaſt,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:51983:160"/>
and at the ſame time bow their Bodies, which
they repeat ſeveral times when they wou'd expreſs a
more than ordinary Affection to the Perſon whom
they ſalute. This is the whole Ceremony of a
ſimple Salutation; but when they intend to ſhow a
profound Reſpect, they muſt not only lay their
Hand upon their Breaſt, but make ſeveral low Bows,
and with all the ſigns of Humility kiſs the lower
part of the Perſon's Veſt; after which they ſtand
upright, and continue ſtill to keep their Hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Breaſt, or even ſometimes both Hands, while
they are in the preſence of him whom they wou'd
reſpect. When he goes abroad, they muſt make a
Lane for him, as they ſee his Servants do, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
him with a low Bow as he paſſes by. Beſides,
in the Abſence of the Servants, they uſually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
their Hands to hold him under the Arms when
he goes up or down Stairs, or Mounts his Horſe,
and on ſome other Occaſions of the ſame Nature;
But when his Servants are preſent, 'tis their Office
to offer their Aſſiſtance to their Maſter. When a
<hi>Frank</hi> makes a Viſit to his <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Friends, they ſtill
preſent him with a <hi>Pipe</hi> after his <hi>Coffee;</hi> which is a
very troubleſom piece of Civility to thoſe who have
ſo ſtrong an Averſion to <hi>Tobacco</hi> as I have, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſidering the peremptory Stiffneſs of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
who will not admit of the moſt reaſonable Excuſe.
Some great Perſons ſmoak a ſort of perfum'd <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi>
like that of which <hi>Spaniſh Snuff</hi> is made; but
our <hi>Franks</hi> never uſe any of that kind.</p>
               <p>I have had occaſion five or ſix times to ſpeak
of their <hi>Perſons of Quality,</hi> without acquainting you
with the Nature of their Grandeur and Nobility;
and therefore I ſhall conclude this Letter with a
ſhort Account of it. You muſt not imagine that
theſe are Perſons of an Ancient and Noble Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
for tho' there may be ſome of 'em that are
honourably deſcended, the greateſt part of 'em
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:51983:161"/>
owe their Advancement merely to Fortune, or
are the Creatures of ſome <hi>Baſſa;</hi> and their firſt
Preferments are only the Rewards of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Thus we frequently ſee that a poor Slave
is advanc'd by degrees to the higheſt Dignities
in the Empire; and it may be ſaid in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
that Riches are the Fountain of Honour in
<hi>Turkey.</hi> This Reflexion puts me in Mind of a blunt
Repartee that was made to the Marqueſs <hi>de la
Marzelliere</hi> by one of theſe Pretenders to Nobility.
This Marqueſs was deſcended of one of the moſt
illuſtrious Families in <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> and yet ſcrupl'd
not to marry a Citizen's Daughter of St. <hi>Malo's,</hi>
who brought him a Portion of Two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Pounds. However, it ſeems, her Brother, whoſe
Fortune was equal to hers, did not think himſelf
much honour'd by this Allyance; for imagining
that the Luſtre of his Gold was bright enough to
make amends for the Obſcurity of his Birth, he
wou'd never be perſuaded to ſhew the leaſt reſpect
to his Brother-in-Law. One Day as they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing
about ſome Points of Honour, after ſeveral
angry Replies, he told the Marqueſs he knew no
Reaſon why he ſhou'd be ſo proud of a Title, and
at laſt added, that he was as good a Marqueſs as
himſelf. <hi>Marqueſs of what?</hi> ſaid Monſieur <hi>de la Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelliere;
Of what?</hi> reply'd he, <hi>I'm Marqueſs of Two
Hundred Thouſand Crowns in good Lewis d'Ors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have made it my Buſineſs to be acquainted with
the Arch-Biſhop of this Place, who is a Perſon of
Wit and Merit, and has given me a particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the principal Differences between the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religions; which I intend ſhall be
the Subject of my next Letter.</p>

               <p>AFter the general <hi>Idea</hi> I have given you of the
Religion and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Turks,</hi> you will
perhaps expect an Account of their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and read with pleaſure ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
on a Subject of which I have often obſerv'd
that even the more inquiſitive part of our <hi>European</hi>
World have but a very ſlight and confus'd Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The preſent Condition of this Nation is ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
and ſo apt to produce all the moſt
tender Motions of Compaſſion in thoſe who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
reflect upon it, that 'twou'd be needleſs to
heighten the Gloomineſs of the Proſpect by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it with their former Glory, which after a
long and fatal Eclipſe, was reſtor'd to its ancient
Splendor by <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> whoſe Memory
will laſt till the final Period of the World. But
the Empire of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> which he founded, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
to that of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> was divided again after
his Death, and continu'd in a declining Condition
till the final Overthrow of the <hi>Palaeologi</hi> by the <hi>Turks,</hi>
in the Fifteenth Age; ſince which time the <hi>Greeks</hi>
have ſtill been Slaves in a Country of which they
were formerly Sovereigns; and to redeem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Yoak under which they are born,
they are forc'd to pay a yearly Tribute, call'd the
<hi>Carache,</hi> which is only impos'd upon them, and
their Fellow-Slaves the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Carache</hi> is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Poll-Tax, and exceeds not four <hi>Piaſters</hi> a
Man; and yet ſince 'tis a Mark of their Bondage,
they have left no Means uneſſay'd to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:51983:162"/>
from it, and have even offer'd to raiſe more
conſiderable Summs another way. Beſides, there
are oftentimes large <hi>Avanies</hi> impos'd upon 'em,
which they levy among themſelves, according to
the proportion of their Eſtates. All their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,
Biſhops, and Abbots are alſo oblig'd to pay
for their Patents; and the Prices that are exacted
of 'em cannot but amount to a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Summ, ſince there are above five Thouſand
Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire,
who, reckoning one with another, pay above
two Thouſand <hi>Piaſters</hi> a-piece, as a Fine to the
<hi>Grand Signior.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> are naturally Proud,
and lovers of Pomp and Magnificence: Moſt of
'em ſpend higher than their Eſtates will bear, and
are very fond of the Title of <hi>Chelety</hi> or <hi>Lord.</hi> Yet
even the richeſt of 'em, of which there is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Number, are look'd upon as Objects of
Scorn and Contempt by the <hi>Turks.</hi> 'Tis true, they
are not inſenſible of their Slavery, and perhaps
wou'd willingly ſhake off the inſupportable Yoak
of their Domineering Maſters; but the Natural
Impatience of their Temper is more than ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
curb'd by their Weakneſs, and want of Power;
and they muſt e'en content themſelves with repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in ſecret at the reſiſtleſs Tyranny of their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors:
For they are ſeldom or never able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Satisfaction for the Injuries they receive from
the <hi>Turks,</hi> if the Offenders are not wholly deſtitute
both of Friends and Money.</p>
               <p>The Habit of the <hi>Greeks</hi> is very different from
that of the <hi>Turks.</hi> They are not permitted to wear
a white <hi>Turbant;</hi> nor muſt their <hi>Turbants</hi> be of the
ſame bigneſs with thoſe that are us'd by the <hi>Turks,</hi>
nor folded after the ſame manner: For they only
wrap a little piece of Courſe Cloth, either blue or
ſtrip'd with blue, two or three times about their
Caps; and even uſually they wear none at all, but
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:51983:162"/>
content themſelves with a little red Cap which is
not large enough to cover their Ears. Inſtead of a
Veſt they have only a plain Waſt-coat, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſhort, and open before; and over that they
wear another that meets on the ſide. Neither ought
they to wear a <hi>Chacſir</hi> after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Faſhion; for
their Breeches are very ſhort, and reach not below
the Knee. And beſides, they are diſtinguiſh'd
from the <hi>Turks</hi> by their red <hi>Babouches;</hi> for thoſe
that are us'd by the <hi>Turks</hi> are yellow. Thus I have
given you a ſhort Account of the Habit of the
<hi>Greeks;</hi> but tho' moſt of 'em do, and all of 'em are
oblig'd to wear it, ſome of the richer ſort are ſo
far from obſerving theſe Regulations, that they can
ſcarce be diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Turks</hi> but by their
<hi>Turbants:</hi> And even all Perſons of Note, whether
<hi>Franks</hi> or <hi>Greeks,</hi> put on white <hi>Turbants</hi> when they
go out of the City, as I have had occaſion to ſee
above fifty times. The <hi>Turks</hi> have of late conniv'd
at thoſe Innovations; but they have ſtill ſuch a
veneration for <hi>Green,</hi> that the <hi>Greeks</hi> dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to wear it: nor wou'd it be ſafe for <hi>Franks</hi>
to wear Green in the midſt of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> tho' I
have often ſeen 'em make bold with that ſacred Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
Since the Women are generally inviſible,
they are not oblig'd to obſerve theſe Marks of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction;
and the only difference between their
Habit and way of Dreſſing, and that of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
is that they muſt, as well as the Men, abſtain from
wearing <hi>Green.</hi> Nor is there a leſs Reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
'em in their Manners and Cuſtoms, and in
their ſolitary way of living; tho' they find ſo much
ſweetneſs in the Freedom that prevails among us,
that they whoſe Husbands or Fathers have frequent
Occaſions to converſe with <hi>Franks,</hi> are eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to renounce their wonted Severity. They are
lovers of Pleaſures, Dancing, and magnificent Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits;
and will fix a Paſſion upon a Man whether
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:51983:163"/>
he will or not. But the poor <hi>Frank</hi> that ſuffers
himſelf to be noos'd, muſt reſolve either to be
Hen-peck'd, or a Cuckold: He muſt adore his
<hi>Graecian</hi> Spouſe; he muſt furniſh her with the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Habits, and keep a numerous Train of Slaves to
attend her; or, if any of theſe things be wanting,
<hi>'Ware Horns.</hi> For the <hi>Franks</hi> have an excellent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
at curing a handſome Lady of the grumbling
Diſeaſe, and are always ready to do a kind Office
to a Country-man's Wife.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Dances are extremely pleaſant, and
full of Mirth. They are of two kinds: The firſt
is a ſort of Country-Dance or <hi>Couranto,</hi> danc'd by
Pairs; and the ſecond a kind of <hi>Gavote</hi> or <hi>Branle,</hi>
in which the Men and Women are mingl'd, as

The fitteſt time to take the pleaſure of viewing
their way of Dancing, is when they are met at a
Wedding; for on ſuch Occaſions they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up to Joy and Pleaſure, drinking, eating,
and ſporting, and indulging themſelves in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Diverſions. The next Morning the young
Woman's Relations make a Viſit to the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marry'd
Couple, and examine the Bridegroom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Wife's Virginity: Then they take the
Bride's Bloody Smock, and expoſe it to the View
of all the Company, as if it were ſome rare Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.
The <hi>Jews</hi> obſerve the ſame Cuſtom at the
Marriage of a Maid, and are even nicer and
more ſcrupulous in this Point than the <hi>Greeks;</hi>
for if the Bride's Honeſty be not confirm'd by the
Blood that appears on her Smock, her Reputation
is irrecoverably loſt, and ſhe is immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd
from her Husband. They unanimouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in believing that this is an infallible Mark
of Virginity: And this Opinion is ſo generally
receiv'd thro' all <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> that if a Man
ſhou'd endeavour to contradict it, he wou'd expoſe
himſelf to the Laughter and Deriſion of all that
ſhou'd hear him. The <hi>Italians</hi> are alſo perſuaded
of the Certainty of this Experiment, tho' they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from making a Shew of the Bloody Smock,
for fear of expoſing their own Shame; but the
Husband examines his Bride very narrowly, and
if he finds her not ſuch as he expects and deſires,
'tis in vain for her to endeavour by the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Proteſtations to convince him of her Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Nevertheleſs this way of trying the Chaſtity
of a Maid is eſteem'd uncertain and ridiculous by
the <hi>French,</hi> and even by Chirurgeons; nor can I
reflect without a certain Wonder and Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on this Diverſity of Opinions concerning a
Queſtion that one wou'd think might have been
fully decided by ſo many repeated Experiments;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:51983:165"/>
for I ſee no reaſon to believe that our Country-Women
are fram'd after another manner than the
reſt of their Sex. But leaving this Controverſie to
be decided by others who are better acquainted
with the Works of Nature, I ſhall proceed in the
Account I promis'd to give you of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<hi>Graecian</hi> Cuſtoms, among which I cannot
forbear taking notice of one that ſeems to be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to this Nation. On <hi>Eaſter-Day,</hi> and during the
three following Weeks, they ſalute one another
with three Kiſſes, one on the Mouth, and one on
each Cheek, at the ſame time repeating theſe Words,
<hi>Chriſtos aneſti,</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt is riſen.</hi> At other times
their familiar Salutation is the ſame with that
which is us'd by the <hi>Turks:</hi> But when they deſign
to ſhew a more than ordinary Reſpect to a Man,
they kiſs his Hand, and then lay it upon their
Heads. They obſerve the ſame Cuſtom when they
receive a Preſent, if it be not either too heavy
or bulky: For this Ceremony of laying a Man's
Hand upon their Head, is a Mark both of their
Reſpect and Gratitude. When a Woman accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
her Husband in a Viſit to a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
ſuch as a <hi>Conſul,</hi> whether they come to treat of
Bus'neſs, or only out of Civility, ſhe ſtands direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
behind her Husband; and when the Viſiter
brings his Daughters along with him, they place
themſelves at one another's Back behind their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
ſo that the Husband ſtanding in the Front
of the File, hides all his Female Train; and when
they intend to go out, they make a half-Turn to
the Right, and the Daughters march out firſt, to
avoid the Indecency of appearing in a Stranger's
Preſence.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of the Method I propos'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
I ſhall in the next place conſider their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
I'm oblig'd to my Friend, the Archbiſhop,
for the following Account, which perhaps will
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:51983:165"/>
give you a clearer <hi>Idea</hi> of this Subject than you can
draw from the Relations of others. For there are
ſome who pretend that the <hi>Greeks</hi> are only <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi>
or bare Separatiſts from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church;
whereas others ſtretch the Point too far on the
other ſide, and make their Differences in matter of
Doctrine appear greater and more irreconcilable
than they really are.</p>
               <p>They acknowledge only One viſible <hi>Church</hi> of
God, without which there is no Salvation, unleſs
in the Caſe of a ſudden Converſion at the Hour
of Death.</p>
               <p>They believe that the Apoſtles inſtituted five <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi>
to govern the Church upon the Earth, who
were ſeated at <hi>Rome, Alexandria, Conſtantinople, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi>
and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and under them ſeveral Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,
Biſhops, and inferiour Paſtors. All the
Members of this Hierarchy have a Right to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
a Spiritual Juriſdiction over thoſe that are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
to 'em, and to inflict Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
But the Patriarchs can only admoniſh one
another, and can neither be puniſh'd nor depos'd
for their Offences but by the Sentence of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council. Yet their Power does not extend
ſo far as to enable 'em to introduce new Laws
into the Church, and they wou'd be laught at if
they ſhou'd attempt to grant Indulgencies. The
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the firſt of the Patriarchs; nor
do any of the reſt pretend to diſpute with him for
Precedency: But they refuſe to ſubmit to that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Power he has aſſum'd in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Advantage of the Superſtition and Simplicity
of the People, and the Connivance of the Princes.
'Tis plain that the <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhops had Reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
their Conſent to the Introduction and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of a Tyrannical Power in the Church,
ſince they cou'd not but foreſee that it wou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
very fatal and pernicious Conſequences: And
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:51983:166"/>
yet this is the only Cauſe that made the Pope
diſcharge his Thunders againſt 'em, and declare
'em <hi>Schiſmaticks;</hi> thus violently breaking the ſacred
Union of the Church, for the Preſervation of
which he ought to have ſpent the laſt Drop of
his Blood. For this reaſon the <hi>Greeks</hi> are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with returning the Charge of <hi>Schiſm</hi> upon the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, but pretend that they never actually
ſeparated from the Communion of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince
they have not eſtabliſh'd a <hi>Fifth Patriarch,</hi> and ſtill
acknowledge the <hi>Pope</hi> to be the <hi>firſt Biſhop</hi> in the
World, and that therefore they cannot with the
leaſt Shadow of Juſtice be blam'd for the Fault of
another, or ſaid to ſeparate from a Church which
has violently driven 'em out of her Communion.
I know not whether this is the Opinion of the whole
<hi>Greek</hi> Church; tho' I cannot reaſonably decline giving
Credit to a Thing which I have heard ſo often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
with repeated Proteſtations by the Archbiſhop
of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who is eſteem'd one of the moſt learned
Doctors of that Church in this Age. However,
I took the Liberty to ask him why they did
not ſend their Biſhops to the laſt Councils that
were held in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> in which all their Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
might have been amicably terminated. He
reply'd, that their Abſence wou'd be eaſily excus'd
by thoſe who conſider the Severity of the Yoak
under which they groan; and that the ſending of
Deputies to the Councils wou'd have given a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Umbrage to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who wou'd
have been apt to ſuſpect that theſe Biſhops were
ſent to contrive a Rebellion againſt him, and to
plot the Ruine of his Empire; and to deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from the danger of a Revolt, might have been
eaſily perſuaded to have put the whole Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Military Execution. This Anſwer ſeem'd ſo
reaſonable, and agreeable to the Truth, that I
was oblig'd to acknowledge my ſelf intirely ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:51983:166"/>
Thus I have given a ſhort Account of
the Occaſion of the fatal Breach that divides the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches, and of the Reaſons
alledg'd by the <hi>Greeks</hi> to free themſelves of the
Imputation of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> I ſhall in the next Place
examine the Points of Doctrine in which they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Difference between theſe Churches may be
reduc'd to five Articles, of which only two are
Fundamentals: For tho' the other three are of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Moment, they wou'd not be ſufficient to
excuſe a Separation. The firſt is the <hi>Proceſſion of
the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who in their Opinion proceeds not
from the <hi>Son,</hi> but only from the <hi>Father.</hi> To illuſtrate
and confirm this Doctrine, the Archbiſhop told me,
that the <hi>Three Perſons</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> were only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd
by their different Operations and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes;
That the Property of the <hi>Father</hi> was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
without being begotten; That of the <hi>Son,</hi> to
be eternally begotten, without begetting; and
that of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to inſpire and ſanctifie our
Hearts. I reply'd, That it did not neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
becauſe the <hi>Son</hi> was begotten, that he cou'd
not co-operate with the <hi>Father</hi> in the <hi>Proceſſion of
the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> But he wou'd not acknowledge
the force of this Reaſon, pretending that we cou'd
not aſcribe to the <hi>Son</hi> the Attribute of <hi>Generation,</hi>
that belongs only to the <hi>Father,</hi> without overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Order, and confounding the Perſons of
the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Then he repeated what he had ſaid
before, that the Perſons were only diſtinguiſh'd by
their Attributes; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om whence he concluded that
the latter cou'd not be confounded without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
the former. And for a farther Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of his Opinion, he ſhew'd me a large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
of S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> printed at <hi>Venice,</hi> with the
<hi>Latin</hi> on one ſide, and the <hi>Greek</hi> on the other, and
made me take Notice of two Paſſages, which I
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:51983:167"/>
tranſcrib'd, but have unhappily loſt the Paper.
However, tho' I cannot at preſent call to Mind
the very Words of the Author. I remember that
in the firſt Paſſage he ſpoke of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt's</hi>
proceeding from the <hi>Father,</hi> without mentioning
the Son. I reply'd, that the Queſtion was not
whether the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> proceeded from the Father;
and that the Author whom he cited did not deny
his Proceſſion from the <hi>Son.</hi> But I was oblig'd to
acknowledge that the ſame Anſwer wou'd not
ſerve to elude the poſitive Authority of another
Paſſage which he ſhew'd me in the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi>
where 'tis expreſsly ſaid, <hi>à ſolo Patre procedens.</hi> Thus
my Mouth was ſtopt on this Subject, as well as
on the former; and I muſt leave the Deciſion
of this Controverſie to thoſe whoſe Profeſſion
obliges 'em to ſearch into theſe Myſteries.</p>
               <p>The ſecond difference between the <hi>Romiſh</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi>
Churches, is concerning the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi>
which the latter expreſsly denies, affirming, with us,
that 'tis abſolutely injurious to the Merit and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Chriſt: Yet they pretend there is a certain
Baptiſmal Fire, through which every one muſt
paſs before he can be admitted into <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
They believe that the Souls of Juſt Perſons at
their Separation from the Body, go into a Third
Place, of the ſame Nature with the <hi>Romiſh Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo's,</hi>
where they muſt remain till the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
at which Time a ſudden Fire ſhall diſſolve
the World in an Inſtant, and purifie the Souls of
the Righteous, who after their final Judgment,
ſhall be receiv'd into everlaſting Glory. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this Doctrine, they alledge that Paſſage of the
Scripture which ſpeaks of the Souls that <hi>reſt under
the Altar:</hi> But after all, this Opinion ſeems not
to be ſo well grounded as the former; for if the
Dead are not in a ſuffering Condition, I know
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:51983:167"/>
not what Reaſon they can give to juſtifie their
praying for 'em.</p>
               <p>The third Point is the <hi>Communion under both kinds:</hi>
for they give the Sacrament to the People in a
Spoon, in which the Bread and Wine are mixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>The Fourth is concerning <hi>Leaven'd Bread,</hi>
which they uſe in the Conſecration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Fifth and laſt Point in which they differ
from thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſuaſion is the <hi>Celibacy
of the Clergy:</hi> For a ſimple Prieſt is allow'd to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
once, but muſt never proceed to a ſecond Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
The Prieſts wear the Violet-colour'd Habit
of a Biſhop, and a Cap of the ſame Colour, with
a little blue <hi>Turbant;</hi> and behind their Cap there
hangs a piece of Cloth of the ſame Colour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
half a Foot long and broad, which falls back
on their Shoulders. Beſides theſe Prieſts, there
are certain Religious Perſons under a Vow of
Chaſtity; and out of their Number the Biſhops,
and even the Paſtors, are choſen, whom they call
<hi>Papa's:</hi> They eat no Fleſh, and wear long Hair,
without ever touching it with Sciſſors: They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſuffer their Beards to grow without ſhaving or
clipping 'em, which disfigures their Faces, and
makes 'em ſeem very ugly. They wear a large
black Gown or Robe, not much different from
our Night-Gowns; only their Sleeves are wider,
and button'd before; and the Neck is like that of
a Caſſock. Their Caps are made of Felt, flat
beneath like the Block of a Hat, and wou'd be
very deep, if they were not cut before; ſo that
the whole Face appears, but the Ears and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
of the Head are cover'd. Over this they
wear a Kerchief of black Serge, which hangs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Shoulders. This Habit is generally us'd
by all religious Perſons, Paſtors, Biſhops, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:51983:168"/>
without any Mark of Diſtinction; only
the Biſhops carry in their Hands a Paſtoral Staff
of Ebony, eight Foot long, with an Ivory Ball
on the Top. The Biſhops are not uſually rich, but
they are no leſs reſpected by their Clergy than
our <hi>French</hi> Prelates are by theirs. Their Churches
are built after the manner of ours, but without
the leaſt appearance of Pomp or Grandeur. They
have a Quire where the Prieſts place themſelves,
with thoſe that come to confeſs; and a Place for
the Church-Wardens, with a Crucifix, or a Saint,
to which every one preſents an Offering. The
Biſhops do not obſerve ſo much State as in <hi>France;</hi>
for my Curioſity having one Day carry'd me to
ſee 'em Officiate, the Archbiſhop roſe up to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
me, and made me ſit down by him on one
of the Seats in the Quire, whither a Prieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
me by his Order; after which they brought
me ſome Frankincenſe, as they do to all Perſons
of Note of their own Nation. Their Pontifical
Habit is ſo ſingular and odly contriv'd, that
'twou'd be a hard Task to repreſent it diſtinctly;
and therefore I will neither undertake the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of that, nor of their Ceremonies and
Rites of Worſhip. I ſhall only add, that when
they enter the Church, they take ſome Holy-Water,
and make five large Signs of the Croſs,
at each of which they make a very low Bow, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame Ceremony when they go out, to
commemorate the five Wounds of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p>It has been ſo poſitively aſſerted by ſo many
celebrated Divines, that the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi>
is not acknowledg'd by the <hi>Greek</hi> Church,
that I dare hardly venture to contradict 'em. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſince neither Intereſt not Authority ought to
deterr us from owning the Truth, I'm reſolv'd at
all Adventures to undeceive you of ſo vulgar an
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:51983:168"/>
Error. 'Tis plain that the Authors of thoſe Relations,
on whoſe Credit that Opinion is grounded, were
either deceiv'd themſelves, or intended to deceive
their Readers; unleſs perhaps to ſoften the harſhneſs
of that Cenſure you had rather believe that they
ſpeak of ſome obſcure Sect, which is not known in
thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Countrey: For I can aſſure you that the <hi>Greeks</hi>
at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Smyrna</hi> are as firmly perſwaded
of the truth of that Doctrine as the moſt zealous
<hi>Romaniſts;</hi> and the only reaſon why they do not
kneel at the Elevation of the Hoſt, is becauſe
their manner of Adoration is different from ours.
Nor do they worſhip the Sacrament leſs devoutly
by bowing their Body, and ſmiting their Breaſt,
tho' they ſtand all the while on their Feet, than
we do by proſtrating our ſelves on the Ground;
and therefore we ought rather to conſider the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of their Mind than the Poſture of their
Body. But this is not all; for they have a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
which may ſerve for a convincing Proof of
their Belief of that Opinion. On <hi>Good-Friday</hi> they
walk in Proceſſion to the <hi>French</hi> Church, to adore
the Sacrament which is expos'd there, and even
pay five hundred <hi>Piaſters</hi> to the <hi>Turks</hi> that they
may be ſuffer'd to perform their Devotions there
on that Occaſion: So true it is that they are not
willing to be ſeparated from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
You may depend upon the Certainty of this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for I can aſſure you of the Truth of it on
the Faith of an Eye-Witneſs.</p>
               <p>They have a great Number of <hi>Images;</hi> and
their Devotion to 'em is not at all inferior to that
which prevails in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I muſt
confeſs there is a great Difference in the Structure
and Workmanſhip of the Images; for whereas in
our Country they may, for the moſt part, be reckon'd
ſo many Maſter-pieces of Art, whether we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Regularity of the Deſign, the Diſpoſition
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:51983:169"/>
of the Lights and Shades, or the Beauty of the
Colours. The <hi>Greeks</hi> are of Opinion, and ſcruple
not to ſay, that the Pictures of the Saints, as
they are repreſented in the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches are
more proper to raiſe Criminal Deſires, than to
inſpire the Minds of the Spectators with Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And therefore to avoid the dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of that Abuſe, they confine themſelves
to a certain Antick way of Painting, which is
extremely unnatural, eſpecially in their Figures of
Virgins, who are almoſt all repreſented black, and
ſo muffled up in Kerchiefs and Gowns, that you
can ſcarce diſtinguiſh their Faces. And their
Painters are ſo ignorant, and ſo little acquainted
with the Beauties of the Art they profeſs, that
they cannot ſo much as copy a Head. Nor am
I at all ſurpriz'd at the Unskillfulneſs of theſe
pretended Artiſts; for their Method is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to that of our Painters: Firſt they lay on the
Shades, and deſign the entire Figure, after which
they proceed to the Diſpoſition of the Light; which
is the moſt prepoſterous Method cou'd be imagin'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Armenians</hi> are not ſo ſcrupulous in this
Point, tho' they profeſs almoſt the ſame Articles
of Faith; for they make uſe of the modern way
of Painting; and there is at preſent on their
High Altar an Image of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> made by a
<hi>French-man,</hi> which ſhews ſo much of her Breaſts
that I ſhou'd be almoſt Jealous if my Miſtreſs
were painted after that Manner. Nevertheleſs you
muſt not ſuſpect them of <hi>Libertiniſm;</hi> for I never heard
of any Religious Order, except the Monks of <hi>Trape,</hi>
that obſerve ſuch mortifying <hi>Faſts.</hi> They keep
four <hi>Lents,</hi> which laſts one half of the Year, like
thoſe that are obſerv'd by the <hi>Greeks:.</hi> But the <hi>Armen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from eating Fleſh, Fiſh, and even Shell-Fiſh, Butter,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:51983:169"/>
Milk, Cheeſe, and every thing that has or ever
had Life; which may be juſtly reckon'd a very ſevere
piece of Mortification. Their Biſhop has put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
under the Protection of <hi>France,</hi> to deliver
himſelf from the inſupportable Exactions of the
<hi>Turks;</hi> and 'tis but a very little while ago ſince
he was freed from Priſon, where he had lain ſix
Months. He is a very honeſt and civil Perſon,
and diligent in performing the Duties of his Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
His Habit is almoſt the ſame with that of
the <hi>Greek</hi> Biſhop, only he wears a Hood or Cawle
at the Neck of his Gown, and carries in his Hand
a Croſs, like that which is us'd by the <hi>Roman</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
only 'tis made of Wood. This puts me in
Mind of what a certain Author ſaid concerning
the Ancients, That they were <hi>Golden Biſhops</hi> tho'
they wore <hi>Wooden Croſſes;</hi> and I may ſafely ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to apply that Saying to this Prelate.</p>
               <p>To return to the <hi>Greeks;</hi> I had almoſt forgot
to take Notice of one of their Opinions in which
they differ from thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſuaſion.
You have doubtleſs obſerv'd that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have
an extreme Veneration for thoſe Perſons whoſe
Bodies remain free from <hi>Putrefaction</hi> after their
Death; and that the Incorruption of the Body is
reckon'd a convincing Mark of the Holineſs of
the Deceas'd, and is one of the moſt conſiderable
Proofs that can be offer'd for the <hi>Canonization</hi> of
the Saint; whereas the <hi>Greeks</hi> pretend that 'tis
only an Effect of <hi>Excommunication;</hi> and when they
find a Body in that Condition, they never leave
praying for the Soul of the dead Perſon, till his
Body be putrefy'd and corrupted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Interrment</hi> of dead Bodies is perform'd with
almoſt the ſame Ceremonies that are obſerv'd in
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> All the Clergy meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſing the <hi>de profundis,</hi> and Prayers for the
Soul of the Deceas'd. Several Perſons march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:51983:170"/>
with lighted Candles, after whom the Body is
carry'd in an open Coffin, dreſt in its fineſt Clothes,
with a little Cotton in its Mouth; ſo that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Perſon ſeems to be alive. Then comes
the Husband or Wife, accompany'd with the
Children and Slaves of the Deceas'd, all bellowing
out their Grief in ſo diſmal and terrible a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that one wou'd conclude they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
irrecoverably ruin'd. The Women eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſignalize their Love by all the wildeſt Marks
of Deſpair, toſſing their Bodies ſo furiouſly from
ſide to ſide, that they wou'd certainly break
their Necks if they were not ſupported by two
Perſons who are appointed to attend 'em. Their
uſual Song is <hi>Hai agamimont, hai mathiamont; Ab
my Eyes! ah my Love!</hi> And the Slaves echo back
the howling Muſick with ſo hideous a Noiſe, that
one wou'd think they deſign'd to ſcare the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
Thoſe who have not a ſufficient Number of
Slaves to make a Noiſe ſutable to the Quality of
the Deceas'd, may ſupply that Defect by hiring
<hi>Weeping-Women,</hi> who for an <hi>Jſallote,</hi> which is worth
about forty Pence, howl and cry, as if they were
acted by the moſt furious Tranſports of Rage and
Deſpair. 'Tis true, the Frace is too groſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
for there is ſomething ſo moving in true Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
that it can never be counterfeited; neither
is it poſſible for the moſt dextrous Mimick to
imitate the tender Motions of Nature. And even
when thoſe pretended Mourners ſeem to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
with Fury and Deſpair, running about
like Mad-Women, with diſhevell'd Hair, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
is eaſily diſcernible. And particularly I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
that when they pretend to tear their Hair,
they hold it faſt with one Hand near the Roots,
and then pull as hard as they can with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

wou'd be tempted to imagine that all this Mumme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:51983:170"/>
is acted in deriſion to the deceas'd; for as ſoon as
he is interr'd, they make a Feaſt on his Grave at his
own Charge; and his Wife and Children take care
that nothing be wanting to the Company, who eat
and drink and laugh, as if they were carouſing in a
Tipling Houſe. This is certainly a very extravagant
way of expreſſing their Affection to their dead
Friends; nor cou'd they treat a Man worſe whoſe
Memory they deſign'd to affront. I have alſo
had occaſion to ſee the Funeral Solemnities of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> which in my Opinion are leſs inconſiſtent
with the Rules of Decency; for tho' they uſe
thoſe Affected Howlings as well as the <hi>Greeks,</hi> their
Deſign is to Mourn and not to Feaſt. Among the
Ceremonies that are us'd by the <hi>Iews</hi> at the Death
of their Relations, I took notice of one which
ſeems to be very Troubleſome and Inconvenient,
I mean their keeping of the Dead Body Three
Days unbury'd: And I leave you to judge what
a ſad Companion that muſt be to the Widow and
Children, who are oblig'd to weep without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
till the Body be interr'd.</p>
               <p>Since the Deſcription of the <hi>Greekiſh</hi> Funerals
has given me an Occaſion to mention the <hi>Jews,</hi>
I ſhall conclude this Letter with a brief Account
of that Nation. 'Twou'd be needleſs to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
you with an Abridgement of their Ancient
Hiſtory, and therefore I ſhall only obſerve, that
after the <hi>Romans</hi> became Maſters of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> theſe
unhappy Fugitives were diſpers'd, and ſcatter'd
thro' the whole World, and have liv'd ever ſince
like hated Vagabonds, without King or Head, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> with an Impatience that has
frequently made 'em give Credit to Impoſtors.
About Thirty Years ago there aroſe a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
or <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in this Country, call'd <hi>Sabatai Sevi,</hi>
who was very learned, and had diligently ſtudy'd
the <hi>Cabala,</hi> by which means, 'twas thought, he came
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:51983:171"/>
to the Knowledge of certain Magical Secrets, which
he afterwards made Uſe of to abuſe the Credulity
of his Followers. I have heard a Thouſand Stories
of him, but ſhall content my ſelf with telling you
that he manag'd the Cheat with ſo much De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
and Succeſs, that he was follow'd by a great
Multitude of People, and began to exerciſe ſo
great an Authority over the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> himſelf, growing jealous of his Power and
Credit, order'd him to be apprehended, and
brought in Chains to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Meſſiah</hi> turn'd <hi>Turk</hi> to ſave his Life. The
Scandal of this Example, which ought to have
taught the <hi>Jews</hi> more Caution for the future,
cou'd not keep 'em from falling not long after
into another Error of the ſame Nature. You muſt
know that during the <hi>Feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> the
young Women of that Nation are oblig'd to lie
abroad under Tents in a place appointed for that
purpoſe; and they have an old Tradition that the
<hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall be conceiv'd in the Womb of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
during that Feſtival. Now it happen'd that a
certain Maid, who it ſeems was weary of that
Denomination, reſolv'd to make uſe of ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
an Opportunity of taſting the <hi>forbidden Delight,</hi>
and to conceal her Fault, ſpread abroad a Report
that God came to viſit her every Night, and that
ſhe was to be the Mother of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Theſe
acceptable News were receiv'd with Joy by the
whole Synagogue, who appointed ſeveral Days
of Solemn Thankſgiving to be kept with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
Secreſie, for fear of offending the <hi>Turks.</hi>
But their Joy was at laſt turn'd into Shame and
Confuſion, when inſtead of their expected <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer,</hi>
the pretended Virgin was brought to B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:51983:171"/>
The <hi>Levantine Jews</hi> are extremely Cunning and
Deceitful, and ſo dextrous in the Art of Wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that thoſe who deal with 'em ought to be
always upon their Guard. Cheating is the Trade
by which they live, as others do by Labour or
Traffick; and 'tis uſually ſaid here, that a <hi>Jew</hi>
never eats his Breakfaſt till he has cheated a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
However, 'tis certain that he who truſts
'em muſt either betray his Ignorance or Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
for by a modeſt Computation, I may
venture to aſſure you, that among <hi>Twenty Jews</hi>
there are always <hi>Nineteen Knaves.</hi> There cannot
be a more convincing Argument to prove that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
is not always attended with <hi>Honeſty;</hi> for if
it were, the <hi>Jews</hi> wou'd be the honeſteſt Men in
the World. They obſerve the Precepts of their
Law with an incredible exactneſs; and wou'd not
do the leaſt Work on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to prevent the
Ruine of the Univerſe. 'Tis not yet a Fortnight
ſince we had an eminent Inſtance of the Power
of Superſtition, on occaſion of a Fire which broke
forth in the <hi>Jews</hi> Quarter in this City on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>

               <p>JUſt now I'm inform'd that five <hi>Barbary</hi> Veſſels
anchor'd this Morning at <hi>Foſche,</hi> which is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Harbour at the Mouth of the Gulph. If this
be true, we muſt expect to ſee the Streets always
full of thoſe inſolent Scoundrels, from whom the
<hi>Franks</hi> receive a Viſit once every Year, tho' they
wou'd gladly diſpence with ſo troubleſome a piece
of Civility. I have not yet had Experience of
their Deportment; but the Accounts I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from others have extremely abated my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Curioſity to be acquainted with the Cuſtoms
of Strangers: And I had much rather hear a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
than be an Eye-Witneſs of the Diſorders
they committed in this City, which are ſtill ſo
freſh in the Memory of the People, that they
hardly talk of any thing elſe. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you cou'd hear without Diſturbance a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of thoſe Abuſes, if you were in a place
where you might ſhortly expect to ſee 'em re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated:
But ſince you are at ſo great a Diſtance
from the Scene of the Tragedy, you may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to read it without fearing to be made a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator
of it: And beſides, there can be nothing
more proper to give you a clear <hi>Idea</hi> of the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>About a Year ago the ſame <hi>Barbary</hi> Ships touch'd
at the Port where they have now caſt Anchor, which
is only four or five Leagues diſtant from this place;
and ſince theſe Sea-Monſters are not reſtrain'd by
the leaſt ſhadow of Diſcipline, one half of 'em
was perpetually in the City. Theſe pretended
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:51983:173"/>
Soldiers are a meer Rabble of Murderers, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and the moſt deſperate Villains, who, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the juſt Puniſhment of their Crimes, flock
from all parts of <hi>Africk</hi> to the Sea-Coaſt, where
they find on board the Ships, a Sanctuary that
ſecures 'em from being made accountable for their
paſt Offences, and are at the ſame time privileg'd
to re-act their former Barbarities without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul;
ſo that they are equally dreaded by the
<hi>Turks, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Franks,</hi> tho' the Storm falls hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt
upon the laſt, eſpecially ſince the Bombard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Algiers,</hi> which has inſpir'd 'em with a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Averſion againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and againſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Franks</hi> for their ſake.</p>
               <p>Two or three Days after their Landing, two of
'em drinking in a Tipling-Houſe pick'd a Quarrel
with a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who ſeeing 'em advance towards
him with naked Poniards, diſcharg'd his Piſtol
at 'em, and then made his Eſcape. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
the two <hi>Barbarianss</hi> one of whom had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a ſlight Wound by the Shot, being reinforc'd
by ſome of their Fellows, ran thro' the Streets,
ſwearing like enrag'd Furies, and threatning to
murder all the <hi>French</hi> without exception. In the
Heat of their Rage they met three Mariners of
<hi>Provence</hi> coming out of a Barber's Shop, whom
they inſtantly aſſaulted, and dragg'd by the Hair
along the Street to the <hi>Bazar,</hi> where they butcher'd
'em with their Poniards in a moſt barbarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
The <hi>French Conſul</hi> being alarm'd at the News,
commanded thoſe of his Nation to keep within
Doors all that Day, and ſent for Soldiers and
Arms from on board the Ships that were in the
Port, to ſecure him from the Inſolency of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd
Rabble. Next Morning he order'd forty
Men, arm'd with Carabines and Piſtols, to bring
off the Bodies of the three Seamen that had lain
all the while in the Street. As ſoon as the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:51983:173"/>
heard of their Deſign, they reſolv'd to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Execution of it; but ſince they had no
Fire-Arms, and are extremely afraid of Shot, they
fled after the firſt Diſcharge, and left the Bodies
to the <hi>French,</hi> who carry'd 'em off without any
Oppoſition. In the mean time the <hi>Conſul</hi> had
ſent a Meſſage to the other two <hi>Conſuls</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> to beg their Aſſiſtance in the
Common Cauſe of the Three Nations: But theſe
Gentlemen did not think fit to irritate an enrag'd
Mobb that had not poſitively declar'd againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Nation but the <hi>French.</hi> And it appear'd
by the Event, that they acted wiſely in ſo nice
a Juncture; for the Neutrality they obſerv'd, and
the Care they took not to kindle the Fury of the
<hi>Barbarians</hi> by appearing too much in the Streets,
had ſo good an Effect, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
receiv'd not the leaſt Injury during the Tumult,
except ſome affronting Words. The <hi>French Conſul</hi>
being diſappointed of the Aſſiſtance he expected
from the two Nations, and not knowing to what
Saint he ſhou'd make h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

laſt to demand Protection from the <hi>Cadi.</hi> Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
he ſent two Merchants, and as many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
to complain to that Officer of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
he had receiv'd from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and to
aſſure him that if the Tumult were not quickly
appeas'd, he wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d ſeek Redreſs at the <hi>Port,</hi> and
in the mean time wou'd Arm thoſe of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in their own Defence. But inſtead of the Aid
he expected, he had the Mortification to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
only a faint Excuſe; for the moſt favourable
Anſwer his Meſſengers cou'd obtain from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi>
was, that he had not Forces ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the ſeditious Multitude; and that the beſt
Advice he cou'd give his Maſter, was to defend
himſelf as well as he cou'd. The <hi>Conſul</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that this was in effect an abſolute Denial,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:51983:174"/>
diſpatch'd an Expreſs to Monſieur <hi>de Chaſteauneuf,</hi>
to acquaint him with the extreme Danger that
threaten'd the Nation, and to intreat him to uſe
his Int'reſt at the <hi>Port</hi> for the procuring a <hi>Grand
Mandamus</hi> againſt the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I proceed farther, 'twill not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to inform you, that a <hi>Grand Mandamus</hi> is an
expreſs Order from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> which he never
grants but in Caſes of great Neceſſity, and of
the higheſt Importance. Thoſe who refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to it are declar'd Rebels againſt the <hi>Grand
Signior;</hi> and the Law ordains that ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhall be treated as Infidels: So that theſe
Orders may be call'd the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Thunders;
as Excommunications are ſaid to be the Thunders
of the <hi>Vatican.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Conſul</hi> waited with an extreme Impatience
for the Return of his Expreſs, and during the
ſpace of three Weeks which that Meſſenger ſpent
in his Journey, and in diſpatching his Bus'neſs,
the <hi>French</hi> were forc'd to ſuffer the Inſolency of
the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> whoſe Fury was ſo far from being
appeas'd, that it wanted little of its firſt impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity;
for they continu'd ſtill to beat and affront
all the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> that came in their Way. Nor
cou'd the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> eſcape their Rage, for
as many of 'em as were found with yellow <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouches,</hi>
long Breeches, or any ſort of Habit or
Ornament prohibited by Law, were ſure of the
<hi>Baſtinado;</hi> theſe Villains pretending that they wou'd
reſtore Juſtice in the City, and reform the Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that had crept into the Government. One
Day they happen'd to meet an old <hi>Drogue-man</hi>
with a <hi>Chacſir,</hi> after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Faſhion, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ask'd him by what Authority he wore
that Habit: The poor Man reply'd, that he wore
it as Interpreter of <hi>France;</hi> but this Anſwer
inſtead of pacifying 'em, irritated 'em ſo extremely,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:51983:174"/>
that after a ſevere Beating they took away his
<hi>Chacſir,</hi> and ſent him home with a bare Breech.
At laſt the <hi>Grand Mandamus</hi> came, forbidding the
<hi>Barbarians</hi> under pain of Rebellion to moleſt the
<hi>French;</hi> and ordaining the <hi>Cadi,</hi> and all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to ſhut up their Shops, and be
ready to aſſiſt the <hi>French</hi> in caſe of any Tumult
or Diſturbance. The <hi>Conſul</hi> was extremely proud
of this Order, and after he had notify'd it to the
<hi>Cadi,</hi> thought himſelf as ſecure as if he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a ſtrong Reinforcement: But the <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
who had receiv'd Advice of it from the <hi>Cadi,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of ſubmitting to the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Command, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to Rage with more Violence than before.
The firſt who felt the Fury of this new Storm,
were a Chirurgeon and another <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who
receiv'd three Wounds with a Poniard. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they beſieg'd the <hi>Conſul</hi>'s Houſe, and wou'd
have ſet Fire to it, if they had not been prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by fifteen or twenty <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> whom he had
call'd to his Aſſiſtance. The <hi>Cadi</hi> ſeem'd to be an
unconcern'd Spectator of all theſe Diſorders; for
when the <hi>Conſul</hi> ſent to require his Aſſiſtance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Order he had receiv'd from the <hi>Port,</hi>
he anſwer'd him in plain Terms, that he neither
wou'd nor durſt incenſe the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and that
he was reſolv'd to expect the Event without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing
in other Mens Affairs. In the mean time
the Inhabitants of the City ſhut up their Shops,
according to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Order; but they
were ſo far from aſſiſting the <hi>French,</hi> that they had
not the Courage to appear in the Streets: And if
by good Fortune the <hi>Captain Baſſa</hi> had not arriv'd
with ſeven Galleys, 'tis hard to divine what might
have been the iſſue of theſe Diſturbances. You
may eaſily conclude, that our Country-men, after
ſuch late and fatal Experience of the Barbarity of
thoſe Infidels, are extremely alarm'd at the News
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:51983:175"/>
of their Arrival: And their Fears are encreas'd
by the Advice they have receiv'd from <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
that there were two <hi>Frenchmen</hi> murder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by
'em there in their own Houſes. 'Tis true, the
two <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Nations have hitherto ſuffer'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Words; but who can ſecure 'em from
the Danger of being made Sharers in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Calamity, if another Tumult ſhou'd happen.
'Tis impoſſible to reflect without Horror on their
manner of attacking a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> that has the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to come in their way. As ſoon as they
perceive him at a Diſtance, they draw their Poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
and with a Howling and Wolviſh Noiſe, run
bellowing out theſe Words, <hi>alla, alla, alla,</hi> in the
ſame Tone they uſe when they board a Ship. In
ſuch Caſes 'tis in vain to think of Reſiſtance; and
as ſoon as a Man ſees 'em coming, he muſt place
his only Confidence in the Swiftneſs of his Legs;
For if a <hi>Turk</hi> ſhou'd offer to ſtop 'em, they wou'd
infallibly turn their Poniards againſt him.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the fatal and inevitable Conſequences
of the Weakneſs of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Government: And
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> muſt be a tame Spectator of the
Inſolency of three or four Hundred Scoundrels,
(for there were no more of 'em,) and patiently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
'em to domineer over a great City, ſlight his
<hi>Grand Mandamus</hi>'s, and aſſaſſinate almoſt under his
Whiskers thoſe whom he had taken into his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
in ſo particular a manner.</p>
               <p>The preſent <hi>French Conſul</hi> has been very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in the Diſcharge of his Office. He has been
twice affronted by the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> and beſides, he
has a very ſmall Share in the Ambaſſador's Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and is yet leſs belov'd by the Nation, who
take all Occaſions to mortifie him. T'other Day
there happen'd a Quarrel between him and the
<hi>Capuchins,</hi> who are Curates of the Pariſh, on the
Occaſion of the Election of a Grand-Vicar. For
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:51983:175"/>
the <hi>Conſul</hi> was perſuaded by the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to promote
one whom they recommended to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to make him Officiate on S. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Day,
and pronounce that Saint's Panegyrick. The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins</hi>
wou'd not own the new Vicar, and were
ſo incens'd againſt the <hi>Conſul,</hi> that they threaten'd
to ſhut the Doors of their Church; but perceiving
that he was reſolv'd to break 'em open, they were
unwilling to expoſe themſelves to ſo publick an
Affront, and contented themſelves with giving out
that they wou'd Excommunicate the <hi>Conſul,</hi> who
laugh'd at their Anger, and told 'em in a deriding
manner, that ſince nothing leſs than Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
wou'd ſatisfie 'em, he wou'd let 'em know
that he cou'd Excommunicate as well as they,
and that they ſhou'd find his Sentences more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
than theirs were wont to be. This <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul</hi>
is abſolutely govern'd by the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and ſo
intirely devoted to 'em, that he can't live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
'em. Among the Marks of his Affection to
that Order, I may reckon the late ſplendid Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
which he gave to Father <hi>Grimaldy,</hi> who
paſs'd by this Place in his Return from <hi>China,</hi>
from whence he was ſent with the Character of
an <hi>Envoy</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King. This <hi>Jeſuit</hi> has a
ſtrange Ambition to appear Great, and talks per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
of the Honours he receives from the King
of <hi>China,</hi> and of the Favours that Monarch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows
on ſome other Fathers of the Society, whom
he has made <hi>Mandarin's</hi> of the firſt Order. It muſt
be acknowledg'd, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are perfect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Art of Intriguing; they have always
made it their Bus'neſs to inſinuate themſelves into
the Affection of Princes, and have manag'd their
Ambitious Deſigns with ſo much Dexterity and
Succeſs, that we have already ſeen ſome Fathers
of that Order dignify'd with the Title of Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
by the Courts of <hi>Siam, China, Poland, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:51983:176"/>
&amp;c.</hi> You ſee, Sir, how ſuitable their Actions
are to the pretended Humility of their Profeſſion:
And I leave you to judge with what Confidence
they can boaſt of their renouncing Eccleſiaſtical
Dignities, while they court Secular Preferments
with ſo much Eagerneſs.</p>
               <p>In the Account I gave you of the Temper and
Diſpoſition of the <hi>Turks,</hi> I forgot to take notice
of their ſurprizing Neglect of the Public Int'reſt,
in which Reſpect they run exactly Counter to the
Maxims that are obſerv'd in all well-govern'd States.
If we conſider this incurable Flaw in their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
we may venture to conclude that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
will not find many Objects of Admiration
in the future Monuments of their Power and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
If the <hi>Aegyptians, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> had not
been inſpir'd with a nobler Ardour, we ſhou'd
not now ſee ſo many Curious and Inquiſitive Perſons
undertake ſuch long and troubleſome Voyages to
viſit the Ruines of their ancient Grandeur, or to
diſcover the Medals that give ſome light to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of the Great Men for whom they were coin'd.
The <hi>Turks</hi> are ſo extremely careleſs of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Publick Affairs, that their Streets are
not ſo much as pav'd; and I'm apt to think there
wou'd not be a Fountain in their Cities, nor a
Bridge on their Rivers, if ſome dying Perſons did
not bequeath Legacies to be employ'd in erecting
ſuch uſeful Works. The ill Poſture of Affairs in
this Country is a natural Conſequence of the
Conſtitution of the Government; for what Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
can be expected in a place where there are
no incorporated Societies, Town-Houſes, Sheriffs,
or Burgo-maſters. They have no Publick Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
or Walks, and their Cities are extremely
ill-built. There are no fixt Poſts nor Couriers;
ſo that when a Man has occaſion to write to any
remote place, except <hi>Conſtantinople, Aleppo,</hi> or <hi>Cairo,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:51983:176"/>

he muſt ſometimes wait a whole Year for an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion;
and even between <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
there are only <hi>Arabs</hi> who go a-foot, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſtay a Month before they ſet out. I
leave you to judge how ſtale the News muſt
come to ſeveral places, and what an univerſal Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
muſt reign throughout the Empire. There
are ſome <hi>Turks</hi> who know not ſo much as the
Name of the reigning <hi>Sultan;</hi> and even in the
places that are moſt frequented, by reaſon of their
Conveniency for Traffick, ſuch as <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitan's
are ſcarce acquainted with the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Tranſactions in the World. For they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
publiſh any Books, Journals, Gazettes, or the
leaſt Account of Publick Affairs; nor do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that there is in all <hi>Turkey</hi> a Man capable of
ſuch an Undertaking. The Time they allow for
the Improvement of their Knowledge is intirely
ſpent in ſtudying the Art of Magical Divination
and Fortune-telling, which they have borrow'd
from the <hi>Arabs,</hi> and have ſo high an Opinion of,
that they eſteem it a neceſſary Qualification in
one that pretends to Learning. There is a very
famous Soothſayer in this place, call'd <hi>Solyman A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi>
of whom I heard ſo many Wonders, that I
went on purpoſe to ſee whether there was any
Solidity in ſo ſuſpected a Science. When I came
to the Place of his Abode, I found a Man whoſe
Mien and Aſpect was exactly ſuitable to the <hi>Idea</hi>
we uſually have of a <hi>Magician;</hi> for he was black and
lean, his Looks was gloomy and diſmal, and his
Beard almoſt cover'd his Breaſt; and beſides, he
had about twenty <hi>Arabick</hi> Books full of Figures. As
ſoon as I enter'd, I told him, by a Friend that
perform'd the Office of an Interpreter betwixt us,
that the Fame of his great Learning had drawn
me to ſee him; and begg'd him to acquaint me
with ſome part of my future Deſtiny. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:51983:178"/>
that I was a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that my Friend was
alſo a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and that conſequently we were
Brothers. I was not at all pleas'd with ſo imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
an Anſwer; but ſince I knew that the <hi>Turks</hi>
are extremely fond of Sentences, I look'd upon
his Bluntneſs to be an Effect of his Humour, and
deſir'd my Friend to ask him whether he cou'd
give me a particular Information concerning my
Fortune. <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and more than that; if
you pleaſe I will make you Diſcourſe with the black
Angel, who will teach you to ſpeak all ſorts of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</hi>
Since my only deſign was to diſcover
the utmoſt Reach of his Skill, I took him at his
Word, and earneſtly pray'd him to ſhew me the
Angel, which he promis'd to do the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Hour of <hi>Quindi.</hi> When I return'd at
the appointed Time, I found him extremely
puzzl'd to find out ſome way to ſave his Credit,
and that he was reſolv'd either to flinch from his
Promiſe, or to fright me from demanding the
performance of it: For at firſt he ask'd me a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Crowns, concluding that I wou'd not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
the Satisfaction of my Curioſity at ſo dear
a Rate: However, I reſolv'd to touch him in the
moſt ſenſible Part, knowing that he wou'd be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
concern'd for the Loſs of his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I told him then that I perceiv'd his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was not ſo profound as he pretended, and
that if he were not ſenſible of his own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
he wou'd not demand ſo extravagant a
Summ for ſo ſmall a Matter. Theſe Words, as I
expected, had ſome Influence upon him; for he
told me, but to convince me of the Injury I
did him by ſuſpecting the Truth of his Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he wou'd ſhow me the Angel, and wou'd
make me ſpeak to him for fifty Crowns. But he
was extremely ſurpriz'd, when inſtead of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to beat down the Price, as he concluded
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:51983:178"/>
I wou'd, I immediately agreed to the Bargain:
However, he conceal'd the Perplexity of his
Thoughts as well as he cou'd, and endeavour'd
to find out ſome other Starting-Hole. He aſſur'd
me that he wou'd gladly give me the Satisfaction
I deſir'd, but the Ceremony cou'd not be perform'd
till one a-Clock in the Morning: He advis'd me
therefore not to place too much Confidence in
my Courage, which cou'd not preſerve me from
being ſeiz'd with an Aſtoniſhment and Terror
that might be attended with very dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.
He added a hundred other Reaſons to
deter me from adventuring on ſo hazardous a piece
of Curioſity; but at laſt, perceiving that I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
fix'd in my Reſolution, he promis'd to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
me that Night, and began to talk of Perfumes,
Characters, and Evocations, which were ſo far
from Daunting either me or my Friend, that we
return'd thither in the Evening, well arm'd, and
reſolv'd to Fire briskly at the Devil if he ſhou'd
have the Confidence to attack us. If you ſhou'd
ask me what made me ſo deſirous to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Monſieur <hi>le Diable,</hi> and what Bus'neſs I had
to do with him, I ſhou'd be exremely puzzl'd to
give you a ſatisfactory Anſwer: But to deal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with you, I did not believe that 'twas in the
Conjurer's Power to bring us to a Sight of him,
and 'twas that perhaps that made me ſo reſolute
and couragious. At laſt Midnight being come, he
began to prepare his Perfumes, and to bring his
Books and Inſtruments, which I concluded he did
only to amuſe us; and after all theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
he told us that by reaſon of the Obſcurity
of the Moon he cou'd not ſhew us the Angel, but
he wou'd make him ſpeak to us in <hi>Arabick, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh,</hi>
or <hi>Italian,</hi> which we pleas'd. This unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Shuffling convinc'd me that he was an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor,
and I was ſo enrag'd at the Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:51983:179"/>
that I left him without daining to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
an Anſwer, and immediately went to my
Lodgings.</p>
               <p>By this Inſtance you may judge of the boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Skill of all thoſe feign'd <hi>Arabian</hi> Magicians;
for this Man was reputed one of the moſt learn'd
Profeſſors of that Art in <hi>Aſia:</hi> And yet 'tis as
certain as you may think it incredible, that ſome
<hi>Franks</hi> are ſo beſotted with thoſe myſtical Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that they are not aſham'd to imploy all their
Time in ſo uſeleſs an Occupation. I know a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
expert and much-eſteem'd Painter, call'd <hi>Le
Brun,</hi> who neglecting his Bus'neſs, applies himſelf
wholly to the Study of <hi>Divination,</hi> and ſpends
whole Days in turning over his Magical Books,
which he procures to be tranſlated into <hi>French</hi> at a
very conſiderable Charge. But notwithſtanding all
the Confidence of this pretended Diviner, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that his Art can be true, ſince the very
Principles on which it depends, are certainly falſe;
and to convince you of the Abſurdity of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions,
'twill be ſufficient to acquaint you with his
uſual Method of Divining. He has two little Bones
with Eight Sides a-piece, on each of which there is
a ſmall Character engrav'd; and when you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
your Queſtion, he throws the Bones, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
the Characters that appear on the ſides that
happen to be uppermoſt. Then having made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Combinations of theſe Characters, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Numbers, according to the Subject of the
Queſtion, he draws a Scheme or Figure, which he
ſeeks in one of his Books, where he finds a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
written, which he fancies to be the deſir'd
Solution. Thus you ſee 'tis plain that the whole
Myſtery depends on the Fortune of the Dice: But
when I endeavour'd to convince him of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of his Art which betray'd him into ſo
many Errors, that not One Anſwer in Thirty was
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:51983:179"/>
found to be exactly true, he reply'd very grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that theſe Miſtakes were occaſion'd by his
Ignorance, and that he did not yet comprehend
the Depths of that infallible Science; adding, as a
Confirmation of the Certainty of the Art, that
notwithſtanding the ſmall Progreſs he had made in
it, he never found that his Book had return'd a
Croſs or Impertinent Anſwer. And to convince
me of the Truth of his Aſſertion, he made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Tryals in my Preſence, and I obſerv'd always
that the Anſwer, whether True or Falſe, related to
the Subject of the Queſtion; nor will I ſcruple to
confeſs that I was ſomewhat ſurpriz'd at ſo odd an
Effect of Chance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> are alſo very much addicted to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the <hi>Philoſopher's Stone,</hi> or the Art of making
Gold and Silver; and I remember a ſtory on this
Subject, which I had from a <hi>Turk,</hi> who is reckon'd
a Man of Honour. Two <hi>Perſian Derviſes</hi> came to
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> about four Years ago, and after they
had ſtaid a Fortnight, told their Landlord, that
tho' they had no Money to pay for their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Entertainment, they were reſolv'd not to
go away without giving him entire Satisfaction.
I know not what Credit he gave to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
but he quickly perceiv'd the Effect of 'em,
for they took a large Copper-Diſh, which they
found in the Houſe, and having melted it down
in his Preſence, threw a little Powder upon it,
which immediately chang'd the Copper into Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
They retain'd one half for themſelves, and
left the other with their Landlord, who upon try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
found it to be true Silver: And beſides, they
preſented him with a ſmall Quantity of the
Powder. The <hi>Grand Viſier Iſmael,</hi> hearing of this
Accident, ſent for the Man, and oblig'd him to
deliver up the Powder, which he ſhow'd to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
expert <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> who according to his Orders,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:51983:180"/>
endeavour'd to find out the Secret. But all their
Attempts were unſucceſsful; and I'm the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to believe the Concluſion of the Story, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I look upon this Art to be no leſs frivolous
and uncertain than that of <hi>Divination.</hi>

               <p>IN compliance with your Deſire I ſhall in this
Letter, preſent you with a ſhort View of the
Life of <hi>Soliman,</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who died
<hi>June</hi> 22. and was ſucceeded by his younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Achmet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The preſent <hi>Grand Signior, Achmet,</hi> the deceas'd
<hi>Soliman,</hi> and the depos'd <hi>Sultan Mahomet,</hi> were three
Brothers, the Sons of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> who was
ſtrangl'd in the Caſtle of the <hi>Seven Towers,</hi> in the
heat of one of thoſe mutinous Tumults of the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries,</hi>
that happen ſo frequently in this Country.
His eldeſt Son <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who was then very young, was
declar'd Emperour by the Intereſt and Solicitation
of the <hi>Sultana</hi> Mother, and of the famous <hi>Viſie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
Kopergli,</hi> who ow'd his Advancement to her, and
ever afterwards ſerv'd her with an inviolable Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
This Prince's Reign may be juſtly reckon'd
diſaſtrous; for not to mention thoſe frequent and
terrible Seditions that made him tremble ſo often,
and in one of which he was at laſt dethron'd, his
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:51983:180"/>
Armies were ſeveral times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>outed by the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> before his Death, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
driven him quite out of <hi>Hungary.</hi> The
<hi>Turks,</hi> who are the moſt ungovernable Subjects in
the World to an unfortunate Prince, and who are
poſſeſs'd with a Belief of a certain Predeſtination,
that over-rules the Fate of their Emperour on which
they imagine the Fortune of the Empire depends,
concluded that the Reign of <hi>Mahomet</hi> would be a
perpetual Scene of Diſaſters: and the Grandees en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
the Superſtition of the People, in Expectation
of a favourable Opportunity to execute the Deſigns
they had premeditated againſt the Government.
They cou'd not have deſir'd a more inviting Juncture
to attempt and carry on ſo vaſt an Undertaking, than
the Diſturbances that were occaſion'd by the ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the Campaign of 1687. and eſpecially by
the Loſs of the Famous Battle of <hi>Herſan;</hi> where
the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> kill'd Ten thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> on the Spot,
pillag'd their Camp, made themſelves Maſters of
Ninety Pieces of Cannon, and their whole Train
of Artillery. The Conſternation that was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
among the <hi>Turks</hi> by the News of this Defeat,
was encreas'd by the Advice they receiv'd almoſt at
the ſame time that the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck</hi> was ſeiz'd
by the Count <hi>de Dunevalt,</hi> immediately after the
Victory. The <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> who commanded the
Army in Perſon, dreading the uſual Fate of his
Predeceſſors on ſuch Occaſions, endeavour'd to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
himſelf by laying the Blame on the Generals
that commanded under him; and reſolving to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Deſigns of his Enemies, perſwaded the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> to put 'em to Death. But tho' the
Orders for that Effect were actually given out,
there was ſo ſtrong a Party already form'd both
againſt the <hi>Viſier</hi> and the <hi>Sultan,</hi> that the Great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of the Army, with the <hi>Chiaoux Baſſa</hi> at their
Head, made the whole Army revolt, and march'd
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:51983:181"/>
towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with a Reſolution to depoſe
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> and place his Brother <hi>Soliman</hi> on the
Throne. The News of their Approach ſo terrifi'd
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> that knowing no orher Way to appeaſe
the Fury of the Rebels, he abandon'd the <hi>Grand vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier,</hi>
and ſent the Imperial Signet to the <hi>Chiaoux Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi>
whom he thought to gain by ſatisfying his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.
But he quickly found that the Danger was
greater than he imagin'd; for that Officer declar'd
that he would not accept the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Offer till the
<hi>Grand Viſier, Tefterdar,</hi> Receiver of the Cuſtoms, the
<hi>Caimacan,</hi> and ſome others whom he nam'd, were
put to Death. The Perſons whoſe Heads he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
were the only faithful Servants of the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who was extremely perplex'd at ſo
unwelcome a Propoſal; knowing that his <hi>Viſier</hi>'s
Death wou'd infallibly put a Period to his own
Life, or at leaſt to his Reign. However the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of his Affairs conſtrain'd him at laſt to ſign
the fatal Order: the unfortunate <hi>Viſier</hi> was
ſtrangl'd, and his Head ſent to the <hi>Chiaoux Baſſa,</hi>
who was ſo far from being appeas'd, that his Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
was heighten'd by this Mark of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s
Condeſcenſion. He diſmiſs'd the Meſſengers with
Scorn, telling 'em in a domineering Manner, That
they cou'd not juſtly expect he wou'd be ſatisfied
with one Head inſtead of Twenty which he had
demanded; and that this way of proceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
him that the Government was not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
for the Quiet of the Empire. Thus the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
was conſtrain'd to ſend all the reſt of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
whom thoſe inſolent Rebels requir'd; and
ſoon after perceiv'd there was no Hope of reducing
'em to a Sence of their Duty: for all the Priſoners
were barbarouſly murder'd in the Middle of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
by the <hi>Chiaoux Baſſa</hi>'s Order. This laſt Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity
ſtruck ſuch a Terrour into the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi>'s
Mind, that concluding himſelf to be irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:51983:181"/>
loſt, he reſolv'd in the Fury of his Deſpair
to put to Death all his Brothers and Sons. To
comprehend the Reaſon of this diſmal Reſolution,
you muſt know that the Religion of the <hi>Turks</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires
'em with a certain Veneration for the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Blood, that over-awes 'em ev'n in the the
midſt of the moſt terrible Seditions, and is ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rooted in their Minds, that they wou'd rather
chuſe to ſuffer the moſt cruel Death than to ſee
the Throne poſſeſs'd by a Prince of another Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And therefore 'tis the uſual Cuſtom of thoſe
Emperours to begin their Reign with the Death of
their Brothers, that the Throne may be ſecur'd from
the Attempts of ſo many dangerous Pretenders.
Thus <hi>Sultan Amurath,</hi> the Uncle of theſe three Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
put to Death all the Males of the Family;
and if the Tenderneſs of a Mother had not prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
the <hi>Sultana Validé</hi> to hide <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who was the
Youngeſt, the whole Race had been extinguſh'd. For
the <hi>Sultans</hi> are more concern'd for their own Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
than for the Preſervation of the Royal Line.
Nevertheleſs <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> wou'd never hearken
to the Perſwaſions of ſome of his Counſellours,
who advis'd him to put that cruel Maxim in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and endeavour'd to make him ſenſible that
the Quiet of the Empire could never be ſecur'd but by
the Death of <hi>Soliman</hi> and <hi>Achmet.</hi> But ſince he wou'd
not put 'em to death while they were in his Power,
he found, at laſt, that he cou'd not execute that
bloody Reſolution when his Deſpair conſtrain'd
him to attempt it: for the <hi>Boſtangi Baſſa,</hi> who was
one of the Conſpirators, carry'd the two Princes to
the old <hi>Seraglio</hi> under a ſtrong Guard, who mock'd
the <hi>Sultan</hi> when he demanded to be admitted with
ſome of his Servants; and the Army was already
poſted in and about <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> That Night a
Council of the Great Officers was held in <hi>Santa-Sophia,</hi>
where they came to a final Reſolution to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:51983:182"/>
place <hi>Soliman</hi> on the Throne, and he was declar'd
Emperour the next Day with univerſal Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of Joy. Thus <hi>Mahomet</hi> was depos'd, and
<hi>Soliman,</hi> who was no leſs averſe to Cruelty than his
Brother, contented himſelf with ordaining that he
ſhou'd receive the ſame Treatment which he had
made him ſuffer for ſo many Years. When the
<hi>Capigi Baſſa</hi> came to ſecure his Perſon, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the New Emperour's Order, he
found him on the <hi>Sopha</hi> drinking Coffee, with a
Serenity of Mind that may be almoſt reckon'd a
Prodigy, conſidering the deplorable Circumſtances
of his Condition. He ſubmitted without making
the leaſt Reſiſtance, ſaying, <hi>That it was impoſſible
to oppoſe the Decrees of Heav'n, and that whatſoever is
predeſtinated muſt neceſſarily happen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Caimacan,</hi> who was one
of <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi>'s Favorites, had the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
or Intereſt, to ſecure himſelf from being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll'd
among the reſt of thoſe miſerable Victims
that were ſacrific'd to the Fury of the <hi>Chiaoux Baſſa.</hi>
But aſſoon as he perceiv'd that his Maſter was irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably
ruin'd, he reſolv'd to prevent the implacable
Malice of his Enemies by a ſpeedy flight: and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> was the only Place where
he could expect to ſecure his Life, he embark'd
that Night on a Saique accompany'd only with
one Servant; and having made a ſufficient Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gold, Silver, and Jewels, attempted to get
into a <hi>French</hi> Veſſel of <hi>Ciotad,</hi> commanded by one
Captain <hi>Crevilliers:</hi> but the Mariners who had been
already alarm'd with the News of thoſe terrible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbanees,
wou'd not ſuffer him to approach the
Ship till he had declar'd his Name, and acquainted
'em, that the <hi>Caimacan</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> deſir'd to
ſpeak with the Captain. Aſſoon as the Captain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
the <hi>Caimacan</hi> intreated him to receive him
on Board his Ship, and tranſport him to <hi>France;</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:51983:182"/>
aſſuring him that he might ſet ſail the next night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Oppoſition, and offering Twenty thouſand
<hi>Sequins,</hi> or Fifty thouſand Crowns for his Paſſage.
This was a very tempting Offer to the Captain,
and he has ſince told me, that he wou'd have moſt
willingly accepted it, if the <hi>Caimacan</hi> had had the
the Prudence to conceal his Name; but ſince both
that and his Quality was known by the whole
Ship's Company, neither Compaſſion nor Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
cou'd prevail with the Captain to run ſo great
a Hazard; ſo that the poor <hi>Caimacan</hi> was forc'd to
ſteer his Courſe towards the Canal of the Black Sea,
thinking to make his Eſcape that way. But he was
quickly diſcover'd by the great Quantity of Silver
which he had about him, and was brought back
to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he was beheaded. A Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
other <hi>Baſſa's</hi> underwent the ſame Fate; and
the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> giving a full Career to his Spite
and Revenge, fill'd the whole City with Blood
and Slaughter. There was nothing to be ſeen in
the Streets but <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahi's,</hi> aſſaulting and
murdering thoſe whom they met; and no Man
when he roſe in the Morning was ſure of going to
Bed at Night. The <hi>Franks</hi> were extremely afraid,
leſt the Storm ſhould fall on them: the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
ſecur'd their Houſes with ſtrong Guards, and
all the Veſſels in the Port, <hi>Engliſh, French, Dutch</hi>
and <hi>Venetian,</hi> join'd together, and put out to Sea,
with a Reſolution to defend themſelves to the laſt
Extremity, in caſe they ſhou'd be attack'd. To
conclude; I have heard ſome <hi>Turks,</hi> who are both
very old, and well skill'd in the Hiſtory of their
Country, affirm, That the Quiet of the Empire
was never diſturb'd by a more Bloody Sedition.
However 'twas at laſt appeas'd, tho' the Calm
laſted not long; for in <hi>March</hi> there broke forth
another terrible Inſurrection againſt the New <hi>Sultan,</hi>
whom all Men began to look upon as incapable of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:51983:183"/>
the Government. Nor were they much miſtaken
in their Opinion of him, and 'tis ſtrange they did
not ſooner foreſee the dangerons Conſequences
of ſo great a Revolution; for how cou'd a Man
learn the Art of Ruling ſo troubleſome an Empire,
who had ſpent his whole Life in a cloſe Priſon,
where he cou'd only converſe with Books, and was ſo
perfect a Stranger to the Management of Affairs,
that he was ignorant ev'n in the moſt common
Things. Thus the beſt Quality they could expect
or deſire him to be indu'd with, was an Eaſineſs of
Temper, and a Willingneſs to be abſolutely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by his Miniſters; and indeed it may be ſaid,
that there was never a more tractable Prince; for
during the whole Courſe of his Reign he never made
Uſe of his Abſolute Power in any one Act, but
only in preſerving his Brothers, whom he was
often advis'd to put to Death; eſpecially on this
Occaſion, when the Rebels threaten'd to reſtore
<hi>Mahomet</hi> to the Throne, and had almoſt effected
their Reſolution: for the <hi>Viſier</hi> was maſſacr'd in his
own Houſe by the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of the Revolt, and had made themſelves
Maſters of the City. But the <hi>Sultan</hi> having very
ſeaſonably diſplay'd the Banner of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the
<hi>Saphi's,</hi> the <hi>Leventi,</hi> and the People run to his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and diſpers'd the the <hi>Janizaries.</hi> After the
Tumult was calm'd, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Natolia,</hi> who
headed the Rebels, was oblig'd to beg Pardon, and
above Five hundred of the Mutineers were hang'd;
tho' their Death made but a poor Amends for a
whole Quarter of the City, and above Twenty
Galleys and Sultana's which they had burnt.
'Twou'd be needleſs to give you a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Relation of theſe Accidents, ſince you have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
read an Account of 'em in your publick Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
or News-Papers; and the only Reaſon why I
mention'd 'em, is becauſe they give ſome Light to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:51983:183"/>
the Tranſactions that ſucceeded 'em, which perhaps
have not yet come to your knowledge. While the
whole City was in a terrible Combuſtion, and the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venti</hi>
animated by a Deſire of Plunder, were ſeeking
an Occaſion of breaking forth into freſh Diſorders,
there came a whole Troop of 'em to the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour's
Palace, and in a very inſolent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
deſir'd him to receive a certain beggarly <hi>Greek,</hi>
whom they brought along with 'em, to be his <hi>Drugger-Man,</hi>
or Interpreter. At firſt <hi>Monſieur de Girardin</hi>
rejected the Propoſal, telling 'em that he did not
want a <hi>Drugger-Man,</hi> and would not take one upon
their Recommendation; but ſeeing they began to
be unruly, and threaten to ſet Fire to his Houſe,
he grew more complaiſant, and receiv'd the <hi>Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-Man</hi>
more civilly. Nor can he be blam'd for
ſuffering himſelf to be hector'd by the Rabble,
ſince 'tis certainly the wiſeſt Courſe to ſubmit on
ſuch Occaſions.</p>
               <p>After the Sedition was quieted, <hi>Soliman</hi> retir'd to
<hi>Adrianople;</hi> for he did not think himſelf ſafe in a
City that becomes the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Priſon upon the
firſt breaking forth of an Inſurrection; and after
that time he never reſided in it. He conferr'd
the Dignity of <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> on one <hi>Iſmael Baſſa,</hi>
a Man without Experience, and one who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to recommend him but the Favour of his
Maſter. No ſooner was he intruſted with the
Adminiſtration of the Government, but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
was over-run with thoſe Diſorders and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions
that are the natural Conſequences of the
Unskilfulneſs of the Principal Miniſter of State.
Several <hi>Baſſa's</hi> began to form Cabals, and enter
into ſeparate Aſſociations. Some eſpous'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> the Mother of the depos'd
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> who plotted to reſtore her Son; others
declar'd in Favour of one <hi>Jeghen Baſſa,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Race: ſome reſolv'd
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:51983:184"/>
to be independent, without acknowledging any
Head of their Party, and all in general reſus'd to
ſubmit to the preſent Government.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Emperour carry'd on the
War very proſperouſly; for the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>
took <hi>Belgrade</hi> by Storm, and the Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi>
after he had defeated the Baſſa of <hi>Boſnia,</hi> made
himſelf Maſter of the whole Province. The next
Year was remarkable for more Signal and Glorious
Advantages; for the Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Imperial Army in <hi>Hungary,</hi> fought
three Battles ſucceſſively, and obtain'd as many
important Victories.</p>
               <p>The firſt Battle was fought near <hi>Paſſarowitz,</hi>
where the <hi>Turks</hi> loſt ſeven Thouſand Men, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pieces of Cannon, all their Bombs, Carcaſſes,
Mortars, Powder, Tents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was obtain'd on the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> near <hi>Niſſa,</hi>
where the <hi>Seraſquier</hi> who commanded in Perſon,
cou'd not prevent the Loſs of all his Cannon, and
eight Thouſand Soldiers. The third Battel was
fought near <hi>Widen;</hi> and during the Heat of the
Action, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> carry'd the Town by Storm.
Beſides, the Prince of <hi>Baden</hi> had taken <hi>Niſſa, Zwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,
Nowigrath, Arſowath,</hi> and ſeveral other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which open'd a free Paſſage into <hi>Bulgaria</hi> and
<hi>Macedonia,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Romania;</hi> ſo that
if the War had been carry'd on for ſome time with
the ſame Vigour and Succeſs, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> might
have advanc'd to the Gates of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But
in the beginning of the laſt Year, the <hi>Viſier Iſmael</hi>
was depos'd, and ſucceeded by <hi>Kopergli Oglou, Baſſa</hi>
of <hi>Scio.</hi> 'Twas then the <hi>Turks</hi> began to hope they
might ſee a happy Turn of Affairs; they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
the great Actions of the famous <hi>Viſier</hi> of that
Name, and were perſuaded that this Miniſter wou'd
imitate ſo glorious a Example. Nor were they
diſappointed in their Expectation; for the new
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:51983:184"/>
                  <hi>Viſier</hi> was not inferior to his Predeceſſor either in
Valour, Strength of Mind, or any other Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are neceſſary to fit a Man for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Affairs; and the Empire was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſenſible of the Advantageous Influences of his
Government. I have already acquainted you in a
former Letter, with the proſperous Succeſs of their
Arms during the laſt Campagne, which gave Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador to take notice of
the Sympathy between the two Empires, and was
afterwards ſolemniz'd by that Triumph of which I
gave you a ſhort Deſcription. And therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of troubling you with a tedious Relation of
thoſe Events, which you have doubtleſs heard of,
and have not yet forgotten; I ſhall only tell you, that
if that Great Man had not been kill'd at the Battle
of <hi>Salankemen,</hi> the Chriſtians wou'd have had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to dread a fatal Revolution, which they cou'd
hardly have prevented any otherwiſe, than by a
ſpeedy Peace. And indeed that Deſign was carry'd
on ſo ſucceſsfully, that every one expected a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Concluſion of their Negotiations, when they
were unfortunately interrupted by the <hi>Viſier</hi>'s Death.
For he was not at all averſe to the Propoſal, and
was ſo far from being acted by that baſe Love of
Riches, with which the <hi>Turks</hi> are generally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd,
that, contrary to the uſual Maxims of his
Predeceſſors, he purſu'd no other Intereſt than
this of the State. He had often diſcours'd on that
Subject with <hi>Monſieur Collier,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
whoſe Reaſons made the greater Impreſſion
upon him, becauſe of the Character he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
of his Merit, Capacity, and Dexterity in
publick Negotiations. And that able Miniſter had
prepoſſeſs'd the Mind of the <hi>Viſier</hi> with ſuch ſtrong
Inclinations to a Peace, that, if we may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to judge by the moſt promiſing Appearances,
he wou'd have actually concluded it, if he had not
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:51983:185"/>
been prevented by Death. For <hi>Monſieur Collier</hi> had
made ſo good Uſe of ſuch a favourable Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that almoſt all the Articles were agreed on,
and the Emperour had empower'd the Prince of
<hi>Baden</hi> to ſign the Treaty; and had appointed the
Counts of <hi>Kinsky</hi> and <hi>Straatman</hi> to be his Aſſiſtants.
The King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> had
alſo ſent their Plenipotentiaries: but inſtead of the
much-deſir'd News of a Peace, we receiv'd an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the dreadful Battle of <hi>Salankemen,</hi> in
which the <hi>Viſier</hi> was one of the firſt that loſt his
Life. The <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> the <hi>Seraſquier,</hi>
and Ten other <hi>Baſſa's</hi> of Note, had the ſame Fate;
and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army fled with ſo much Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Terrour, that the Memory of the
Oldeſt Men cannot furniſh 'em with an Inſtance
of ſo entire a Defeat. They loſt above 20000
Men, all their Cannon and Baggage; and, in a
word, all they had in their Camp. I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the Conſternation that was ſpread over the
whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, by the ſurprizing and
melancholy News which was brought into this
Country by ſome that had the good Fortune to
eſcape; who never ſpeak of that Battle without a
certain Dread and Amazement in their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which gives us a more lively Idea of the
Horrour of that Day, than the moſt particular
Relation that cou'd be made of the Action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur de Chateauneuf</hi> takes ſo deep a Share in
the Public Sorrow, that I know not whether he
cou'd ſupport ſo terrible a Blow, if the <hi>Viſier</hi>'s
Death did not comfort him a little. For that
Miniſter never had the Happineſs of his Favour,
becauſe he wou'd not be led by his Advice;
and I know a Man to whom the Ambaſſadour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
his Thoughts in theſe very Words, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Peace; <hi>'Twill, doubtleſs, be ſpeedily conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
ſaid he; <hi>The Dutch Ambaſſadour is perpetually
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:51983:185"/>
with the Viſier, and has got ſuch a Power over him,
that he can undo in one Day all that I am able to do
in Ten.</hi> Nor were his Fears groundleſs, for I can
aſſure you that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is perhaps the fitteſt
Man in the World to manage ſuch a Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In the firſt place, he knows the Original
of all the Great Men at the Port, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
acquainted with their ſeveral Humours,
Intrigues, and Intereſts. Beſides he is the Son of
an Ambaſſadour, and from his very Birth has
been enur'd to Buſineſs, which by that Means
is become ſo natural to him, that he manages
the moſt intricate Affairs with a certain happy
Eaſineſs that can only be acquir'd by a Perſon
of ſo rare an Induſtry, and after a long Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
at the Court. Theſe are the Advantages
which <hi>Monſieur de Chateauneuf</hi> wants: 'tis true, he
has a great deal of Wit, and never ſleeps away
an Opportunity of Acting; but after all, an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
at his Arrival from <hi>France</hi> may be
reckon'd almoſt as great a Stranger at the Port,
as if he had dropt from the Clouds. The Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
and Humour of that Nation is directly oppoſite
to ours, and Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has ſtudi'd it ſo carefully,
and underſtands it ſo perfectly, that he cou'd ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
give the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> themſelves a Leſſon on this
Subject. So that if <hi>Monſieur de Chateauneuf</hi> did not
counter-ballance theſe Advantages with large Bags of
Gold and Silver, which are always wont to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh
Reaſon in <hi>Turkey,</hi> the Peace wou'd have been
long ſince concluded. This puts me in Mind of a
Story, which will give you an Idea of the uſual
way of managing Affairs in this place.</p>
               <p>The Captain of a <hi>Venetian</hi> Ship, who arriv'd
ſome Months ago at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and Colours of <hi>Holland,</hi> was ſolicited by
the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour to put himſelf under his
Protection, and was at laſt allur'd to yield to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:51983:186"/>
that Miniſter's Requeſt by the Promiſes he
made him to obtain conſiderable Favours for
him, both as to the Entry and Exportation of
his Goods. Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> who upon all Occaſions
maintains the Honour of his Maſters with the
higheſt Zeal and Courage, wou'd not endure an
Affront that ſeem'd to be directly aim'd at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public.
Aſſoon as he heard of it, he ſent Orders
to the Captain to take down the Banner of
<hi>France,</hi> if he was not reſolv'd to ſuffer the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Severity of his juſt Indignation: but that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
Officer ſlighted the Meſſage, and ſo was
himſelf the Cauſe of all the Misfortunes that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
befel him. For after his Excellency had
given Notice to the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> that there was
a Prize in the Port, Orders were immediately
ſent to ſeize the Veſſel, which was declar'd to
be lawful Prize; and the Captain with all the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were put in Chains. You may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the <hi>French</hi> were extremely mortifi'd to
ſee a hundred Wretches loaded with Fetters, and
ſold for Slaves, meerly for ſetting up the Banner
of that Nation. <hi>Monſieur de Chateauneuf</hi> receiv'd a
very ſevere Reprimand from <hi>Monſieur de Pont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chartrain,</hi>
and 'twas generally believ'd that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion
on this Occaſion wou'd make him be
recall'd from the Port. In the mean time he
was perpetually at the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi>'s Gate, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuning
him for the Relief of the Ship and
Mariners: but after all his earneſt Solicitations,
he cou'd not obtain a more favourable Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than that he was permitted to redeem the
Men at the Rate of Fifty Crowns a-piece; and
the Ranſom of the Ship was fix'd at Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Crowns, which was more than its real Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.
Since that time the Credit of the <hi>French</hi>
Protection is extremely leſſen'd; and I'm apt to
believe that few Captains will hereafter be guilty
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:51983:186"/>
of the like Imprudence. And even I know ſeveral
<hi>Venetian</hi> Captains who will not put themſelves under
the Protection of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
has impos'd a Tax of Fifteen thouſand
Crowns upon the Veſſels of that Nation by way
of Reprizal, for the Money he paid to the <hi>Grand
Viſier.</hi> This Impoſition occaſions a great murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
among the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who pretend that he
was oblig'd in Juſtice to redeem the Veſſel at
his own Charge, ſince he was the only Cauſe
of its Misfortune.</p>
               <p>I perceive that I have inſenſibly wander'd from
my Subject, and am ready to acknowledge that
this wou'd be an unpardonable Fault in an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
and Methodical Hiſtory: but ſince I only
promis'd you a clear and faithful Account of
the Obſervations I ſhou'd have Occaſion to make
in my Travels, I do not think my ſelf oblig'd
to make an Apology for every little Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Soliman</hi> died on the <hi>twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
of <hi>June</hi> laſt: ſome believe that his Death
was natural, but others ſay that it was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
by the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> the Mother of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The
laſt of theſe Opinions is moſt generally receiv'd,
and wou'd ſeem very probable, if it had produc'd
any advantageous Alteration in the Condition of
that unfortunate Prince; but there was not the
leaſt Motion made in Order to his Reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Achmet</hi> was unanimouſly elected, and his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
to the Throne was attended with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Tranquillity that is rarely obſerv'd in this
Country. The Misfortunes that happen'd in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Reign ſeem to be the Forerunners
and Preſages of future Diſaſters; for before the firſt
Month was expir'd, he loſt that Great and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Battle of <hi>Salankemen,</hi> of which I have
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:51983:187"/>
already given you an Account. And if I may be
allow'd to give Credit to the probable Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of thoſe who are beſt acquainted with the
Genius of his Subjects, I may venture to foretell
that he will never be an old Emperour, tho' he
is already in the <hi>Eight and fortieth</hi> Year of his
Age. For the <hi>Franks</hi> are poſſeſs'd with a leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Opinion of him than of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
<hi>Soliman,</hi> whoſe Reign was nevertheleſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd
with an almoſt perpetual Revolt that kept
his Throne continually in a tottering Condition.</p>
               <p>The Death of the <hi>Viſier Kopergli,</hi> according to
the uſual Cuſtom of this Country, was follow'd
with ſeveral Changes of Officers, and the Death
of many great Perſons, among the reſt of one
<hi>Muſtapha Aga,</hi> whom I knew at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
He was born at <hi>Leghorn</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and had
the Diſadvantage to be deſcended of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
which had no conſiderable Fortune. He
was taken by the <hi>Turks</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Candy,</hi>
and renounc'd his Religion at the Deſire of the
<hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> who had a good Opinion of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
and reſolv'd to put him in a Way of
Bus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>neſs. He was eaſily prevail'd with to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Faith; for ſince he was natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of an aſpiring Temper, he enter'd with Joy
into the Service of a Man by whoſe Intereſt he
might expect to raiſe his Fortune, and either
out of Gratitude, or Policy, he choſe always to
depend on that Family. So that the late <hi>Viſier,
Kopergli Oglou,</hi> was his particular Patron, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
him to the <hi>Tophana,</hi> that is, the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Caſting of Metals, of which he was Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectour-General,
as well as of the Mint, which is
the moſt gainful Poſt in the Empire. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
he made a very conſiderable Addition to
the uſual Profits of that Office, by inventing and
introducing a certain Copper Coin, call'd <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours:</hi>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:51983:187"/>
for each Piece was order'd to paſs at the
Rate of ſix <hi>French Deniers,</hi> tho' 'twas no larger
than a <hi>Dutch Doit,</hi> or a ſingle <hi>French Denier;</hi> ſo
that buying the Copper at <hi>twenty Pence</hi> a Pound, the
Profit amounted to <hi>Six</hi> in <hi>Seven.</hi> Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Advancement of <hi>Kopergli Oglou, Muſtapha</hi>
propos'd this Expedient to fill the Treaſury,
which till this time was very empty; and
had Orders to coin Four thouſand <hi>Purſes</hi> of
that Money, or Two millions of Crowns. So
prodigious a Quantity of thoſe Pieces cou'd not
but occaſion great Diſorders, and a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
of Trade; and beſides thoſe that were
coin'd at the Mint, there came ſeveral Barks la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with 'em from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> where
they were coin'd by the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo that there are
above Two hundred thouſand Crowns of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Money at preſent in the Empire. At laſt
People were ſo diſcourag'd at thoſe Abuſes, that
about three Months ago they began to refuſe to
take theſe Pieces for more than one half, and at
preſent they will not take 'em at all, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the repeated Orders of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
who (as I intimated before) is not much reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Country. The Diſorders occaſion'd by
the debaſing of the Coin, and the vaſt Eſtate <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha
Aga</hi> had acquir'd, were the Cauſes of his Death.
His Enemies had long before begun to exclaim
againſt the Methods he took to oppreſs the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
pretending that he was a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in his
Heart, and that he wou'd at laſt make his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
to <hi>Italy</hi> with all the Treaſure he had ſcrap'd
together in the Empire, which certainly had been
the moſt prudent Courſe for a Man in his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
But ſince the Deſire of Riches is like
the Thirſt of ſome diſeas'd Perſons, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
by Drinking, inſtead of heark'ning to the
Advice of his Friends, he took a quite contrary
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:51983:188"/>
Method, and ſent for his Siſter and Nephews,
thinking by that Means to vindicate himſelf from
the Aſperſions that were fix'd upon him by his
Adverſaries. Beſides he plac'd an entire Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> and thought himſelf
abſolutely ſecure under the Protection of ſo kind
and powerful a Patron: but he ought to have
conſider'd that his Patron was Mortal, and that
his Intereſt wou'd expire with his Life. 'Tis
plain by the Event, that he ſhou'd have acted
more warily in ſo dangerous a Poſt; for I have
juſt now receiv'd a Letter which informs me that
he was ſtrangl'd, after they had given him
the Torture to make him diſcover his Money.
And he was even ſo ſtrangely infatuated, that
tho' he was not apprehended for the Space of
Eight Days after the <hi>Viſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r</hi>'s Death, inſtead of
making his Eſcape, he choſe rather to expect his
Fate at his own Houſe; where he was at laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
by the <hi>Caimacan,</hi> with his Wife, Siſter, and
Nephews. Theſe unfortunate Creatures, who have
not yet renounc'd the <hi>Catholic</hi> Religion, ſent to
beg <hi>Monſieur de Chateauneuf</hi>'s Protection for the
obtaining of their Liberty: but he is too much a
Politician to hazard his Intereſt at the Port to
preſerve the Honour of his Religion.</p>
               <p>They begin again to talk of Peace more than
ever; and I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have not forgot the Promiſe I made you at
the End of my laſt Letter; but I know not
if you will thank me for keeping my Word,
ſince inſtead of the News I hop'd to ſend you,
I muſt acquaint you that the Negotiations for a
Peace are at an End, or rather interrupted for
ſome time; for 'tis ſo much the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s
Int'reſt to conclude a Treaty, that without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the Spirit of Propheſie, I may venture
to foretel that it will be renew'd. In the mean
time it will not be improper to give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this unexpected Accident. The <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors arriv'd at <hi>Adrianople</hi> in the
Beginning of the laſt Month, and had ſeveral
Conferences with the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> in which the
greateſt part of the Articles were mutually agreed
on; and the only Difficulty that obſtructed the
happy Concluſion of the Treaty, was the <hi>Viſier</hi>'s
inſiſting upon the Reſtoring of <hi>Buda,</hi> and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Caminiec,</hi> concerning which they expected
Inſtructions from the Emperor. While Affairs
were in this Poſture, the Plague began to rage ſo
violently at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> that the Ambaſſadors thought
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:51983:189"/>
fit to retire to a Vilage two Leagues on this ſide
the Town, till the Fury of the Diſtemper ſhou'd
be ſomewhat abated. But the Baron <hi>de Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf</hi>
having receiv'd new Inſtructions, which in all
probability were accompany'd with ſome weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Propoſals, came to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> tho' he was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſent for nor expected; and without the leaſt
Regard to the preſervation of his Life, he had the
Courage to brave Death in the midſt of a City
where ſhe ſeem'd to have fix'd the Seat of her
Empire; for the Plague made ſo terrible a Havock,
that there died above a Thouſand Perſons a Day.
At the ſame time it happen'd that Sir <hi>William Huſſy</hi>
was in a Gallery, and perceiving a Company of
Men in the Plain, he had the Curioſity to ſend one
of his Servants to inquire who they were. As ſoon
as he heard that 'twas the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, he
began to dread the Conſequences of that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
Journey; for he conſider'd that he wou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have expos'd himſelf to ſo imminent a Danger,
and even without being call'd, if there had not
been ſome hidden and extraordinary Deſign in
Agitation. 'Tis thought that the <hi>French</hi> King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inform'd of the great Progreſs that was made
in the Treaty, ſent Inſtructions to his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
impowering him to conclude a ſecret Alliance
with the <hi>Turks;</hi> and 'tis but too plain that theſe are
more than bare Conjectures; for the <hi>Viſier</hi> wou'd
never afterwards hear the leaſt Word of a Peace.
However, 'tis certain that Sir <hi>William Huſſey</hi>'s Vexation
at ſo unexpected a Diſappointment, contributed
not a little to his Death; for you muſt not give
credit to the Surmiſes of thoſe who pretend that
he was poyſon'd, ſince there was not the leaſt
Mark of Poyſon found in his Body, which was
open'd by his own Chirurgeon, in the preſence of
his Chaplain, Secretary, and the reſt of his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Servants. But tho' in all probability the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:51983:189"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> had no hand in this Gentleman's Death,
I dare not pronounce 'em guiltleſs of the Attempt
that was made upon Count <hi>Marſigli,</hi> who was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
near <hi>Belgrade,</hi> in his return from <hi>Vienna</hi> with
his <hi>Imperial Majeſty's</hi> Anſwer. His <hi>Chiaoux,</hi> and two
of his Servants, were kill'd upon the Spot, and
he was wounded in five places both with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres
and Piſtols: But before they had time to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch
him, the Prince of <hi>Moldavia</hi> came ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to his Aſſiſtance, tho' he cou'd not ſeize the
Murderers, becauſe they fled as ſoon as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
him. All theſe Circumſtances, and the Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of the Time, make me very inclinable to
believe that this Attempt was not made without
a particular Order. I took Occaſion Yeſterday to
diſcourſe concerning this Accident with the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul
de Hochepied,</hi> whoſe Vertue makes him ſo inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Suſpicion, that he cannot believe the
<hi>French</hi> wou'd be guilty of ſo Barbarous an Action;
and beſides, he is perſuaded that the Murderers
wou'd have ſeiz'd on the Count's Papers, if they
had been ſet on by the <hi>French.</hi> But in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that Circumſtance ought not to be alleg'd
as an Argument in their Vindication; for the ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of the Papers wou'd have plainly diſcover'd the
Authors of the Murder; and we may reaſonably
ſuppoſe, that tho' the <hi>French</hi> King takes no care
to conceal the boundleſneſs of his Ambition, he
wou'd be loath to be reckon'd an Abettor of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.
And beſides, he might well diſpenſe with
a Sight of the Emperor's Orders and Count <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigli</hi>'s
Inſtructions, ſince he entertains ſo many Spies
at the <hi>Port,</hi> who make it their Buſineſs to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the moſt ſecret Tranſactions, and had in all
probability acquainted him with every thing that
related to the Negotiation. Thus Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> has
had the Misfortune to ſee all his Hopes unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
blaſted; and we may reaſonably ſuppoſe that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:51983:190"/>
his Vexation is conſiderably heighten'd by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
of regaining his Ground: For Money is
the prevailing Argument at the <hi>Port,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Rule by which all Controverſies are deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
I cannot better repreſent the Genius of the
<hi>Aga's, Baſſa's,</hi> that <hi>Viſiers</hi> that compoſe this Court,
than by comparing 'em to a Company of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
who wou'd ſell the very State if they
cou'd, to the higheſt Bidder. And the ſame Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
may be univerſally apply'd to private Perſons;
for Int'reſt is the Idol to which they ſacrifice their
Quiet, Honour, Emperor, and even the Empire it
ſelf. This is the fatal Source of all thoſe terrible
Diſorders and Revolutions, of which we find ſo
many Inſtances in Hiſtory, that wou'd ſeem alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
incredible if almoſt every Day did not
furniſh us with freſh Examples of 'em.</p>
               <p>There is at preſent in this Place one of Count
<hi>Tekely</hi>'s Relations, who came lately from <hi>France;</hi>
and 'tis obſervable, that he was not at all ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at the News of the unſucceſsful Concluſion
of the Treaty, which makes us believe that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
ſo ſudden a Change, and was not ignorant
of the Cauſes of it. He lodges at the <hi>Conſul</hi>'s
Houſe, and is juſt ready to depart for <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
where 'tis ſaid he intends to lodge with <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Chateauneuf.</hi> I know not what Treatment he
expects from the Ambaſſador, but I'm apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he will not meet with a very Ceremonious
Reception: For when the Count himſelf paid a
Viſit to the Ambaſſador at <hi>Sophia,</hi> he receiv'd
him in his Bed, and pretended a Fit of Sickneſs,
to avoid the Ceremony of a formal Reception;
for there were ſome Reaſons that inclin'd him to
receive the Count as Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> as
there were others that oblig'd him to treat him
only as Count <hi>Tekely.</hi>

I had Occaſion this very Day to ſee the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
Proceſſion of a <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Renegado, who
came hither in a Ship belonging to <hi>Provence.</hi> Since
the <hi>Cadi's</hi> are oblig'd by the Chartel not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> that intends to abjure his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
till they have firſt acquainted the <hi>Conſul</hi> of his
Nation, who is to examine whether his Apoſtacy
be voluntary or conſtrain'd; the <hi>Cadi</hi> of the City
ſent to inform the <hi>French</hi> Conſul, that a <hi>Frank</hi> who
came under the Banner of <hi>France,</hi> was reſolv'd to
turn <hi>Muſulman,</hi> adding, that he might ſend his
Interpreters to examine the new Convert, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eive
his Declaration. The <hi>Conſul</hi> reply'd, that
he did not know the Man, nor was at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
with his Reſolution; but hearing that the
Cavalcade was to paſs by his Gate, he ſent Word
to the <hi>Cadi,</hi> that he wou'd take it as an Affront,
and order the Renegado to be ſeiz'd in the midſt
of his Triumph, and chaſtis'd with five hundred
<hi>Baſtonado's.</hi> Nevertheleſs he was ſo far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to execute his Menaces, that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
the whole Proceſſion to paſs under his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
without making the leaſt Attempt to diſturb
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>em. I ſhall take this Occaſion to give you a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ief Account of the Ceremonies that are us'd
when a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> intends to abjure his Religion.
Firſt they inſtruct him in the Principles of the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, and after a whole Month
ſpent in that Exerciſe, they gather a Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to buy a Sute of Clothes for him, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
amounts to fifty Crowns, but rarely exceeds
that Summ; and they commonly uſe Force when
People are not willing to contribute out of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Then the Renegado is carry'd before the
<hi>Cadi,</hi> in whoſe Preſence, and of two <hi>Effendi's,</hi>
and ſeveral other Perſons, he makes a public Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of his Faith with the following Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
Firſt an <hi>Iſman</hi> makes him perform the <hi>Goul,</hi>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:51983:192"/>
which is their moſt Solemn Ablution, and as he
begins to waſh himſelf, he pronounces theſe Words,
<hi>bis millah el azem ve ellem doullillah allah din is lam; In
the Name of the Great God, Glory be to God, the God of the
Muſulman Faith.</hi> Then the <hi>Iſman</hi> himſelf performs
the <hi>Goul,</hi> for they reckon themſelves polluted by
touching a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> after which they both put
on their Clothes, and come before the <hi>Cadi,</hi> who
ſays to the Renegado, <hi>Art thou willing to turn Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman.</hi>
After he has reply'd, <hi>Yes,</hi> the <hi>Iſman</hi> takes
the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in both his Hands, and holding it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the <hi>Chriſtian's</hi> Head, he ſays firſt <hi>bis millah, in
the Name of God;</hi> then addreſſing himſelf to the
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> he proceeds thus; <hi>Allah ecber, allah ecber,
allah ecber, eſchad in la illah, illallah, eſchad in Mebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
reſoul allah;</hi> which are almoſt the ſame Words
that are proclaim'd by the <hi>Muezins</hi> from the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narets</hi>
or Steeples of the <hi>Moſquees.</hi> The Renegado
replies, <hi>Illah, illallah Mehemet reſoul allah; There is no
other God, and Mahomet is his great Prophet;</hi> and as
ſoon as he has made a public Profeſſion of his
Faith by pronouncing theſe Words, they put a
<hi>Turbant</hi> on his Head, and make him kiſs the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi>
which he cou'd not do before without a
Crime. Then they embrace and careſs him, and
put all things in order for the Cavalcade, having
already provided two or three Hundred Men,
arm'd with Sabres, Carabines, and Piſtols, with ſix
Enſigns, two of which march before, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
four ſurround the Renegado, who is almoſt
entirely cover'd by 'em. He is mounted on a fine
Horſe, which the <hi>Cadi</hi> lends him, adorn'd with a
rich Veſt, which he wears all the reſt of the Day.
The Soldiers march four in a Rank, expreſſing their
Joy by loud Shouts and repeated Volleys of Shot,
the Renegado walking in the midſt of 'em with
the Enſigns. Thus they march in a Triumphant
manner thro' the City; but all this Pomp is but
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:51983:192"/>
an Introduction to the Scene of Pain, for as ſoon
as the Triumph is over, they proceed to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
which is thus perform'd: They draw
their Prepuce over the Glans or Nut of the
Yard, and preſſing it between two little Pieces of
Iron, they cut off with a Razor that part of the
Fore-Skin which reaches beyond the Glans, and
at that very Moment the Apoſtate muſt once
more repeat theſe Words, <hi>la illah illallah, Mehemet
reſoul allah.</hi> After this Ceremony, the new <hi>Muſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
muſt keep his Bed fifteen Days; for the Cure
of the Wound is rarely compleated ſooner; after
which he may chuſe what Imployment he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
that is, he may either Liſt himſelf in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
or enter into Service, tho' ſuch Perſons uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
become extremely miſerable. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more common than to ſee a Renegado
begging; and the <hi>Turks</hi> are ſo far from relieving
'em in their Diſtreſs, that the very Name of a
<hi>Renegado</hi> is ſufficient to make thoſe who bear it hated
and deſpis'd, not only by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
'em as baſe and cowardly Apoſtates, but even
by the <hi>Turks,</hi> who can never be perſuaded by all
their ſeeming Devotion that they are ſincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of the <hi>Muſulman</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, I have at laſt finiſh'd the Account
I promis'd to give you of this Country, which I
intend to leave very ſpeedily. I deſign to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
on a <hi>French</hi> Ship, which, with another Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of the ſame Nation, is bound for <hi>Venice,</hi> from
whence I reſolve to continue my Journey to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by Land, during which I hope my Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
will furniſh me with freſh Matter to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
you now and then with a Letter. I thought
to have paſs'd by <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> that I might
have ſatisfy'd my Curioſity with a View of
a very conſiderable Rarity, I mean the Bones of
a Giant that were found by ſome Work-men in
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:51983:193"/>
that Place, as they were digging the Foundations
of a Houſe for the <hi>Baſſa.</hi> All the Chirurgeons
of the Country have examin'd 'em, and have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in a formal Atteſtation in which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that theſe are the real Bones of a Man,
whoſe Height, according to their Computation,
amounted to above Twenty Feet; ſo that this
may be look'd upon as a Confirmation of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Giant at <hi>Spire</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> But I muſt
e'en content my ſelf with the Accounts I have
heard of that Curioſity, ſince our Captain intends
not to touch at that Place. I ſhall have the good
Fortune during our Voyage to have the Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one <hi>Signior Stephano,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Engineer, who
having ſpent Eight or Ten Years in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Service, is not willing to continue longer in ſo
dangerous a Poſt. He is an ingenious and witty
Perſon, and will doubtleſs prove a very agreeable
Companion: Beſides, he intends to carry his
Wife along with him, who is a little <hi>Greek,</hi> about
Eighteen Years old, and the prettyeſt Creature in
the World; ſo that I hope to paſs theſe Seas with
more Pleaſure than I did before.</p>
               <p>We have juſt now receiv'd the good News of
Count <hi>Marſigli's</hi> Recovery, with which I ſhall
conclude this Letter. I have already told you that
he was very dangerouſly wounded, and am glad I
can now inform you that the Vigour of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and the Care of his Phyſicians, have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
reſtor'd him to his Health. If the Malice of
his Enemies had ſucceeded according to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
the Emperor wou'd have had reaſon to
bewail the Loſs of a Man who is very well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Management of important Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
He was born at <hi>Piſa</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of a very conſiderable Family; but has not
yet been dignify'd with any other Character than
that of Secratary to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſy; tho'
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:51983:193"/>
he is really a ſecret Envoy from the Emperor,
and only aſſumes the other Title that he may with
more Security negotiate his Maſter's Affairs. But
if the Peace were concluded, he wou'd certainly
be rewarded with a higher Poſt.</p>

perhaps you'll be more inquiſitive to know how

ſhort Account of our Voyage.</p>
               <p>I left <hi>Smyrna</hi> ſome Days after the writing of
my laſt Letter, not without a very ſenſible Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
at my taking leave of Monſieur and Madam
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:51983:194"/>
                  <hi>de Hochepied,</hi> from whom I had receiv'd ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Favours and Civilities during my abode in
their Houſe.</p>
               <p>Our Voyage was diſturb'd by an almoſt perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Storm, which redoubling its Fury from Day to
Day, made us conclude more than once that we
ſhou'd certainly be bury'd in the Waves. Poor
<hi>Signior Stephano,</hi> whom I mention'd in my laſt,
fell ſick two Days after he embark'd, and being
unable to bear the tempeſtuous Working of the
Sea, dy'd Eight Days after. The Superſtition of
our Ship's Crew furniſh'd us with a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Scene; for they unanimouſly concluded him
to be a Sorcerer, becauſe they had ſeen him draw
ſome Mathematical Figures during the firſt two
Days of our Voyage, and were abſolutely confirm'd
in that Opinion by a curious Mechanical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he happen'd to try in their preſence, by
lifting up a very conſiderable Weight with one
Hand, which thoſe thick-skull'd Animals thought
impoſſible to be perform'd without the Aſſiſtance
of <hi>Magic.</hi> This ridiculous Conceit made ſo ſtrong
an Impreſſion upon upon 'em, that they ſlighted
all the Arguments and Aſſeverations I cou'd uſe to
undeceive 'em, and not only perſiſt in their Belief
of <hi>Signior Stephano's</hi> Skill in the Diabolioal Art, but
impute all the bad Weather to his Conjurations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Captain pretends to be of the ſame Opinion,
tho' I know not how to reconcile his Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
to the young Widow to the Sentiments he
ſeems to have of her Husband; For he obliges her
to perform her <hi>Quarantain</hi> on Board his Ship, and
reſolves to make her his Wife.</p>
               <p>The Storm forc'd us to ſtand in to a Canal
between two little Iſlands, call'd <hi>Millo</hi> and <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiere.</hi>
The firſt is Forty Miles in Compaſs, and
the whole Country is Mountainous, except a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and fertil Plain, ſix or ſeven Miles long, in
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:51983:194"/>
the midſt of which ſtands the City of <hi>Millo,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
about Twenty narrow Streets. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
are generally <hi>Greeks;</hi> but there are alſo
3 or 400 Souls of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, who have
their Biſhop and Cathedral. The <hi>Venetians</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a <hi>Podeſtat</hi> in the Iſland to gather the Tribute;
but there is no Garriſon kept in it, tho' it receives
frequent Viſits from the <hi>Turks;</hi> ſo that the firſt
<hi>Corſair</hi> who comes with a numerous Company, is
King of the Iſland ſo long as he pleaſes to reſide
it it. Yet the Pyrates never commit any diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in this place, by reaſon of the Aſſiſtance they
receive from the Merchants that live here, who
furniſh 'em with Commodities to be paid out of
the next Prize that falls into their Hands. There
is a <hi>French</hi> Ordinary in the Town, where one may
find pretty good Entertainment: And I remember
I ſaw a Man there of ſo free and open a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
that I ſhou'd have thought him a Rarity
in that Country, if I had not been told that all
theſe Iſlanders are generally of that Humour. He
took occaſion to Diſcourſe of a Maid who was
his Wife's Daughter, and declar'd that he wou'd
willingly diſpoſe of her to a Husband. One who
was preſent lik'd the Propoſal, and told him that
he wou'd eaſe him of the Burden if he pleas'd to
beſtow her upon him. <hi>With all my Heart,</hi> reply'd
the Father: <hi>Then,</hi> ſaid the other, <hi>I deſire to know
what you are willing to give with her. What d'ye

                     </gap>ean,</hi> reply'd the old Gentleman, <hi>Give with her,

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>oth' a; Why, I wont give her ſelf for nothing. You
moſt take me for a ſilly Coxcomb indeed, if you think I'll
give you a pretty lively Girl, and hire you to take her?
No, I beg your pardon, 'tis you muſt give the Money:
And if I can find none that will take my Daughter on theſe
Terms, I'll e'en keep her, and make uſe of her my
ſelf.</hi>

The Women are ſo accuſtom'd to the Converſe
of the Pyrates, that they are generally very liberal
of their Favours, but not quite ſo frank as their
Neighbours of <hi>Argentiere,</hi> which is another little
Iſland, about Twenty Miles in Compaſs, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only a little Town and a Village, both inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by about Five hundred Women; for there is
not a Man in the Iſland, except Seven or Eight
<hi>Papa's,</hi> who perform <hi>Divine Service.</hi> Theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have no Trade to maintain 'em, but live
purely on the Work of Nature; ſo that all the
Merchants and Corſairs, who come to the Iſland,
chuſe a Female-Companion, either fair or brown,
according to every Man's particular Fancy. The
Children are left to the Diſpoſal of the Women;
the Girls grow up and work to maintain their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but aſſoon as the Boys are Twelve Years
old, they are put on Board the firſt Veſſel that
touches at the Iſland.</p>
               <p>From thence we continu'd our Voyage to <hi>Zant,</hi>
a conſiderable Iſland belonging to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> It
contains a hundred Miles in Compaſs, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
great Store of delicious Wines, both <hi>Muſcadin</hi>
and other Sorts. But ſince <hi>Italy</hi> is ſufficiently
ſtock'd with theſe Commodities, the Inhabitants
of this Iſland dry moſt of their Grapes, and
ſend 'em to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> Both the City
and Harbour are commanded by a very fine Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
where the Proveditore, who is always cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
out of the Principal Nobility, reſides. The
Inhabitants are Rich, and there are ſeveral Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
among 'em. This is the firſt place as you
come from the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> where you meet with
People cloath'd after the manner of the <hi>Franks;</hi>
yet many of 'em wear a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſt above their
other Cloaths. The <hi>Venetians</hi> have built ſeveral
Churches for the Uſe of thoſe who profeſs the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith; and do what they can to eſtabliſh
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:51983:195"/>
that Religion, in Oppoſition to that of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
which is the Religion of the Natives. The City
is long and narrow; which is all the Account I
can give you of it, for thoſe who come from the
<hi>Levant</hi> are not ſuffer'd to go a-ſhore till they
have perform'd their <hi>Quarantain.</hi> The Prince of
<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> who ſerves in the Army of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
paſs'd the whole laſt Winter in this place;
and gain'd the Love of the Inhabitants to ſuch a
Degree, that there is not a Man of 'em who
wou'd not ſacrifice himſelf for his Sake. I heard
a Story of that Prince, which I'm confident will
give you ſome Diverſion. He fell in Love with
a very Beautiful Courtezan, who treated him with
an extraordinary Coyneſs; either becauſe ſhe had
a particular Averſion to him, or (which is the
more probable Reaſon of the two) becauſe ſhe
thought he was very deeply engag'd, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to make him pay dear for a Favour which
he deſir'd with ſo much Ardour. But whatever
was the true Cauſe of her Rigour, the Prince
perſiſted in his unſucceſsful Courtſhip; but his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
being at laſt exhauſted, he reſolv'd upon a
Stratagem to ſatisfie at once both his Love and
Revenge: There are in <hi>Zant</hi> certain Porters call'd
<hi>Ceſtariols,</hi> whoſe Buſineſs is to carry home the
Proviſions that are bought by the Citizens at the
Market. The irritated Prince procur'd a <hi>Ceſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riol's</hi>
Habit, which diſguis'd him ſo well that he had
no Reaſon to fear a Diſcovery. In that Dreſs
he went to the Courtezan's Waiting-Maid, and
told her, that he was ſo paſſionately in Love with
her Miſtreſs, that he ſhou'd certainly loſe his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
if ſhe wou'd not ſuffer her ſelf to be touch'd
with a compaſſionate Senſe of his Sufferings. And
to engage the Maid to employ her Intereſt in his
Favour, he preſented her with Ten <hi>Sequins,</hi> which
amount to about Five and twenty Crowns; and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:51983:196"/>
aſſur'd her that if by her Aſſiſtance he cou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
one Night's Pleaſure, he wou'd give her as
many <hi>Sequins</hi> more, and wou'd beſides reward the
<hi>Signora</hi> ſo liberally, that ſhe ſhou'd never have
Reaſon to repent her Condeſcenſion to him. The
Maid was extremely ſurpriz'd at the <hi>Ceſtariol</hi>'s Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
however ſhe forgot not to deliver his Meſſage to
her Miſtreſs, who ſeem'd to receive it very cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for ſhe thought ſuch an Action wou'd make
her be look'd upon as a common Proſtitute. But
the Maid, who perhaps was not ſo ſcrupulous,
and had ſo conſiderable an Intereſt in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of this Affair, us'd all the Arguments ſhe
cou'd invent, to perſwade her Miſtreſs to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
and concluded her Exhortations with this
wiſe and prevailing Remark, That a <hi>Ceſtariol</hi> with
a full Purſe wou'd prove a better Cuſtomer than
a <hi>Proveditore</hi> with an empty one; adding, that the
Miſtreſs might expect a very Noble Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from one that had been ſo liberal to the
Maid. Theſe ſage Remonſtrances had ſo good an
Effect, that the <hi>Ceſtariol</hi> was introduc'd in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
to the <hi>Signora</hi>'s Chamber, where he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtorm'd the Place that had ſo long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
his Attacks. 'Twou'd be as needleſs to give
you a more particular Account of his Night's
Work, as it wou'd be to repreſent the Confuſion
and Aſtoniſment that ſeiz'd the Fair One in the
Morning, when ſhe ſaw her Chamber full of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
that came to dreſs her Bed-fellow, and found
that the pretended <hi>Ceſtariol</hi> was transform'd into the
Prince of <hi>Brunſwick.</hi> However ſhe endeavour'd to
ſet the beſt Face ſhe cou'd on ſo croſs an Adventure,
and comforted her ſelf with the Expectation of a
magnificent Reward. But ſhe cou'd no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the Diſcompoſure of her Mind, when inſtead
of a Handful of <hi>Sequins</hi> the Prince preſented her
with <hi>Three-pence,</hi> adding, That <hi>if ſhe had entertain'd
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:51983:196"/>
him as a Prince, he wou'd have paid her as a Prince;
but ſince ſhe had only treated him as a Porter, ſhe muſt
content her ſelf with Porter's Wages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Departing from <hi>Zant,</hi> we left <hi>Corfou</hi> on our Left-hand,
and enter'd the Gulf, at the Mouth of which
we loſt our Long-Boat in a Storm. The Fury of
the Tempeſt being ſomewhat abated, we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
our Courſe with a Side-Wind, and about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
perceiv'd, by the Light of the Moon, a Sail,
which paſs'd very near our Ship without haling us. But
ſhe had ſcarce left us half a Mile when ſhe tack'd
about, and bore down upon us with full Sails; and
ſince ſhe was lighter than our Veſſel, ſhe quickly
came up with us. Our Captain concluding that
ſhe deſign'd to attack us, commanded every Man
to his Poſt, and put all things in a Readineſs for
an Engagement, ſwearing that he wou'd fire at her,
if ſhe came nearer. Some of the Seamen endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to perſwade him that a Corſair wou'd hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
venture to cruize in the Gulf; and that if the
Veſſel we fear'd had had ſuch a Deſign, ſhe wou'd
have either fir'd at us, or boarded us as ſhe paſs'd
by. But he continu'd fix'd in his Reſolution, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
'em that he plac'd more Confidence in his
Guns than in their Arguments; and that if the
Captain did not know his own Buſineſs, he wou'd
endeavour to inſtruct him. And indeed he kept
his Word, for aſſoon as cou'd have a full Aim
to point his Guns at her Side, he gave her a
Broad-ſide, and tacking about, rak'd her fore and
aft: but it ſeems ſhe was better acquainted with
the Rules of Good-breeding than we expected, for
ſhe quickly return'd our Compliment with the ſame
Ceremonies, and then bore away. Our Cabbin
was pierc'd with a Shot, which was all the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
we receiv'd, except the breaking of a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
of excellent Wine, which I had provided
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:51983:197"/>
at <hi>Zant</hi> for my own Uſe, during the <hi>Quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two Days after we made the Height of <hi>Ragu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi>
which is a conſiderable City ſeated on the
Sea-ſide; Toward the Sea 'tis defended by a ſtrong
Cittadel, and on the other Side by a high and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible
Mountain. Its Figure is almoſt round,
and its Circuit exceeds not two Miles. The Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are generally pretty well built; but there are
none that deſerve a particular Obſervation. The
Government is <hi>Ariſtocratical,</hi> not much different
from that of <hi>Venice,</hi> only its Weakneſs makes it
act more cautiouſly for the Preſervation of its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
The Senate is compos'd of Gentlemen and
a <hi>Doge:</hi> but this Dignity inſtead of continuing for
Life, as at <hi>Venice,</hi> laſts but a Month, after which a
New <hi>Doge</hi> is Elected with ſo little Intriguing, that
oftentimes a Gentleman walking in the Public
Place, is ſurpriz'd with the News of his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
During the time of his Government he is
ſerv'd and entertain'd at the Public Charge, after
which he returns home to dreſs his Garden. Since
the Government of the Caſtle is a more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Office, and the Ill-management of it might prove
more fatal to the Republic, it laſts not ſo long as
the former: for a New Governour is choſen every
Night, and oblig'd to remain in the Caſtle till his
Succeſſour come to relieve him. So that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
reckon this Commiſſion rather a Trouble than
an Honour; and wou'd be as glad to be exempted
from it, as a Captain wou'd be pleas'd to be excus'd
from mounting the Guard. The Garriſon conſiſts of
Two hundred Men, and beſides the Burgers are
oblig'd to keep Guard with 'em. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are exempted from that Trouble, but they
muſt not lie one Night out of the City without
a ſpecial Permiſſion. S. <hi>Blaiſe</hi> is the Patron of
<hi>Raguſa,</hi> as S. <hi>Mark</hi> is of <hi>Venice:</hi> and is painted on
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:51983:197"/>
their Banners and Enſigns, and wherever 'tis the
Cuſtom to place the Arms of the Republic. A
Mile from the Town towards the Mouth of the
Gulf, ſtands the ancient City of <hi>Raguſa,</hi> which at
preſent is call'd <hi>Raguſa Vecchio.</hi> 'Tis inhabited by
ſome poor People, and ſeems rather to be a Village
than a City. The whole Territory of <hi>Raguſa</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
not Thirty Miles round the City, and at
Sea they are only poſſeſs'd of the Iſland of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta.</hi>
This little Republic makes a great Noiſe
with a certain imaginary Liberty, of which the
<hi>Raguſans</hi> are extremely fond, tho' really they are
not Maſters of themſelves; for they are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and muſt do what
whatever they pleaſe. The <hi>Turk</hi> and Emperour
content themſelves with a moderate Tribute, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
medling with the Affairs of the Republic; but
if the Payment be delay'd, the <hi>Raguſans</hi> run the
the Hazard of paying dear for their Neglect. And
beſides they are on ſeveral Occaſions inſulted over
by the <hi>French</hi> King, and other <hi>European</hi> Princes;
and muſt tamely ſuffer the greateſt Abuſes, without
daring to repine at the Hand which oppreſſes 'em.
I have all along obſerv'd, during the whole Courſe
of my Travels, that one may find every-where
freſh Inſtances of the Folly and Weakneſs of
human Nature: and the very Sight of this Place is
ſufficient to put a Man in mind of that Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For 'tis certain that the Liberty or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency
of the <hi>Raguſans,</hi> as well as of ſeveral
other States, is their greateſt Misfortune; and
that they wou'd be infinitely more happy under
the Dominion of ſome potent Maſter, that cou'd
protect 'em from all the Injuries and Affronts
which they are daily oblig'd to ſuffer without the
leaſt Hope of Redreſs. And I'm confident, if you
conſider, without Prejudice, the Advantages on
both ſides, you will conclude with me, That, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:51983:198"/>
their boaſted Liberty, a Wiſe Man
wou'd rather chuſe to be a Subject of <hi>Venice,</hi>
than to be a Free Citizen of <hi>Raguſa.</hi> But to return to
my Voyage.</p>
               <p>The Wind coming fair, we left <hi>Raguſa,</hi> and the
next Morning we came to an Anchor in the
Harbour of the little City <hi>Parenzo</hi> in <hi>Iſtria,</hi> where
we took a Pilot. For the Republick keeps always
a ſufficient Number of Pilots in this place, for
the Conveniency of Ships that are bound for
<hi>Venice;</hi> which are oblig'd to have Recourſe to
their Aſſiſtance, becauſe from thence to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunes</hi>
the Paſſage is extremely hazardous, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Banks of Sand that are form'd by the
Rivers <hi>Po</hi> and <hi>Brent</hi> at their Falling into the Sea.
Theſe Banks are ſo dangerous, and ſubject to ſo
frequent Alterations, that the moſt skilful Pilots,
who are acquainted with every Rock and Shoal in
the Paſſage, are forc'd to ſteer perpetually with
a Line in their Hand, for fear of ſome fatal
Blunder, which wou'd certainly be puniſh'd with
Death. The Difficulty of the Paſſage is a very
conſiderable Diſadvantage and Obſtruction to Trade;
but it may be reckon'd the main Security of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
which cannot be attack'd on that Side. For
tho' a Fleet of Ships ſhou'd be conducted to <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moca</hi>
by <hi>Venetian</hi> Pilots, 'twou'd be impoſſible for
'em to ride there, by reaſon of the ſtormy Guſts
that happen ſo frequently in that place.</p>
               <p>After the charming View of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> from
the Sea of <hi>Marmora,</hi> I never beheld a finer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
than that of <hi>Venice.</hi> At the Diſtance of
Thirty Miles you begin to perceive the Spires of
the Churches, and the Proſpect is ſtill enlarg'd
the nearer you approach; which gives the raviſh'd
Spectatour the Idea of a Great City ſpringing out
of the Water. Nor can you poſſibly free your
ſelf from this pleaſant Deluſion of the Fancy till
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:51983:198"/>
you have enter'd the Town; for all the outer
Houſes of the City are founded on Piles in the
midſt of the Water. The Port of <hi>Venice</hi> is a large
Plain cover'd with Water, in which there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Iſlands or Riſing-Grounds, level with the
Water, on the biggeſt of which <hi>Venice</hi> is built.
moſt of the other Iſlands are alſo cover'd with
Buildings, and make particular Towns; the moſt
conſiderable of which is call'd <hi>Judeca,</hi> or the <hi>Jews</hi>
Quarter. 'Tis ſaid to contain Forty thouſand
Souls; the Houſes are fair, and there are large
Gardens, whither the Inhabitants go to divert
themſelves during the Summer, and are accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
with all ſorts of Proviſions, cool Liquors,
and oftentimes with very agreeable Company.</p>
               <p>The curious Traveller ought alſo to take a View
of the Iſland of <hi>Mouran,</hi> where the fine Looking-Glaſſes
are made that are ſo famous over all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
beſides ſeveral other Curious Works in Glaſs
and Cryſtal.</p>
               <p>Theſe Iſlands are call'd <hi>Lacunes</hi> or <hi>Lagunes,</hi> both
ſuch as are, and ſuch as are not, inhabited. Two
of 'em are ſet apart for the uſe of thoſe who come
from the <hi>Levant,</hi> where they are oblig'd to perform
their <hi>Quarantain</hi> in certain large Hoſpitals, call'd
<hi>Lazaretti.</hi> The firſt, call'd <hi>Lazaretto Vecchio,</hi> is but
a Mile diſtant from <hi>Venice;</hi> but the other, where
we are confin'd, is five Miles from the City. 'Tis
one continu'd Building, conſiſting of two Stories,
300 Paces long, and divided by High Walls into
ſix Apartments, each of which has a particular
Gate that leads into a Square Court, where there
is a Well, but the Water is ſo bad, that we never
uſe any but what is brought from <hi>Venice.</hi> Every
Apartment contains Twenty Chambers, Ten above,
and as many below, ſeparated like Cells, with a
Chimney in each. Thoſe who perform their <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantain</hi>
are conſtantly attended by a Guardian or
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:51983:199"/>
Keeper, ſent for that purpoſe by the <hi>Tribunal of
Health.</hi> And we have the Misfortune to be plagu'd
with one who mortifies us extremely: For he not
only denies us the Liberty of converſing familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with thoſe who come to ſee us, but will not
ſuffer us to approach within Ten Paces of 'em;
and beſides, they are oblig'd to take the Wind of
us. No Perſon whatſoever, nor even the <hi>Doge</hi>
himſelf, is exempted from theſe troubleſome Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
which are appointed for the Publick Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and for the Preſervation of the City from
contagious Diſtempers. But tho' we are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to entertain thoſe who are without the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaretto,</hi>
there are ſome things which they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to receive from us, ſuch as Bread, Wine,
Veſſels, Tobacco, Money, Wood, and generally
every thing that does not conſiſt of Threads. And
yet, which in my Opinion is the moſt intolerable
piece of Nicety in the World, they will not ſuffer a
Letter to come out of our Hands till it be open'd
and ſmoak'd: And I was even forc'd to open
<hi>Monſieur de Hochepied's</hi> Letters to his Friends in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
ſo that I ſhall be oblig'd to deliver 'em un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeal'd
to the Perſons to whom they are directed.
When a Man comes to lodge in one of theſe
Rooms, he finds nothing but Four bare Walls, and
muſt therefore buy an entire Set of neceſſary Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture:
But as for Proviſions, there are <hi>Barcarioli,</hi>
who bring whatever you call for, allowing 'em a
third part of the Price for their Pains. Every
Man muſt be his own Cook, a Diſadvantage
which is more eaſily ſupported here than any where
elſe; for our Time is ſo great a Burthen to us,
that we are glad of any Occupation; and that
which in another Place would be reckon'd a Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is eſteem'd a Recreation here. The <hi>Lazaretto</hi>
is govern'd by a Prior, appointed by the <hi>Tribunal of
Health.</hi> His Revenue amounts to a Thouſand <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats,</hi>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:51983:199"/>
worth about 3 <hi>s.</hi> 9 <hi>d.</hi> a-piece. He is entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Keys of the ſix Apartments, which
are kept ſhut from Sun-ſetting till Eight a-Clock
in the Morning. The Guardians are under his
Command, and are oblig'd to give him an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of every thing. There are 120 of 'em in
Office, who are employ'd by Turns, according to
the Number of Ships that arrive in the Port.
Their Salary, which amounts to half a <hi>Ducat</hi> a-Day,
beſides their Entertainment, is not paid by
the Republic, but by a Tax laid upon the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Goods that are committed to their Care.
In the ſame <hi>Lagune</hi> there is a large Encloſure where
the Goods are laid in a ſort of Stalls or Market-Houſes,
ſupported by Pillars without Walls, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
on all Sides. And there are <hi>Faquini</hi> or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
appointed to remove 'em from time to time,
and to take care that nothing be loſt or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mag'd.</p>
               <p>You have doubtleſs heard of the great Number of
Spies that are kept by the Senate to give notice
of every thing that is ſaid or done againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Theſe Informers are a horrible Plague
to thoſe who are under the Dominion of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
as well natural <hi>Venetians</hi> as <hi>Greeks.</hi> For
the leaſt Offence expoſes a Man to the Severity
of the Inquiſition of the State, which is at leaſt
as terrible a Tribunal as that of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nor is it
poſſible for a Man to know when he ſhou'd be
upon his Guard; for thoſe who profeſs the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Friendſhip and Fidelity, are oftentimes mere In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers.
And beſides, there are Spies of all Ranks
and Orders; Servants, Merchants, Officers, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
and Nobles, who diſguiſe themſelves with
ſo much Care and Dexterity, that 'tis impoſſible
to penetrate into their hidden Deſigns. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public
is ſo cautious in preventing Diſcoveries of
this Nature, that thoſe who undertake ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:51983:200"/>
are enjoyn'd to conceal it even from their
Wives and Children, under pain of ſuffering the
moſt rigorous Penalties. And the Scandal and
Odium that attends their Profeſſion is alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to oblige 'em to Secreſie, tho' they were
not kept in awe by the Fear of Puniſhment. This
breeds an univerſal Diffidence and Shieneſs among
all ſorts of People, and makes 'em extremely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in diſcovering their Sentiments to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
eſpecially in the preſence of certain Perſons
who are more particularly ſuſpected, ſuch as <hi>Monks,</hi>
and the <hi>Guardians of Health</hi> in the <hi>Lazaretti,</hi> who
are generally reckon'd to be the Inquiſitor's Spies,
and I believe not without reaſon, as you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by the Relation of an Accident that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to my ſelf.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as a Veſſel enters the Port, the <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of Health</hi> ſends immediately a Guardian with a
<hi>Phanti</hi> on board to conduct the Paſſengers to the
<hi>Lazaretto,</hi> that no time may be loſt; for the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantain</hi>
is not reputed to begin till the Day after
they come a-ſhore. But tho' this Cuſtom is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
exactly obſerv'd on all Occaſions, there aroſe
a Diſpute in our Ship about ſome Matters relating
to Trade, that retarded our Landing Four Days,
which conſequently were not reckon'd in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Days of our <hi>Quarantain.</hi> This Delay occaſion'd
a general Diſcontent among us, and we were the
more ſenſibly afflicted, becauſe we neither foreſaw
nor knew how to remedy our Misfortunes. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> whom he had take
on board at <hi>Zant,</hi> conceal'd their Reſentments
with all poſſible Care. But I who was not ſo well
acquainted with the Cuſtoms of the Place, and
perhaps am naturally of too free a Humour, cou'd
not forbear complaining of this Injuſtice that was
done us, and was even ſo far tranſported, that I
expreſs'd my Impatience and Indignation in very
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:51983:200"/>
bold and emphatic Terms. In the mean time I
was extremely ſurpriz'd to perceive an univerſal Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
among thoſe who heard me, and was ſo vex'd
to find that none of 'em wou'd join with me, that
at laſt I held my Peace. An Hour after, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
took me aſide, and told me that I was ruin'd:
I entreated him to let me know the reaſon that
made him give me ſo unwelcom an Admonition:
<hi>Becauſe,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>you have ſpoken diſadvantageouſly
of the Government before a Guardian, who is certainly
an Informer;</hi> adding, that he wou'd not have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſo freely for a Hundred thouſand Crowns.
Then he related five or ſix Tragical Stories of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that had loſt their Lives for leſs provoking
Crimes, and added ſo many Arguments to convince
me of my Danger, that I began to be afraid in
good earneſt, and to complain of his Unkindneſs
in not giving me more timely warning. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
that he ne'er thought of it, and that he
cou'd not imagine me to be ignorant of a thing
that was ſo univerſally known. <hi>The only way I
can ſuggeſt to you,</hi> added he, <hi>to prevent your Ruine,
is to be ſilent for the future, and to bribe the Guardian
with a Preſent, which perhaps will ſtop his Mouth.</hi> In
purſuance of his Advice, I gave the Guardian two
<hi>Sequins,</hi> and endeavour'd to oblige him by all
the Marks of Friendſhip and Kindneſs during the
two days we remain'd on Board after that Accident.
Yet after all, he inform'd againſt me, at leaſt I had
reaſon to ſuſpect him; for the Prior told me t'other
Day, that the Inquiſitor had ſpoken concerning
me, and had ſignify'd to him, that there was a
very turbulent and impatient <hi>Frenchman</hi> in his <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaretto.</hi>
This Reprimand abated, inſtead of encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
my Fears, for the Inquiſitor wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d not have
ſpoken to the Prior, if he had intended to puniſh
my Boldneſs. However, this Accident ſhall teach
me Circumſpection for the future; and may ſerve
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:51983:201"/>
for a Warning to ſuch of your Friends whoſe
Curioſity may incite 'em to viſit this Place in
their Travels: For Strangers are in a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
manner expos'd to the Severities of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tribunal; and I'm perſuaded that ſuch indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet
Expreſſions have oftentimes prov'd fatal to
Travellers.</p>

               <p>AT laſt I have obtain'd my Liberty, and have
bidden a joyful <hi>Farewel</hi> to that naſty <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto,</hi>
where I was forc'd to do ſo tedious a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for my Sins. And ſince I have reaſon to
believe that all my Tranſgreſſions are blotted out
by ſo ſevere a Mortification, I'm e'en reſolv'd to
venture upon a New Score: There is not a Town
in the World ſo full of Invitations as this: I ſee
every Day ſuch charming and enflaming Objects
at the <hi>Opera, Ridotti,</hi> and whither ſo ever I go,
that a leſs ſenſible Heart than mine cou'd not long
reſiſt the powerful Temptation. There is a greater
Number of lovely Women here than in any other
Place of <hi>Europe,</hi> and their Charms are more allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
Three Divinities ſeem to contend which of
'em ſhou'd contribute moſt to the Embelliſhment
of a City where they have fix'd the Seats of their
ſeveral Empires. <hi>Venus</hi> makes it the Scene of all
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:51983:201"/>
the ſoft Delights of Beauty and Love; <hi>Apollo</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays
the raviſhing Variety of his belov'd Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and <hi>Momus</hi> charms both the Eye and Ear
with ſplendid Masks and ingenious and witty Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.
<hi>Venice</hi> is a Cluſter of inchanted Iſlands,
where Joy and Pleaſure have eſtabliſhd their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Sway, without the leaſt Diſturbance from tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary
or gloomy Paſſions. 'Tis all over charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
every Object inſpires Love, and fills the Mind
with a reſiſtleſs and ſurprizing Delight. But I muſt
not forget that I write to one who is too inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to be ſatisfy'd with general Hints; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall proceed to give you a particular Account
of this admirable City. I intended to have begun
my Letter with the Story of a pleaſant Accident
that happen'd to one of my Friends at our coming
out of the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> where he perform'd his <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantain</hi>
with me; but tho' I am not often guilty
of a ſcrupulous Niceneſs in obſerving the Rules of
an exact Method, I'm loath on this Occaſion to
invert the Order I intend to follow in the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the City; and therefore I ſhall defer the
Relation of my Friend's Adventure, till I come to
ſpeak of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Curtezans.</p>
               <p>The Obſervation I made concerning <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
and <hi>Cairo,</hi> may with equal Juſtice be apply'd
to <hi>Venice,</hi> and in the general to all great and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Cities; that there are very different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning their Extent, and the Number of
their Inhabitants. Nor is this Controverſie ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
decided as ſome Perſons imagine: For when
did ever a Traveller undertake to count the Streets
of a great City? Or what more can the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive
Stranger do than to meaſure the Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of a Publick Place, or of a Temple? Judge then
whether any one can make a certain Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Number of the Houſes, or of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that inhabit 'em. And I may venture to
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:51983:202"/>
add, that none but a Soveraign is able to manage
ſuch a Deſign; and that the exacteſt Calculations
that can be made by Private Perſons, are mere
uncertain Conjectures, that can never be true but
by a lucky Hit, on which there can be no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
The ſame may be ſaid of the Bigneſs of a
City, which ought rather to be computed from the
Figure, than from the Extent of its Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
And 'tis ſo difficult a Task to find and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
the true Figure of a Town, that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
themſelves are ignorant of it. How many
different Judgments are made of the comparative
Bigneſs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Paris?</hi> Yet every Man
thinks his own Opinion true; and the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
may be apply'd to all other large Cities.
I will not undertake then to determine ſo intricate
a Controverſie, but ſhall content my ſelf with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
you, that <hi>Venice,</hi> as to its Extent, may,
in my Opinion, be compar'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the
Streets are Narrow, the Ground extremely well
Husbanded, and the Houſes full of People to the
very Top. It has neither Gates, Walls, nor Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel,
and yet cannot be juſtly ſaid to be Weak.
'Tis eſteem'd impregnable by many Authors, and
that Opinion is ſo generally receiv'd, that you
ſhall hardly hear any Man give an Account of
<hi>Venice</hi> without that Encomium at the End of it.
The <hi>Venetians</hi> themſelves tell the Story ſo often,
that at laſt they imagine it to be a certain Truth,
and wou'd fain perſuade others to be of the ſame
Opinion. But tho' they alledge ſome Reaſons in
Confirmation of that Aſſertion, they muſt not
expect to make us ſwallow 'em by an implicit
Faith. At leaſt I can aſſure you, their Arguments
have made no great Impreſſion upon me; for I
cou'd never boaſt ſo ſtrong a Faith as to give
Credit to an obvious Abſurdity. However, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
has taught me ſo much Wiſdom, that I
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:51983:202"/>
ſhall hardly venture to own my Opinion in this
Caſe during my abode here. Let 'em magnifie
their City beyond all the Forts in the World,
and defie the Ambition of the moſt potent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns
in <hi>Europe;</hi> their Arrogance ſhall never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
one indiſcreet Word from me ſo long as I
remain within the reach of the Inquiſition: But as
ſoon as I can ſet my Foot beyond the Limits of
their Dominions, I ſhall e'en make bold to talk
as freely to any Man of the boaſted Strength of
their City, as I now intend to write to you.</p>
               <p>You may remember I acknowledg'd that <hi>Venice</hi>
is impregnable on the Side next the Sea, and gave
you an Account of the Reaſons which inclin'd me
to be of that Opinion. But I'm fully perſuaded
that 'tis not impoſſible to attack it with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
on the other ſide, unleſs it be defended by an
Army ſtrong enough to baffle all the Attempts of
the Beſiegers, in which Caſe, I muſt confeſs, it
may be ſaid to be impregnable; but upon the ſame
Suppoſition any Town in the World may plead a
Right to that Title: Whereas a Place that may
be properly call'd impregnable, muſt be ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to endure a Siege two or three Years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Relief; that is, it muſt be able to reſiſt any
Enemy but Famine, which is a neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of a long and cloſe Siege. I confeſs there
are very few ſuch Places in the World; yet I
have ſeen one, I mean <hi>Malta,</hi> and 'tis probable
there are ſome other Forts which merit the ſame
Character. As for thoſe Places that may be ſubdu'd
by Force, tho' not without extreme Difficulty, they
may and ought to be call'd <hi>Strong,</hi> but cannot juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be ſaid to be <hi>Impregnable.</hi> Yet the laſt of theſe
Epithets is very frequently abus'd and miſapply'd;
for 'tis as uſual to honour a Place with that Title,
as 'tis rare to find one that deſerves it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:51983:203"/>
If this be the true meaning of the controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Term, and if none but ſuch Places as theſe
can be properly ſaid to be impregnable, as 'tis plain
they cannot; I know no reaſon that ſhou'd hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me from excluding <hi>Venice</hi> out of that Number.
It ſeems to be no very difficult Undertaking to
ſeize on the <hi>Lido</hi> and <hi>Malamoca,</hi> two inhabited
Iſlands, and by ſecuring thoſe Poſts, to intercept
the Communication of the City with the Sea,
and to cut off all Relief that might be expected
that way. An Army might alſo ſoon take Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of ſeveral little uninhabited <hi>Lagunes</hi> about
<hi>Venice,</hi> from whence the City might be eaſily bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
and bombarded; and God knows what Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
the Bombs wou'd make in ſo compact a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as this. And beſides, the Multitude of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
wou'd quickly expoſe 'em to all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
that are uſually caus'd by Famine. I
confeſs the Arſenal is ſo well furniſh'd that all the
Burghers might be arm'd in Four and twenty
Hours; but what uſe cou'd they make of their
Arms in a Town which in caſe of a Siege wou'd
inſtantly be turn'd to a Priſon: For there is no
cover'd Way thro' which they cou'd ſally out upon
their Enemies; and tho' they cou'd contrive one, the
Citizens of <hi>Venice</hi> wou'd make but a very feeble
reſiſtance. I have ſo mean an Opinion of their
Military accompliſhments, that I dare boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that Ten thouſand well-diſcipln'd Soldiers
wou'd do more execution than a Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of 'em. Was not <hi>Paris</hi> ſtarv'd by 30000 Men,
tho' at the ſame time it was defended by 150000
Citizens, who might have ſally'd out when they
pleas'd? What then wou'd become of <hi>Venice</hi> in
ſuch a Caſe, where the beſieg'd muſt be coop'd up
in their Houſes, and cou'd never make a Sally to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
or annoy their Enemies? Perhaps I ſhall be
laugh'd at for maintaining that this wonderful
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:51983:203"/>
Place that diſpiſes and defies the moſt potent and
triumphant Enemies, might be enter'd and ſet on
Fire by a ſufficient Number of Men with Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in their Hands, without the Trouble or
Charge of Bombardment. But I wou'd willingly
be inform'd what cou'd hinder 100000 Men from
making and executing ſuch an Attempt. There
are no Walls to ſtop or retard their Progreſs; the
City is open in Fourſcore ſeveral Places, all the
Houſes that ſurround it are pierc'd with Doors
and Shops, and many of 'em are built of Wood.
I confeſs ſuch an Expedition wou'd require a vaſt
Number of Boats; but when I ſpeak of 100000
Men, I do not mean that they ſhou'd all be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in the Attempt: The Fifth part of 'em
wou'd ſerve to carry on the Attack; and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
might find a ſufficient Number of Boats in
the adjacent Harbours, without giving themſelves
the trouble of making new ones.</p>
               <p>My Opinion in this Caſe is ſo ſingular, and ſo
directly oppoſite to the Notions that are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by the generality of Mankind, that you will
doubtleſs ſcruple to give Credit to my ſingle Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,
eſpecially ſince the Arguments I bring to
confirm it depend on certain Circumſtances with
which you never had occaſion to be acquainted.
And you will be apt to tell me, that the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
wou'd certainly have taken care to fortifie
their Capital City, if its Natural Strength were
not incapable of any Artificial Improvements. In
anſwer to the firſt part of this Difficulty, I ſhall
only repeat what I have already told you, that
'twas never my Cuſtom to make my Judgment
a Slave to Authority, or to regulate my own, by
the Opinions of others. I'm perſuaded that a blind
Submiſſion to Vulgar Notions, is one of the moſt
fertil Sources of Error, and that there is nothing
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:51983:204"/>
ſo variable and uncertain, as the Sentiments of
Men in different Places and Ages.</p>
               <p>I confeſs the other part of the Objection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a greater and more puzzling Difficulty. But
tho' the Conduct of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senate in this
Caſe ſeems at firſt View to depend upon ſome
ſecret Reaſons of State, the Myſtery lies not ſo
deep but that it may be eaſily unriddl'd by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Degree of Application. You know that the
Government of <hi>Venice</hi> is purely <hi>Ariſtocratical,</hi> and
that the Revolutions which happen in ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
are uſually occaſion'd by ſuffering one
of the Members of the Body in which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is lodg'd, to over-top the reſt: For an
Ambitious Perſon may be eaſily tempted by ſo
inviting an Opportunity, to eſtabliſh the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of his Family by oppreſſing his Fellow-Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
and to erect a Monarchy upon the Ruines
of the Republick. Hiſtory and Experience furniſh
us with ſo many Inſtances of ſuch Revolutions,
and theſe Examples are ſo univerſally known, that
'twou'd be needleſs either to cite 'em, or to alledge any
other Arguments to prove ſo well-atteſted a Truth.
Now the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe Maxims are,
without Controverſie, grounded on the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
Politicks, making a wiſe uſe of the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of other States, and being well acquainted
with the weak part of their own, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to prevent the Inconveniences that might
ariſe from that neceſſary Flaw in their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
by the moſt prudent Laws and Proviſo's
that ever were invented; and their Care for the
Preſervation of the State has been attended with
ſuch excellent Succeſs, that the Republic conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
ſtill to ſubſiſt on the ſame Foundations on
which 'twas firſt eſtabliſh'd. To give you a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen
of the admirable Politicks of that wiſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
I ſhall briefly take notice of ſome of thoſe
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:51983:204"/>
Laws and Cuſtoms that are interwoven with the
Conſtitution of their Government. The <hi>Doge</hi> is
entruſted with ſo ſmall a Share in the Management
of the State, that he may be juſtly call'd a meer
Shadow of Grandeur. There are Inquiſitors ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to have an Eye upon his Actions, who may
call him to an Account when they pleaſe. He is not
allow'd the Liberty of public and familiar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
nor ſuffer'd to appear in the City but
on certain Days of Ceremony. The Nobles are
forbidden to entertain any correſpondence with
Foreign Princes, or their Miniſters. They are not
permitted to wear Arms, to uſe any Ornaments of
Gold or Silver, to keep a numerous Train of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
or to affect any Marks of Grandeur. The
Cuſtom of walking in the <hi>Broglio</hi> was introduc'd
to prevent the dangerous Conſequences of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Cabals. The Inquiſitors of State were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
for the Security of the Government; and
'tis the ſame Conſideration that moves 'em to
entertain above a Thouſand Spies. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that illuſtrious Body in which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is lodg'd, the celebrated <hi>Senate of Venice,</hi>
which knows ſo well how to maintain its Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
on other Occaſions, keeps neither Guards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Place of its meeting, nor a Garriſon in
the Town; wiſely conſidering, that if ever an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
ſhou'd happen, thoſe Mercenary Soldiers,
however appointed for the Defence and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the State, wou'd be made the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of its Ruine.</p>
               <p>I will not trouble you with a particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all the Laws and Regulations that were
inſtituted for the ſame end, and are ſtill obſerv'd
in this place. But from what has been ſaid on
this Subject, you may eaſily perceive that thoſe
prudent Senatours make it their principal Care to
prevent Inteſtine Diſorders, and to render the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:51983:205"/>
Nobles incapable of invading the Public Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>Now if the Senate ſhou'd order a Citadel or
Fort to be built at <hi>Venice,</hi> they might with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
be accus'd of contriving the Inſtruments of
their own Ruine, and of undermining that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Fabric, which they have taken ſo great Care
to ſecure. But they are too wiſe to be guilty of
ſo fatal a Blunder; and 'tis better to be in ſome
meaſure expos'd to the Inſults of Foreign Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
than to lie at the Mercy of Domeſtic Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Beſides they have no Reaſon to be afraid
of their Neighbours; for 'tis the Intereſt of all the
Princes and States of <hi>Italy,</hi> to preſerve the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,
that it may continue to be the Bulwark of
<hi>Chriſtendom</hi> on that ſide, and to counter-balance the
Power of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> And as for the
<hi>Turks,</hi> they are at too great a Diſtance to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
an Expedition againſt the City.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee that there are ſeveral weighty
Conſiderations that deter the Senate from forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
their Capital City: and there are no leſs
preſſing Reaſons that oblige 'em to encourage
the Vulgar Opinion of its pretended Impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
               <p>If I ſhou'd ſend you a particular Deſcription
of this City, I cou'd only entertain you with a
Repetition of what you have read perhaps in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Authors. And therefore I ſhall content my
ſelf with communicating ſome of my Remarks to
you, in a looſe and familiar manner.</p>
               <p>Some pretend that <hi>Venice</hi> is built on ſeventy
two Iſlands or <hi>Lagunes,</hi> which are ſeparated by
ſuch narrow Chanels that they ſeem to form
one little Continent: and there are others who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
this Opinion. I will not undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
the Controverſie, but only tell you what I
have ſeen, and leave the whole Matter to your
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:51983:205"/>
Judgment. 'Tis certain that <hi>Venice</hi> is founded on
a Spot of Ground that riſes at leaſt to the Surface
of the Water; for the Earth appears in the Streets,
Keys, public Places, and Houſes. 'Tis true they
are forc'd to make uſe of Piles, becauſe the Ground
is not firm enough to ſupport the Weight of a large
Palace without ſinking: but that ought not to
make us doubt the Truth of a thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by the Teſtimony of our own Eyes; for
the ſame way of Building is generally us'd in all
Mooriſh or Fenny Places, and particularly in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
'Tis no leſs certain that this Spot of Ground
is at preſent a Maſs of Iſlands, ſo that it remains
only to conſider whether the Canals that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
theſe little Iſlands be Natural or Artificial.
This Queſtion is not eaſily to be determin'd, for
one may alledge very plauſible Arguments either
for the Affirmative or Negative part. 'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
the <hi>Venetians</hi> might dig theſe Chanels, for
the more convenient Carriage of Goods, which by
this means are brought to their Doors, and for
the Embelliſhment of the City, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Town in the World that can boaſt of ſuch a
Situation. But there are ſo many, and ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Reaſons, which favour the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that I'm almoſt entirely convinc'd of the
Truth of it. In the firſt place, 'Tis plain that the
<hi>Venetians</hi> have taken all poſſible Care to husband
the Ground on which the City is founded. The
Streets are ſo narrow, that in moſt of 'em three
Men cannot walk a-breaſt, and in ſome, one Man
can hardly paſs by another. And the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Houſes on one ſide are laid in the
Water, without any Key or Paſſage betwixt 'em
and the Canals. We cannot then ſuppoſe, with
the leaſt Shadow of Probability, that the Proſpect
of any Conveniency cou'd oblige 'em to waſte
ſo conſiderable a quantity of that Ground which
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:51983:206"/>
they manage ſo thriftily, that the City is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
full of Boundaries, to reſtrain the Proprietors
of the Houſes from breaking in upon the
Streets. And beſides, what Reaſon can there be
alledg'd for their leaving ſo many large Spots of
Ground entire; for tho' you are inform'd that a
Man may go in a Boat to any Houſe in the
City, you muſt not take theſe Words in a ſtrict
and literal Senſe, but only as a figurative Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to ſignifie that there are a great Number of
ſuch Houſes in <hi>Venice.</hi> I can aſſure you that
there is not a Canal within five hundred Paces
round of the Houſe where I lodge; and that
there are twenty ſuch Places in the City. I ſhall
only add that the Canals are crooked, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
unequal both in Length and Breadth;
which, in my Opinion, may ſerve to convince
any conſidering Perſon, that they are not Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.</p>
               <p>All the Streets in the City, without Exception,
are narrow and crooked; but to make amends
for theſe Diſadvantages, they are ſo clean that one
may walk a Year in 'em without meeting with
any Dirt: and beſides they are pav'd with large
ſquare Stones, which always after a Shower grow
as white as Marble. In ſeveral parts of the City
there are little empty places call'd <hi>Campi</hi> or Fields;
which were probably left for the Conveniency of
intrenching, if an Enemy ſhou'd enter the Town;
for they are not at all Ornamental. The only
conſiderable Place or Field in <hi>Venice,</hi> is that of S.
<hi>Mark,</hi> which certainly claims all our Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
'Tis two hundred and fifty Paces long, and
eighty broad. The Church of S. <hi>Mark</hi> faces one
of the Ends of it, and that of S. <hi>Geminian</hi> the
other. 'Tis border'd on each ſide with thoſe ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Piles of Building call'd the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>aties,</hi>
which make it, without Controverſie, the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:51983:206"/>
moſt Magnificent Place in the World. The
Front of each Procuraty is ſupported by a large
Portico, ten Paces broad; and all along
there are double Piazza's, one of which entering
into the Building ſerves for Shops, which are lett
by the <hi>Signiory</hi> to thoſe who ſell Perfumes, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monade,
and Coffee. The Procurators of S. <hi>Mark</hi>
lodge in theſe Palaces, which for that Reaſon are
call'd the <hi>Procuraties:</hi> but when any Foreign Prince
comes to take a View of 'em, or on ſome other
Occaſions of Public Rejoicing, the Partitions are
taken down, ſo that one may walk from one
End to the other, and all the ſeveral Apartments
are united into one ſpacious Houſe. That on the
Right-hand, as you go to S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church, is
call'd the <hi>New,</hi> and that on the Left the <hi>Old
Procuraty.</hi> The firſt has two principal Fronts, one
of which looks into the Place of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and
the other into the <hi>Broglio,</hi> over-againſt the Palace
of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> which is an Ancient and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Structure, where all the Councils meet; ſuch
as the <hi>Grand Council,</hi> the <hi>Council of the Finances</hi> call'd
the <hi>Ceca,</hi> the <hi>Marine Council,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Ceca</hi> is a
diſtinct Apartment in the Palace of S. <hi>Mark;</hi>
and tho' 'tis built after the ſame Manner, and
with the ſame Stones, the large Grates and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Doors of Iron, with which 'tis inclos'd, make
it reſemble a Priſon rather than a Palace: And
beſides the Smoak that ariſes from the Furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
has ſo penetrated the Stone-Walls, that they are
black even within the Chambers. Here the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is coin'd, and the Public Treaſure kept in
great Iron Cheſts, ſecur'd with three Locks, the Keys
of which are committed to the Cuſtody of three
Procurators, who, under Pain of Death, dare not
make the leaſt Attempt to open 'em till they are
all met together. The Council ſits twice a Week,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:51983:207"/>
which are the only Days for all ſorts of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The little <hi>Arſenal</hi> of the Nobles, whoſe Arms
are always kept ready charg'd, is in the ſame
Palace of S. <hi>Mark;</hi> and the <hi>Doge</hi>'s Apartment is
in the Right-Wing, from whence there is a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to the Church, whither he goes ſometimes
<hi>incognito</hi> to hear Maſs; but uſually he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
his Devotions at a private Chapel in his own
Apartment.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church is a large Structure, ſquare on
the Out-ſide, cover'd with four Leaden Domes,
of which the largeſt is in the Middle, without
any Spires or Steeples. The Top is ſurrounded
with Stone Baliſters for the Conveniency of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
You enter the Church thro' a Portico com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of five Arches, the higheſt of which is in
the Middle. There you may take a View of
thoſe Large and Stately Gates of Braſs, which the
<hi>Venetians</hi> brought from <hi>Santa Sophia</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
when they robb'd that City of ſo many valuable
Curioſities to enrich their own. Among the reſt, I
cannot forbear taking Notice of the four Brazen
Horſes that are plac'd upon the ſame Portico. 'Tis Pity
they are not more carefully preſerv'd; for they are
ſo finely ſhap'd, that Nature her ſelf cou'd not
mend thoſe Artificial Animals. 'Tis true, they
have endeavour'd to piece 'em, but all their Care
and Skill will never be able to reſtore 'em to their
primitive Beauty.</p>
               <p>The Figure of the Church within reſembles a
Croſs, the Quire repreſenting the upper part. 'Tis
vaulted throughout, and enrich'd with very fine
<hi>Moſaic</hi>-Work, like that of <hi>Santa Sophia,</hi> but not
near ſo laſting: for it decays ſo faſt, that they are
forc'd to keep ſome Workmen on purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
it; whereas the other remains entire notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
its great Antiquity. And beſides there is
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:51983:207"/>
another Difference betwixt the <hi>Moſaic</hi>-Work at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
and that at <hi>Santa Sophia;</hi> for the latter is
ſmooth and plain, whereas the former is full of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.
Theſe are the only Pieces of this Nature I
have had occaſion to ſee in my Travels, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
one at <hi>Scio.</hi> The Floor of the Church is
adorn'd with another ſort of <hi>Moſaic</hi> no leſs preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than the former, conſiſting of ſeveral ſmall
Pieces of Porphyrie, Jaſper, and Serpentine or
ſpeckl'd Marble, not unlike to the Tables and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets
of Ebony, that are inlaid with Shells and
Naker.</p>
               <p>The Arms of all the <hi>Doges</hi> that have hitherto
govern'd the Republic are plac'd round the Walls.
They are generally magnificent, and even ſome of
'em are of Silver curiouſly wrought. The only Fault
I can find in this Church is its Obſcurity, which
hides the greateſt part of its Beauties: For in all
other reſpects 'tis enrich'd with the fineſt Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſuch as Altars, Pictures, and Veſſels of Gold
and Silver. 'Twou'd be needleſs to preſent you
with a Catalogue of the rare Curioſities that are to
be ſeen either in the Church or Treaſury, ſince
you will find 'em all particularly deſcrib'd in a
Treatiſe written by <hi>Monſieur de S. Didier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis Pity the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhou'd have loſt the Body
of their good Patron, S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and that their Loſs
ſhou'd be attended with this mortifying Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
that they know neither the Time nor Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of it. 'Tis true the common People believe
that he retir'd into a Pillar, which they ſhew'd
me, and that he thruſt his Hand out of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
when he gave the Ring to the <hi>Doge;</hi> but
moſt of 'em ſcruple not to confeſs that they know
not where he is, nor whither he went.</p>
               <p>They made me alſo take Notice of a Stone,
which they pretend is the ſame that yielded Water
to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they were tormented with
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:51983:208"/>
Thirſt in the Wilderneſs. If this be true, we muſt
allow that Rock a Power to multiply its Kind; for
'tis ſtill to be ſeen in the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Sues</hi> and <hi>Tor,</hi> as I have heard ſeveral credible
Perſons affirm, as well <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi>
who aſſure me that it ſtands by it ſelf in the
midſt of a Sandy Deſart; and that one may both
eaſily perceive the Holes that gave a Paſſage to the
Water, and diſcern the very Track or Print that
was made by the Stream.</p>
               <p>The next place in <hi>Venice</hi> that claims a particular
Obſervation, is the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> which is certainly the beſt
furniſh'd Magazine in the World. For tho' it
contains no leſs than two Miles in Compaſs, 'tis
fill'd and even crowded with Cannons, Bombs,
Granadoes, Muskets, Sabres, Gun-powder, Ropes,
Sails, Anchors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To give you an Eſtimate of
the prodigious Quantity of Ammunition that is
hoarded up in this Place, 'twill be ſufficient to
tell you, that in caſe of Neceſſity, 'tis ſufficient
to arm and equip fifteen Galleys, four Galeaſſes,
as many Ships, and a hundred thouſand Men. The
<hi>Arſenal</hi> is govern'd by three Nobles, and under
them by the Pilot of the Republic, whom they
call the Admiral, who is entruſted with the Care
and Inſpection both of the Stores, and of two or
three hundred Men, that are conſtantly kept at
Work. He never goes to Sea but once a Year,
to ſteer the <hi>Bucentaur</hi> on <hi>Aſcenſion-Day,</hi> when the
Duke accompany'd by all the Nobles, performs
the Ceremony of Wedding the Sea. They ſet ſo
high a Value upon this Veſſel, that the Pilot is
oblig'd under Pain of Death to bring it back in
Safety; which makes him ſo cautious in obſerving
the Weather, that when he perceives any Clouds,
or the leaſt Appearance of a Wind on the Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the Solemnity, he procures it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd
till the next <hi>Sunday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:51983:208"/>
'Tis the Opinion of one, That <hi>Venice</hi> contains
Four hundred Palaces, fit to receive and entertain a
King. This is certainly a very bold Aſſertion; and
yet I dare not poſitively contradict it: for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
are ſo Numerous and Magnificent, that I
may venture, without a <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> to affirm that
they are ſufficient to adorn Ten Cities. On the
great Canal alone there are at leaſt Two hundred,
which ſeem to out-rival one another, whether you
conſider the Boldneſs of the Deſign, or the Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Structure; and confound the amaz'd
Spectatour with ſo vaſt a Medley of different Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that he knows not which to prefer, or
where to point at the Principal Object of his
Admiration. If your Curioſity ſhou'd lead you
out of the City, to take a View of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Continent, eſpecially towards <hi>Padua,</hi> you
wou'd be tempted to fanſie your ſelf among the
Habitations of the Gods; for every Palace reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
a Magnificent Temple, adorn'd with all the moſt
exquiſite Beauties of Architecture. It muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
that the <hi>Italians,</hi> and particularly the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> are the beſt Architects in the World;
and that the fineſt Houſes in <hi>France</hi> are not
comparable to theſe Palaces on the Outſide.</p>
               <p>I ſhall take this Occaſion to give you a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Idea of their Manner of Building. The Height
of the Edifice is exactly proportion'd to its Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
according to the niceſt Rules of Architecture.
The Houſes are cover'd with fine Platforms, where
a Man may enjoy the Pleaſure of walking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
going out of his own Houſe; and when he grows
weary may either ſit down on the Benches, or reſt
on the Baliſters that ſurround the Platform. The
Fronts of the Houſes are adorn'd with Portico's, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns,
Balconies at the Windows, Frizes, Feſtoons,
Niches, and Statues. Theſe Ornaments are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with Courts, Anti-Courts, delicious Gardens,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:51983:209"/>
Fountains, Grotto's, and all the other Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that a luxurious Fancy can contrive. I can
aſſure you that this is a true and faithful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of theſe glorious Edifices; and I leave
you to judge whether they may not juſtly be
call'd Palaces, and whether any thing cou'd give a
higher Idea of the Grandeur of the <hi>Venetian</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
The main Reaſon, in my Opinion, that
makes 'em employ ſo great a part of their Treaſure
in Building, is becauſe they are not permitted to
diſplay their Magnificence any other way. For
ſince they are not ſuffer'd to conſume their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in ſplendid Equipages, and rich Habits, 'tis
plain they muſt either build, or find ſome other
way to beſtow their ſuperfluous Caſh. And, 'tis
probably the ſame Reſtraint that tempts 'em to
throw away ſuch vaſt quantities of Money on
Courtezans and at Play. You wou'd hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, if I ſhou'd tell you what prodigious Summs
are conſum'd every Year at <hi>Baſſette,</hi> eſpecially du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>Carnaval;</hi> when the <hi>Ridotti</hi> or Gaming-Houſes
are open. None are admitted into theſe
Houſes without Masks; that all ſorts of People
may enjoy an equal Liberty, and that there may
be no Occaſion for Diſputes, nor any Marks of
Diſtinction in a place where every one is welcome
for his Money, and where there is always a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
Medley of Noblemen, Citizens, Ladies, and
Courtezans: Yet this Order is not obſerv'd with
the utmoſt Rigour; for one that has a falſe Noſe,
or counterfeit Whiskers is held to be ſufficiently
Mask'd. The Nobles keep the Bank, and relieve
one another by turns from Morning till Night.
They bear good or bad Fortune without diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the leaſt Alteration either in their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
or Humour: and ſeem as little concern'd
when they loſe a Thouſand <hi>Sequins</hi> by one Card,
as when they gain One by another. I have
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:51983:209"/>
had Occaſion two or three times to ſee the Bank
broke, but cou'd never perceive the leaſt Sign of
Diſturbance in the unfortunate Gameſter. And
which is no leſs ſurprizing, I have ſeen other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
continue to play with the Loſer, upon his
bare Word, to the Value of Ten thouſand Ducats,
which were always punctually paid next Morning.
'Tis true, the Loſs does not fall wholly upon one
Perſon, for there are ſometimes a Hundred of 'em
join'd together; and this is perhaps the main Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that makes 'em bear their Misfortunes ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently.
Beſides the Bank is ſeldom a Loſer at
the laſt; and the <hi>Ridotti</hi> are ſometimes ſo full of
Money, that they know not where to keep it.
All the Caſh is entruſted to the Care of ſome
Nobleman, who is uſually one of the poorer Sort;
and yet 'tis never obſerv'd that he retains ſo much
as one Peny.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Remember I told you, that the Order of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
might be divided into four Claſſes; and I
ſhall begin this Letter with applying the ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
to the Noblemen of <hi>Venice:</hi> for tho' all
who bear that Name are united into one Body,
their Families are not equally Illuſtrious. The firſt
<hi>Claſſis</hi> or Rank, conſiſts of thoſe Families who foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Republic, and were Noble before that
time. The ſecond comprehends thoſe who were
elected before the Shutting up of the Council,
which was call'd, <hi>Il Serrar del Conſiglio.</hi> The third
contains thoſe who obtain'd that Honour as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
for ſome eminent Services done to the
State; and are therefore call'd Gentlemen by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
And the fourth is made up of <hi>Nobili per Soldi,</hi>
or <hi>Gentlemen by Purchaſe,</hi> who bought the Title. But
notwithſtanding ſo conſiderable a Difference in their
Pedigrees, they have all an equal Right to give
their Voices, and enjoy the ſame Privileges: All,
from the Higheſt to the Loweſt, go to the Great
Council, and are honour'd with the Title of <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</hi>
And even it happens not unfrequently that
the moſt Illuſtrious Members of that Body are not
moſt reſpected: for oftentimes a Gentleman of
three Days ſtanding is advanc'd to the Dignity of
a <hi>Procurator,</hi> while the Ancient Families, and thoſe
that gave a Being to the Republic, are in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
Condition. Here, as well as every where
elſe, 'tis the Cuſtom to worſhip the Riſing Sun, and
to court thoſe who ſeem to be the Darlings of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
The Richeſt are always eſteem'd the Greateſt
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:51983:210"/>
Lords, and ſtand faireſt for Preferment. However
ſince all Elections are decided by Plurality of Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Grand Council, the poorer Sort of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
are treated with more Complaiſance than
they cou'd expect, if they had not a Right to
Vote on ſuch Occaſions; ſince it may ſometimes be
in their Power to diſpoſe of the Procuratorſhip,
and even of the Ducal Coronet. This puts me
in mind of a Story, which perhaps will divert
you; you muſt take it on the Credit of its Authors.
There was, ſay the <hi>Venetians,</hi> a certain poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
who had Occaſion to take a Journey into
the Country: Before his Departure he went to a
Great Lord, who was his Neighbour, and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to lend him a Cloak; but had the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
to receive a flat Denyal, and was forc'd to
have Recourſe to another. Not long after the <hi>Doge</hi>
di'd, and the rich Nobleman had ſo great an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in the Council, that when they proceeded to
Balloting, he wanted but one Voice to be choſen.
In the mean time the poor Gentleman happen'd to
come in, and was immediately accoſted by his
wealthy Neighbour, who, with all imaginable
Submiſſion and Reſpect, begg'd his Voice; and
aſſur'd him, that he wou'd always look upon him
as the Author of his Fortune. But the Gentleman
remembring his late Incivility, reply'd in an
angry and diſdainful manner, <hi>No, my Lord, you muſt
e'en reſolve to go without a Coronet, as you made me
go without a Cloak.</hi> The Conſideration of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Occaſions they have to make uſe of the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the reſt of their Body, makes 'em treat
one another with a great deal of <hi>Civility,</hi> if I
may be allow'd to uſe ſo weak an Expreſſion to
ſignifie the Compliments and Ceremonious Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their Salutations, which are ſo extravagant,
that in any other Country they wou'd be eſteem'd
Ridiculous. 'Tis pleaſant to obſerve how they
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:51983:211"/>
court one another when they meet on the <hi>Brog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio:</hi>
I have often ſeen Noblemen who ſtood Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates
for the higheſt Preferments, proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
before a poor Gentleman whoſe Veſt was
not worth a Groat, as if he had been a King,
or ſomewhat more than Humane. The <hi>Venetian</hi>
Salutations are quite different from Ours; they
perform 'em ſlowly, to expreſs the Modeſty and
Humility of their Reſpect, and bowing their Heads
to their very Knees, continue ſometimes for the
Space of a Minute in that Poſture, offering their
Service in the moſt ſubmiſſive Expreſſions; after
which they raiſe their Bodies, and immediately
begin again, repeating the ſame Ceremony two
or three times. And they are ſo nicely ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in ſuch Caſes, that if any Nobleman ſhou'd
venture to ſhorten his Reverences, or to imitate
the <hi>French</hi> Air in the leaſt, he wou'd be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
a baſe Man, who had loſt all Senſe of
Honour.</p>
               <p>When a Stranger comes to ſerve in the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Army, he muſt immediately learn their Faſhions,
as the only way to avoid their Hatred, and to
raiſe his own Fortune; tho' it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
theſe fawning Ceremonies are extremely
troubleſome and uneaſie. I had occaſion t'other
Day to ſee the Entry of a Procurator, and took
notice of ſome Colonels and other Officers who
march'd before the Senate to the Church, where
they ſtopt within the Door, and ſaluted every
Nobleman as he paſs'd by, with a Reverence,
ſuch as I deſcrib'd before; ſo that for a large
Quarter of an Hour they were perpetually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in that troubleſome Task. But beſides thoſe
profound Reverences, there are a Thouſand other
Niceties, and nauſeous Flatteries, which are the
neceſſary Conſequences of their Exceſſive Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
You muſt weigh every Expreſſion you uſe
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:51983:211"/>
either in Letters or Diſcourſe; for 'tis not enough
to avoid the Word <hi>Voi</hi> or <hi>You,</hi> which wou'd be
reckon'd a Downright Affront, and to uſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the Third Perſon <hi>Lei,</hi> or <hi>Ella,</hi> but you muſt
take care to repeat the moſt ſubmiſſive Phraſes,
ſuch as <hi>If it pleaſe my Patron, If my Patron vouchſafe
to command me,</hi> &amp;c. You muſt ſtill ſay, <hi>My Patron</hi>
ſaid or did ſuch a thing; and whatever Epithet
you beſtow upon him, you muſt never forget to
add <hi>iſſimo</hi> to the End of it; for 'twou'd be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
a poor Compliment to call a Man <hi>Nobile,
Docto,</hi> or <hi>Galanto,</hi> inſtead of which you muſt ſay
he is <hi>Nobiliſſimo, Doctiſſimo,</hi> and <hi>Galantiſſimo.</hi> The
ſame, or rather greater Ceremonies, are obſerv'd
in <hi>Writing;</hi> I remember I have ſeen ſome Letters
from the Captain Generals <hi>Cornaro</hi> and <hi>Mocenigo</hi> to
a <hi>Greek Merchant,</hi> in which they gave him the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>Molto Illuſtre Signor.</hi> Four Fingers breadth
lower the Letter began thus, <hi>Ho ricevuto de voſtra
Signoria molto Illuſtre,</hi> &amp;c. and the reſt was all of
a Piece: At the End of the Letter were theſe
Words, <hi>de voſtra Signoria molto illuſtre, devotiſſimo
Servitore;</hi> then a Space of Six Fingers breadth,
and the Subſcription at the Bottom. I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
ſurpriz'd at the Extravagancy of theſe
Compliments, when I conſider'd the Quality of
the Writers, and of him to whom the Letters
were directed; and I leave you to judge what
Ceremonies muſt be obſerv'd between Equals. A
Letter to a Nobleman muſt be directed thus,
<hi>Al' Illuſtriſſimo &amp; Excellentiſſimo Signor, &amp; mio Padrone
Colendiſſimo, il Signor,</hi> &amp;c. and the Body of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
muſt be ſutable to the flattering Superſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
You muſt take care to give every Man the
Titles that are appropriated to Perſons of his Rank
and Quality: Thus when you ſpeak to a <hi>Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
you muſt call him <hi>Signor Pietro,</hi> or <hi>Signor
Paolo;</hi> to a <hi>Citizen</hi> or <hi>Merchant</hi> you muſt ſay <hi>Voſtra
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:51983:212"/>
Signoria,</hi> and, in Letters, <hi>Voſtra Signoria molto Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre.</hi>
A <hi>Counſellor, Phyſician, Notary,</hi> or a <hi>Gentleman</hi>
who is a <hi>Subject</hi> is ſtyl'd <hi>la Signoria Illuſtriſſima;</hi>
The proper Title of the <hi>Nobles</hi> is <hi>l' Excellenza;</hi>
and the <hi>Doge</hi> is uſually call'd <hi>la Serenita,</hi> or <hi>il
Sereniſſimo;</hi> for they rarely ſay <hi>il Dogio.</hi> But when
they ſay <hi>il Principe,</hi> they always mean the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public.</hi>
Thus all Orders and Proclamations begin
thus, <hi>Il Sereniſſimo Principe fa ſapere; The moſt Serene
Prince declares, or gives Notice:</hi> And tis uſually ſaid
in familiar Diſcourſe, <hi>Il Principe ha prohibito le Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe;
The Prince has prohibited the wearing of Coſtly Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,</hi>
&amp;c. Thus they ſpeak when they do not ſo
much as think of the <hi>Doge,</hi> who has no more
Power to make ſuch Regulations, than the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Officer that belongs to the Republic; and far
from being a Soveraign, he is ſo much a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that he dares hardly move one Inch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Orders. <hi>Francis Moroſini,</hi> the preſent <hi>Doge,</hi>
was elected to that Dignity in <hi>April</hi> 1688, while
he was obtaining Victories for the Republick abroad.
And yet as told and infirmas he is, he was forc'd to
continue in that fatiguing Employment, and at laſt,
with much ado, and after a whole Year ſpent
in humble and earneſt Solicitations, he obtain'd
leave to quit the Service, and return'd to <hi>Venice</hi>
laſt Year. He is the firſt <hi>Doge</hi> that ever enter'd
the City with the Ducal Coronet on his Head:
Nor cou'd the Senate refuſe to grant ſome unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
Mark of Honour to the Conqueror of all
<hi>Morea.</hi> However, I'm ſtrongly inclin'd to ſuſpect
that the main Conſideration which made him ſo
uneaſie till he had obtain'd a Permiſſion to leave
the Army, was his Fear of loſing the Glory he
had acquir'd. And you will be of the ſame O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
if you conſider the ill Succeſs of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon <hi>Negropont;</hi> and the ſlow Progreſs he
made in the Siege of <hi>Napoli di Malvaſia,</hi> which
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:51983:212"/>
held out two Years againſt him, and was ſtill in
ſo good a Condition at his Departure, that there
was little or no hope of reducing it; tho' for want
of Proviſions the Garriſon was oblig'd to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Place to the General during the laſt
Campaign.</p>
               <p>The length of this Siege puts me in mind of
<hi>Candy,</hi> which for ſo long a time was attack'd and
defended with equal Obſtinacy and Vigour. 'Twas
the ſame <hi>Moroſini</hi> who commanded in the Place,
and the Senate being unwilling to waſte ſo much
Blood and Treaſure in the Defence of a Place
which, after all, they cou'd not hope to preſerve,
ſent him poſitive Orders to Capitulate. But he
was ſo deſirous of Glory, and had ſo mean an
Opinion of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Valour, that he aſſur'd
the Senate, if they wou'd continue to ſupply
him with neceſſary Proviſions, he wou'd either
ſave the Place, or bury himſelf under its Ruines.
Yet, for all his bravery, he was forc'd to ſubmit
to the Chance of War, without performing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of his Promiſe: And at his return to
<hi>Venice</hi> he had the mortification to meet with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bad Reception on the <hi>Broglio.</hi> Some of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
were ſo incens'd againſt him, that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
their Spite by abuſing him to his Face,
asking by way of Deriſion, <hi>Ha! is not this</hi> Moro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſini;
while others reply'd with equal Bitterneſs
and Contempt, <hi>No, no, that can't be the Man who
promis'd to bury himſelf under the Ruines of</hi> Candy, <hi>if
he ſhou'd find himſelf unable to preſerve it.</hi> But the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of his Enemies did not evaporate in Jeſts,
they were not ſatisfy'd with ſo poor a Revenge,
but proſecuted him ſo warmly, that his Head was
in a tottering Condition. One of 'em repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Crime to the Council, and in a vehement
and pathetic Diſcourſe, accus'd him of abuſing the
Senate, by promiſing ſuch things as he cou'd not
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:51983:213"/>
perform, and of engaging the Republick in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Charge, which might have been better
employ'd another way. Nor was this the ſingle
Opinion of one Perſon, for ſeveral others voted
him guilty: Yet his good Fortune deliver'd him
from ſo great a Danger, and has now ſet the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet
on his Head; he is ſomewhat lean, and of
a middle Stature; his Hair and Beard are white;
he wears Whiskers, and a little Tuft of Hair up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Chin. I ſaw him at the Entry of his
Kinſman the Procurator <hi>Moroſini;</hi> and ſince I have
occaſion again to ſpeak of that Solemnity, which
I only mention'd before, I ſhall now give you a
particular Account of it: But before I deſcribe
the Order of the Cavalcade, it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
to acquaint you with the Preparations
that were made in the Church of S. <hi>Mark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the Door of the Nave or Body of the
Church to that of the Quire, there was a Lane
border'd with Rows of Benches, thro' which the
<hi>Doge</hi> and Procurators were to paſs; and both the
Floor and Benches were cover'd with <hi>Turkiſh Tapeſtry.</hi>
The Quire was alſo full of Benches, without any
Difference or Mark of Diſtinction; only the <hi>Doge</hi>'s
Place was cover'd with red Velvet; and beſides,
there was a Cuſhion of the ſame Velvet at his
Feet, and another on the Place where he lean'd
at Prayer. The Altar was embelliſh'd with the
richeſt Jewels, Relicks, Candleſticks, and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments;
and the Patiarch's great Vicar waited
in his Seat for the <hi>Doge</hi>'s coming. He wore a
Chaſuble embroider'd with Pearls, worth above
6000 <hi>Ducats;</hi> and the Hangings of the Altar
were no leſs rich.</p>
               <p>The Church being thus prepar'd, the Signiory
or Noblemen began their Cavalcade from the Hall
of the Great Council in S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Palace, where
they were aſſembl'd to aſſiſt at the Solemnity.
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:51983:213"/>
In the firſt place march'd the <hi>Doge</hi>'s Servants, to
the Number of Forty, in long Livery Cloaks.
Then came the Societies of Tradeſmen, or rather
a confus'd Company of private Perſons who came
of their own accord to honour the new Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator;
for their Preſence was not requir'd by
any poſitive Order. Theſe were follow'd by a
Hundred <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Soldiers, arm'd only with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,
who had obtain'd leave to come from the
Army, and appear'd on this Occaſion at the deſire
of their Commanders. Twelve or Fifteen Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
march'd before 'em, among whom was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant
Major; and there were ſome alſo in the
Rear. Theſe Officers were not arm'd, becauſe
they came voluntarily, not by command; for at
<hi>Venice</hi> every Man is welcome on ſuch Occaſions,
tho' he be not invited. Then came the Eight
Standards of the Republick, Two <hi>Red,</hi> Two <hi>White,</hi>
Two <hi>Blue,</hi> and Two of a <hi>Violet-colour;</hi> the <hi>Red</hi> being
carry'd firſt, to ſignifie the preſent War. Theſe
were immediately follow'd by the Signiory, who
march'd Two and Two, in open-ſleev'd Gowns,
or Robes of <hi>Red</hi> Cloth furr'd with Ermines. There
were at leaſt Three hundred Nobles, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Senators and the Procurators, who
form'd the laſt Ranks, and conſequently were
next the <hi>Doge.</hi> He that made his Entry walk'd
among the reſt, without any Mark of Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
either in his Habit, or any other Reſpect;
ſo that if ſome Perſons had not ſhew'd him to
to me, I cou'd not have diſtinguiſh'd him from
the reſt of the Procurators. The Robes or Gowns
of all the Procurators are exactly alike; nor is
there any difference among the Nobles in reſpect
of their Habits; that ſo none may pretend to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
over another. After them came the
<hi>Doge,</hi> who repreſents the Soveraign: He had a
Veſt of Red Brocado, with Gold Flowers, and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:51983:214"/>
over that a Duc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Mantle, of a very rich
Stuff of Gold. His Coronet is a Cap of Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
neatly cover'd with the ſame rich Stuff,
and adorn'd with ſome Galoons, without either
Pearls or Precious Stones. There is a ſort of
Point on the hinder part of the Cap, that bends
a little forwards. The magnificent Coronet that
is kept in the Treaſury, is only us'd on the Day of
the <hi>Doge</hi>'s Coronation. He was accompany'd on the
Right-hand by the Pope's <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and on the Left
by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, <hi>Monſieur de la Haye.</hi>
The firſt was in a Camail and Rochet, and the
other in a black Cloak. Two Citizens bore the
<hi>Doge</hi>'s Train, which otherwiſe wou'd have trail'd
above four Feet on the Ground. Laſt of all
march'd Fifty or Sixty Nobles, in the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as before. As the Noblemen paſs'd by, there
were certain old and young Women that ſtrew'd
the Way with Flowers and Green Leaves, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
before the <hi>Doge:</hi> In the mean time the
Guns at the Arſenal were fir'd, and the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
was entertain'd with the Noiſe of the Prince's
Trumpets and Kettle-Drums, which were plac'd
on the Top of the Portico of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Brazen Horſes, from whence they
might be eaſily heard, becauſe 'tis not Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Paces from thence to the Hall of the Great
Council. As ſoon as the <hi>Doge</hi> enter'd, he
went immediately to perform his Devotions upon
the Steps of the Altar, where he kneel'd without
a Cuſhion. As he return'd to his Place, the <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi>
happen'd to be on his Left-hand, and the
Ambaſſador on his Right, but they inſtantly
chang'd Places, and proceeded as before to the
Place where the <hi>Doge</hi> was to ſit. After the <hi>Doge</hi>
had ſeated himſelf, the <hi>Nuncio</hi> ſate down on his
Right-hand, and <hi>Monſieur de la Haye</hi> took his
Place on the Right-hand of the <hi>Nuncio;</hi> ſo that
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:51983:214"/>
the <hi>Nuncio</hi> ſate between the <hi>Doge</hi> and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador.
This prepoſterous Order will perhaps
ſurprize you; for according to the Ceremonies
that are obſerv'd on ſuch Occaſions, the <hi>Doge</hi>
ought to have ſate in the Middle: But I had
forgot to tell you, that there was no particular
Place appointed for the <hi>Doge,</hi> neither a Tribune,
Pew, nor ſo much as an arm'd Chair; ſo that
he was forc'd to make uſe of the Seat that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Dean of the Canons, which is the
firſt on the Right-hand next the Door of the
Quire. The reſt of the Seats in the ſame Row
were fill'd by the Procurators and Senators; ſo
that the <hi>Doge</hi> had only the firſt Place among the
Senators, without any other Mark of Diſtinction
than the red Velvet with which his Seat was
cover'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doge</hi>'s Behaviour during the Maſs was not
very edifying, for he ſpent the whole time in
diſcourſing with the <hi>Nuncio</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
and expreſs'd a great deal of Earneſtneſs
by his Actions. Tho' I cou'd not pretend to
divine the Subject of his Diſcourſe, I cou'd eaſily
perceive that he talk'd of ſome important Affair;
for <hi>Monſieur de la Haye</hi> roſe from his Place, and
talk'd with him above a quarter of an Hour,
chuſing rather to ſtand while the <hi>Nuncio</hi> ſate, and
to turn his Back to the Altar, than to loſe the
Opportunity of imparting ſomething with which, in
all probability, he long'd to entertain him. After the
Maſs was ended, the <hi>Doge</hi> and Nobles return'd
in the ſame Order as before, to the Palace of
S. <hi>Mark,</hi> where they were regal'd by the New
Procurator with a ſplendid Collation of <hi>Wax,</hi> for
ſo it might be properly call'd, ſince moſt of the
Diſhes contain'd nothing elſe. The whole Table
was cover'd with Trophies, Confections, Turky-Cocks,
Partridges, and Fruits repreſented in Wax,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:51983:215"/>
excepting two or three Places where there were
Diſhes of good and delicious Victuals: For the
<hi>Italian</hi> Cooks are at leaſt as skilful as ours. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſaw People eat more heartily than theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and I'm apt to believe that their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
of ſerving up the Diſhes ſingly might ſharpen
their Appetite; for 'tis certain that the very ſight
of a full Table cloys the Stomach. Yet I cou'd
not forbear telling one of the Company, that
this manner of Entertainment, and eſpecially the
Feaſt of Trophies was very odd and ridiculous: But
the Perſon to whom I addreſt my ſelf, made a ſhift
to anſwer my Objection by pretending that they
obſerv'd this Method to avoid the trouble of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
ſo large a Table ſeveral times, which cou'd not
be done without Confuſion.</p>
               <p>That and the two following Days were ſpent
in rejoycing; The Streets were full of People in
Maſquerade, and the Merchants expos'd their rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Commodities. There was nothing to be ſeen
in the Shops but Brocado's of Gold and Silver,
Galoons, Fringes, and Ribbons; Sonnets in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Procurator were ſcatter'd about by
Thouſands, and Prints of him every where hung
out. At Night there were great Illuminations at
his Palace, and at that of S. <hi>Mark;</hi> and the
whole City in the general ſeem'd to be full of
Joy; tho' 'tis certain the Pomp wou'd have been
much greater if the Magiſtrates, to whom the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation
of ſuch Ceremonies does properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
had not publiſh'd an Order three Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to moderate the Expence of the Solemnity:
For otherwiſe the whole City wou'd have been
illuminated, the Ladies wou'd have adorn'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with Pearls and Jewels, all the Lacqueys
wou'd have appear'd in Liveries, and the Canal
wou'd have been cover'd with magnificent <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dola's,</hi>
embelliſh'd with Flaggs and Streamers, and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:51983:215"/>
fill'd with Conſorts of Muſick. Beſides the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator's
Friends wou'd have ſignaliz'd their Joy
in a particular manner, by Feaſts, Illuminations,
and Fire-Works: But all this Pageantry was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by a poſitive Order from the above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
Tribunal. At the ſame time, another Edict
was publiſh'd, which concerns all Perſons in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and is only a Repetition of thoſe Regulations
that were formerly made on ſuch Occaſions. By
this laſt Order all <hi>Venetians,</hi> whether Nobles
or Citizens, are prohibited to wear any ſort of
Stuff, embroider'd Fringe or Galoon, of Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Steel, or any thing that ſhines or caſts a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre.
The ſame Edict forbids Lace, new Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Cloaths, Liveries, and the Painting or
Adorning of <hi>Gondola's;</hi> and reſtrains the Women
from uſing Gold or Silver Ribbons, and from wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above three Rows of Fringes or Lace on their
Pettycoats, and even thoſe Ornaments muſt only
be worn on the Fore-part of the Pettycoat. But
thoſe who are call'd Novices are allow'd, during
the two firſt Years of their Noviciate, to wear a
String of Pearls, and a Gold Fringe about their
Pettycoats. The Novices are ſuch as are newly
married.</p>
               <p>All Strangers are excus'd from complying with
this Order for ſix Months after the Day of their
Arrival; but aſſoon as that time is expir'd, they
muſt ſubmit to the Cuſtom as well as the Natives,
unleſs they belong to the Retinue of an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour;
tho' Offences of this Nature are rarely
puniſh'd.</p>
               <p>When I conſider the extreme Eagerneſs with
which the Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> contend for the Ducal
Dignity, I cannot forbear reflecting on the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Humane Nature, which expoſes us to the
moſt fatal Deluſions, and prompts us to court the
dazzling Appearances of Grandeur, tho' we are
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:51983:216"/>
convinc'd of the Vanity of that Enjoyment in
which we ſeem to place our Happineſs. For, in
my Opinion, the Condition of a ſimple <hi>Senatour</hi> is
infinitely more happy than that of the <hi>Doge.</hi>
He is permitted to enjoy the Pleaſure of Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to viſit his Friends, and to go to the <hi>Opera</hi>
and <hi>Ridotti.</hi> He is not perpetually watch'd, and
haunted Night and Day by a Multitude of Spies,
under the Name of Counſellours; nor is he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to give an exact Account of his Actions. But
the <hi>Doge</hi> is a gawdy Slave loaded with Fetters,
which are not the leſs heavy becauſe they are gilded:
And his Authority extends no farther, than to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
ſome Officers of the Palace, and to create
ſome <hi>Knights of S. Mark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Order of Knighthood may be divided into
three <hi>Claſſes</hi> or Ranks. The <hi>Firſt</hi> comprehends the
<hi>Knights of the Golden Star,</hi> who are all Noble <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians,</hi>
that owe their Dignity to their Merit, and
wear a <hi>Star</hi> border'd with a Gold Galoon. The
<hi>Second</hi> Rank conſiſts of the <hi>Knights of S. Mark,</hi>
who are call'd <hi>Knights of the Senate:</hi> And this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is uſually conferr'd as a Recompence, on Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels,
and even ſometimes on Captains, who have
ſignaliz'd their Bravery in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or render'd ſome important Services to the
Republic. The Captain-General recommends
the Perſon to the Senate, who, if the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loting
run in his Favour, receives the Order, and
with it a Penſion of at leaſt a Thouſand Ducats
a Year. Theſe Knights wear a Medal at one of
their Button-holes, with the Figure of S. <hi>Mark</hi>
on one Side, and a Device on the Reverſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Pleaſure of the Senate. They are
honour'd with the Title of <hi>Illuſtriſſimo,</hi> and are much
reſpected: but the Dignity is indifferently beſtow'd
upon all, whether Noble or Ignoble, <hi>Venetians</hi> or
Foreigners. The <hi>Third</hi> and laſt Rank is made up
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:51983:216"/>
of the <hi>Doge's Knights,</hi> who confers the Honour
on whom he pleaſes, and oftentimes on thoſe
who never wore a Sword; for any Man may
purchaſe the Title of <hi>Illuſtriſſimo</hi> at the Rate of a
Hundred <hi>Sequins,</hi> which, if I am not miſtaken,
is the uſual Price of this Dignity. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Lowneſs of the Rate, the <hi>Doge</hi> finds
but few Cuſtomers; for the <hi>Italians</hi> are not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fond
of ſo unprofitable Honour. So that this <hi>Claſſis</hi>
of Knights conſiſts chiefly of Foreign Officers, who
receive ſome Benefit by the Title; ſince it not
only procures 'em a more than ordinary Reſpect,
but confirms 'em in the Poſſeſſion of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
               <p>Since the mentioning of theſe Officers puts me in
mind of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army, I ſhall take this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to give you ſome Account of the Forces
that are maintain'd by the Republick. The total
Number of the Soldiers both at Land and Sea,
hardly amounts to Four and twenty thouſand; and
of theſe there are uſually Twelve or Fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
in the Field. The <hi>Captain-General,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
'em, is always a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> and has
under him a <hi>General of the Land-Forces, Lieutenant-Generals,</hi>
and <hi>Sergeant-Majors,</hi> who are almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>always
Foreigners; for the Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> are not
very ambitious of Military Employments. 'Tis
true, they cannot be accus'd of Want of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
but ſince a Soldier muſt ſerve his Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip
with his Muſquet on his Shoulder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can attain to any Perfection in his Art,
they cannot endure to think of ſtooping ſo low:
and even there is hardly one of 'em that wou'd not
think it beneath him to accept a Captain's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
The <hi>Soldiers</hi> are for the moſt part Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
as well as the <hi>Generals;</hi> for, except three
or four ſmall <hi>Italian</hi> Regiments, which are not
much eſteem'd, the reſt of the Army conſiſts ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:51983:217"/>
of <hi>Germans,</hi> or <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> whom they call <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montani.</hi>
The Pay of Foreigners is double to that
which is allow'd to the <hi>Italians;</hi> and no Captain muſt
receive a Soldier of another Nation into his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
under Pain of being caſhier'd without Remiſſion.
But the ſame Order is not obſerv'd in the <hi>Italian</hi>
Regiments, for any Man may be admitted to
ſerve in 'em. And ſince the Foreign Captains
wou'd be at a Loſs for want of Men, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public
takes care to ſupply 'em with Recruits:
Only they muſt be very cautious in preventing
the Deſertion of their Men; for when a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is extremely diminiſh'd, the Captain is always
<hi>reform'd,</hi> and the Soldiers ſerve to recruit the reſt
of the Regiment. I know ſeveral Officers, who
loſt their Places by Misfortunes of this Nature;
which ſometimes cannot be avoided, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>French,</hi> who deſert by Hundreds at a
time. If it were not for this only Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
I ſhou'd have a very good Opinion of the
<hi>Venetian</hi> Service; for a Foreign <hi>Captain</hi> has no leſs
than a <hi>Hundred</hi> Ducats a Month, which makes
<hi>Two hundred and fifty French</hi> Livres; a <hi>Lieutenant</hi> has
<hi>Thirty,</hi> and an <hi>Enſign Twenty five.</hi> Beſides there
is not a Place in the World where a Soldier has
a nearer Proſpect of Advancement; for ſince the
Army is not very Numerous, and the Noble <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
never pretend to Military Preferments, a
Stranger has a fair Opportunity of raiſing his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
So that a <hi>Captain</hi> muſt either be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unfortunate, or negligent in the Performance
of his Duty, if his Service be not rewarded with
a <hi>Colonel</hi>'s Commiſſion, or even with more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Preferment. The Army is full of <hi>Sergeant-Majors,</hi>
who owe their Fortune meerly to their
Merit; and there is no Poſt ſo high which a
brave Man may not in time hope to obtain. 'Tis
a wonderful Encouragement to a Young Aſpirer,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:51983:217"/>
to ſee daily ſo many Examples that flatter and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
his Ambition. Beſides their travelling by
Sea frees 'em from the Charge of providing an
Equipage; which is a great Advantage to thoſe
who are not over-ſtock'd with Money. Add to
theſe Conveniencies the free and unconſtrain'd Way
of living <hi>a-la-mode de Venice;</hi> and it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd,
that a Man may eaſily chuſe a leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Employment. I know the World has ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſo bad an Opinion of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Service,
that 'tis uſually the laſt Refuge of thoſe who are
reduc'd to Extremity: Nor am I ignorant that
the Officers are not here on the ſame Foot
as in <hi>France,</hi> and that the meaneſt Scoundrels find
Admittance; but, after all, the Service is not
really leſs advantageous for theſe Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>But, as for the Common Soldiers, their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ſo miſerable, that I wou'd rather chuſe to
ſerve a Tinker, than to carry a Muſquet at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>
Their Pay amounts to no more than <hi>Three
Pence</hi> a Day; and beſides they muſt furniſh their
own Clothes. Judge then what Proviſion they
can make for their Bellies, and whether their
Deſertion can be reckon'd a Fault. Thoſe who
ſerve at Sea have the ſame Pay, and Clothes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bargain; but they muſt buy their Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for they are allow'd only Bread and Water.
There are <hi>Eleven</hi> Ships belonging to the Republic,
commanded by the <hi>Captain-General;</hi> for there is
no <hi>Admiral.</hi> But beſides the little Care that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to keep 'em in Repair, they are ſo defective
in all Reſpects, that they hardly deſerve the Name
of <hi>Ships,</hi> much leſs of <hi>Men of War.</hi> In every Ship
there is a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi>
who pehaps never ſaw a Maſt before his
coming on Board: but he has under him a <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
whom he conſults, or rather ſuffers to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

Theſe Captains (who are uſually old and
expert Pilots) have <hi>Thirty</hi> Ducats a Month beſides
their Entertainment; and may in time be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
to the Command of a Merchant-Ship, if
the Owners think fit to truſt 'em. The <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of <hi>Venice</hi> is <hi>Red,</hi> with a <hi>Lyon</hi> in the Middle,
holding an open <hi>Book</hi> in one of his Paws, with
theſe Words, <hi>Pax tibi, Marce, Evangeliſta meus.</hi>
Many take this <hi>Lyon</hi> for the <hi>Arms</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> but
they are extremely miſtaken; for the <hi>Republic</hi> has
no Coat of Arms, and wou'd be loth to adorn
a Scutcheon with that Sacred Beaſt, whom they
honour as an Emblem of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> or rather that
Evangeliſt himſelf repreſented under the Figure
of a <hi>Lyon.</hi> I knew that Painters uſually give that
Saint a <hi>Lyon</hi> for his Companion; but I cou'd
not believe that the <hi>Venetian Lyon</hi> was the <hi>Saint</hi>
himſelf, till I was convinc'd by the repeated Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations
of ſeveral credible Perſons, and even
of ſome Noblemen; who, to ſatisfie my Scruples,
told me the following Story.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Mark</hi> was a Youth of ſuch exquiſite Beauty,
that his only Siſter fell ſo deſperately in Love
with him, that notwithſtanding all his Holy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
ſhe haunted him Night and Day, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him whitherſoever he went, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
begg'd him to ſatisfie her Paſſion. At laſt
the young Saint perceiving that all his Severity
cou'd not extinguiſh her Criminal Flame, beſought
God to transform him into the moſt hideous
Creature in the World. His Prayer was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and he was inſtantly turn'd to a <hi>Lyon,</hi> whoſe
gaping Mouth, and horrid Roaring, ſo terrify'd his
Siſter, that immediately ſhe fell upon her Knees,
pray'd to God to forgive her, and was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The <hi>Open Book</hi> he holds in his Talons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> of which they pretend to
have the Original in the Treaſury; and the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:51983:218"/>
Words that are written in it are the ſame with
which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaluted him when he came to viſit him
in Priſon.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you'll think that this Story deſerves a
place in <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metamorphoſes;</hi> but I can aſſure
you the <hi>Venetians</hi> are oblig'd to believe it, under
Pain of being accounted <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Sometimes they
repreſent him with, and ſometimes without Wings,
but they ſeldom or never forget to draw Rays
about his Head; and very often the <hi>Doge</hi> is
painted kneeling before him. At leaſt he is
thus repreſented in all the moſt remarkable Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſuch as the Front of the Palace of S.
<hi>Mark,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I'm ſenſible I have already detain'd you too
long, but I muſt not finiſh my Letter before I
have finiſh'd the Account I promis'd to give you
of the <hi>Venetian Nobles.</hi> I had form'd ſo ſtrange
an Idea from the Character I had receiv'd of 'em,
that I look'd upon 'em as the moſt Haughty and
Ill-natur'd Men in the World. And even a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Author has the Confidence to affirm that
one of their uſual Recreations is to affront Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
who ſeem to be Perſons of Note; thruſting 'em
into the Canal as they walk along the Streets,
ſpitting upon 'em at the <hi>Opera,</hi> beating 'em with
flaming Torches, and hiring <hi>Bravo's</hi> to murder
'em. Yet to do Juſtice to that Illuſtrious Body,
I can aſſure you, that I never met with more
civil and obliging Perſons in the World. I have
the Honour to know two or three of 'em, and
perceive daily ſo many conſpicuous Marks of good
Nature in all their Actions, that I cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Indignation, reflect on the Impudence of thoſe
who have ſo unjuſtly blacken'd their Character.
'Tis true, they take Care to maintain the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of their Birth, and their Authority over the
Citizens and the reſt of their Subjects: but they
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:51983:219"/>
are ſo far from inſulting or tyrannizing over
'em, that they are always ready to grant their
Protection to honeſt Men; and as for Strangers,
there is not a City in the World where they meet
with a kinder and more civil Entertainment.
They may do what they pleaſe, for no Man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enquires into, or comments upon their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and when they meet with a Nobleman, they
are treated with all imaginable Marks of Honour
and Civility. There are ſeveral <hi>Coffee-Houſes</hi> under
the <hi>Procuraties,</hi> ſome of which are ſet apart for
the Nobility; and that Order is ſo ſtrictly obſerv'd
that a Citizen never enters into 'em. But if a
Foreigner, who has the Appearance of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
go in to one of theſe Places, all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
that are there begin immediately to careſs
him; and there is not one of 'em who wou'd not
willingly embrace the Offer of his Acquaintance,
provided he belongs not to the Retinue of an
<hi>Ambaſſador:</hi> for they are ſeverely prohibited by
the Laws of the State to entertain any correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with ſuch Perſons.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Bravo's,</hi> I will not pretend to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that <hi>Venice</hi> was never plagu'd with thoſe
barbarous and inhuman Murderers. It muſt be
acknowledg'd that the Senate tolerated theſe Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
too long: There was a time when ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
kept Fifteen or Twenty o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thoſe Ruffians;
and there were others who were ſtill ready to
ſerve any Man in their Way, that is, for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Sequins</hi> wou'd agree to kill a Man, or to break
his Arms for ſuch a Number of <hi>Ducats.</hi> But the
Face of Affairs is wonderfully chang'd ſince that
time, and ſo vaſt a Number of thoſe Villains
have ended their Lives either on a <hi>Gibbet,</hi> or in
the <hi>Galleys,</hi> that the Race of 'em ſeems to be quite
extinct. The <hi>Shirts</hi> of <hi>Mail</hi> that were ſold in
thoſe Days for <hi>Fifty Piſtoles</hi> a-piece, are now ſold
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:51983:219"/>
for <hi>half a Crown</hi> to Fiſhermen, who uſe 'em for
catching Oyſters: For theſe Cautions, that were
once thought ſo neceſſary for preventing ſecret Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinations,
are now become ſo uſeleſs, that one
may walk as ſecure thro' the City by Night as
by Day, and during the <hi>Carnaval</hi> as in <hi>Lent:</hi> At
leaſt I have not yet heard of any Diſord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs ſince
my Arrival. On the contrary, I ſhou'd never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to converſe with a more harmleſs and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
People; and if there are any Inſolencies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
I ſhou'd rather accuſe the <hi>French</hi> as the
Authors of 'em, who in this, as well as in all other
Places, aſſume thoſe Liberties by which they affect
to diſtinguiſh themſelves from other Nations. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I wou'd not adviſe any Man to hunt too bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a Nobleman's Incloſure; for 'tis certain that
there is none of 'em ſo Complaiſant as to ſee his
Wife kiſs'd, without reſenting the Affront, and
that notwithſtanding the ſeeming Extirpation of
the <hi>Bravo's,</hi> the injur'd Nobleman wou'd quickly
find a ſufficient Number of 'em to execute his
Revenge. Their Jealouſie is accompany'd with ſo
implacable a Fury, that they wou'd rather ruine
themſelves and their whole Family, than ſuffer a
bold Intruder into their ſecret Delights to eſcape
unpuniſh'd; and after they had ſacrific'd the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to their Rage, they wou'd infallibly compleat
their Revenge by the Death of her who betray'd
'em. Such Accidents have ſometimes happen'd,
and 'tis to be obſerv'd, that in ſuch Caſes the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
never enquires into the Murder. For every
Nobleman may poiſon his Wife for Adultery, and
cauſe her Gallant to be poniarded, without fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be call'd in queſtion for ſo bloody a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
ſince 'tis ſuppos'd that no Man wou'd have
recourſe to ſuch violent Methods, if he were not
fully convinc'd of his Wife's Infidelity. I confeſs
this way of ſatisfying their Revenge ſeems at firſt
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:51983:220"/>
View to be extremely baſe and unworthy of a Man
of Honour: But you will be the leſs ſurpriz'd at their
manner of Proceeding in theſe Caſes, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that, notwithſtanding their Nobility, 'tis not
their Profeſſion to bear Arms. For they are as
much <hi>Men of the Gown</hi> as the <hi>Preſidents</hi> of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
at <hi>Paris;</hi> and are therefore under a ſort
of Obligation to abſtain from Duels. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſince 'tis not juſt that they ſhou'd tamely ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themſelves to be Cuckolded, they muſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their Vengeance by Proxy, ſince their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
reſtrains em from making their own Hands
the Inſtruments of their Revenge.</p>
               <p>I ſhall in the next place give you a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their <hi>Habit:</hi> They wear a black Gown
exactly like that of a <hi>Minime Friar;</hi> only 'tis
longer, wider, and open before; the Sleeves are
ſo big that they hang down almoſt to the Ground,
and they have a little Collar or Neckband like
that which is us'd by the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi> In the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Gowns are lin'd with a greyiſh Fur,
which reaches a hands-breadth beyond the Cloth,
all along the Breaſt, and are ty'd about with a
Leathern-Girdle, adorn'd with Silver Buckles and
Boſſes. In Summer they uſe neither Girdles nor
Furrs; for they wear their Veſts looſe by reaſon of
the Heat, and line 'em with very thin Taffata:
But they ſtill wear Cloth Gowns of the ſame big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as in Winter. On their Shoulders they wear
a ſort of Bag or Hood of the ſame Cloth, call'd
the <hi>Stole,</hi> 18 or 20 Inches broad, and twice as
long, which is extremely troubleſome. Under
their Gowns they have only a little Doublet, almoſt
quite cover'd with black Lace, and adorn'd with
Ribbans at the turning up of the Sleeves. Their
Shirts are always very white and fine. Their
Breeches are open and very wide, like thoſe that
were us'd by Citizens in <hi>France</hi> Fifty Years ago;
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:51983:220"/>
and they are alſo full of Lace and Ribbans. This
Garb is both ſtately and cheap; for a Gown laſts
at leaſt three or four Years. The only Fault I
find in their Habit is that they uſe neither Bands
nor Cravates. Formerly they were oblig'd to wear
their own Hair, but now they uſe the fineſt and
longeſt Periwigs, which is certainly one of the
moſt neceſſary parts of their Dreſs: for their Caps
are ſo ill-contriv'd, that there can be nothing
more proper to disfigure a Man's Face, which
perhaps is the reaſon why at preſent they only
wear 'em in their Hands like a Fan.</p>
               <p>Theſe Nobles, notwithſtanding the Dignity of
their Character, ſcruple not to go to the Market, and
buy all the little Proviſions that are requir'd for
the maintaining of a Family. But I believe they
are injur'd by thoſe who pretend that they carry
home their Proviſions in the Sleeves of their Gowns;
for there are Porters or <hi>Ceſtarioli,</hi> who have no
other Occupation, and whoſe Hire is ſo ſmall, that
even the meaneſt Tradeſmen make uſe of 'em.
Nor muſt you imagine that the Principal and
Rich Nobles buy their own Proviſions; for the
Markets are only frequented by the poorer ſort of
Gentlemen, of whom there is a conſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and whoſe Condition is the more deplorable,
becauſe they muſt not endeavour to improve it by
Trading.</p>
               <p>I know not what Apology to make for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
Length of my Letter, unleſs you will be
ſatisfy'd with that common Excuſe for all ſorts
of Faults, that I did not intend it. I confeſs that
will not make amends for the trouble I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you, but I hope you'll for once admit a Plea
that can never be more juſtly urg'd than in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of this Nature; for it oftentimes happens, that
when a Man comes to the End of the Leaf
where he deſign'd to have ended his Letter, he
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:51983:221"/>
finds himſelf oblig'd to begin another, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
two or three before he can finiſh his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Have ſeen the famous Ceremony of <hi>Aſcenſion-Day,</hi>
and was ſo tranſported with Pleaſure at
the Sight of that celebrated Solemnity, that I was
ſtrongly tempted, and almoſt fully reſolv'd to ſend
you a Deſcription of it. But upon ſecond and
cooler Thoughts, I conſider'd that I cou'd add
nothing to what ſo many Authors have already
ſaid on that Subject, and therefore I ſhall only tell
you, that the prodigious Quantity of <hi>Gondola's</hi> that
cover'd the whole Surface of the Sea from <hi>Venice</hi> to
the Mouth of the <hi>Lido,</hi> made me almoſt give
Credit to the uſual Computation of the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
who affirm, that there are <hi>Five and twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Gondola's</hi> in the City. The Number of thoſe
little Veſſels might be more eaſily calculated than
that of the Inhabitants; becauſe every <hi>Gondolier</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to pay a certain Tax to the State. The
Dexterity of theſe Boatmen is ſurprizing, and
even almoſt incredible; for tho' they ſeem to fly
as ſwift as a Bird, and tho' the Canals are both
narrow, and in ſeveral Places croſs one another,
they never run foul of thoſe whom they meet.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:51983:221"/>
To avoid the Diſorders that happen on ſuch Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
they make a Noiſe at each Corner of the
Canal to give Warning to thoſe that are within
the reach of their Voice, who anſwer in a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
conſiſting of Words that are only known to
themſelves, ſuch as <hi>Preci, Prami,</hi> and <hi>Sia,</hi> which
they underſtand ſo well, that immediately they
turn their <hi>Gondola's,</hi> and paſs by without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another. Theſe <hi>Gondola's,</hi> which are all
made after the ſame Faſhion, from that which
belongs to the firſt Procurator to thoſe that are
commonly hir'd, are a ſort of flat-bottom'd, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and very long Boats. In the middle there is
a little Chamber cover'd with courſe black Serge,
with an Opening before inſtead of a Door; and
on each Side there is a Window that may be
ſhut with Curtains, or ſometimes with a Piece of
the ſame Serge which hangs at the Top of the
<hi>Gondola,</hi> and is uſually turn'd up in fair Weather.
The Price of a <hi>Gondola</hi> ready made amounts to
five and twenty <hi>Ducats;</hi> but in thoſe that belong
to ſome of the principal Noblemen, there are
Grates that ſometimes coſt above a Hundred
Crowns; and beſides, the Windows may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
with Glaſſes like thoſe that are us'd on
Coaches; which is all the Embelliſhment that is
allow'd by the Republick. The meaneſt <hi>Gondolier</hi>
earns half a <hi>Ducat</hi> a Day; and there are ſome
who will not ſerve under a Crown: So that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that every <hi>Gondola</hi> requires four Men, it
will be found at the End of the Reckoning that
one of theſe Boats conſumes as much Money as
the keeping of a Coach and Six Horſes.</p>
               <p>The Ceremony of the <hi>Bucentaur,</hi> according to
the uſual Cuſtom, was ſucceeded by a very mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Feaſt, that laſted Fifteen Days. This may
be reckon'd a ſecond <hi>Carnaval,</hi> and does really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the firſt. 'Tis true, there are no <hi>Opera</hi>'s nor
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:51983:222"/>
                  <hi>Comedies,</hi> but that Defect is more than ſupply'd
by the enlivening Beauty of the Seaſon, and by
one of the fineſt and richeſt <hi>Fairs</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> which
is kept in the Place of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and in the <hi>Brog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi>
where the Shops are rank'd with ſuch a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
Proportion and Uniformity, that one
wou'd think it were a City purpoſely built for
Pleaſure. The Street of the <hi>Goldſmiths,</hi> and that
of the <hi>Mercers</hi> are extremely magnificent; for the
Shops are full of the richeſt Commodities, and
every Morning and Evening one may have the
Pleaſure to ſee the beſt Company in Town, and
eſpecially the Ladies, who come to oblige the
longing Spectators with a View of their Charms,
and to make Strangers confeſs that they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
furniſh'd with the nobleſt Ornament of their
Sex than all the moſt celebrated Beauties in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countries. And I cannot forbear adding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Occaſion, that the Liberty I obſerv'd in
this Place ſeems to be altogether inconſiſtent with
the Slavery which theſe fair ones are ſaid to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.
'Tis certain that the Ladies in this Place are
more cloſely confin'd than in <hi>France;</hi> but their
Reſtraint is not ſo ſevere as we commonly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
'Tis true, 'twou'd be thought indecent for
a Woman to walk, or to entertain a private Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with thoſe of our Sex; nor is it uſual for
Ladies to make Matches for Gaming. But to
make amends for theſe Niceties, they are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ſee <hi>Opera's</hi> and <hi>Plays,</hi> to go to the <hi>Ridotti,</hi>
the <hi>Freſco,</hi> and <hi>Fairs,</hi> and to walk about the
Streets in <hi>Maſquerade,</hi> either alone or in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
I leave you to judge whether their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
be ſo rigorous as 'tis uſually repreſented,
and whether they have reaſon to complain of the
Severity of their Husbands. For my part, I'm apt
to think that there are few Men in <hi>France</hi> or
<hi>Holland</hi> that wou'd willingly allow their Wives the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:51983:222"/>
Liberty to go abroad without any other Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
than one or two Maids, and after they have
run Maſqu'd about the Streets all Day long, to pop
into a publick Gaming-Houſe, where there are
more Courteſans than any other Company. This
is the uſual Recreation of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ladies,
which they daily uſe without expoſing themſelves
to their Husband's Anger, or the Cenſure of their
Neighbours; tho' in ſuch Frolicks they meet with
many a fair Opportunity of indulging themſelves
in more criminal Diverſions; for they are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
ſurrounded with Temptations, and 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for a Lady to ramble about a whole Day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hearing Twenty Compliments of that Nature.
'Tis the Cuſtom of the Place, and the particular
Privilege both of the <hi>Carnaval</hi> and <hi>Fair,</hi> that any
Man may demand the <hi>laſt Favour</hi> of a Woman
whom he finds alone in a Vizor-Mask; for that
Circumſtance alone gives her the Denomination
of <hi>Signora Maſcara,</hi> and ſhe's reckon'd as lawful
Prize as if ſhe were cloath'd in the obſceneſt and
moſt extravagant Garb. You may freely accoſt
any Woman that wears this Badge, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off your Hat, or uſing any other Ceremony
whatſoever; but if they return no Anſwer to
your ſecond or third Queſtion, you may leave off
your Courtſhip, and conclude that they will not
be debauch'd. Nevertheleſs 'tis highly dangerous
to uſe the ſame Freedom with a Lady that walks
without a Mask; for in ſuch Caſes we are only
allow'd the Privilege of Gazing and Wiſhing,
and all other Liberties are ſo rigorouſly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the higheſt Affront that can be offer'd
to a Woman, is to ſalute her; for none but Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans
will permit that Freedom.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Maſquerades</hi> are not only very diverting, but
extremely commodious for ſeveral ſorts of People.

How many Princes, Dukes, Procurators, and other
Perſons of high Quality, take the Advantage of ſo
ſavourable an Occaſion to ſhake off that Load of
Grandeur with which they are continually op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd;
and breaking looſe from their gawdy
Priſons, ramble about <hi>Incognito</hi> among the Crowd,
and find more Pleaſure in perſonating a Citizen
or Tradeſman, than ever they cou'd enjoy in
their Palaces. For a <hi>Mask</hi> has this admirable
Quality, that it can in a Moment transform a
Prince into a Porter; and one of the greateſt
Advantages of ſuch a ſurprizing <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> is,
that every Man may reſume his own Figure when
he pleaſes. If we may believe the <hi>Venetians,</hi> a
certain Great Prince, who is known over all the
World, ſcrupl'd not to act a part in theſe agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Frolicks.</p>
               <p>The whole <hi>Carnaval,</hi> and the Feſtival after <hi>Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Day</hi>
is ſpent in <hi>Maſquerading,</hi> and all that while there
ſeems to be a New Republic form'd in the midſt of
the other. There is an univerſal Change in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
Cuſtoms, and Laws. All <hi>Marks</hi> of <hi>Diſtinction</hi> and
<hi>Superiority</hi> are forgotten, or at leaſt neglected; All
Perſons are, or ſeem to be equal: Reſpect, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
Ceremony, Care, and Buſineſs, are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
from Society, and are ſucceeded by Joy,
Liberty, and an agreeable Sort of Folly. Under
this Diſguiſe many pleaſant Intrigues are carry'd
on; and Strangers are oblig'd to that Concealer
of Bluſhes for many a happy Moment. I know
one that was accoſted by a Lady, who carry'd
him to a little Houſe; where, having open'd the
Door with a Key that ſhe had in her Pocket,
ſhe put him in Poſſeſſion of a thouſand
charming Beauties; yet all his Arguments and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:51983:223"/>
cou'd not procure him a ſight of her Face;
for her Mask was ty'd on with a Silver Chain
faſten'd with a little Padlock. But the ſtrangeſt
<hi>Maſcara</hi> that ever I had occaſion to ſee, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
that ever appear'd in <hi>Venice,</hi> was a Woman
who came to the Fair, cover'd from Head to
Foot with a ſort of long Gown or Shroud. She
had no Clothes under it, not ſo much as a
Smock, and from time to time ſhe open'd her Gown,
and oblig'd the Company with a full View of her
Wares. Thus ſhe walk'd three or four times about
the Fair, and was doubtleſs very narrowly and
attententively view'd by the Spectators. This Frol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
was thought to be occaſion'd by a Wager.</p>
               <p>During the Fair, the whole Place of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and
part of the <hi>Broglio,</hi> is cover'd with Shops: The
other part is full of <hi>Juglers, Tumblers, Puppet-Players,
Bears,</hi> and <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> who are <hi>dancing</hi>
frequented by all ſorts of People, from the <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
to the <hi>Gondelier.</hi> But the greateſt Croud is
about certain <hi>Female-Aſtrologers,</hi> who are mounted
on little Stages or Scaffolds, cover'd with Lace and
Ribbons like Puppets; their Faces painted white and
red, and ſurrounded with a great Number of Books,
full of Figures and Characters, tho' they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
no more of 'em than to diſtinguiſh the
White from the Black. There are alſo ſome Men
who follow the ſame Trade; but they are not
ſo much follow'd as the Women, whoſe triple
Top-knots draw the Multitude after 'em. They
ſit upon a Chair, from whence, as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>from a <hi>Tripos,</hi>
they blow good Fortune to their Cuſtomers thro'
a Tin Trunk eight or ten Foot long, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt
putting the other End to his Ear. The Price
of a Conſultation is no more than <hi>Five-pence;</hi>
and for ſo ſmall a Summ you may have the
Promiſe of as much Honour and Riches as you
pleaſe. Theſe Wenches, who ſometimes are not
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:51983:224"/>
ugly, obſerve an admirable Gravity in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their <hi>Reſponſes;</hi> but they are not ſo ſtarch'd
in private, and may be eaſily prevail'd with to
lay aſide their affected Severity. One of my
Friends, who is a <hi>Germain</hi> Officer, happen'd t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Day to try the Experiment; and ſince the
Story is not unpleaſant, I ſhall make bold to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
you with it. As we were taking our
Diverſion in the Fair, we took particular Notice
of one of thoſe <hi>She-Aſtrologers,</hi> who was one of the
prettyeſt and graveſt of the whole Tribe. She
was ſurrounded with a Croud of People of all
Ages and Ranks, who approach'd one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the End of her Trunk to learn their Fate,
and to hear the Oraculous Sentences which ſhe
pronounc'd with an incredible Majeſty and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
My Friend took his Turn among the reſt,
and after ſhe had acquainted him with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
told her that he was deſirous to conſult
her about ſome private Affair, and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
her to turn the other End of the Trunk,
that he might communicate his Secret to her
without diſcloſing it to the Company. But inſtead
of propoſing ſome Queſtions to her about his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
he told her thro' her Trunk, that he came
not to deſire the Aſſiſtance of her pretended Art,
which ſerv'd only to amuſe the Vulgar; that 'twas
in her Power to grant him a more ſolid Favour;
and that his Buſineſs was to enquire where and
when he might ſpend a Night with her. Aſſoon
as ſhe had heard his Propoſal, ſhe turn'd the
Trunk and reply'd, that he ought not to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at her way of Living, by impoſing upon
the Credulity of the People, ſince the only Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation
of the greateſt part of Mankind conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in cheating one another, every one in his
own Way, and according to the Nature of his
Employment; and that for her part ſhe thought
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:51983:224"/>
five or ſix Crowns a day but a moderate Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for the Pains ſhe took in deceiving thoſe that
were willing to be deceiv'd; adding however that
ſhe was glad ſhe had found a Man of Senſe, that
knew the Infirmities of Humane Nature, and wou'd
laugh with her at the Follies of Mankind, and
concluded with giving him an Aſſignation at an
Inn, where ſhe promis'd to meet him that Evening.
Her agreeable Humour furniſh'd us with Matter of
Diſcourſe for above an Hour; but this was
the End of the Adventure, for the Officer did not
think fit to drive the Jeſt further.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Summer is ſcarce begun, the Heat is
already ſo violent, that every one endeavours to
make it leſs inſupportable by the Thinneſs and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Clothes. Now I ſpeak of Habits, I
wiſh you cou'd ſee that which is us'd by the
Girls that viſit the Fair every Day to look out
for a Cuſtomer. For every Mother that is willing
to be rid of her Daughter, carries her thither
every Day as to a Market, with all the alluring
Ornaments of an advantageous Dreſs. They have
large and very fine Top-knots; their Neck and
Breaſts are bare; and their Habit conſiſts chiefly
of a little Cloak or Mantle of white Muſlin, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
with red Ribbons, a ſingle Petticoat of
the ſame Cloth, a neat Pair of Shooes and Silk-Stockins,
exactly fitted to their Legs. There is
nothing more proper to inſpire Love than the ſight
of thoſe young Creatures, who for the moſt part
are charming Beauties; nor is a Man forc'd to
purchaſe his Happineſs at the Rate of a tedious
Courtſhip; for aſſoon as he feels Nature begin to
work, he may immediately addreſs himſelf to the
Mother, who is always ready to make the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
But tho' it will not coſt you a Sigh to
gain your Miſtreſs's Heart, you muſt pay dear for
the Enjoymnent of her Perſon: for you cannot
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:51983:225"/>
purchaſe a handſome Maiden-Girl under 150
Crowns in hand, and as much every Year for
Entertainment. For 200 you may have the Choice
of the Market, where you may find ſome that
look like little Angels. Nor are you oblig'd to
buy a Pig in a Poke; for you may view and
handle her as much as you will, and examine
your Commodity both with your Eyes and Hands
before you agree upon the Price. As for the
Maiden-head, if the Mother promiſe to warrant
it, you may depend upon her word: for theſe
Matrons are too conſcientious to impoſe ſecond-hand
Goods upon a Cuſtomer; and beſides they
dare not venture upon a Cheat which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
may be ſo eaſily diſcover'd. For 'tis as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to root this Opinion out of the Minds
of the <hi>Italians,</hi> as of the <hi>Oriental</hi> Nations; and
whether it be true or falſe, 'tis attended with this
advantageous Conſequence, that it makes the young
Women very careful of preſerving their Treaſure,
ſince they believe it impoſſible to conceal the Loſs
of it; at leaſt it has this Effect on thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to marry. But they who pretend only to be kept
are not ſo nice, for tho' they take care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their Maiden-head, they never ſcruple to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a Man all the Liberties that can be us'd
without deflowring 'em. I know a Woman that
has three Daughters; the two Eldeſt are public</p>
               <p>Courtezans, but the Third, who is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pretty, is ſtill<note n="*" place="margin">A Maid.</note> 
                  <hi>una Putta, una Vergine,</hi>
tho' ſhe has lain perhaps with a Hundred Men.
Yet ſhe is really a Maid, and wou'd not ſell
her Maiden-head a Farthing under Two hundred
Crowns. I cannot leave this Subject without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Notice of the extravagant Opinion of the
<hi>Italians,</hi> concerning one of the Properties of a
Beautiful Woman. Inſtead of little, hard, and
well-ſeparated Breaſts, they love to have 'em
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:51983:225"/>
large and fleſhy; ſo that when they put their
Hand into the Boſom of a Maid whom they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to purchaſe, if ſhe be not ſo well provided
as they commonly deſire, ſhe is forc'd to make
ſome pretty Excuſe, or to tell 'em laughing, That
<hi>ſhe has lent her Bubbies to her little Siſter, or has
plaid 'em away at Baſſette.</hi> And even when a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
meets with ſuch Girls, and tells 'em that he
is no Admirer of fleſhy Breaſts, they uſually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<hi>Ay, Sir, you are pleas'd to ſay ſo; but if they
were larger you wou'd like 'em better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will be apt to look upon this Way of
buying Girls as very odd and extravagant; but
I'm confident you will be no leſs ſurpriz'd at
the Relation of an Adventure that happen'd to
one of my Friends, who is a <hi>French</hi> Officer late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
return'd from the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army. I remember
I promis'd you the Story, and I'm reſolv'd to
keep my Word, tho' I muſt run the Hazard of
giving you an ill Opinion of my Friend's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity.</p>
               <p>During our Confinement in the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> we
had no other Recreation, but what we found in
converſing with the <hi>Prior,</hi> who is a very accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd
Perſon: You may eaſily divine the uſual
Subject of our Diſcourſe. We hardly talk'd of any
thing but the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ladies, of whoſe Beauty and
Gracefulneſs he gave us ſo lively a Deſcription,
that his feeling Expreſſions made a very ſtrong Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
on the Officer's Mind. Then he proceeded
to tell us, that we might eaſily ſatisfie our Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to Love in this great City, without expoſing
our ſelves to the Cenſures of a Critical and Ill-natur'd
World. In ſhort, my Friend was ſo charm'd
with his agreeable Converſation, and ſo well pleas'd
with the Hope he gave him, that he cou'd not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
proteſting and repeating his Proteſtations more
than once, that he wou'd not leave the City
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:51983:226"/>
without taſting the <hi>Dear Delight.</hi> His Guardian,
who never left him, and had often heard us talk
on that Subject, concluded that he had met with
a Man fit for his Purpoſe, that is, one who wou'd
ſpare no Coſt to indulge his Inclination to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
Reſolving then to make the beſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of ſo promiſing an Opportunity, he took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to talk with him in private two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Departure, and told him with a great
deal of Confidence, that perceiving him to be a
great Admirer of handſome Women; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he wou'd probably meet with ſome in
that great City whither he was going, he thought
himſelf oblig'd to admoniſh him of the dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
that frequently attended the Raſhneſs of
an unexperienc'd Adventurer upon an unknown
Coaſt; ſince thoſe who ſeem to be very ſound
and beautiful, are oftentimes mere lewd and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Strumpets. But, added he, if you will truſt
my Honeſty, and lodge at my Houſe, which is
both very neat and civil, I have an only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who has as much Beauty as any Lady in <hi>Venice;</hi>
her I'll beſtow upon you, and warrant her as
ſound and clean as a Pearl, as I hope in the
moſt holy <hi>Madona.</hi> Then the Officer ask'd
him whether ſhe was a <hi>Maid,</hi> and he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ingenuouſly acknowledg'd that ſhe was
not, and that ſhe was kept by a <hi>Venetian</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman,
who allow'd her a<note n="*" place="margin">200 Crowns.</note> hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>Sequins</hi> a Year: but, continu'd
he, tho' ſhe has hitherto obſerv'd an inviolable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to her Keeper, I have ſo ſtrong an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to make you my Friend, that I'm reſolv'd to
give her to you, and I'm confident you'll be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
with her Perſon when you ſee her. My
Friend conſidering that at <hi>Venice</hi> a Man that loves
to keep himſelf clean and neat, muſt not take a
Lodging at a Public Houſe of Entertainment, and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:51983:226"/>
not knowing where to find a convenient Lodging,
accepted his Guardian's Offer, and went to his
Houſe, where he took a very neat Room, and
agreed both for Diet and Lodging at a very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Rate. The next Morning his Landlord
carry'd him to his Daughter, who had a very mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Apartment, conſiſting of three fine Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
on a Floor, adorn'd with large Looking-Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Cupboard and Scrutores of <hi>China,</hi> with two
Maids in a very handſome Garb to attend her. My
Friend was doubtleſs extremely well ſatisfy'd with
every thing he ſaw, and eſpecially with the lovely
<hi>Donna,</hi> who was one of the moſt charming Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the World: But his Satisfaction laſted not
long, for when he came to talk of the Price, ſhe
ask'd four times as much as he was able or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give her; ſo that after two hours Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
he was forc'd to leave her without conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Bargain. Yet he continues ſtill to lodge
at her Father's Houſe, who profeſſes as much
Friendſhip to him as ever. He told me that he
obſerv'd one Piece of Furniture in the Young
Lady's Chamber that was very ſuitable to one of
her Profeſſion. 'Twas a very large Couch cover'd
with a Quilt of black Sattin, and directly over it
there hung at the Cieling one of thoſe <hi>Fans</hi>
which I had occaſion to mention in one of my
former Letters. She confeſs'd that this was her
Lover's Contrivance, to qualifie the extreme Heat
of the Weather, which is never more inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than when one is already ſufficiently heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the eager Recreations of Love. And ſhe
aſſur'd him that the all Nobles have ſuch Fans
in their Houſes.</p>
               <p>Of all the Cuſtoms that are peculiar to the
<hi>Italians,</hi> I know none that ſeems odder and more
incommodious than that of lying ſtark-naked in
their Beds, which is generally obſerv'd by Men,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:51983:227"/>
Women, Boys, and Girls; and notwithſtanding
the Indecency of ſuch a Cuſtom, the moſt baſhful
Virgin never ſcruples to ſtrip her ſelf to a ſtate of
pure Nature on her Wedding Night, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an <hi>Eve</hi> to her new <hi>Adam.</hi> 'Tis true, moſt
Perſons of Quality lie as we do, tho' there are
ſeveral even of that Rank, who follow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Faſhion.</p>
               <p>The Curtezans enjoy here no leſs Liberty than
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and are divided into two diſtinct Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
The firſt conſiſts of ſuch as are kept by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Perſons, ſuch as the Guardian's Daughter;
and theſe are ſo far from being imputed infamous
or contemptible, that they are envy'd by their
Companions, and are eſteem'd (as they ſay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
if not <hi>Donne Honorate,</hi> at leaſt <hi>Donne de
propoſito.</hi> And beſides, they have this Advantage,
that they can eaſily find a Husband after they
have gain'd Seven or Eight hundred <hi>Ducats;</hi> for
moſt Tradeſmen are extremely fond of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Fortunes. The other ſort of Curtezans
are ſuch as proſtitute themſelves to all Comers, and
expoſe their Bodies indifferently to all ſorts of
Perſons. And even theſe, tho' they muſt for ever
deſpair of retrieving their Honour by Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
diſown the Name of <hi>Putane,</hi> and call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>Donne d'amore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the extraordinary Kindneſs
and Beauty of the Women, the <hi>Venetians</hi> are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſo brutiſh, that they wou'd rather chuſe a
Boy, tho' as ugly as an Ape, than the moſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
Girl in the World. This is the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Vice of the Nation, with which they are
ſo miſerably intoxicated, that they ſpare no Pains
or Coſt to ſatisfie their beaſtly Paſſions: And even
ſome of 'em are ſuch Prodigies of Infamy, and
have ſo entirely loſt all ſenſe of Humanity, that
they turn <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ccubus's</hi> to <hi>Porters</hi> and <hi>Gondoliers,</hi> whom
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:51983:227"/>
they hire to act that Filthineſs upon their polluted
Bodies. All their Converſations are larded with
thoſe deteſtable Impurities; and as in <hi>France</hi> 'tis
the uſual Cuſtom of young Perſons to divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with talking of their Intrigues with a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Miſtreſs, their Diſcourſes in this Place run per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
on their Maſculine Amours. Nor are the
<hi>Turks,</hi> themſelves more addicted to this unnatural
Abomination than the <hi>Italians</hi> ſeem to be. The
<hi>Monks,</hi> eſpecially, are infamous for <hi>Sodomy</hi> as well
as <hi>Whoredom;</hi> and perhaps not without reaſon, for
tho' I am not ſo particularly acquainted with
their manner of Living, as to give you an exact
Account of their Cuſtoms and Practice, I can
aſſure you (and one ſight of their Convents wou'd
convince you) that they aſſume a great deal more
Liberty than their Brethren in <hi>France.</hi> About
ſome Weeks ago I viſited the Convent of S. <hi>Joan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
Paolo,</hi> to ſee the fine Pictures with which 'tis
adorn'd, eſpecially that of S. <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> by <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
which is eſteem'd one of the moſt finiſh'd
Pieces in the World; and that of the <hi>Laſt Supper,</hi>
at the bottom of the <hi>Refectory.</hi> After I had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
my Curioſity with a View of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Pictures, they ſhow'd me the Apartment
of one of the Fathers, which certainly merits the
particular Obſervation of every curious Traveller;
for I muſt confeſs I ſhou'd have rather fanſy'd it
to be the Reſidence of a Cardinal than the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of a ſolitary Friar. It conſiſts of three
ſmall Pavilions, rank'd in a ſtreight Line, each of
which contains two Chambers and a Hall. They
are ſeparated by two Gardens, planted with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range-Trees,
and divided into ſeveral Borders or
Beds of Flowers, adorn'd with Buſts and Statues.
'Tis true, there is no Water; but that defect is
ſupply'd by a very fine Perſpective, repreſenting
a Fountain at the end of a long Walk, border'd
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:51983:228"/>
with Trees. And this artificial Fountain is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
from the firſt Pavilion thro' the ſecond,
which is pierc'd and left open for that Purpoſe.
The Beauty of the Chambers is ſutable to that
of the Garden; and to conclude, there are few
Places in the World leſs fit to inſpire a Man
with Thoughts of Mortification and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>I muſt not finiſh my Letter without giving you
ſome Account of the <hi>Opera's</hi> and <hi>Comedies,</hi> which
may be reckon'd one of the principal Diverſions
of the <hi>Carnaval.</hi> All the Beauty of the <hi>Opera's</hi>
conſiſts in <hi>Vocal Muſic</hi> and <hi>Machines;</hi> for there is
nothing in the <hi>Habits, Dancing,</hi> and even in the
<hi>Plays</hi> themſelves, that merits a particular Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And, generally ſpeaking, they are much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to thoſe that are repreſented at <hi>Paris;</hi> for tho'
the <hi>French</hi> muſt acknowledge themſelves indebted
to the <hi>Venetians</hi> for their <hi>Opera's,</hi> 'tis certain that in
this, as well as in ſeveral other Caſes, they have
ſurpaſs'd their Maſters. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Muſic does
not pleaſe all ſorts of Ears; ſome diſlike the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of their exceſſive Quavering, which made
one ſay, That they ſeem'd to contend with Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingales,
who ſhou'd be moſt admir'd for the Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of their Throats. But I muſt confeſs I'm
of another Opinion, and I'm ſo charm'd by the
melodious Accents of a fine <hi>Italian</hi> Voice, that I
can hardly forbear crying out with the <hi>Venetians,
I'm loſt, I faint, I die.</hi> 'Tis true, thoſe agreeable
Tranſports I uſually feel on ſuch Occaſions, are
purely occaſion'd by the <hi>Muſic,</hi> and by the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Voice,</hi> without any regard to the <hi>Words,</hi>
which are ſo far from contributing to the Delight
of the Hearer, that he ought not to give the leaſt
attention to 'em; ſince the <hi>Italian</hi> way of ſinging
is extremely unſuitable to tragical Subjects: For
what Impreſſion wou'd it make upon your Mind
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:51983:228"/>
to hear an <hi>Orlando Furioſo,</hi> or a deſpairing <hi>Atis,</hi>
warble out the terrible Paſſions with which they
are agitated, in a perpetual Quavering for a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an Hour together? Wou'd you not imagine
that thoſe Actors deſign'd to ridicule the paſſionate
Lovers whom they pretend to repreſent? This puts
me in mind of the Air with which <hi>Harlequin</hi> us'd
to ſing on the Theatre of <hi>Burgundy, Ha! tu vas
trahir malheureuſe,</hi> &amp;c. This, Sir, is the main Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that recommends the <hi>French</hi> Way of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beyond the <hi>Italian;</hi> for the Muſic is made pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
for the Words, and ſo admirably well fitted
to 'em in every reſpect, that the Singing is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive,
and infinitely more touching than the
Words, eſpecially when there is Occaſion to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
a Perſon tranſported with Sorrow, Deſpair,
or Fury. But abſtracting from this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
I'm ſtill of the Opinion, that the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Muſic, ſingly conſider'd, is finer than ours,
and that its Charms are extremely improv'd by
a ſweet and tuneful Voice, which is no Rarity in
this Place.</p>
               <p>There are alſo many different Opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Venetian Comedies;</hi> for I have heard ſeveral
Men of Senſe not only deſpiſe 'em as Trifles, but
abſolutely condemn 'em, as only fit to amuſe the
Eyes and Ears of Footmen and Porters. Others,
on the contrary, are ſo much in love with this
Diverſion, that they wou'd rather chuſe to deprive
themſelves of Meat and Drink, than to loſe their
Share in ſo agreeable a Pleaſure. For my part, I think
theſe Opinions are equally guilty of an Exceſs, and
I ſee no reaſon that ſhou'd oblige us to run to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe oppoſite Extremities. If every thing
that is not properly inſtructive, and does not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
tend to the Advancement of Vertue muſt be
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:51983:229"/>
abſolutely rejected; I confeſs indeed, that the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Comedies</hi> ought to be baniſh'd out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick;
but by the ſame Principle <hi>Masks, Balls,
Turnaments,</hi> and all ſorts of <hi>Games</hi> muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
and the moſt innocent Pleaſures muſt be
reputed criminal. But ſince my Conſcience is not ſo
nice, I muſt own my ſelf ſo much a Friend to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian
Comedies,</hi> that I can eaſily bear with all
their Defects. 'Tis true, they can neither make
us wiſer nor better; but that Fault, if it be one,
is ſufficiently atton'd for by the Pleaſure they give
us. And I have often obſerv'd, that thoſe moroſe
Criticks who talk of nothing but <hi>Edification,</hi> are
the firſt who burſt forth into Laughter, and expreſs
their Satisfaction by clapping their Hands. Yet
there are certain Indecencies which I cou'd wiſh
the <hi>Italian</hi> Poets wou'd avoid; and it were to be
deſir'd, that they had more Regard to the Reſpect
that is due to the Modeſty of Ladies, and to the
Rules of Civility that ought to be obſerv'd between
Man and Man. But after all, I have a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Opinion of the <hi>French</hi> than of the <hi>Italian</hi> Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre:
For I had rather learn to know my ſelf in the
Characters of <hi>Moliere,</hi> than to be an uſeleſs Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator
of the Poſtures of <hi>Harlequin,</hi> or of the
Dreams of Dr. <hi>Balouarde;</hi> tho' if I had a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Opportunity, and knew not how to employ
my Time better, I ſhou'd never ſcruple to laugh
an Hour or two at their diverting Fooleries.</p>
               <p>I had almoſt forgotten to acquaint you with a
pleaſant Cuſtom which is uſually obſerv'd in this
Place at the hearing of <hi>Opera's.</hi> The Female Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
are always applauded at the End of their
Songs; but the Hearers make uſe of different ways
to expreſs their Satisfaction. If they only ſay
<hi>Cara, Cara,</hi> 'tis a ſign they are but indifferently
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:51983:229"/>
pleas'd; but when they are touch'd to the quick,
they fill the whole Theatre with repeated Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
crying as loud as they can, <hi>Mi Moro,
Mi Buto;</hi> and not unfrequently make uſe of ſuch
immodeſt and obſcene Expreſſions, that I dare not
ſo much as repeat 'em.</p>
               <p>In Obedience to your Deſire, I have made it
my Bus'neſs to enquire into the Birth and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of the late Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VIII. You are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform'd
by thoſe who aſſure you that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from a Noble Family: For <hi>John Ottoboni,</hi>
his Great-Grand-Father, was a Merchant, and was
not much taken Notice of at firſt, tho' he afterwards
gain'd a conſiderable Eſtate, which recommended
both him and his Children to the Conſideration
of the Publick. His Eldeſt Son, <hi>John Francis,</hi> was
advanc'd to the Dignity of <hi>Great Chancellor,</hi> the
higheſt Office to which a Citizen can pretend;
for thoſe who are rais'd to that Poſt are honour'd
with the Title of <hi>Excellency,</hi> and wear a <hi>Red Gown.</hi>
His Son <hi>Leonard,</hi> who had already ſerv'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public
as Secretary to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſy, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
as Agent in that Country, was advanc'd
to the ſame Office in the Year 1639. and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
in that Poſt till his Death. He left two Sons,
<hi>Francis,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> who was afterwards made Pope:
<hi>Francis</hi> marry'd, and left a Son call'd <hi>Anthony,</hi>
who is ſtill alive; but <hi>Peter,</hi> who had not yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a Wife, endeavour'd to procure a certain Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
which, notwithſtanding all his earneſt Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
was beſtow'd on another Citizen, whoſe
Family had never been intruſted with the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any Public Affairs: And he was ſo nettl'd
at ſuch an unexpected Diſappointment, that for
mere Vexation he reſolv'd to embrace an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Life. Two or Three Years after, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:51983:230"/>
of <hi>Padua</hi> gave him a Place in his Chapter,
where he continu'd for ſome time; but being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
of an impatient and ambitious Temper, he
ſoon grew weary of that Poſt: And I'm inform'd
that he us'd frequently to tell his Friends that
ſomething whiſper'd perpetually in his Ears, and
bid him go to <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe Suggeſtions flatter'd
his Ambition, and made him ſo uneaſie at <hi>Padua,</hi>
that he left his Place, and went to that Great Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Court, where by his Intrigues, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance,
and Diſſimulation, of which he was an
Abſolute Maſter, he acquir'd ſeveral powerful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
and inſinuated himſelf ſo dexterouſly into
the Favour of the reſt, that in 1652, he obtain'd
a Cardinal's Cap of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> X. and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
made Biſhop of <hi>Breſcia</hi> in the State of
<hi>Venice.</hi> But his Ambition was not ſatisfy'd by ſo
conſiderable a Preferment; for he ſtill continu'd
to manage his Game with ſo much Dexterity and
Succeſs, that at laſt he was advanc'd to the Papal
Throne by the <hi>French</hi> Faction, and by the Intereſt
and Solicitation of Cardinal <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> who to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
his Maſter's Favour, left no Means uneſſay'd
to raiſe this Prelate to the Apoſtolic See. 'Twas
on the 6<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1689, that the Supreme Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
was conferr'd upon him; and his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
occaſion'd a general Satisfaction. <hi>Rome</hi>
thought ſhe had now a Biſhop, who wou'd aim
at nothing ſo much as the Exaltation of the
Church and the Holy See: <hi>France</hi> concluded that
ſhe had at laſt obtain'd a Pope who was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
devoted to her Intereſt: The <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>
hop'd that he wou'd promote the Public Good of
<hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> And <hi>Venice</hi> was over-joy'd to ſee one
of her Citizens in a Condition to raiſe the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Country. In the laſt of theſe Places,
eſpecially, all poſſible Care was taken to expreſs
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:51983:230"/>
the publick Satisfaction with all the Marks of
Splendor and Magnificence: <hi>Anthony</hi> the Pope's
Nephew was honour'd with the Title of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman,
and at the ſame time was made <hi>Knight
of the Golden Star,</hi> and Procurator of S. <hi>Mark by
Merit.</hi> He ſent his two Sons <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> to
<hi>Rome,</hi> where the latter was immediately preferr'd
to an advantageous Match; and the former was
made <hi>Cardinal Patron.</hi> Dignities and Riches were
heap'd without meaſure upon all the reſt of the
Pope's Relations, who ſeem'd, like ſo many Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms,
to ſpring up in a Night. Their ſudden
Advancement gave <hi>Paſquin</hi> occaſion to ſay, That
<hi>his Holineſs had ſignaliz'd his Acceſſion to the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Throne by a Miracle:</hi> And <hi>Marforio</hi> demanding
what it was, he reply'd, That <hi>the Pope had reſtor'd
to Life one that was Dead;</hi> meaning the <hi>Nepotiſm,</hi>
which ſeem'd to have been utterly extinguiſh'd
by <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. And indeed never Pope made ſo
good Uſe of his Time as this <hi>Alexander:</hi> But
ſince I have already given you an Account of
his Character and Actions, I ſhall only add, that
he went out of this World loaded with Curſes,
that his Memory is odious to all Mankind, and
that never any Man's Death was leſs lamented
than his. <hi>Rome</hi> deteſts him by reaſon of his Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and becauſe he eſtabliſh'd the <hi>Nepotiſm:</hi> The
<hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> hate him as one that was their
declar'd Enemy: <hi>France</hi> is incens'd againſt him
becauſe of the terrible Blow he gave her towards
the end of his Pontificate: And <hi>Venice</hi> abhors the
Memory of a Citizen, who inſtead of proving a
Benefactor to his Country, ſeem'd on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to be its mortal Enemy. At <hi>Rome</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to expreſs their Hatred before he expir'd;
for in the Night in which he dy'd there was a
Paper affix'd to the Gate of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> in
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:51983:231"/>
which he was repreſented in the Poſture of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
that is going to take Horſe, with theſe Words
written underneath, <hi>If any Man wou'd ſend a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Devil, here is a Poſt juſt ready to depart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After his Death, Prince <hi>Anthony</hi> his Nephew,
endeavouring by his Intrigues to exclude Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Barberino,</hi> and to promote the Faction of the
<hi>Pignatelli,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> depriv'd him of the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorſhip,
and at the ſame time remov'd him from
the Management of Publick Affairs, and even
prohibited him to appear in the Council; ſo that
at preſent inſtead of a Procurator's Veſt, he wears
only a Citizen's ſhort Cloak. Yet he was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded,
but only ſuſpended from the Exerciſe of
his Offices.</p>
               <p>I muſt not leave <hi>Venice</hi> without acquainting you
with the ridiculous Opinion the <hi>Italians</hi> have of
the <hi>French</hi> Cuſtoms: They imagine that a Man
may Kiſs and Handle a Young Woman as roughly
and indecently as he pleaſes before her Father and
Mother, and that one may take the ſame Liberty
with a Wife in the Preſence of her Husband; and
from thence they infer, that they are guilty of
more Criminal Familiarities in private. You ſee
what an injurious Opinion they have of our
Nation, and eſpecially of the Chaſtity of our
Ladies; and yet this extravagant Conceit is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grounded on the Civility of our Countrymen,
who permit a Friend or Relation to Salute a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with a Kiſs after a long Abſence; and are
not ſo horn-mad as to enter an Action againſt a
Man for every Kiſs he ſteals from a Woman.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how fatally Men are deluded by
that unconquerable Inclination they have to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:51983:231"/>
every thing. As ſoon as they hear of any
thing that is unuſual, they inſtantly fanſie it to
be a Prodigy, and conclude that 'tis either againſt
the ordinary Courſe of Nature, or contrary to
common Senſe. I have had occaſion to diſcourſe
with ſeveral Perſons that are no <hi>Italians,</hi> who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
me that in <hi>England</hi> a Man may freely Kiſs
the firſt handſome Woman he meets in the Street,
and even that all Women, not excepting the
chief Ladies of the Court, are oblig'd to allow
ſuch Liberties. But tho' I never was in that
Country, I'm ſo far from believing the Story,
that I'm confident, and dare venture to affirm,
that 'tis abſolutely falſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude my Letter with telling you
that I have ſeen <hi>Padua,</hi> which is a very large
Town, but ſo diſpeopl'd, that one half of the
Houſes are not inhabited; and that I have bought
a Horſe to carry me to <hi>Holland;</hi> for I cou'd not
endure to be ſo long ſhut up in a Coach. I have
already ſent my Horſe to <hi>Meſtre,</hi> a little Harbour
about five Miles from this City, in the Road to <hi>Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
and am putting all things in a readineſs for
my Departure. And therefore to finiſh the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of <hi>Venice,</hi> which ſome call the <hi>Rich,</hi> others
the <hi>Fair,</hi> and I the <hi>Licentious,</hi> I ſhall only tell you,
that I'm extremely pleas'd with three things in it,
which I deſpair of finding in any other Place:
Firſt, the <hi>Feſtival Solemnities,</hi> which are always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
with <hi>Shows:</hi> Secondly, the obliging
<hi>Sweetneſs</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> of the <hi>Women:</hi> And in the
laſt Place, the <hi>Neatneſs</hi> of the Houſes within.
I have often heard <hi>Holland</hi> commended for the
extraordinary Neatneſs of its Houſes, but I'm
perſuaded that even in this reſpect it does not exceed
<hi>Venice:</hi> For the very Floors are cover'd with a

certain red Cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ſmooth and clear as a Looking-Glaſs: And all
the Furniture of the Houſe is kept in the beſt
Order, and with the ſame Care and Exactneſs.
Every Cobler in the City takes care to furniſh
his Apartment with Hangings of gilt Leather, a
large Looking-Glaſs, and ſome pretty Pictures;
and the Magnificence of the Houſes is always
ſutable to the Riches of the Inhabitants.</p>
