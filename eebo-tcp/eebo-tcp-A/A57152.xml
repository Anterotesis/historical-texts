            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>These considerations moved me, when I was invited to Preach before you at that solemn time when many proper objects of <hi>good works</hi> use to be presented to your eyes, to single out that argument to treat upon.

of wars, Nation against Nation, Kingdom against Kingdom; many offended, many hating one another, many false Teachers, many seduced people, and, above all, an abundance of iniquity. And indeed, it may be justly feared, that where there are so many divisions, prejudices, animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, differences both of judgment and interest, to say nothing of the luxury, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy, vanity and excess in private ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, there cannot but consequently be a very great obstruction in the current of <hi>good works.</hi>

            <p>My hearty desire and prayer is, That as this <hi>Sermon</hi> received favorable audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from you, and is now by your own direction exposed to a more general view, so some signal <hi>blessing</hi> may follow the publication thereof, that thereby the hearts of many <hi>rich men</hi> may be inlarged to honor the <hi>Lord</hi> with their substance, and to let their Merchandise, and their <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 9.</note> Treasures have inscribed upon them, <hi>Holiness to the Lord.</hi>

There is a strange contradiction between mens Professions and their Practice.

houses, and dwelt therein: And when thine Herds and thy Flocks multiply, and thy Silver and thy Gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 8. 12, 13, 14. Men are like Larks, very silent and modest when they are low and on the ground; but in a warm and glorious Sunshine they soar up, and are very clamorous. And though they be never a dram the holier, the nearer to Heaven, the safer from Hell by all their wealth; yet they think highly of themselves, walk with more state, look with more disdain, breathe more skorn, keep more distance, that you would not think such an one a <hi>richer</hi> onely, but another man. Put mony into a Bag, and the Bag remains Leather or Canvas still; but if it once get into the <hi>heart</hi> of a man, he is presently changed, his thoughts of himself greater, and of others meaner then they were before.</p>
            <p>This the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith should not be so, for after all this, <hi>It is but man still, Eccles.</hi> 6. 10. and the Word is as much above him, as before. A Hill is proud and overtops the Valley; but in comparison of the Sun, they are equally distant, and that haply scorcheth the one when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viveth the other; as the same Word it may be, comforteth a poor Believer, and scourgeth a rich Sinner. A <hi>rich man</hi> then should not be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded: For</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Riches</hi> are not noble enough to raise the Minde, or to put any solid value upon a man more then he had before. <hi>Righteousness</hi> indeed, <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 34.</note>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:64475:13"/>
because it comes from <hi>Heaven,</hi> can <hi>exalt</hi> and <hi>lift</hi> up thitherward: But things of a meer Earthly extraction, do rather depress then heighten the Soul, they bear no proportion unto it. The Heart is as improper a place for <hi>riches,</hi> as a mans Purse or Barn is for <hi>Grace.</hi> The Minde is the seat of <hi>wisdom,</hi> of <hi>knowledge,</hi> of <hi>divine impressions;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Earthly things can <hi>per se,</hi> and in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture operate onely unto earthly effects. They may indeed be used by sensual lusts, as the Foams and Instruments of Pride and Luxury, and by <hi>special wisdom,</hi> as the <hi>vehicula</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Mercy;</hi> but of themselves they adde nothing of real value to a man. A poor man may be <hi>richer</hi> by <hi>one promise</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> by laying up but <hi>one line</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> in his heart, then a <hi>Doeg</hi> or a <hi>Nabal,</hi> by the Cattel on a thousand Mountains.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Rich men</hi> are at best but <hi>Stewards; For the Earth is the Lords,</hi> we are but Tenants, Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, Treasurers unto him. Now a <hi>Steward</hi> or <hi>Princes Treasurer</hi> is the self same man, no change of State, no ebb or flux of greatness, when he hath the custody of Thousands or of Tens: And surely God gives us our <hi>riches</hi> to honor him, and not our selves withal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Rich men</hi> walk amongst more <hi>snares</hi> and <hi>temptations;</hi> for <hi>riches</hi> are the materials which provoke, excite, foment lust, call forth sinful pleasures, worldly love, self-confidence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Word, endanger our Apostacy in times of persecution, and our security in times of peace. And this is certain, That a <hi>full Estate,</hi> is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64475:14"/>
like a <hi>full Diet;</hi> as this requires more strength of nature, so that more wisdom and grace to order and to digest it. Therefore a <hi>rich man</hi> ought to look downward the oftner, to take care of his feet, and the higher the winde is to hoise up the fewer Sails, because there are Rocks and Shelves round about him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In making men rich, and setting them in great places, God hath exalted them enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and they ought the rather to be more low in their own eyes. The highest boughs in a Tree are the slenderest, the more nature hath raised them, the smaller they are in themselves, and by that means the less endangered by the tempests which they so easily yeild unto. And so it should be with us, the more we are exalted by God, the less we should be in our own esteem; and the less we are in our own esteem, the safer we shall be against any <hi>temptations.</hi> Humility is not onely an <hi>ornament,</hi> but a <hi>protection.</hi> We see the fruit grows upon the twigs and smaller branches of a Tree, not upon a Stock: Humility makes way to fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and fruitfulness back again to humility. The more weighty the Ears of Corn, the more they hang downward towards the ground. The richer things are, the more humble they are. <hi>Ambition</hi> was the sin of the <hi>Bramble;</hi> the <hi>Vine, Olive, Fig-tree,</hi> were contented with their former dignity. Clouds, the fuller they are, are the more heavy; the Earth is the richest, and yet the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Element. <hi>Christ</hi> had in him the Treasures of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and yet in nothing more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64475:14"/>
himself unto us as an example, then in meekness and humility, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>John</hi> 13. 13, 14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7. And what comparison is there between <hi>Christ</hi> the Heir of all things, and the richest man on Earth. When the <hi>Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who thought it no robbery to be equal with God, humbled and emptied himself, and made himself of no reputation;</hi> What is there in sinful dust and ashes, that he should be proud? We see in the Body one member hath more magnitude, nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, dignity, imployment then another; but none hath more humility then another. The Head will be as ready to study for the Hand, as the Hand to work for the Head; the Tongue as forward to speak for the Foot, as the Foot to move for the Tongue. And all <hi>Christians</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to be <hi>Members</hi> of the same <hi>Body,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none should be proud or disdainful towards another.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Why should a mans work and service make him proud? Commonly <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>idleness</hi> go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 49. Now the more <hi>riches God</hi> gives a man, the more <hi>work</hi> he sets him about. If we see a mans shop full of Wares, of Instruments, of Servants, Commodities continually imported, we conclude such a man is full of business: When the <hi>Lord</hi> doth multiply <hi>mens estates,</hi> he doth mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply their <hi>employments.</hi> And we see Tradesmen, though upon Festival times they will put on rich Apparel; yet upon working days they go in a more plain and careless fashion. Now of all other work, a <hi>Christians work</hi> will not let him be proud.</p>

Lastly, Why should I for a little difference in this one particular of worldly wealth, despise or disdainfully over look my poor Brother? Doth a <hi>Lawyer</hi> despise a <hi>Physician,</hi> because he hath not read the Code or the Pan<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

Have we not all <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Hope, one Spirit, one Gospel, one Common Salvation?</hi> When so many and great things unite us, shall our wealth onely disunite us? One <hi>Sun</hi> shines on both, one <hi>Air</hi> refresheth both; one <hi>Blood</hi> bought both, one <hi>Heaven</hi> shall receive both: Onely he hath not so much of the Earth as I, and possibly much more of <hi>Christ.</hi> And why should I disdain him on Earth, whom haply the <hi>Lord</hi> will advance above me in Heaven?

            <p>We see a <hi>rich man</hi> hath no reason to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded; but he that is so, will not stop there.

               <hi>That the rich mans wealth is his strong Tower, and an high Wall in his own conceit, Prov.</hi> 18. 11. As <hi>Thrasylaus</hi> by a melancholly fancy judged all the <note place="margin">Athenaens, l. 12. c. ult.</note> ships in the Harbor at <hi>Athens</hi> to be his; so a <hi>rich man</hi> judgeth all the safety and security, that the World can afford to be his own, because he hath that <hi>unum magnum</hi> which will help in the sorest extremities. Every man is conscious to himself, both of his <hi>wants</hi> and of his <hi>dangers;</hi> what good he is <hi>defective</hi> in, what evil he is <hi>exposed</hi> to: And therefore doth what he can for assistance to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the good he wants, and to repell the evil he fears; and of all assistances, he looketh upon this as the surest, because <hi>money answers unto all.</hi> The <hi>Fool in the Gospel</hi> promised himself, <hi>Ease, long life, many years, to eat, to drink, to be merry,</hi> and all in the confidence of his <hi>riches, Luke</hi> 12. 19. How many men trust their wealth to uphold their wickedness, and lean upon them while they fall from God? How many take a <hi>liberty of violence, rapine, cruelty, oppression, luxury, prophaneness,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they think their wealth will be an advocate and a varnish unto all? How many, if <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Mammon</hi> should come into competition, would say as <hi>Amaziah</hi> did, <hi>What shall I do for the hundred Talents? Arduares haec est opibus non tradere mores.</hi> So hard a thing is it not to give up our souls into captivity to our wealth. But</p>

            <p>The Lord could have inriched <hi>all men,</hi> but he hath said, That we shall have the <hi>poor always with us;</hi> that so the <hi>rich</hi> may have matter to <hi>imitate God,</hi> and the poor to <hi>praise him;</hi> that the poor may have Christ for an example of <hi>patience,</hi> and therich for an example of <hi>goodness;</hi> that the <hi>rich mans</hi> supplying the <hi>poor mans</hi> wants, may be a pledge and an assurance of Gods supplying his wants. For rich and poor are relations amongst men; but as we stand in relation to God, every man is poor, and must be always in a begging posture, <hi>Luke</hi> 18: 1. And as <hi>Christ</hi> hath taught us to pray, <hi>Lord, I forgive others, do thou forgive me;</hi> in like manner, we may pray, <hi>Lord, my heart and hand is open to others, let thine be so to me. 1 that am evil,</hi> am enabled by thee to give <hi>good things</hi> to others, and thou hast given me assurance that thou wilt much more <hi>give good things to those that ask them.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Ezra 2. 69. Acts 11. 29.</note> according to the blessing of God upon honest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors; so much the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> importeth, 1 <hi>cor</hi> 16. 2. which doth not hinder our endeavors to lay up and provide for our Families and Posterity, which the Apostle requires, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Matter Circa quam</hi> of our <hi>Good works,</hi> are</p>
            <p>First, <hi>The worship of God,</hi> and things subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64475:21"/>
and conducent thereunto; as maintaining Poor Scholers in the <hi>Nurseries</hi> of the Ministery, and <hi>Schools</hi> of the Prophets; comforting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the able and faithful <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel:</hi> For which, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> are by God honored in the Records of <hi>Scripture,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 22. &amp; 31. 4, 11. <hi>Nehe.</hi> 13. 10, 14. <hi>Let him that is taught in the Word, communicate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that teacheth in all good things,</hi> Gal. 6. 6. <hi>Honor the Lord with thy substance, Prov.</hi> 3. 9. They who <hi>fow</hi> unto you <hi>spiritual things,</hi> it is equal that you minister unto them <hi>carnal things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>David</hi> would not, when he might, offer unto the <hi>Lord</hi> of that <hi>which should cost him nothing,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 24. Ministers that are faithful; dare not offer unto you that which costs them nothing: It costs them their time, their Studies, their strength, their Prayers, possibly their tears and sorrows, to see their <hi>work</hi> fall as fast as they set it up (as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> sometimes complained) Nay, if you will have a <hi>Learned Ministry,</hi> it must cost their purses too; the Utensils of a Minister are chargeable things. And therefore it is a worthy, honorable, and most beneficial work, to contribute unto pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Libraries for the service of the Ministry in Universities, Cities, and publick places.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The necessities of men;</hi> and here</p>
            <p n="1">1. Kinred, friends, acquaintance, <hi>those of our own house, 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Those of the houshold of Faith, who dwell before the Lord, Gal.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Isai.</hi> 23. 18. Pour your oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above all, upon the feet of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:64475:21"/>
3. Strangers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Enemies themselves, <hi>If thine enemy hunger, feed him, Rom.</hi> 12. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>In one word, All that are in misery and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress amongst them: First, The most <hi>helpless,</hi> widows, fatherless, sick, maimed, aged, exiles, captives. Secondly, The most <hi>hopeful,</hi> useful, and painful; as <hi>pregnant wits</hi> for learned educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or other necessary imployments.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>manner</hi> how, the <hi>Apostle</hi> directeth us. First, To do good works <hi>richly:</hi> They who are <hi>Divites opibus,</hi> must be <hi>Divites operibus</hi> too; their <hi>fruit</hi> must be plentiful, as well as their <hi>estate.</hi> There may be a narrow Heart, a starved Charity, where there is a large estate, as in <hi>Nabal:</hi> And there may be a large and bountiful heart, where there is but a poor and narrow estate, as in the poor widow, who as our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us, <hi>Cast in more then all others</hi> into the Treasury; more in <hi>proportion, quia nemo sibi minus reliqui<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> more in <hi>affection,</hi> she cast in her <hi>bowels,</hi> she cast in her <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> with her two <hi>Mites, Mark</hi> 12. 43. So the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> testifieth of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> That <hi>their pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was deep,</hi> and yet <hi>their liberality was rich and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2. Though they could not draw much out of their <hi>Purse,</hi> yet they drew out their very <hi>Soul</hi> to their Brethren, <hi>Isai.</hi> 58. 10. As the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, That he <hi>imparted his own Soul</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 1. But you that are rich in estate, may be rich in <hi>good works,</hi> as well as in <hi>good affections,</hi> may be exercised to all bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11. As there is a <hi>decentia status</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:64475:22"/>
for a mans expences on himself; so is there for his bounty to the poor. The Widows two Mites had been a mock and not an alms, if a rich man had cast them in.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>To do them readily,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. To be easie, prompt, prone unto <hi>good works,</hi> not out of necessity, importunity, constraint, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. This is a great mercy, when men are able to offer these Sacrifices <hi>willingly,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 14. And hereunto are necessary such habits and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as do facilitate good works, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Piety to God,</hi> a desire to honor him with his own gifts, and to give him back again of his own, and thereby as to testifie our professed subjection to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> so to procure abundant thanksgiving unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Love to Christ,</hi> whose <hi>doctrine</hi> hereby we obey, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 41. whose <hi>example</hi> herein we imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, <hi>John</hi> 13. 29. whose <hi>members</hi> hereby we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh, and so in his accompt do it unto himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 40. and become his creditors. For he <hi>that giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord, Prov.</hi> 19. 17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Love to our Neighbor,</hi> which worketh <hi>tender heartedness</hi> towards him in his affliction, and <hi>large heartedness</hi> for his relief, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 20. God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the <hi>doing of judgment,</hi> which in some cases may be done with sorrow, as in the punishment of malefactors; but he requireth <hi>The loving of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> We must never go unwillingly about that, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 8. Our bounty must be in our eye, and so affect our heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 9.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:64475:22"/>
4. <hi>Wisdom and skill</hi> with prudent consideration to do a good work to the best advantage. A man is never ready and dextrous in a business, which he is unskilful in; therefore the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, <hi>Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is he that considereth the poor, Psal.</hi> 41. 1. We read as I take it in <hi>Seneca</hi> or <hi>Plutarch,</hi> of one who knowing the poverty and modesty of his friend, was fain to steal a gift under his Pillow for him, who otherwise might have refused it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Chearfulness and speed,</hi> to do a good work without grudging or delay. <hi>Say not to thy Brother, Go and come to morrow, Prov.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>Job</hi> did not withhold the poor from their desire, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 16. He that sheweth mercy, must do it <hi>with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Rom.</hi> 12. 8. For <hi>the Lord loveth a chearful giver,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. In many cases <hi>delays</hi> are <hi>denials;</hi> a duty done in season, is twice done.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>To do them diffusively,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. We are not onely to do good, to do it copiously, to do it readily and chearfully, but to do it to <hi>many,</hi> to <hi>community;</hi> so to have the property in <hi>our selves,</hi> as that the <hi>comfort</hi> may be diffusive, and redound to many others. And as here <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are put together, so elswhere, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, doing good and communicating, are put together, and so it is used, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>The word seemeth to import, first, To do good so, as <hi>that many</hi> may be the better for it, that it may be a <hi>common</hi> and a <hi>publick good:</hi> Such are the works of God; his Sun-shines, his Rain falls on good and bad; on the barren Rocks, as well
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64475:23"/>
as the fruitful Valleys. Such publick works are building and endowing of Schools, of Churches, of Lecturers, of Work-houses, of Hospitals, of Manufactures, furnishing of Libraries, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of publick Professors, Legacies to the poor, repairing Ways and Bridges, Loans to set up poor Tradesmen, and other the like Benefactions which have a common and publick influence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To do it <hi>as in communion,</hi> as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of another, <hi>communion Natural</hi> upon principles of <hi>humanity,</hi> and <hi>communion Spiritual</hi> upon principles of <hi>Christianity.</hi> To remember them that are <hi>in Bonds, as bound with them,</hi> and them which suffer adversity, <hi>as being our selves in the body, Heb.</hi> 13. 3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To do it <hi>sociably,</hi> modestly, humane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be not onely bountiful, but to adorn both our wealth, and our good works with suavity of conversation, with meekness, placideness, and facility of manners, with an amiable and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative deportment towards all men. For a Mans very charity may be so morose and austere, that tender stomacks may nauseate it; as Physick that is wholesome, but bitter.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to press this duty upon you, which the Apostle doth by so many and emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal expressions, with such considerations as these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the example of <hi>God himself,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth us to imitate him in works of mercy, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 36. <hi>His mercy is in the Heavens,</hi> Psal. 36. 5. <hi>The Earth is full of his goodness,</hi> Psal. 35. 5. <hi>His bounty is over all his works,</hi> Psal. 145. 9. <hi>He punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64475:23"/>
unwillingly,</hi> Lam. 3. 33. <hi>He watcheth to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> Isai. 38. 18. He chose <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> as the choisest things, to make his <hi>name</hi> known unto his people by, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>He giveth his Son, his Spirit, his Love, his Grace, his Glory, Himself unto us; and yet his <hi>mercy is free,</hi> he is not by any Law bound thereunto. <hi>He sheweth mercy to whom he will shew mercy, Rom.</hi> 9. 18. Whereas we are but his <hi>Stewards,</hi> and have <hi>riches</hi> as the <hi>Sun</hi> hath light to disperse to others. We have the <hi>custody,</hi> but the <hi>comfort</hi> belongeth unto others; it is called <hi>another mans,</hi> and not our own, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 12. If a Man were master of the light of the Sun, we should esteem him extreamly barbarous and inhumane; if he should let it shine onely into his own house: Our Money, our Bread, our Cloathing, is as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for our poor Brother, as the light of the Sun; and therefore the inhumanity as great to withhold the one, as it would be to monopolize the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From the example of <hi>Christ.</hi> He was his Fathers Almoner, <hi>Mercy</hi> was his Office: It belonged unto him as <hi>the Son of David,</hi> to shew mercy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>Mercy</hi> was his <hi>practise, He went about doing good, Acts</hi> 10. 38. All his <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> were in <hi>works of mercy,</hi> feeding, healing, raising, comforting; and though he be now in glory, yet he reckoneth the bounty shewed to his members, as done to himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 35, 40. A <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was offered to <hi>God,</hi> though eaten by the Priest and the people; and our <hi>Alms</hi> are called <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Heb.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 18. The poor onely
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64475:24"/>
are benefited, but God is honored by them. And there is a <hi>connexion</hi> between his <hi>mercy</hi> and ours; we forfeit his when werestrain our own, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 13. And the <hi>Argument</hi> is strong from his to ours; his was to <hi>enemies,</hi> ours to <hi>Brethren;</hi> his to <hi>debtors,</hi> ours to <hi>fellow-servants.</hi> His <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace</hi> to me, mine <hi>just debt</hi> to my Brother, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8. His for <hi>ever</hi> to me, mine but for a <hi>moment</hi> to my Brother; his in <hi>Talents</hi> to me, mine but in <hi>Pence</hi> to my Brother; his in <hi>Blood</hi> to me, mine but in <hi>Bread</hi> to my Brother; his <hi>mercy inricheth</hi> me, mine leaves my Brother <hi>poor</hi> still. If then I live by the <hi>mercy</hi> which I do <hi>enjoy,</hi> and must be saved by the <hi>mercy</hi> which I do <hi>expect,</hi> shall so much <hi>mercy</hi> shine on me, and none reflect from me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my poor Brother? shall all the <hi>Waters of life</hi> run from <hi>Christ</hi> unto me, as those of <hi>Jordan,</hi> into a Dead Sea, to be lost and buried there? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Sun shine, and the Rain fall on the Earth, but that it may be fruitful? The <hi>mercies of God</hi> should be as Dew and hear, as manure and culture to the Souls of Men, that being thereby <hi>inriched,</hi> they may empty themselves, and draw out themselves into the Bowels of others. <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Fountain; Rich men</hi> the <hi>conduit,</hi> and <hi>Poor men</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> which are there and thence sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From respect <hi>to our selves.</hi> 1. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of <hi>nature,</hi> we also are <hi>in the flesh:</hi> We thay want mercy from others, as others do now from us. Who would have thought that <hi>David</hi> should have stood in need of the Bread of a Churl!
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64475:24"/>
Good offices between men and men, are not <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> onely, but <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>merchandise.</hi> I shew them to him now, and another time he may shew them to me; it is the <hi>Apostles</hi> argument, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 14. 2. A <hi>special honor,</hi> when God makes us <hi>instruments</hi> of doing good; for it is <hi>a more blessed thing to give, then to receive, Acts</hi> 20. 35. <hi>Mercy</hi> is the seed of <hi>honor, Psal.</hi> 112. 9. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 21.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, From <hi>respect to our Neighbor,</hi> to whom we ow this <hi>debt of love:</hi> For there is a <hi>debt of Charity</hi> as well as a <hi>debt of Justice:</hi> A debt whereby I ow him that which is truly his, and a debt whereby I ow him something of that which is mine own. And this I do both unto <hi>Gods Image</hi> in him; for every one <hi>that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten,</hi> 1 John 5. 1. and unto mine <hi>own Image;</hi> for <hi>his flesh is as mine own flesh,</hi> Nehe. 5. 5. <hi>He that made me in the Womb, made him,</hi> faith <hi>Job, Cap.</hi> 31. 15. <hi>And when I hide my self from him, I hide from mine own flesh,</hi> Isai. 58. 7. <hi>Homo sum, humanum à me nihil alienum puto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, For the <hi>credit of our Reformed Religion,</hi> that the mouths of adversaries may be stopped, who falsly charge us with preaching, and you with professing a naked, empty, fruitless Faith. We preach St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Faith, a <hi>Faith which works by love; remembring your work of Faith.</hi> We preach <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6. 1 Thes. 1. 3. 2 Pet. 1. 5, 7.</note> St. <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, a <hi>Faith</hi> which hath <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>temperance,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>brotherly kindness,</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> added unto it. And we tell you with him, That if these things
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64475:25"/>
be lacking, you are blinde; and your knowledge is worth nothing, so long as it is barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful. We preach St. <hi>James</hi> his Faith, a Faith which hath <hi>works,</hi> which may be <hi>shewed,</hi> which <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 2, 14, 18, 21, 25.</note> visiteth the <hi>Fatherless</hi> and <hi>Widows</hi> in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith that hath a bosome for poor <hi>Lazarus, Rahabs</hi> Faith which had an Harbor for endangered Strangers. We preach St. <hi>Judes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jude v. 3. 12, 20.</note> Faith, a <hi>most holy Faith,</hi> a <hi>Faith delivered to the Saints;</hi> such a Faith, as he who indeed hath it, is not a Cloud without Water, nor a Tree without Fruit. We preach St. <hi>Johns</hi> Faith, <hi>to believe on</hi>

                  </gap>. John 3. 17, 18, 23.</note> 
               <hi>the Name of Christ,</hi> and <hi>to love one another;</hi> and to shew this love by opening our <hi>Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion</hi> to our needy Brother, and loving him not in <hi>Word</hi> onely, but in <hi>Deed and Truth.</hi> We tell <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 3.

This is the Faith we preach, this the Charge we give: We tell you, without this, your Faith is <hi>Hypocrital,</hi> your Religion <hi>vain,</hi> your Hope <hi>delusion,</hi> and all your Expectation but as a <hi>Spiders Web.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Let me press upon <hi>London,</hi> the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>London,</hi> an easie Argument, One would think, to desire you to be like your selves. I might make a large recital of <hi>great</hi> and <hi>publick Works of Piety</hi> done by this famous City: I might mention multitudes of ample Munificencies and Benefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by very many worthy Members thereof,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64475:25"/>
since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> whereby they have refuted the calumnies cast upon our Religion by Papists, as if it made us careless of <hi>Good works.</hi> A large Catalogue hath been made of them to mine hand by a <hi>Learned Writer,</hi> Dr. <hi>Andrew Willet,</hi> to the <note place="margin">Synopfis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pismi. Edit. 5. P. 1223-1232</note> honor of God, and credit of our Religion. I shall content my self to give you a report of the <hi>general sum,</hi> which upon computation, he telleth us, doth amount in the space of Sixty years, unto above Six hundred thousand pounds. So that by an equal distribution, through the whole time, this famous City did allow Ten thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> for Threescore years together unto <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Piety and Charity</hi> (besides all which was done in a private and unobserved way.) An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I believe, hardly to be parallel'd in any City under the <hi>Roman</hi> Jurisdiction. More then Forty Hospitals built, above Twenty Free Schools, besides Granaries, Conduits, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, Loans to poor Workmen, Exhibitions to poor Scholers, Churches, Munificent gifts to the Universities and Colledges there; so that I may say unto you, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Brotherly love, You need not that I speak unto you, for you have been taught of God;</hi> onely I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, <hi>That you abound more and more,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 9, 10. That you may receive the same honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Testimony and Memorial from <hi>Christ,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> hath received, <hi>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works,</hi> (they are twice mentioned) <hi>and the last to be more then the first,</hi> Revel. 2. 19.

               <hi>Be not weary of weldoing, in due time you shall reap, if you faint not,</hi> Gal. 6. 9. <hi>Lose not the things which ye have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward,</hi> 2 <hi>John v.</hi> 8. And this leads me to the last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Seventhly, The <hi>Reward which is set before you.</hi> It is a <hi>sowing of Seed,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. A <hi>scattering</hi> which tendeth to <hi>increase, Prov.</hi> 11. 24. There is no duty which hath more copious promises of <hi>reward,</hi> then this of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>good works.</hi> Rewarded with <hi>plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Thy Soul shall be as a watered Garden, I sai.</hi> 58. 11. <hi>For this thing, the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, Deut.</hi> 15. 10. Rewarded with <hi>honor, He hath dispersed and given to the poor, his horn shall be exalted with honor, Psal.</hi> 112. 9. Rewarded with the blessings of the poor. <hi>The blessing of him that was ready to perish, came upon me, Job</hi> 29. 11, 13. Rewarded with the <hi>grace</hi> of God, <hi>God is able to make all grace abound towards you,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 8. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a pure and <hi>comfortable use</hi> of what we enjoy our selves. <hi>Give alms of such things as you have, and behold all things are clean unto you, Luke</hi> 11. 41. Rewarded with a lengthning of our present <hi>tranquillity, Dan.</hi> 4. 27. Rewarded with <hi>Gods acceptation, Heb.</hi> 13. 16. with the <hi>mercy</hi> of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 7. with the <hi>mansions</hi> of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 9. <hi>Good works</hi> are <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> which return our estates into another Country.</p>
            <p>This laying out is <hi>laying up; Mercatura est amit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere ut Lucreris.</hi> It is like putting a Basin of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Pump which draws out a great Vessel full: It is a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and Sacrifices were offered
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64475:26"/>
for the benefit, not for the damage of the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. A man scatters his Seed in the Furrow, but he lays up his Crop in the Barn; it is a scattering which ends in a laying up. The Backs of the poor, the Bellies of the hungry, are the Bank of Heaven.</p>
            <p>And it is a laying up <hi>for our selves.</hi> Men lay up usually for others; their Children, their Heirs and Executors meet with it at the last; but <hi>works of mercy</hi> are all expended <hi>upon a mans self,</hi> he hath the <hi>comfort here,</hi> and the <hi>reward hereafter.</hi> It is money lent to God, and he will repay it to our selves. In Law, he which <hi>sows</hi> must <hi>roap;</hi> and so says the Apostle, <hi>He that soweth bountifully, shall reap bountifully.</hi>
               <q>Quas dederis solas semper habebisopes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And it is laying up a <hi>Foundation,</hi> a way to make our uncertain <hi>riches</hi>

            <p>And this life to come, a life which <hi>may be held,</hi> a life which can never be lost, when the last gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conflagration shall have consumed and melted all the Treasures of the World, our <hi>good works</hi> will abide that trial; the inheritance unto which they follow us, <hi>is incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in the Heavens for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now <hi>Right Honorable</hi> and <hi>Beloved,</hi> to give you all in one view, You have heard the <hi>Charge</hi> of the God of Heaven, to the <hi>Rich men</hi> of the Earth: It is my Petition, it is his Command. I beseech you, he injoyns you, <hi>Not to be high mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> not to let that which comes from the deep places of the Earth, exalt you, and make you forget that you are Earth; not to let the thick Clay make the thin Dust proud. It cannot adde a cubit to your stature, let it not adde so great a sin to your Souls: It is gift, it is not property;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64475:27"/>
Gods, not yours; you are the fiduciaries, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positaries onely; why should you <hi>glory as if you had not received it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me adde this one word more, Let not your <hi>riches</hi> make you low-minded neither, to glew your hearts, to bend your affections to things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: Let them make you heavenly-minded, and then they will make you humbly-minded; the more of Heaven in any minde, the more of Humility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not to trust in riches,</hi> not to let his gifts be used to his own degrading: Who would trust in an <hi>unstable</hi> thing, which he cannot keep! <hi>Riches</hi> are uncertain; in a <hi>false thing</hi> which he cannot credit? <hi>Riches</hi> are deceitful; in a <hi>nothing,</hi> which <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 5. 1 Cor. 8. 4.</note> is not? He that trusts in <hi>riches,</hi> makes them an Idol, and <hi>an Idol is nothing in this world.</hi> Who would trust in a Dead Idol, that hath a <hi>Living God</hi> to trust in? who would trust in an useless <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> who hath a <hi>Bountiful God,</hi> who gives <hi>all things</hi> to trust in?</p>
            <p>You have another charge, <hi>To do good, to be rich in good works,</hi> to do them chearfully, to do them diffusively: And though God might stop at the <hi>charge,</hi> his soveraignty and dominion would bear him out, to <hi>command</hi> you onely; yet being full of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> he is pleased to <hi>encourage</hi> as well as <hi>command</hi> you. He encourageth you <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedenter,</hi> by that which goes before your duty, his own <hi>example;</hi> he encourageth you <hi>consequenter,</hi> by that which follows after your duty, his great <hi>reward,</hi> his <hi>example</hi> you have; he <hi>gives,</hi> you do
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64475:28"/>
but lend; he gives, you do but render back to him of his own. He gives to you <hi>all things;</hi> the Earth empties into your Coffers her Silver and her Gold; the Pastures send you in Cattel, the Fields Corn, the Sea Fish, the Air Fowl; one Country sends you in Wine, and another Spices; one Silks, and another Furrs; one Delicates, another Ornaments: He gives you the light of the Sun, the influences of the Stars, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Angels, the Righteousness of his Son, the Graces of his Spirit, the Hope of his Glory: He gives you Himself, and his own Alsufficiency for your portion. And now if Heaven and Earth be <hi>all,</hi> if Grace and Glory be <hi>all,</hi> if God and Christ be <hi>all;</hi> he hath given you <hi>all things richly to enjoy;</hi> for many of these gifts bring their joy and fruition with them. So the <hi>Example</hi> far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the <hi>Imitation;</hi> you <hi>lend,</hi> you do not <hi>give;</hi> you lend <hi>some thing;</hi> you do not <hi>give all things;</hi> you lend to the <hi>necessities</hi> of your Brother; you do not give to his <hi>delights</hi> and <hi>replenishment;</hi> you <hi>cloath him,</hi> you do not <hi>adorn him;</hi> you <hi>feed him,</hi> you do not <hi>fill,</hi> much less pamper him. This is one encouragement, <hi>A great Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have another encouragement, <hi>A full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> good measure shaken together, pressed down, running over into your bosoms. You give money, God gives life; you things uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which you could not keep but by giving; God gives a Foundation, Mansions, a City which hath Foundations, <hi>The sure mercies of David.</hi> You lay out to your Brother, God lays up for you;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64475:28"/>
you give perishing things to your Brother, God an abiding, an abounding life to you; you a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or a Coat to your Brother, God a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and a Crown to you; you such things to your Brother, which neither you nor he can keep; God such things to you, which when once laid hold on, you cannot lose.</p>
            <p>So this double encouragement sets on the <hi>duty</hi> by a threefold <hi>love.</hi> If you <hi>love God,</hi> imitate his <hi>example,</hi> be merciful as he is <hi>merciful:</hi> If you <hi>love your Brother,</hi> refresh his Bowels, make his Back and Belly your repositories. He can repay you with Prayers, and Prayers are as good as Gold. If you <hi>love your selves,</hi> do what the most covetous man would do, lay up, lay up for your selves, not onely for your heirs, your children; it may be for strangers, for enemies: Lay up <hi>surely,</hi> that which you may lay hold on, that which will <hi>stay</hi> by you, a <hi>Foundation:</hi> Lay up for the <hi>future,</hi> that which Time, which Death, which Rust, Moth, Theif, cannot take away; for <hi>life</hi> which is more worth then wealth, for <hi>eternal life</hi> which is more durable then wealth. If you do not thus by your wealth, lay up a Foundation unto <hi>Eternal life,</hi> your thick Clay will load you with many sorrows, and drown you in destruction and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. You have your wealth for this end, you have your life and salvation with this homage, and quit-rent upon it. If you do not give, you shall not live; if you do not do good, you shall not receive good; if you do not lay out, you shall not lay up. Here is your option, keep your
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64475:29"/>
money, and perish with it; return it unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and be gainers by it. If you love God, or your Neighbor, or your selves, or your very riches themselves; do good, be rich in good works, you do not onely comfort your Brother, but you keep your God; you save your selves, you lengthen your lives, you preserve your estates unto <hi>all eternity.</hi>
