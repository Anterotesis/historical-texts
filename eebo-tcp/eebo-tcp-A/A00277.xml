         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

all good workes to doe his will, working

            <p>DEare Brethren, because we are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid
for gods glory the edification one
of another in Christ, and are bounde
to serue thervnto by wealthe or woo, lyfe or
death, and cheifly, they to whom God haue
geuen the greter gyftes, and whom he hath
callyd to higher romes, are moste bounde to
be zelous for gods glory with godly zelousie
to profyt the churche and sponse of Christe
vnder their charge, and that by no subteltye
as the Apostel warnithe, they shulde be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
from the symplicitie of Christ: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is no doubt of your good zealle
and diligence. My good fathers &amp; deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
who ar first callid to the battel, to stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
for gods glory and the edification of his
people, against the Romish reliques and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Antichrist, I doubt not but that you
wyl coragiouslye and constantlye in Christ,
rape at these rages of Gods enemyes, and
that you will by this occasion race vp many
as grete enormites that we all know, &amp; labo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
to race out all the dregges &amp; remnants of
<pb facs="tcp:12155:3"/>
transformid popery, that are crept into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
by to much lenite of them that wylbe
namid the Lordes of the cleargie: what is he
that hath the zeale of gods glory before his
face, that wyl not ioyne both in prayer, and
in sufferinge with you, in so good a cause,
that is so much for gods glory, and the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of gods church, in the pure simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
of Christes word &amp; sacramentes, wherin
our enemies and persecutours are strangely
bewitchid. I wote not by what Circes cupe,
that they do make suche a diuersite betwixt
Christes worde &amp; his sacramentes, that they
can not thinke the worde of God safelye y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe
preachid, &amp; honorably inough hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyd,
without cap, cope, surplis. But that the
sacraments the maryinge, the buryinge, the
churching of wemen, &amp; other church seruice,
as they call it, muste nedes be decored with
crossinge, with capping, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> surplessing, with
knelinge, with preti wafer cakes, and other
knackes of poperi. O Paule that thou were
a lyue, thou durst tell those politike gentel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that ther hath bin to much laboure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoued
vpon them in vaine, thou durste say
vnto them, as thou didest to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Corinthians,
that they eat not the Lordes supper, but pley
a pagent of their owne to blynde the people,
and kepe them still in supersticion, fare from
the symplicite of Christes supper: but howe
<pb facs="tcp:12155:3"/>
many sely sowles is ther that dothe beleue
veryly, that they haue an English masse, and
so put no difference betwene truth &amp; falshod,
betwene Christ and antichrist, betwene God
and the deuell, they are strangely bewitched.
I say that thus wyll bynde theyr Englyshe
presthode &amp; sacraments, but muche more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntid
that can fynd no garments to plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
them. But such as haue ben polutid open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with popishe supersticion &amp; Idolatry, but
most of all in this point shall theyr madnes
apere to all posterites, that they make these
Antichristian rages <hi>Causam sine qua non,</hi> that
is, a cause without which ther is no holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
in Christ, so that this shall make an
Englyshe preste, be he neuer suche a dolt or
vnlearnid in the knouledge of the scripture
as we haue very manye, and without these
romisshe reliques not Paule hym selfe shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be

his policie, and so ar all they that wil retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

be taken for the best gospelars, are contentid
to kepe it as an holie religion. Marke well
also how many godly and learnid ministers
ther be here in all countres, that be so zelous
not onlie to forsake the wickyd doctrine of
poperie, ready to leue the minystry, &amp; to lose
lyuinges, rather then to be lyke the popishe
teachers of supersticious order in aparell or

to late: yet god wyll comfort his by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meane: It ys a perilous thinge, not to
healpe in the tyme of neade, &amp; not to suffer
religion to goe forward in all syncerite, and
to further gods cause when ye maye, when
Terenti a good Christian captaine returnid
with great triumphe &amp; victory, the Emperor
Valerius bade him axe what he wold. and he
shuld haue it for his good seruice: he hauing
God before his eyes, desyryd nether ryches,
nether honor, but those which had aduente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their liues for true religion, might haue
a church alowid them, to serue their god pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rely
in, &amp; seueral from the Arrians. The Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour
beyng angrie with his request, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyd
his supplicacion in pecis, and bade him
axe som other thing. but he gathered vp the
pecis of his, paper and sayd: I haue receuid
my rewarde, I wyll axe nothinge els, God
encrece about Princes the small nomber of
suche zelous futers &amp; promoters of religion,
and then no doubt gods glorye shall florishe
when we seke his dewe honor, and not oure
owne profyte. But to avoide contencion &amp;
scisme Austen gevith good counsel to godly
and quiet men, that they mercifully correcte
that whiche they can, &amp; that which they can
not, paciently beare, grone and morne, with
<pb facs="tcp:12155:12"/>
loue, vntil god ether correct or amend them.
But how this Christian loue shuld be kept
in this church, when so manye godlie for so

Therfor in this case we must not so suttelly

when lyberte is turnyd into necessite, yt ys
evell, &amp; no lenger lyberte: and that, that was
for wynning the weake sufferid for a tyme,
is become the confyrminge of the frowarde
in their obstinacie. Paul vsyd circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cision for
a tyme as of lyberte, but when it was vrgyd
of necessite, he wold not bende vnto it. That
famous father Master Bucer, when he was

made aunswere, because hys heade was not

controuersie now raysyd by packynge of
enemys about the wearinge of popish ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
and as ye haue well begonne, ther
is no doubt, but the Lorde in mercy shall
kepe ye pure and blameles to the ende. It
hathe byne no small ioye and comfort to
many godlye and good Churches, which
dayly and howerly prayeth for your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and that it wolde please God to
ease it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his good will and pleasure is.
So on the other syde muche lamentynge
the blyndnes of those that goeth about to
defende it: but especiallye those that are
become persecutors of their godly &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
brethren: but as charite requireth, we
desyre God neuer laye it to theyr charge,

for his Christ sake make Ephrahim and
Manassis agre, that we maye all with on

those that are earnestly turnyd to the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shippe

of Idolatrie, You shall, sayth he, put out
the couerynge of the Imagis of syluer,<note place="margin">that is all thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Idolatry.</note> &amp;
the precious vestyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,
and thou shalt caste them awaye lyke
<pb facs="tcp:12155:23"/>
a menstrous clowte, and saye vnto yt: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uawnte,
or get the hence. Fynallye when
all godly men abhorre the monstrous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
of Fryers, Monkes, Chanons, I
can not se, by what order they shulde exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
the ornaments of Popishe Preastes,
whose order is as wyckyd as Freyers,
Monkes, or any other, which thyng may
be sayd of the reste of the Popishe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies,
which may all with lyke precepte and
coloure, &amp; by as good reason be receuid in
the Churches as those. But admyttinge
that these thynges were neuer so indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
yet it can not be that we shulde thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
them lawfull, for vs to vse them: For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
those thinges, which by them sealues are
lawfull, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other circumstance is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyd
to them, then become they vnlawfull
for a Christian to vse them, as in these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
First we can not cast of all doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
hauing so many reasons on our syde,
and so manye examples bothe of learnyd
men, and best reformyd Churches, but in
all thinges most indifferent. Saint Paule
chargith euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be certanly persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyd
in his owne mynde, which some men
vntruly translate, Let euery man abownde
in his owne sence, for he that with doubt
of conscience eatyth, which of it sealfe is
<pb facs="tcp:12155:23"/>
lawfull, is condemnyd, because he doth it
not of fayth. Now the assurance of fayth
muste be sought no where, but in Gods
worde. Secondlye, thowghe we shulde sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfye
our consciences, yet this man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fylid,
which is not persuadid by Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de,
but encreased by our examples, that he
dare do that, whereof before he doubted,
and this is to geue an offence, as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call it to anger them, for they that
are best pleasyd with these matters, are
most offendyd that they stomble and falle,
we must not do what so euer is lawfull,
but what so euer also is profytable to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying:
nether must we only regarde what
lyberte permyttyth, but rather what our
brothers proffyt requiryth. Thyrdlye, we
maye not altogether neclecte what infy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells
iudge of vs in the vsynge of thinges
lawfull by them sealfes, and therefore S.
Paule byddeth them that are callyd to the
feastes of the gentyls, so sone as mencyon
is made of meate offeryd to Idoles, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne
from eatinge of it, because of hym
that tolde of it, and his conscience, not of
hym sealfe, but of an other. What the Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pistes
iudge of vs, maye casely be seene by
this, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Harding for the retayning of those
Popishe cerymonies, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teynith hope that
<pb facs="tcp:12155:24"/>
popery shalbe restoryd: what the ignorant
people iudge of the reamnants of papistri
retaynyd, wyse men may well consyder.
Herunto might haue byne ioynid the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of olde Doctors, Justinus, Ireneus,
Tertullianus, Agustyne, Ambros, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostums,
Celestinus, &amp; almost all the rest,
for abhorrynge the customes and ryghtes
of the Jewes and gentyles and heritykes,
but Gods truthe nedyth not mans aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte,
except they that be against vs, in this
cause wyll appeale to the fathers, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall
they perceyue, that in nomber both of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
and sentences, we shall be nothinge
inferior to them. In the meane tyme this
maye suffyce, to shew fyrst that the precy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians
is blameles, secondly the garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes
ar not indifferent, &amp; thyrdly that thowghe
they were indifferent yet ther is sufficient
reason at this tyme, why we shoulde not
weare them. Come Lord Jesus, and make
an ende of thys wyckyd wordle, that thy
sainctes may come to gether, that we may
synge with the in thy holy hyll for euer.
He that ouercomith, shalbe crownyd.
Pray, pray, as the Apostell Peter
sayth: the end of all thinges
is at hand.</p>
