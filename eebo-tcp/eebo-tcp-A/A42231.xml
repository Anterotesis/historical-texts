            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In remembrance of your worthy Brother, our late Dean of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> I offer your Lordſhip theſe brief Diſcourſes. In his Study, I firſt met with that uſeful Collection of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Epiſtles, where this is exſtant. At his Houſe, under his favour, firſt came I into your knowledge. Now, after his deceaſe, his Name, dear ſtill to us who once enjoyed his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, generous, and obliging Converſe, will add ſome Grace unto theſe Papers in your Eye: and your Name, my Lord, worthily advanced to your high Office, will make them acceptable to ſome of this great people under your Government. I heartily wiſh, we may all Tranſlate into our minds the ſedate and pacific temper of this Author. A man above my Praiſe. Whoſe Writings (as it was ſaid, in the laſt Age, of his Country-man the great <hi>Eraſmus</hi>) are the delight of our learned World. If any Reader pleaſe to diſſent from the Opinion of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Grotius,</hi> he may: but then he ought not to be diſpleaſed, if another diſſent from him.

            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Conſulting with my ſelf about an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Writing of the famous <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> I return unto this Epiſtolar office for ſome time intermitted. If I ſhould ſay nothing, I ſhould injure the truer opinions
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102345:4"/>concerning the rites and government of the antient Church, the Conciliation of Grace and Free-will, the government of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Powers in affairs Eccleſiaſtical. All which, either by reaſon of his haſte into England, or becauſe his exact care of other contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies gave him no leiſure to conſider of theſe, were not handled by <hi>Molinaeus</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his uſual learning. Truly, I am not glad he read that part of my letter, wherein I did with ſome freedom touch the mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Churches: for there are few, that can patiently endure the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their Ulcers. Being offended here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he does me great injury in anſwering ſo, as if I diſſwaded the nearer union of the Proteſtant Churches, when as I have many years had the ſame wiſhes with him, and ceaſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot to do all the ſervice I can to that end.</p>
            <p>But, from your Epiſtle. moſt Noble Sir, what I writ had its riſe, wherein you ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Engliſh Embaſſador gave ſmall hope of promoting that buſineſs. Hence I took occaſion to ſearch after the cauſes, which might hinder ſo good a deſign. God grant my Conjectures be not true.</p>
            <p>Whether the reformed French have ſo much reverence for the higheſt Powers as the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102345:4"/>Engliſh, theſe very times, I fear, will give too great an evidence. The King of Great Britain long ſince hath declared his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the too near equality of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will not conſiſt with due obedience, and he hath been often heard to ſay: <hi>No Biſhop, No King.</hi> That in England, there is more reſpect given to the antient Church then in <hi>France,</hi> I wonder any man will deny. In the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Anglican church</hi> written in the year 1571 I find this: <hi>The preachers</hi> ſhall have a ſpecial care that they deliver nothing in their Sermons, but what is agreeable to the old and new Teſtament, and which the Catholick Fathers and old Biſhops have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence, I much doubt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hether the French miniſters will receive this law.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>Rites,</hi> I am ſure the Engliſh Liturgy, the impoſition of hands at Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of baptized children, the authority of Biſhops, Convocation of Prieſts alone, and many like things agree well with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes of the more antient Church, from which things we muſt needs confeſs in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Belgium</hi> they have receded. That <hi>He</hi> hath a better eſteem of Biſhops and Confirmation, I rejoyce but he is not ignorant, that ſome of his acquaintance call the one <hi>a device of Satan,</hi> the other <hi>a note of Antichriſt:</hi> a ſort
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102345:5"/>of men, great enemies to the Churches peace True it is which <hi>Molinaeus</hi> affirms, peace may conſiſt with different rites and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin: but then, great care muſt be had, that they prefer not their own too much above others, eſpecially things lately invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above thoſe which are received from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Molinaeus</hi> imagins I meant cunningly to engage him in the <hi>Belgic</hi> controverſies: but I can religiouſly proteſt, I had no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but by your mediation to get the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Councel for my ſelf and others toward the making of peace. For, having formerly ſeen another writing of his, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning concord to be made between pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> alſo included; in which he clearly profeſſeth, that many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, not neceſſary to ſalvation, are to be laid aſide: and namely, thoſe moved by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> of predeſtination, of <hi>freewill,</hi> and <hi>of perſeverance:</hi> I verily thought, he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a form of doctrin therein as not to condemn the opinion, which I will not ſay <hi>Arminius,</hi> but <hi>Melanchthon</hi> liked beſt. He does indeed propoſe ſome <hi>Theſes,</hi> which he ſaith agree with the doctrin of <hi>Auſtin, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, Fulgentius,</hi> and the <hi>Arauſican</hi> Council. But, they that differ from <hi>Molinaeus</hi> will ask, why the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102345:5"/>Authority of <hi>Austin</hi> muſt be greater then of all the Fathers, who lived in the elder and the purer times, i e, within 400 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the birth of Chriſt. From whom, what we have received, the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> doth profeſs he will never condemn, and very many of us are of the ſame mind.</p>
            <p>Now, all they neareſt to the Apoſtles Age and their ſucceſſors, many of them, both Biſhops and Martyrs, held Gods <hi>purpoſe, and predeſtination according to preſcience: that he made ſome veſſels of honor, ſome of diſhonor, becauſe he fore-ſaw the end of every one, and fore knew their will and deed under the aid of Grace:</hi> as their Books do teſtify, and <hi>Proſper</hi> doth in plain words confeſs: <hi>This is the constant judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Fathers that the will is free in belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, yet not without the aid of divine Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Arauſican</hi> Council, there is not any thing at all touching the queſtion of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination,</hi> whether it be with <hi>preſcience,</hi> or by a decree without <hi>preſcience:</hi> but <hi>Anathema</hi> is pronounced againſt them, <hi>that ſay any men are by the divine law predeſtinate to evil.</hi> In the ſame it is ſaid: <hi>Grace to believe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd upon all that deſire to be baptized,</hi> And, <hi>All the baptized are able to fulfil all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to ſalvation, by the help of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt clear doctrins of <hi>Proſper</hi> are theſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102345:6"/>
               <hi>No man is predeſtinate to ſin: From the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predeſtinate alſo, original ſin is taken away by baptiſmal grace, and he that denies it is no catholick: Such as are not predeſtinate are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not predeſtinate, becauſe they were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known what they would be.</hi> i. <hi>revolters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out correction of penitence. All are rightly ſaid to be redeemed, but not all delivered out of captivity: God would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledg of the truth but they that come, are directed by Gods help; they that come not, reſiſt by their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy: and the word</hi> All <hi>is to be understood univerſally. There is given always to all men a certain meaſure of doctrin, though of more ſparing and more ſecret grace, yet ſufficient to ſome for remedy, to all for teſtimony; or</hi> (as it is elſe where explained,) <hi>The Grace of God is preſent to all men, by a various work and in a divers meaſure: Help is given to all by innumerable ways, To all is afforded a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of general aid; it is their own wickedneſs whereby it is refuſed by many; that it is by many received, is the work of divine Grace and of humane will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the definition of <hi>Fulgentius: God, to ſhew what he foreknew to be rendred, and what to be given, predeſtinated them to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom he fore new to depart from him
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102345:6"/>by the pravity of their evil Will; and predeſtinated them to a Kingdom, whom be foreknew to believe in him by the aid of preventing Mercy, and to abide in him by the aid of ſubſequent Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of <hi>Auſtin</hi> many places might be alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, even from his latter Writings, wherein he declareth, <hi>That Free-will is helped and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Grace, not taken away.</hi> Certainly, no diligent Reader of the Ancients will deny this: That <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, <hi>Proſper, Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and as many Catholick Writers as were either before or after them, held and taught this Doctrine: <hi>Many juſtified and regenerated Perſons do not perſevere in Faith which worketh by Love, and ſome fall irrecoverably.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things written by <hi>Molinaeus</hi> do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with theſe, let ſuch as are skilful in them judge.</p>
            <p>This is manifeſt to me; in the antient Church it was the cuſtom, to place in their <hi>Creeds</hi> only thoſe things, wherein Catholick Writers always had agreed, omitting ſuch as approved Authors had in doubt. And this way (as to me it ſeemeth) the <hi>Arauſican</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers took, and <hi>Coeleſtinus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with aſſent doubtleſs of the moſt learned Prieſts then at <hi>Rome;</hi> and before theſe, the Biſhops who met at <hi>Dioſpolis,</hi> at <hi>Carthage,</hi> at <hi>Milevis; Innocentius</hi> alſo, and <hi>zoſimus,</hi> Roman
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102345:7"/>Biſhops all, conſulted about theſe very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. Whoſe modeſty (to ſpeak with <hi>Molinaeus</hi>) it is far better to imitate, than to adhere ſtifly to preconceived Opinions, or to pluck away from the Unity of the Church thoſe who have probable Reaſons of a divers judgment in ſubtile Controverſies.</p>
            <p>But to believe that <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus, Iuſtin, Cyprian, Martyrs;</hi> and then <hi>Athanaſius, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil, Gregory Nyſſen, Nazianzen, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, Ambroſe, Ierom,</hi> are to be condemned by us, as injurious to Gods grace, and as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowers of the Saints Confidence and Conſolation, that cannot I as yet induce into my mind.</p>
            <p>In the Writing of <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> I find many things right and ſober; nor doubt I, but if our Miniſters would imitate his prudence, we ſhould have the Church much more at Peace than now it is. But the things which in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reading again, came into my conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are as followerh.</p>
            <p>He ſets down this as a moſt certain Truth, <hi>Many things are done neceſſarily which are done freely.</hi> I think not ſo. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily good.</hi> This is true; <hi>yet freely.</hi> This I cannot acknowledge: For, <hi>that is free which is undetermined to either ſide.</hi> But God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by his Nature, <hi>i.</hi> by the Deity it ſelf
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102345:7"/>to good. So that it involvs a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſay; <hi>He is God,</hi> and <hi>He can be not good. God cannot lye</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: Therefore he is not free in not lying. True, God is (<hi>ſponte</hi>) ſpontaneouſly veracious: But not all things that are done ſpontaneouſly, are done (<hi>libere</hi>) freely, as Philoſophers well note. Many are deceived, by not diſcerning twixt the quality or general nature of Action, and the ſingle kinds thereof. God created Man freely, redeemed him freely; and freely, in this or that manner, declar'd his Goodneſs. But this is not to be freely good, but to demonſtrate his goodneſs freely ſo or ſo. And the Devil does evil neceſſarily, ſince by a free act he caſt himſelf into this neceſſity: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs in vexing <hi>Job,</hi> in tempting <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he acteth freely: for he might be evil, and not do evil in that kind. Likewiſe, a man ſold under ſin, ſins neceſſarily, not freely: he cannot but ſin: but he is an Adulterer free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a Murtherer freely, a Thief freely. Nor can I grant, to the ſettling of liberty 'tis ſufficient to take away Coaction: for <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is not leſs contrary to <hi>liberty</hi> than <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action</hi> is. This does outwardly <hi>determine,</hi> that inwardly, and therefore cauſes the thing done to be done <hi>not freely.</hi> Neither is it free for a man, not to ſee, having his eyes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102345:8"/>open: becauſe the nature of the eye and things viſible is ſuch, that he cannot chuſe but ſee. But methinks they labour in vain, who ſtudy to reconcile things eſſentiall differing, ſuch as are <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>free</hi> (for liberty is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of contingency) by reſpects. That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeemeth to me moſt true, eſpecially if we ſpeak of the ordinary way of Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: <hi>In whatſoever manner God moveth our wills, yet hath the will its liberty, and things have their contingency,</hi> as <hi>Molinaeus</hi> excellently ſaith. But he that ſaith ſo, muſt withall ſay; <hi>The will is not moved by God in the way of predetermination,</hi> For, that cannot be free, which to one ſide is predetermined and limited by any of the cauſes, and chiefly by the firſt cauſe, upon whoſe efficacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend all inferior cauſes in their working: nor can any thing be contingent of which it may be ſaid; 'Tis impoſſible for it not to be: But'tis impoſſible for the effect predetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be, predetermination being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>I do alſo approve that which <hi>Molinaeus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms: <hi>He is diſervedly condemn'd, who abuſeth the Seeds naturally ſown in him, and does not uſe them in what manner and how far he might have done.</hi> But what if he doth uſe the ſeeds in what manner and how far he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102345:8"/>having the Divine aid of that meaſure which unto none is denyed? Shall he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned nevertheleſs? He cannot then be ſaid to be condemned for abuſing, if having rightly uſed them he be nevertheleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Molinaeus</hi> enquires, if any one, living in the moſt remote parts of the World, do make good uſe of the <hi>firſt Grace,</hi> whether God will ſend a Preacher to him, or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. Suppoſe the Anſwer be affirmative, I know not how it can be refuted. For the hand of the Lord is not ſhortned. But he ſaith, it never comes to paſs. How knows he that? Becauſe we read it not. As if we had the Hiſtories of thoſe Nations; or, if we had, the things befalling every particular perſon, as the ſending of an Angel, were wont to be related in Hiſtories; when they uſe not often to come to the knowledge, no not of the next neighbours. And I ſee not how this can be deny'd to happen. Did not God appear to <hi>Abraham,</hi> living amongſt the <hi>Chaldeans?</hi> Did he not appear to <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech?</hi> If you ſay, theſe did not make a right uſe of common gifts: I ask a reaſon, why we ſhould believe God would ſhew his power leſs to ſuch as do make that uſe, than to ſuch as do not. Have not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102345:9"/>have not the Apoſtles preached the Word to many Nations, wherein were ſome perſons, if not well uſing, certainly leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumaciouſly abuſing common gifts. To <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> the Centurion, praying and giving Alms (which by Grace one may do, who does not yet believe in Chriſt, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> expreſly ſaith of <hi>Cornelius</hi>) there is ſent both an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel and an Apoſtle. Who can aſſure us, God is leſs willing now to do ſo, or leſs able? Indeed, <hi>Cornelius</hi> was already endued with the ſpirit of the Law delivered by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> But 'tis confeſt, the Law written in the hearts of men, and the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer only in the manner of delivery, and the degree of clearneſs, not in ſubſtance: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo this Law the ſpirit is ready to aſſiſt, calling to repentance: and I ſee not how he may be refelled, who believes God will cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate the uſe of this gift with greater, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that general ſentence, <hi>Whoſoever hath,</hi> i. makes uſe of former gifts, <hi>to him ſhall be given,</hi> i greater gifts ſhall be granted.</p>
            <p>Neither is he guilty of a new opinion, who thinks ſo of the Divine Goodneſs. For 'tis the ſaying of <hi>Proſper: There have been, and are gifts of this ſort ſo general, that by their evidence men might be further'd in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102345:9"/>the true God: unto which gifts, in all Ages witneſſing the Author, the bounty of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace hath been ſuperadded.</hi> And <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith: <hi>'Tis not reckon'd to thee as a fault, that thou art ignorant againſt thy will, but that thou doſt neglect to ſeek after that whereof thou art ignorant: nor, that thou doſt not cloſe up thy wounds, but that thou contemneſt him who is willing to heal them.</hi> Bullinger ſaith: <hi>No Nation wanted true Religion, if they would have uſed it.</hi> Muſculus: <hi>They have knowledge fit to lead them to the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and would lead them, did they not binder it by their Idolatry.</hi> Mattyr: <hi>The Heathens were inexcuſable, becauſe they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed not what was within their power.</hi> And after all, if one had a mind to maintain, that the Apoſtolical Preaching came unto all the Nations of the World, and the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps thereof are not wholly worn out, no not among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Tartarians;</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments would not be wanting, and ſuch as are of moment. But this would be a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion rather Hiſtorical then Theological.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Merit of Congruity,</hi> as the Papiſts call it, is very juſtly condemned by <hi>Molinaeus:</hi> but I ſuppoſe he includes not in that name this opinion: <hi>That it is congruous, or agreeable unto the Divine will, without merit, to confer
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102345:10"/>upon a man greater gifts, who uſes former gifis, even before faith, as well as he can.</hi> For this opinion wholly excludeth <hi>merit.</hi> I. Becauſe that very uſe is not from the ſtrength of nature, but from the ſtrength given by prevenient Grace to one, not only meriting no good, but all evil. 2. Becauſe, not the worthineſs of mans act obtains the greater benefit, but the undeſerved bounty of God affords it, Grace for Grace. 3. Becauſe this is the nature of <hi>merit,</hi> that whatſoever is given in the way of merit, merit is the cauſe thereof; and for that reaſon it is given, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe not given: But now, the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, and the gifts attending on it, happen to very many who have foully abuſed former gifts; ſo that an adequat rule of this conceſſion cannot be taken from the uſe of former Grace. And this is mainly urged by the Fathers, to ſhew that the Grace of the Goſpel is not given becauſe of merit. For that which without any prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent obligation, without any diſcriminating ſign, is common to him who rightly uſeth former gifts, and to him that does not; that muſt needs be a pure and mere gift, as well in the one ſort as in the other.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Free will,</hi> hath no ſtrength from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto ſpiritual good: that Grace is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102345:10"/>(<hi>i. actu ſecundo</hi>) to give <hi>not to reſiſt,</hi> and <hi>to will</hi> it ſelf: that our ſalvation is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Divine gift: that when we follow God calling, we owe it to the Grace of God: and in other things which are well ſaid by <hi>Molinaeus</hi> to the honor of Grace, I am of his mind. They are all without controverſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>But, though a man not yet regenerate be able to do no ſpiritual work, i. truly and properly ſuch: though no man without faith can pleaſe God, i. to Juſtification: yet does it not follow hence, that a man excited by prevenient Grace (not at preſent regenerate) cannot, by the power of that Grace, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which the Divine Goodneſs may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, ſo far, as to carry on the doer to that Grace without which he cannot be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. Wherefore, whereas <hi>Molinaeus</hi> ſaith; It is impious to hold any degree of <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Grace,</hi> without faith in Chriſt: 'tis very true, if you underſtand Grace <hi>immediately</hi> ſufficient unto ſalvation, or remiſſion of ſins. And yet, <hi>Proſper</hi> is not to be accus'd, nor they that with <hi>Proſper</hi> affirm; The more general Grace preceding faith is ſufficient to a remedy, underſtanding a <hi>remote</hi> ſufficiency: becauſe that Grace is apt to lead one by the hand (as 'twere) to further Graces, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102345:11"/>by Gods order is ſufficient to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe, I conceive it is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that before faith it ſelf, there do in ſome precede certain <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> (effected doubtleſs by virtu of Grace prevenient) which are not found in other men. For when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Job. 7.17. If any one will do the will of my Father, be ſhall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God:</hi> He plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetteth an obedient temper of mind, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to faith it ſelf. So are ſome perſons ſaid to be <hi>not far from the Kingdom of heaven, Marc.</hi> 12.37. to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>well diſpoſed</hi> to the Kingdom of God, <hi>Lu.</hi> 9.62. to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. of a more <hi>generous nature, Act.</hi> 17.11. And this affection being the effect of <hi>Grace,</hi> ſome do apply here that text <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. where 'tis ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>well ordered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi> unto life eternal, and affected with a ſerious deſire thereof, believed: and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Job.</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that is of God</hi> (by this pious inclination) <hi>heareth the words of Chriſt,</hi> with aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt of faith. This ſurely is plain beyond denial: to read the holy Scriptures, to weigh them diligently, to meditate of their meaning, to frequent Godly Sermons, to compoſe himſelf to prayers, is in the power of a man, haply now at the point of new
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102345:11"/>Birth, and not yet fully born again.</p>
            <p>I aſſent alſo unto <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> none of the Reformed (as I ſuppoſe) gainſaying: That the <hi>Elect</hi> reſiſt not the call unto the end: no, nor can reſiſt it, in the conjoyned ſenſe (but all the doubt is about the ſenſe divided) and the reaſon is, becauſe God (as <hi>Molinaeus</hi> himſelf confeſſeth) ſo bows the will, as not to take away the liberty of the will.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion is, whether to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of man, any <hi>previous</hi> action of God be neceſſarily required (I ſay <hi>previous,</hi> for of the <hi>concomitant</hi> there's another reaſon) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the conceſſion of ſufficient ſtrength. For (ſay ſome) either ſomething more is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and then what was granted is denied, the ſtrength is not ſufficient; or the ſtrength is <hi>really</hi> ſufficient; and then it follows, that nothing more is requir'd. But, ſufficient ſtrength being granted, the will remains <hi>free,</hi> i. indeterminate, to do or not to do.</p>
            <p>This for the elect, or ſuch as are actually converted: but for others, who are not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally converted, the cauſe <hi>why Grace is ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious,</hi> many think it hard to attribute unto God, ſince in no wiſe it ſeemeth <hi>Grace</hi> which is inefficacious by Intention of the Giver. Nor doth it ſeem poſſible, that any one ſhould be puniſht more heavily for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102345:12"/>that which was impoſſible to be done: namely, for not making that grace efficacious, which was in itſelf, at leaſt in relation to the ſubject, inefficacious. Nor does it ſeem to theſe men enough, to avoid the making God the Author of unbelief, (which <hi>Molinaeus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives may be avoided by caſting the cauſe upon mans <hi>nature</hi>) but withal care muſt be had of this alſo, leſt the <hi>ſignos</hi> of Gods will be made to diſagree with his will, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury be done to the Divine ſimplicity and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. For how ſhall they be ſaid <hi>called ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,</hi> who are called with this mind, that they may not come; yea ſo, that they cannot come.</p>
            <p>Here now do thoſe Scriptures offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felves to hand: <hi>I deſire not the death of a ſinner, but that he be converted and live. What could I have done for my Vineyard, which I have not done? How often would I have gathered you, and you would not!</hi> and ſuch like, which do, both on Gods part, prove ſome will at leaſt of converting; and on mans part not convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, argue a fault, not ſimply natural, and ſo neceſſary (as 'tis neceſſary for a ſtone, not to live, ſaith <hi>Molinaeus</hi>) but evitable by thoſe helps which were granted, or were ready to be granted. For to thoſe alſo, who being called to the Wedding would not come, all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102345:12"/>things yet are ſignified to be in readineſs. And verily, unleſs it be ſo, it ſeems a man may be puniſht for his ſin that hinders him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; but cannot be puniſht more heavily for this, that (ſuppoſing ſin, and this ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitabl hindring) be believed not.</p>
            <p>That ſaying which <hi>Molinaeus</hi> diſlikes: <hi>It is in man to follow Gods calling, or not to follow:</hi> though it may have a dangerous ſenſe, is not yet without great Authors, and therefore may receive a benign interpretation. <hi>They which are halped to believe,</hi> ſaith Proſper, <hi>have it in their power to come.</hi> Auſtin: <hi>Neither ought they to aſcribe unto themſelves, who are come, becauſe they came being called; nor they that would not come, to lay the fault upan ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but on themſelves alone; becauſe being called, it was in their free power to come.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>we have the beginning of our Salvation by Gods compaſſion; 'tis in our power to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in the ſaving inſpiration.</hi> Wherefore the ſame Father explains <hi>the calling according to purpoſe</hi> by that manner of calling, as is fit for one to be called that he may follow, not ſo as being called he cannot chuſe but follow. And although the ſame <hi>Auſtin</hi> very often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes vocation by <hi>ſwaſion,</hi> yet I think all Pious men will grant to <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> God doth not work by <hi>mere ſuaſions,</hi> not only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102345:13"/>the mind, but upon the Will, by inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalutary aftections, and not by changing the property of the will concreated with it.</p>
            <p>To that Queſtion touched by <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> Why unto ſome the Goſpel is not preached, or being preached, their Heart is not opened to believe? I ſee the antient Fathers have anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer'd two ways, in a double reſpect. For if it be abſolutely enquir'd, Why unto ſome people of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> the Goſpel was not preached at this or that time? The anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is, becauſe of their voluntary ſins; ſins of that fort, for which God threatens he will ſend a Famine of the Word. Likewiſe, if in be enquir'd, why God hardens ſome to whom the Goſpel is preached? the Anſwer is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had harden'd themſelves before. For, as <hi>Austin</hi> ſpeaks; <hi>Then began they to deſerve puniſhment, when being call'd they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to come.</hi> But if the Queſtion be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd comparatively, Why to theſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is preach'd rather than to thoſe? Why this mans heart is touched with more Virtue than the others? Here it cannot be anſwer'd, ſo as to give a general Reaſon in either caſe from man: For tis certain greater Benefits do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fall to them who are the more undeſerving perſons: Recourſe muſt be had in this affair to the Divine Liberty.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:102345:13"/>
            <p>Next, as to the <hi>certainty of Salvation,</hi> I do exceedingly approve that which is ſet down by <hi>Molinaeus.</hi> 1. That there are ſome degrees of true Faith which are overthrown. 2. That ſome Elect ones doubt of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 3. That there is a certain pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar degree of Faith, which never fails. 4. That full Aſſurance is to be earneſtly beg'd of God. For, hence I collect. 1. That the Faith which fails, and which doth not fail, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not ſo much in eſſence as degree; which alſo was the Opinion of <hi>Iunius.</hi> 2. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> obtain'd for us perſeverance, and it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd by God on this condition, that we ask and beg it with our earneſt prayers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not at all abſolutely But, not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with ambiguity of words, we muſt note; all the Antients ſo affirm that Faith which may be overthrown, to be true Faith, as not to deny to it the effect alſo of Juſtification. For they openly pronounce: Many are damned for latter ſins, to whom the former were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: Nor do they leſs conſent to this, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Grace cannot at the ſame time conſiſt with ſins againſt Conſcience, as Murther, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, and ſuch like. Wherefore, being ſome elect, after the gift of Faith received, fall into fins of this ſort, as by too many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples it is evident; it follows, and is clearly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102345:14"/>pronounced by the Holy Fathers, that there may be ſome time after Faith received, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Perſon elect may not be in the ſtate of Juſtification. Theſe things, if need were, might be prov'd by many authorities, and by the confeſſions of Proteſtants. See <hi>Confeſſ. Auguſt Art</hi> 11. <hi>Angl 16. Sax</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>The antient Authors ſeem to me to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge three ways of certainty concerning Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The firſt whereof is extraordinary, by Revelation: this <hi>Austin</hi> ſaith, happens to ſome: <hi>what man can know he ſhall perſevere to the end in the work and way of Righteouſneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be aſſured by ſome Revelation from him, who by his juſt and ſecret judgment in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doth not instruct all, but deceiveth none.</hi> The ordinary ways are two; the one taken from the time, the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her from the degree of Faith. Certainty of his salvation a faithful man may have from the time, who is at the point of death, and hath now no hope of life. For, being a Believer knows he doth believe, and withal knows a Believer is juſtified before God (both which by the teſtimony of Holy Scripture, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pious Antiquity, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt the Papiſts) and this time of life is at an end, the Believer knows he dyeth in the ſtate of Grace, and ſo is certain of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. In reſpect whereof, <hi>Proſper</hi> having
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102345:14"/>ſaid predeſtination is uncertain to us, addeth <hi>whilſt we are among the perils of this preſent life.</hi> The other ordinary manner of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is from the degree of Faith. For, the Antients do conſtantly deliver, that perfect Charity (according to the perfection of this life, for the moſt perfect, ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> is not attained here) never fails. Notable is that of <hi>Jerom: Charity which Peter before is dental bad, was an herb, and ſprings up young in every one before it is ſtrengthened; and before its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, is loſt and recovered.</hi> This is that root, which though the Sun, ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſhine hot upon it, cannot wither. And to the ſame purpoſe he asketh, <hi>which of the multitude of Believers can preſume, himſelf is in the number of the predeſtinate:</hi> for naming <hi>the multitude,</hi> he ſeemeth to except ſome few excellent ones.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe three ways of certainty, there are other degrees inferior: For, as <hi>Bernard</hi> himſelf alſo doth acknowledge with all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, God hath not left his Elect without a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of conſolation in this life. This teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony the more and greater are the exerciſes of Piety, is ſo much the more certain, which the holy Scripture demonſtrates plainly, when we are commanded to make our calling and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection firm and s;ure, by Faith, Virtue, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102345:15"/>Continence, Patience, Piety, Love and Charity: whence that ſaying of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> agreeing with the Antients, <hi>Fear is ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated as Charity is encreaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed now to that part of the Writing, where <hi>Molinaeus</hi> ſeparates himſelf from thoſe, who againſt all Antiquity affirm, Men are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to this end that they may periſh; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Reprobation</hi> before the fall, put upon themſelves a neceſſity of attributing to God the efficacious procurement of all ſins, even of the firſt ſin alſo: becauſe, he that abſolutely ſets the end, ought withal to ſet the means, without which there is no coming unto the end. Here the moſt learned man, walking heedfully, does with a little fear declare his judgment, ſaying, he digeſteth not ſuch kind of ſpeaking: to wit, becauſe they are perſons of great Autority that ſo ſpeak. But truly. the danger is not in the form of vvords, but in the Doctrine it ſelf. For, that Opinion direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runs into the <hi>Anathema</hi> of the <hi>Arauſican</hi> Council, boldly pronounced by <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and <hi>Proſper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here it is to be admired; whereas all they that deduce ſins from a fatal neceſſity, were by the antient Church caſt unto the <hi>Manichees</hi> the worſt and moſt hated Hereticks; but the <hi>Semipelagians</hi> were ſuffered very long in their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102345:15"/>Communion; why at this day, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſuch as make God partly unjuſt, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unmerciful, partly the Author of all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, live freely without cenſure: But, if any man do concieve more meanly of Grace, though not near to Pelagianiſm, all do every where riſe againſt him with equal animoſity. Is the fault ſo much leſs, to load the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor with contumelies, than to deny the benefit?</p>
            <p>Rightly indeed, and agreeably both to the <hi>Gallic</hi> and <hi>Belgic</hi> Confeſſion doth <hi>Molinaeus</hi> pronounce, <hi>Reprobation is not but in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt maſs.</hi> But this corrupt Maſs, ſome conſider in original ſin alone, catching that which is ſpoken of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> albeit that very ſpeech is ſuch as goeth afore of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſmael,</hi> which the apoſtle himſelf elſe where declares to be Allegorical. (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.) It was, I confeſs, <hi>Auſtin's</hi> opinion, which diſpleaſes moſt of the Reformed; That ſome children dying in their Infancy are damned for original ſin. But <hi>Auſtin</hi> could not think this of <hi>Eſau:</hi> becauſe, in his opinion, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin was taken away by circumciſion. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conſider the corrupt Maſs in actual ſins: to whom <hi>Molinaeus</hi> ſeems to conſent when he ſaith, ſome men are deſignd to puniſhments for ſins which willingly and by <hi>by God unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102345:16"/>they have admitted. Laſtly, ſome there are that conſider this corrupt Maſs, not in any ſort of ſins, but in the contempt of Vocation: for whom that ſentence of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> concerning the ſame <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſeems to ſtand; <hi>He did not will, he did not run: but if he had willed and runned, he had attained by the help of God, who would give him to run and to will by calling, unleſs by contempt of the call he would become a reprobate.</hi> Out of this ſentence therefore might be added to the words of <hi>Molinaeus by God unprovok'd,</hi> yea and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly invited to repentance.</p>
            <p>Hither have I been carried unaware (for when I began to write I purpoſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch in brief) by the relection of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, wherein the ſentiments of <hi>Molinaeus</hi> are contain'd. Of which I was not willing to deliver my own Judgment: nor would I have you think ſo. But, as it is a pleaſure to me to compare the antient Writers with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, ſo I eſteem'd it worth my pains, moſt noble Sir, to advertiſe you of that which (if I am not much deceiv'd) by my not indili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reading I have learned, the Judgment of the Fathers touching theſe controverſies. You may, ſo judicious you are, collate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of the antient and more recent Authors one with other; and ſo far as your
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102345:16"/>buſineſs will permit, conſider which of their different Interpretations is more conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the ſacred Context, to Reaſon by God illuminate, and to the edification of Gods Church.</p>
            <p>In the Writing of <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his ſentence, follows a Collection of certain Articles, wherein he thinks the parties will eaſily agree. Of ſome things in them I have already made my Remarks, as may appear by what I have ſaid before, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anticipated them leſt the matter ſhould be ſevered. What remains ſhall now be added.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Free will,</hi> by the fall of our firſt Parents, is rightly ſaid, to be loſt in reſpect of pious actions, as it hath no ſtrength to actions of that kind: not ſo, as to ſignifie the native li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is not in the will, without which it cannot be a will, and by which it cannot will and <hi>nill</hi> ſuppoſing all prerequiſits, i. ſtrength to will being granted. Therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith. <hi>Who among us affirms, that by the ſin of the firſt man, free will periſhed from all mankind?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ad Boniſ. <hi>I. 1.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>46</hi>
               </note> And to exclude here all together pious actions, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayings will not permit. <hi>If no grace of God, how doe; he ſave the world? if no free will, how does he judge the world?</hi> And, <hi>The
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102345:17"/>Divine precepts would be profitable to no man, had he no free choice of will.</hi> Alſo, <hi>The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith denies not free will neither to good life nor bad;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">de gra. and lib. arbis. c. 2.</note> 
               <hi>nor attributes to it any power without grace.</hi> Elſewhere, <hi>He that denies free will is not a Catholick: but he is a Catholick, who ſaies that without God it can neither begin nor finiſh any good work.</hi> By which ſaying 'tis not ſignified, that by nature we have <hi>to will well</hi> (which is Pelagian) but by nature we have this thing <hi>to will:</hi> which being inform'd by grace, <hi>we will well.</hi> For grace is the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from which, the will or free choice is the principle in which converſion is made. That of <hi>Auſtin: No will of man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth God being willing to ſave:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">De fide ad Pet.</note> is ſo to be explained, that another ſentence of his lately cited be not contradicted: where he ſaith, <hi>It is imputed to many that they contemn God willing to heal.</hi> There is then a certain Will conditionate, which <hi>Proſper</hi> calls <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting:</hi> there is alſo an abſolute Will, which follows a certain, at leaſt conditionate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>That of <hi>Molinaeus, whom God hath predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to the end,</hi> i. Salvation, <hi>he hath predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to the means;</hi> ſeemeth plainly to define, that before he determines any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102345:17"/>Faith, he determines abſolutely to ſave <hi>this</hi> man. Which definition ſegregates from us all the Fathers before <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Whether it agrees with <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, is diſputed: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perchance the word <hi>predeſtination</hi> be ſo generally taken, as to comprehend alſo that which is not abſolute, but which the means ſuppoſed paſſeth into abſolute.</p>
            <p>Concerning the word <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> we have already ſpoken. That none of them can periſh, whom God hath predeſtinated to the Kingdom; none by any means be ſaved, whom he hath not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated unto life, is fully true in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned ſenſe, what way ſoever predeſtination, ſo it be abſolute, is taken: but in the divided ſence 'twill be true, if this were true that reprobation is without preſcience of a free act: which <hi>Molinaeus</hi> ſeemeth to deny. Surely, <hi>Proſper</hi> was not afraid to ſay, <hi>Becauſe they are foreknown the predeſtinate will not fall:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ad obj. Vinc. reſp. 12. Ad Oan. Gal. 7. I. Sent. ſup. cit. c. 7.</note> And, <hi>They ſhould be predeſtinate if they would return and perſevere in holineſs.</hi> Again, <hi>Becauſe he foreknew they would fall by their own will, for this he did not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from the Sons of perdition by any predeſtination.</hi> Again, Therefore were they not predeſtinate, becauſe they were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102345:18"/>that they after would be ſuch by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary prevarication. I will add this on the by; the Book <hi>De fide ad Petrum,</hi> out of which is cited that newly mentioned ſentence, is by the learned thought not to be the work of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and that upon weighty ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p>That which is ſaid, <hi>God hath elected the prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate to believe,</hi> is well ſaid, ſince every benefit unto which not all attain, is juſtly ſignified in Scripture by the word <hi>election.</hi> Neither yet does it follow hence, that the ſame men can no way be ſaid to be elected, i. to be juſtified becauſe they believe, if the word <hi>becauſe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note not the cauſe deſerving, but in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner anteceding. In the ſame manner, he ſheweth mercy to us that we may be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: nor yet muſt we deny, there is ſome mercy following faith, and therefore ſhewed to the faithful, as ſuch. God by giving faith makes men hear the Goſpel worthily: but yet we muſt not therefore deny, God out of his immenſe goodneſs, whereby he converts many long contumacious, will not purpoſely exclude from that benefit the leſs contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſuch as diligently read and hear his word: Neither ſeems it fit to be denied, that ſuch as do attentively hear the Preachers of Gods word, are leſs unworthy of the gift
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102345:18"/>of faith, than ſuch as ſtop their ears like the hearers of St. <hi>Steven.</hi> Thus in the Goſpel, the Apoſtles coming into any City or Village are bid to enquire, who in that place is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: to whom they are oppoſed as unworthy, who will not receive the Apoſtles, nor give audience to the word. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. And in the <hi>Acts</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſaid, then at laſt to have judged themſelves unworthy of eternal life (i. by a greater and more ſpecial unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) after they were filled with wrath, and contradicted the word, and that with blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. But, if any man, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not figuratively or comparatively, ſay there is in the unregenerate any ability to do that whereby he may be worth) to attain to faith, that his opinion is dangerous none I think will deny.</p>
            <p>Now whereas <hi>Molinaeus</hi> ſaith, the Cauſes why he hath elected theſe, not elected thoſe, are with God, and not anxiouſly to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd by us; firſt he ſeems to intimate, that the only and univerſal cauſe of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination is not the divine pleaſure: For this cauſe were open enough, to exclude other cauſes whatſoever. And when he ſaith, they are not anxiouſly to be enquir'd, he ſeems to grant, they may be enquir'd, at leaſt in ſome manner: which ſeems not far
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102345:19"/>from that opinion of <hi>Auſtin</hi> (which many think was retracted by him) where he ſaith, the cauſe why this perſon rather than that is reprobated, proceedeth <hi>from our own merits.</hi> Becauſe the groſſer <hi>Papiſts</hi> refer the word <hi>merit</hi> to the nature of the work and to commutative juſtice, we do upon very good grounds not dare to uſe this word. The Fathers took <hi>to merit</hi> for that which is <hi>to obtain</hi> by doing ſomewhat; and <hi>merit</hi> for a pious work unto which is a due reward by liberal and gratious promiſe. So, the word being molified, we ſhall leſs wonder now, if among the Fathers more antient than <hi>Auſtin</hi> we find, man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate for merits. For they ſpeake of an abſolute decree of giving glory by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. whence <hi>Ambroſe: whoſe merits he hath foreknown, their rewards he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">De fide 5.3.</note> To conclude this part: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, I am of <hi>Molinaeus's</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in theſe controverſies ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle may be contrived, to which the <hi>French, Engliſh, Belgians, Helvetians,</hi> embracing the more pure Religion, will ſubſcribe: and the Article may beſt be taken out of the <hi>Arauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Council, and out of <hi>Proſper</hi> Sentences <hi>ad capitula Gallorum</hi> And I think this ought to be the ſcope. <hi>That in good the honor of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102345:19"/>grace may be kept inviolate; in evil, man may accuſe himſelf, and not draw God at all into the Society of his crime.</hi> Moreover, <hi>That man may be taught, neither to diſtruſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aſſiſtance, nor ſeek ſecurity in any other way but in the ſtudy of piety.</hi> Withal, I would wiſh that ſobriety to be uſed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining queſtions, that a fit reſpect may not only be had for <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Proſper,</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> but alſo that men may abſtain from condemning thoſe ſentences, in which 'tis manifeſt moſt holy men liv'd and dv'd; who after the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in the Ages moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous for all piety, edified the Church of Chriſt by their words and writings, by their life and blood.</p>
            <p>I am now come to the laſt part, which is concerning the <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi> And here <hi>Molinaeus</hi> ſaith pleaſantly, He is eaſed by me, becauſe I am forward to teach him what ought to be his Opinion. Wherein he ſhews himſelf much miſtaken in my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For my intent was, neither to teach him (whom I thought fit to be admoniſht by your Honor, as from your ſelf, touching ſome things, and that he ſhould never ſee what I had written to you) nor to teach any other, but freely to depoſit my thoughts in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102345:20"/>your boſom, my moſt noble Friend. And that, upon this occaſion: becauſe I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by you, that <hi>Molinaeus</hi> beſtowed upon learned Magiſtrates ſome Right which he would not grant to the leſs learned. That did not pleaſe me, I confeſs: and therefore I gave a clear diſtinction, as it ſeemeth to me, and perſpicuous, between the <hi>right</hi> or power, and the <hi>Aptitude</hi> or Ability. But <hi>Molinaeus</hi> here was ſo far from taking my ſenſe, that he aſcribes to me a meaning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my words. He ſaith, I would have <hi>a right of making laws</hi> to pertain to the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Magiſtrates. I ſaid it not, yea I ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the contrary, <hi>that learning makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the right it ſelf.</hi> He ſaith after, a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator or Judge, if he be a Lawyer, is ſo, as he is a judge. I much diſlike this. For there are many Lawyers, not Judges, and many Judges not Lawyers. The one is a name of office, the other of skill. Take another example. There are many Paſtors (alas!) too unskilful of holy letters. Their office is to interpret Scripture, nor are they without a right, but they have not an Aptitude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to requiſit. Science therefore neither giveth nor encreaſeth right, but to the good uſing of it conduceth much. An unskilful Prince (not to ſpeak yet of <hi>Church-affairs</hi>) hath
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102345:20"/>no leſs right to give commands in civil affairs, and to make laws, than a Prince moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I much admire, theſe things were not conſider'd by a man moſt acute. That which is ſpoken of knowledge, underſtand alſo of probity of mind. He muſt be a good man, that will govern well: but the right it ſelf of governing depends no more upon Virtue, than the dominion of a private e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. For, the covetous man is as well Maſter of his goods, as the liberal; though the liberal rightly uſeth riches, which the covetous abuſeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Molinaeus</hi> ſuppoſed, I would have the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, who ſhall govern the Church, to be <hi>Orthodox.</hi> Really I would, and all rich men to be liberal. He asketh, who ſhall judge whether the Magiſtrate be <hi>Orthodox?</hi> If himſelf, great danger: if others, then will the Magiſtrate be ſubject to others Judgment. I will ask likewiſe, who ſhall judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Magiſtrate be ſufficiently skill'd in civil matters? and if that argumentation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, I will conclude the Magiſtrate to be ſubject to the judgment of the people. I will ask again, when the Magiſtrate muſt apply himſelf to ſome Church, who ſhall judge whether this, or that Church be the more Orthodox? ſhall he, or the Church? If he, there is alſo the ſame danger as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102345:21"/>if the Church, this is to beg the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: for there is no Aſſembly of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which calls not it ſelf a Church, and that Orthodox too. But, ſaith he, an Infidel Magiſtrate will abuſe this example, and uſurp the ſame power. As if, to alledge an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity were to ſolve the Argument. What is there in humane affairs without ſome incommodity? May not I in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſay, if that be given to the Church which I conceive is to be given to the Magiſtrate, an Aſſembly of Heretical Paſtors will alſo abuſe this example and uſurp the ſame right, if any where it prevail, as it hath happened more than once. I will anſwer in the words of <hi>Auſtin: Kings, when they are in Error, make laws for error againſt the truth; and when they are in the truth, make laws for truth againſt error. So are good men tryed by evil laws, and by good laws are evil men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi> You ſee how little <hi>Auſtin</hi> feared that incommodity. And in truth, it is of no moment. <hi>Aurelian</hi> the Emperor was not Orthodox: therefore he could not expell from his Biſhoprick the Heretick <hi>Samoſate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> This conſequence was not perceived by the Holy Fathers, who yielded the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Samoſatenus</hi> to the Emperor ſo far, that the cauſe being examined, they requeſted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102345:21"/>he might by the Imperial autority be dethron'd. Neither would <hi>Paul</hi> have appealed unto <hi>Nero,</hi> had he believed, no right of judging in a caſe of Religion belonged to him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as <hi>Trajan</hi> civilly honeſt, <hi>Nero</hi> wicked, are nevertheleſs equal in the right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo pious <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and impious <hi>Nero</hi> are equal in the right of judging, in aptitude and skill unequal.</p>
            <p>This moſt learned man further enquires, whether by Governing the Church I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand being judge in the heads of faith; or, a power to purge the Church of ſcandals, and to command belief of thoſe things which are contained in the word of God. But I wonder theſe are parted, which do ſeem to me indiſſolubly joyned. For, if it be the office of a King to command, that thoſe things be taught which are true, that ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals be avoided; amongſt which Hereſies have the chief place; how ſhall he do this unleſs he judge, what is true, what is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy. <hi>For the act of commanding reguires the power of judging.</hi> But he ſaith, Thoſe things muſt be commanded to be believed, which are eſtabliſht by the Aſſembly of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors Orthodox. And he that ſays this, does he not ſhew, 'tis at leaſt required to judge who are thoſe Orthodox Paſtors. Now,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102345:22"/>becauſe the examples of King <hi>Edward,</hi> of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> are alledged, I enquire: when there were in <hi>England</hi> Romiſh Paſtors, and there were alſo Reformed; in <hi>Holland</hi> not only Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, but Anabaptiſts alſo and Lutherans; that the Reformed Religion was publickly introduced in both Nations, other being either prohibited or poſtpoſed; did it not ſo come to paſs, becauſe the King, the States, the Prince, judged this Religion pureſt? They embraced then what was ſuggeſted by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Paſtors and demonſtrated by Scripture, not for the Autority of Paſtors (for there were many families of them) but becauſe they judged the things agreeable to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Albeit they underſtood not the knots and ſubtilities of Theology, it was ſufficient that they did caſt off Idolatry and Popiſh Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and other errors, with an aſſured judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>A queſtion follows, impertinent to this place, touching a King, who will with blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous mouth receive the holy myſteries. I anſwer: either this is forbidden by Divine law, or not: If forbidden by Divine law (as I conceive it is, if the King be ſuppoſed not yet repenting) the King will not be ſubject to the Eccleſiaſtick laws, which <hi>Molinaeus</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:102345:22"/>ſaith, but to the Divine, which none denies. The like is in a judge of petty cauſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the King to give ſentence againſt equity. This Judge will not do ſo, if he be wife. Is the King therefore ſubject to the Judge? No verily: but the Judge is ſo ſubject to the King, that he muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, above the earthly King, the Empire of his heavenly King, who forbiddeth injury to be done to any. But, if you ſuppoſe here ſome law, not Divine but poſitive, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from humane will; to this law who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall affirm a King to be ſubject, ſo as to be unable in any caſe to relax the legal bond, he denies him to be a King.</p>
            <p>The Canons of many Synods forbid Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ſeats to be erected into <hi>Metropolitan:</hi> they forbid new Biſhops or <hi>Metropolitans</hi> to be conſtituted, or a Biſhop to do ſacred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in another Dioceſe: they forbid Biſhops to undertake civil imployments. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, by command of the Emperors all this was done very often. The Greek Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters give the reaſon, becauſe the Emperor is not ſubject, neither to the Laws nor Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</p>
            <p>Next, <hi>Molinaeus</hi> enquires, whether the Kings Counſellors muſt be Doctors of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or it be alſo neceſſary for the King to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102345:23"/>be a learned Divine. Verily, my opinion is, that the knowledge of things Divine is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit in a King and in his chief Counſellors; not that he may be a King, They Counſellors, but to the end they may rightly perform the work of their places. But I ſay nor ſuch knowledge, as to diſtinguiſh every truth from falshood (for the greateſt Profeſſor of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology cannot promiſe himſelf this) but to put a <hi>difference between things neceſſary to be believed or done, and things not neceſſary;</hi> between Heretical and not Heretical. And in the ſame manner I conceive, both the knowledge of the laws, and the art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are deſired in a King. But, ſaith <hi>Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> 'tis fit the leſs learned be taught by the more learned. This argument, if it prove the leſs learned muſt ſubmit to the judgment of the more learned, then in Synods alſo the Paſtors ought to yield to the Doctors: for <hi>Molinaeus</hi> names them as men of the greateſt learning. And yet 'tis certain, that Paſtors have not leſs, if not more right than Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. Our men are wont to uſe the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Panormitan,</hi> that a private perſon's Judgment, confirmed with better autority of Scripture, is to be prefer'd before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Patriarch. To come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, It is indeed the part of the more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102345:23"/>to teach the leſs learned, but not to have command over them. Therefore a Country Judge (as the laws tell us) is not obliged by the Reſponſe of Lawyers; nor is a ſick man bound to the preſcript of his Phyſitian, but ſo far as no reaſon of his own ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades him to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Another queſtion follows. whether a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> may adjoyn himſelf to the leſſer num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Paſtors. Strange, that this ſhould be asked by a Paſtor reformed, ſeeing all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, who have in our age reform'd the Church, rightly believ'd the leſſer number of Paſtors againſt the greater. But in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod <hi>Conſtantine</hi> yielded to the more, and did not addict himſelf to the fewer. Yea, he yielded to the plain and manifeſt truth, which the greater number at that time by Gods bleſſing followed. This doth not always happen: for the greater part oft over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the better. But if ſentences are to be numbred, not weighed, the <hi>Arimin</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of cccc. Biſhops will be of more value than the <hi>Nicene</hi> of cxviii. And what ſhould the Emperor have done, when (as <hi>Jerom</hi> teſtifies) the whole World groaned and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd it was turned <hi>Arian;</hi> was paucity then to be deſpiſed, multitude to be followed? No man in his right mind will ſay ſo. The
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102345:24"/>two Kings are blamed for not believing one <hi>Michaia,</hi> rather than four hundred falſe Prophets. Well then, the different parties are to be heard, but the Prince ought to lend his autority to that cauſe, not which hath moſt ſuffrages, but whoſe equity the vigor of truth well try'd hath commended to him. That Rule, <hi>Every man muſt be believ'd in his own Art,</hi> hath ſome probability, but not perpetual certainty. And there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Arts-men, that often times it is expedient to truſt a few rather than many: So true is the common ſaying, <hi>The worſt are moſt.</hi> Theology indeed is not the proper Art of a King: but the <hi>Art</hi> moſt convenient for him is that which learned Writers call <hi>regal, leading, architechtonical:</hi> whereof the moſt noble part is that which I have named, the knowledge of things Divine; not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to all ſubtilties of the School, nor yet ſtaying within the mean endowments of a private man; but comprehending all the chiefeſt points, and of ſuch a meaſure, that if any thing be wanting, it may be ſupplied by the Miniſtery of others. And I have ſaid before, the like meaſure of other Arts is deſir'd in a King; though I doubt not, if there be any ſcience to which a King ſhould addict his peculiar ſtudy, it is Theology.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102345:24"/>They greatly erre, who do either repreſent, or make it ſo obſcure and difficult, as to deter Princes from that ſtudy, which the Divine law ſo much commends unto them. But if in that reſpect the higheſt power in cauſes Eccleſiatical is to be denied the King, neither will the right of making laws, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being better Lawyers, belong unto him. I fear alſo, that the ſame reaſon will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude many Paſtors from all right of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage.</p>
            <p>I do not well underſtand what <hi>Molinaeus</hi> ſaith of the King of <hi>England.</hi> For he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to be the ſupreme Judge in all Cauſes, as well Eccleſiaſtick as civil, yet not to be the judge of controverſies, nor to own that Title. How Controverſies can be exempt from the univerſal appellation of Cauſes I ſee not, when Judgment is not uſually given but of things controverted. But he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to diſtinguiſh between matters of Faith and other Church-affairs. But, to judge what is an Idol, what is Idolatry, does it not pertain to Faith? Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her brother King <hi>Edward,</hi> preferred the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation above <hi>Papiſm:</hi> not by an ignorant zeal, I ſuppoſe, but with good judgment. Now, the contention between the Papiſts and the Reformed is concerning Articles of Faith.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102345:25"/>The King, whoſe words are alledged, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving from himſelf the judgment about Articles of Faith, did he not hear at Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton Court, the Biſhops on the one ſide, the Puritans on the other? as Arbiter, as Judge? When the Conference was not only of Church Government, but of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and aſſurance of ſalvation. Did he not pronounce what ſeemed to him right? What is it then, that he putteth from himſelf? That authority, which the Pope claimeth, who makes himſelf a Judge infallible, to be believ'd on his own word, without the Scriptures. This Right certainly is due nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to King nor Council. For, neither may a Council be believ'd for it ſelf, but for the teſtimony of Scripture on which it relies: becauſe true Faith of things Divine cannot be had but by Divine authority. This ſenſe of the King, the King himſelf ſhall I ſay, or <hi>Molinaeus</hi> beſt of all explains in his book againſt Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> ſaying, The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors never aſcribed to themſelves abſolute judgment and infallible concerning Doctrin; but that they took knowledge of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of Councils, and not of Diſcipline alone, he there both confeſſes and proves; adding, that the Emperors examin'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nothing was decreed, in the Aſſembly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102345:25"/>of Biſhops, repugnant to former Councils: and that, unleſs this be lawful for a King, the King will be nothing elſe but <hi>Lictor Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it appears ſufficiently, that the Kings judgment is bound to the word of God, but may be inſtructed and led by the Biſhops; yet not ſo, but that he ought to make uſe of his own judgment. And reaſon exacts as much. For no action is good, but which proceeds from the judgment of the doer; and the King, as King, his office is to cheriſh true Doctrine by his laws, and to ſuppreſs the contrary. He ought therefore to have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo of the Doctrine. Nor is here any more attributed to a King than to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man. For private men, for themſelves, by the Word of God, judge of Articles of Faith: but the effects differ, in as much as a King can do more than a private perſon: as alſo the judgment of a Father of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who is chief in a great houſe, is more largly extended than his, who is the poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of a Cottage.</p>
            <p>To that cenſure, where they are called <hi>flatterers</hi> who moved this queſtion in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 'twere eaſy to return one as ſharp, that they are juſtly ſuſpected of affecting a new papacy, who ſo much decline the judgment of the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:102345:26"/>
            <p>What follows, that it might more eaſily be ſuffered that the Magiſtrates ſhould judge of controverſies in Religion, if our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were ſure to have ſuch Magiſtrates as it hath now, I cannot fully approve, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Theſes</hi> ought not to be changed as the Times change: nor is any thing, becauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, the more or leſs true. Herein alſo he is miſtaken, when he oppoſeth a few Magiſtrates to a great aſſembly of Paſtors: For with us the Government is not in the hand of fewer perſons then they who are wont to meet in Synods; who, if they be not as skilful in Theological points as the Paſtors are (though he that thinks ſo knows not what many of our Paſtors be, but grant this) Surely they are, for the keeping of peace and tranquillity much better affected, than they that are the Preachers of peace. For, ſo much as skill conduceth unto judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no leſs doth ſtudy of parties hinder it.</p>
            <p>We do not ſpeak this, that Judgments of Synods ſhould be omitted. No verily: for they are of very great uſe. But for a King to be ſo tyed up with them, that againſt his own conſcience he ought to follow the Synodical decrees, I cannot conſent to this. And theſe matters are under diſpute among
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102345:26"/>us: but in <hi>Germany</hi> and other places the Princes do openly exerciſe this Right, not one of the Paſtors contradicting.</p>
            <p>I muſt now make an end: for if I would caſt into paper whatſoever comes into my mind about this Argument, I ſhould be not ſparing of my own time, and prodigal of yours. This only I proteſt to you in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that concerning predeſtination of Grace, Free will, and other queſtions of this kind, I had rather hear the Judgments of other men than declare my own; but of Magiſtrates I have here ſaid nothing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am not very certain. 1515.</p>
