            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

left unto Posterity, is rather to admire and imitate, then

wrought higher or cleerer. For though our homely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors,

there the <hi>Fancy</hi> seems some time too loose for such Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend

Subject, and to the heat and vigour of their early Witts,

               <head>A Fancie of Love.</head>
               <l>THe Sun had run his race, and now began</l>
               <l>His Steeds to water in the Western Seas,</l>
               <l>When suddenly the sky waxt pale and wan,</l>
               <l>And night drew on the time of rest and ease:</l>
               <l>I lay me down to take my sleep in bed,</l>
               <l>And lo what fancies came into my head.</l>
               <l>Fast by my side there seemed one to stand,</l>
               <l>I know not how possest on every part,</l>
               <l>Possest on either foot, on either hand,</l>
               <l>Possest on head, but most possest on heart;</l>
               <l>Ladies they seem'd, that did divide him so,</l>
               <l>And still at odds both draw him to and fro.</l>
               <l>I sigh to think, how I did sigh in sleep,</l>
               <l>And full of pitty, pittied his estate,</l>
               <l>I scarce can hold to think how he did weep,</l>
               <l>And make complaint of his unhappy fate;</l>
               <l>Yet went I on to see what Dames they were,</l>
               <l>That did the silly soul in pieces tear.</l>
               <l>Upon his heart, his tender heart I saw,</l>
               <l>Love like a Prince sit in a Chair of State,</l>
               <l>Under her feet lay all his thoughts in awe,</l>
               <l>Not daring once their case for to debate;</l>
               <l>The reason was, reason it self was fled,</l>
               <l>And scarce did hold a corner of the head.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:62800:47"/>
Upon this head did foolish fancy sit,</l>
               <l>Devising toyes his Mistris mind to move,</l>
               <l>I never saw the like conceits of wit,</l>
               <l>As thence were sent to get his Mistris love:</l>
               <l>And though he sent unto her more and more</l>
               <l>He never sent the same he sent before.</l>
               <l>On either hand did sit a modest Dame,</l>
               <l>One on the left, another on the right,</l>
               <l>One called <hi>Hope,</hi> the other <hi>Faith</hi> by name,</l>
               <l>Too constant both for love that was but light;</l>
               <l>Yet winged both, as if they would aspire,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> with desert, and <hi>Hope</hi> with hot desire.</l>
               <l>Upon his feet two spitefull ones did sit,</l>
               <l>To weigh him down, &amp; nail him to the ground</l>
               <l>To clog his hope, his faith, his love his wit,</l>
               <l>From getting her to whom he would be bound</l>
               <l>To wit, distrust, that hindred faith to flye,</l>
               <l>Despair, that hindred hope to mount on hye.</l>
               <l>While I stood musing at his wofull case,</l>
               <l>She passed by that puts him to this pain,</l>
               <l>It grieved me to see so sweet a face,</l>
               <l>To bear a hand so armed with disdain,</l>
               <l>And as his faith began to plead desart,</l>
               <l>With her disdain, she thrust him through the heart.</l>
               <l>Do I say him? I feel my self her hand,</l>
               <l>This very wound doth drive my dream away,</l>
               <l>Well may I dream that others by me stand,</l>
               <l>But when I wake, I must the person play:</l>
               <l>Well may I dream this deed by others true,</l>
               <l>But when I wake, it can be none but you.</l>

               <l>A goodly pale it had about it round,</l>
