            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </l>
            <l>Which might our Senſes overjoy'd, alar'm,</l>
            <l>And time give to prepare for ſo great Harm.</l>
            <l>The Spring-tide of our Joy was newly Flood,</l>
            <l>Paying our Thankful Vows for ſo much good</l>
            <l>We gather now, under a gracious KING;</l>
            <l>Inſpired <hi>Bards</hi> began ſtrong Lays to Sing,</l>
            <l>When (ôh ſad Fate!) Ebb'd are our Flowing Seas,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Epiques</hi> chang'd to Doleful <hi>Elegies.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Cruel Extremes! thus robb'd of Joys the chief,</l>
            <l>Thrown down like Light'ning into Seas of Grief.</l>
            <l>'Tis paſt the reach of Mortals to devine,</l>
            <l>Why Heav'n ſo ſoon has broke our <hi>Threefold Line;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>We may not pry without a black offence</l>
            <l>Into th' <hi>Arcana's</hi> of his Providence,</l>
            <l>But may believe, ſince with a Bounteous Hand</l>
            <l>God has reſtor'd the Bleſſings of this Land,</l>
            <l>That he has flung us into Griefs extreme,</l>
            <l>Not out of Wrath to Us, but Love to Him.</l>
            <l>He was Fair Fruit ſprung from a Royal Bud,</l>
            <l>And grown as great by fair Renown as Blood;</l>
            <l>Ripe too too ſoon; for in a Youth ſo green</l>
            <l>An Harveſt was of gray-hair'd Wiſdome ſeen.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Minerva's</hi> Darling, Patron of the Gown,</l>
            <l>Lover of Learning, and <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Crown</l>
            <l>He was; the Muſes he began to nouriſh,</l>
            <l>Learn'd Men and Arts under his wings did flouriſh;</l>
            <l>But leſt we ſhould commit Idolatry,</l>
            <l>Heav'n took him from our Sight, not Memory;</l>
            <l>For though he's carried to th' Immortal Sphere,</l>
            <l>Our Loves will make his Fame Immortal here.</l>
            <l>'Tis Autumn now, and <hi>Ceres</hi> to our hands</l>
            <l>Has pour'd the Annual Bleſſings of our Lands;</l>
            <l>We'ave robb'd the teeming Trees of all their fruit,</l>
            <l>And left them naked till the Spring recruit</l>
            <l>Their ſtore again; till then they hang their head,</l>
            <l>And ſtand like <hi>Mourners, leaves</hi> for <hi>tears</hi> they ſhed;</l>
            <l>So the high powers Cropt from the Royal Stem,</l>
            <l>What was too good for us, and fit for them,</l>
            <l>Whileſt we lament, till a new Spring ariſe,</l>
            <l>And CHARLS his <hi>Firſt-born</hi> clear our weeping eyes.</l>
            <l>A general Sadneſs locks up every Tongue,</l>
            <l>Amazedneſs has ſtruck the <hi>Laureats</hi> dumb:</l>
            <l>And who would weep, through too much Grief for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears,</l>
            <l>Exceſs of Grief gives yet no vent for Tears,</l>
            <l>But when the Coming Springs begin to riſe,</l>
            <l>Grief then will draw a deluge from our Eyes;</l>
            <l>Till then theſe Loyal Drops fall'n into Verſe,</l>
