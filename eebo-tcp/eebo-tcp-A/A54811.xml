         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether kind or unkind, I shall call you neither, for fear lest I be mistaken; However, to You alone (and that without the Patronage of any great Person) I Dedicate this Book; which if it be any ways diverting to You, will answer my expence of Time, and Yours of Mony: if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it is now too late for either to repent. The humour of this Age is such, that a <hi>Dedication</hi> or <hi>Preface</hi> before a Book, and a Grace before a Meal, are thought to be equally necessary, and useful: As if the one was no less a Preservative against the succeeding folly in the Author, than the other against the crooked Pin in the Pudding First then for <hi>Dedications,</hi> their Flattery is so gross and fulsom, that all Men of Ingenuity or Honour must nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seate and abhor them; There you shall see the wise men of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Heroes</hi> of <hi>Troy</hi> laid flat on their backs, when in comparison of our gallant Patron, (perhaps some Country Esquire or Justice) <hi>Aristotle's</hi> a Coxcomb, <hi>Plato</hi> an Ass, <hi>Hercules, Ajax, Achilles, Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> are all but so many Cowards and Striplings: Or if she be a Woman to whom He Addresses Himself, though She be really and truly as ugly as the Devil, and as Whorish as <hi>Thais</hi> her self, yet He has that art of washing a Blackmore white, that with two or three lines of his Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Quill, he can make her more Beautiful than <hi>Helen</hi> of <hi>Troy,</hi> or the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Queen, and more Chaste than <hi>Penelope</hi> her self; Insomuch, that most Dedications differ little from some Funeral Sermons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for a new Mourning Gown, a Gold Ring, and Five or Ten Pounds to the Vicar of the Parish, our beloved Brother [though a Devil in this World,] is made a Saint in the next. Secondly, for <hi>Prefaces,</hi> they ever were, and still are but of two sorts, let other Modes and Fashions vary as they please; Let the prophane long Peruke succeed the godly cropt Hair; the Cravat, the Ruff; Presbytery, Popery; and Popery, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery again, yet still the Author keeps to his old and wonted method of <hi>Prefacing</hi>; when at the beginning of his Book he enters either with an Halter about his Neck, submitting himself to his Readers Mercy whether he shall be hang'd or no; or else in a huffing manner he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with the Halter in his hand, and threatens to hang his Reader, if he gives him not his good Word. This, with the excitement of some
<pb facs="tcp:98416:3"/>
Friends to his undertaking, and some few Apologies for want of Time, Books, and the like, are the constant and usual shams of all Scriblers, as well Antient, as Modern.</p>
            <p>But now as for my part, I enter the Lists upon another score, and think my self oblig'd in Duty to give you some account why <hi>I</hi> have here presented you with so imperfect an History. My Author PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOSTRATUS, Written Originally in Greek, has ever till now of late been esteem'd so inoffensive a Writer, that the most strict <hi>Catholick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors</hi> have never oppos'd either the Reading or Translating of him; Thus we see him already rendred into <hi>Latine</hi> by Monsieur <hi>Morell,</hi> and into <hi>French</hi> by Monsieur <hi>Vigenere</hi>; both which Translations are now Printed in <hi>France</hi> by publick Authority and Approbation. Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could they rationally except against him, as being no more than a bare Narrative of the Life of a Philosopher, not of a new <hi>Messiah,</hi> or any ways in opposition to the old; no, PHILOSTRATUS does not any where so much as mention the name of <hi>CHRIST</hi>; And if one Heathen Writer (HIEROCLES) did make an ill use of this History, by comparing APOLLONIUS with <hi>CHRIST,</hi> what is that to PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOSTRATUS, who never meant nor design'd it so, as I can any where find? However, EUSEBIUS hath already confuted HIEROCLES, which Confutation I had intended to have annext to PHILOSTRATUS by way of Antidote; although to Rational Men, I think there needed none. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if it be objected, (as I know it will,) that it may be of ill Consequence, to let the Vulgar perceive that any other Person acted Miracles besides <hi>MOSES, CHRIST,</hi> and the <hi>APOSTLES;</hi> How comes it then to pass that that passage in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> of the <hi>Magicians,</hi> and that other in the <hi>New</hi> of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> have hitherto esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the <hi>Index Expurgatorius?</hi> Moreover, how came Dr. <hi>More's Mystery of Godliness</hi> to be permitted? wherein he writes a whole comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> and <hi>Apollonius,</hi> setting down at large the Miracles both of the one and the other? Besides, the Scriptures themselves do frequently acknowledge that such Miracles shall be acted by False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as would deceive [if it were possible] the very Elect: So as if the Vulgar were hereby made acquainted with the Miracles of <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> it would be no new thing, but rather advantagious to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, than otherwise, by how much the lustre of a true Diamond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the more beautiful when compar'd with counterfeit Stones. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Philostratus</hi> delivers them with so much of indifferency and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, that he endeavours all that in him lies to withdraw his Readers from the belief of them; to instance only in the last Chapter of his Fourth Book, where, speaking of <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s raising a young Wench from the dead, He there gives you several Natural Reasons to shew how it might be done without a Miracle; and so much for <hi>Philostratus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98416:3"/>Now as to my self, I am so far from comparing him with our Blessed Saviour, or from giving credit to any other <hi>New Miracles,</hi> that my daily request of God is, to give me Faith enough to believe the <hi>old.</hi> But then if it be enquir'd for what Reason I undertook to Translate him; my Answer is, that I thought the many Descriptions in him of remote Countries, and Ancient Customs so far different from our own, as well as the Philosophical Discourses of Morality, might be both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, and beneficial to all those that perused him. There are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious hints of ancient History, vvherein <hi>Philostratus</hi> is esteem'd Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and vvhich <hi>I</hi> had design d to have illustrated by my Notes, had it been permitted me. But <hi>Right</hi> is not a sufficient Argument against <hi>Might</hi>; Therefore 'twas a vvise Caution of the Ass in the Fable, who vvhen there vvas a Lavv made against all horn'd Beasts, fear'd lest his Ears might be expounded to be Horns, since the Exposition of an <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> is unlimited, and its vvays past finding out.

<pb facs="tcp:98416:4"/>
arriv'd at the City of <hi>Delphos,</hi> and looking upon the Priests, he said,
<q>
                  <hi>I may fitly compare You to the Wood which is carry'd upon the Sea; beholding it afar off, we judge it of great value; but when we come near, we slight it: Even so did I, (when far from your City,) admire you; but coming among you, find you to be the most useless of Men.</hi> Now when the <hi>Delphian Priests</hi> heard this, [fearing lest he should disparage them in other places,] they determin'd craftily to take away his life; Whereupon taking a Golden Cup out of <hi>Apollo</hi> s <hi>Temple,</hi> they secretly convey'd it amongst <hi>Esop</hi>'s Baggage, who [not being aware of their Subtilty,] began his Journey to <hi>Phocis,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Delphians</hi> pursuing him, charg'd him with <hi>Sacriledge</hi>: He deny'd the Fact; but they searching his Baggage, and finding the Cup about him, prevail'd with the Ignorant multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude [who knew nothing of the Cheat] to put him to death as a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sacrilegious Person.</q>
Now fearing least some such <hi>Chalice</hi> should be thus thrust into my <hi>Portmantue,</hi> and the silly common People made believe I was a Thief or an Atheist, which might cost me my Life, as it did <hi>Esop</hi>; I thought it my safest way to let the two Milstones of Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Folly, grind on to the end of the World, without interposing my inconsiderable Opinion, which like the small Barly-corn vvould serve only to be ground to pieces it self, vvithout any effect upon the motion of the Stones. 'Tis a thing of most Dangerous Consequence to oppose any Doctrine that is publickly receiv'd, how sottish soever it be; I have often vvonder'd at the obdurate Hearts of some incredulous <hi>Mahometans,</hi> vvho, even to this day persist in that Heresie of believing in the story of the <hi>Seven Sleepers</hi>; that there vvere but Five [besides the Dog] that slept 300 years in a Cave; Whereas the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>CORAN posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively declares, that true Believers affirm them to be Seven, and their Dog to make up the Eighth, vvith a severe <hi>Anathema</hi> upon all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve othervvise. Now for my Part, rather than incur the like <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,</hi> I think it much more safe to believe as the Church believes; And (vvere I a <hi>Mahometan,</hi>) should most vvillingly subscribe that there vvere 800 besides the Dog, if the <hi>Mufti</hi> directed me so to do; But as I am, shall at all times pin my Faith upon my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s sleeve: Wherefore, if the Clergy vvould have APOLLONIUS esteem'd a <hi>Rogue,</hi> and a <hi>Iuggler</hi>; that being risen from the Dead, he is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal fomenters of this <hi>Popish Plot</hi>; or that there never vvas any such Man as APOLLONIUS, vvith all my heart, vvhat they please; For I had much rather have him decry'd in his Reputation, than that some grave <hi>Cardinal,</hi> vvith his long Beard, and Excommunicative <hi>Ha,</hi> should have me burnt for a Heretick. Therefore for these <hi>Weighty Reasons</hi> I have thought fit to Prorogue the remaining part of this History till In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest have no longer need of a <hi>Holy Masque,</hi> and till there be discover'd some nevv Road to the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> vvhere every honest Man

               <hi>Lastly,</hi> As for my <hi>Illustrations</hi>; Notwithstanding they have ever some coherence with my Text, yet I likewise design'd them as <hi>Philological Essays</hi> upon several Subjects, such as the least hint of my Author might present me with; And herein making some occasional Reflections upon the defects of Humane Conversation; it may [as I expect no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise] render me odious to all such guilty Persons whose Follies are here exposed: For instance, <hi>Religion</hi> is a thing Sacred; but he that shews how it is sometimes made a Cloak for Knavery, and how some Men fight the Devils Battle under a counterfeit Banner of Christ, (<hi>ut melius possis fallere, sume Togam,)</hi> Shall render himself a mortal Enemy to Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites. In like manner Honour is Venerable, as being (when justly confer'd) the Reward of Virtue; But he who should tell you that it is somtimes made use of only as <hi>Fullers-earth,</hi> to wash out the stains of an ignoble and base Original, or as a support to the sinking credit of some half-witted rich Heir new launch'd into an Estate, and thus upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Poet,

Whoever (I say) exposes any thing of this Nature, cannot but acquire the ill will of all such who have nothing to shew for their Gentility or Brains, but a <hi>Patent</hi>; and so the like upon all other Subjects. Now the main Scope and Design of <hi>Books</hi> in general, is, to teach either what Men <hi>should do,</hi> or what they <hi>really do</hi>; whereof the first instruct you in little else than what every Devout Old Gentlewoman teaches her little Grand-son, and differ not much from our Childrens <hi>Common Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms.</hi> But on the contrary, those Authors, who (like <hi>Machiavil, Montaign,</hi> and all Writers of <hi>Satyr</hi>), give a true Description of what Men <hi>really do;</hi> shew that <hi>Man-kind in general, ever was, is, and will be the same,</hi> viz. Base, Treacherous, and False, studying nothing but their own Interest and Safety, to which they will attain by any means whatsoever; That he who makes himself a Sheep, becomes a Prey to the Wolf; and that if men are less vicious, or more honest, it is not out of manners, but fear. Now by receiving this Character, every man puts himself upon his Guard, and is thereby rendred less apt to be invaded or injur'd; distrust making men more vigilant, and vigilance more safe. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, <hi>veritas odum parit</hi>; And he that gives this true Character of his Fellow-Citizens, shall be hated even unto death, for that most

men are Dishonest, but few desire to be thought so. However, this is the way of Writing which <hi>I</hi> have endeavour'd (though imperfectly) to imitate; And if by shewing what ill men do, some malicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (who would have their Hearts no more than their Chests of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, unlock'd by any but themselves,) should mis-interpret my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, as if <hi>I</hi> encourag'd others to do the same; Let this serve for my excuse, that <hi>I</hi> can be no more accountable for my Reader's indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herein, than any Fencing-master answerable, if his Scholars make use of the Skill he taught them, to the Destruction of their Friends; whose only aim was to instruct them how to Defend Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a Just and Lawful Cause.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey who commend <hi>[1] Pythagoras</hi> the <hi>[2] Samian,</hi> do generally relate that he was not at first an <hi>Ionian,</hi> but <hi>[3] Euphorbus</hi> the <hi>Trojan,</hi> and dying (as <hi>Homer</hi> writeth) did afterwards revive again. Furthermore they report, that he refus'd to wear any Garment made with the skin of that Creature which died of any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease; also that he abstain'd from <hi>[4]</hi> eating living Creatures, being of opinion, that no such thing ought ever to be <hi>[5]</hi> sacrificed, nor that the Altars of the Gods should be defiled with blood; but rather that Wafers made with Honey, Frankincense, and singing of Hymns should be rendred up unto them: For such were the only Sacrifices that he himself did offer unto the Gods; asserting, that he had ever found them to be far better pleas'd with those kind of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, than in any <hi>[6]</hi> Hecatomb, or Knife with a Basket. For having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant with the Gods, he had there learnt what things were pleasing, and what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to them. From hence he likewise gave out, that he had learned those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which he used to deliver concerning the Nature of Things; and that whereas
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98416:6"/>
other men treated of divine Matters only by conjecture, (most of them <hi>[7]</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting one another) yet that <hi>Apollo</hi> had appear'd to him, and told him plainly he was <hi>Apollo</hi>: As also <hi>Pallas</hi> and the <hi>Muses,</hi> (not declaring who they were) together with other Gods, whose Shapes and Names were yet unknown to men. And that whatsoever he deliver'd was by his Disciples not only observ'd as a Law, but also be himself was revered as coming from <hi>Jupiter.</hi> They also observ'd <hi>[8]</hi> Silence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Things divine; for that they heard many sacred Mysteries, which were hard to understand, for those that had not first learn'd that to be silent is a kind of Reasoning. It is likewise reported, that <hi>Empedocles</hi> the <hi>Agrigentine</hi> was addicted to the same kind of Philosophy, as is evident from this passage in his Poems:
<q>
                     <l>Comrades adieu; from henceforth I shall be,</l>
                     <l>(God-like) exempted from mortality.</l>
                  </q>
And in another place:
<q>I have already been both Boy and Girl.</q>
Also the <hi>[9]</hi> Ox, which he (having made Wafers) is reported to have sacrificed in <hi>Olympia,</hi> was a Testimony of one that esteem'd the Doctrine of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> And many other things do Historians report concerning the Followers of that Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's Manners; which I must here omit, in that I hasten to my intended Discourse. For <hi>Apollonius,</hi> who exercised things near of kind to these, and yet came nearer to divine Wisdom than <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himself, is not yet known among men, by that true Wisdom which he followed solidly and like a Philosopher, though he lived nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very long ago, nor yet very lately: But of him one commendeth this, another that.</p>
               <p>Also there are some, who because he conversed with the <hi>Magicians</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Brachmans</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> and the <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> account him likewise a <hi>Magician</hi>: and slander him for obtaining his Wisdom by indirect means. Such a misrepresentation had they of so great a Man! whereas <hi>Empedocles, Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> notwithanding their frequent Converse among the <hi>Magicians,</hi> were never censured for that Art. <hi>Plato</hi> also travelling into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Doctrines of their Priests and Prophets in his Writings, or like some cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Painter laying Colours on a rude Draught, did never yet incur the least suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of Magick, although for his singular Wisdom he was not a little envy'd.</p>

Now the crafty Sacerdotal Order (who (like Swine fatten'd with trough) were maintain'd and made rich out of the Follies and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men) did above all things improve and propagate this Opinion, and that because great part of the Offerings fell to the Priests share.

               <head>CHAP. II. How <hi>Apollonius</hi> having foretold many Things, was accused for Magick; when at the same time <hi>Plato, Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> were not taxed with the like Crime, although they were likewise divine Men, and foretold the most remote Things.</head>
               <p>IT would be a very <hi>[1]</hi> unjust thing for any Man to tax <hi>Apollonius</hi> with such a Crime, only because he foresaw and foretold sundry Things: In as much as <hi>[2] Socrates</hi> will come under the same Condemnation, for the Things which he foreknew by the help of his Genius; as also <hi>[3] Anaxagoras,</hi> for the many Things which he by his Wisdom foretold would come to pass. For who knoweth not, that <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> at <hi>Olympia</hi> (when there was no sign of Rain) came into the <hi>Stadium</hi> with a furr'd Garment, and presently after there succeeded a vehement Shower? Likewise foretelling that a certain House would fall to the ground, he was in the right, for it fell: Also predicting that the day would be turn'd to night,<note place="margin">Laert. <hi>l. 2.</hi>
                  </note> and that <hi>[4]</hi> Stones should fall down from Heaven about the River <hi>[5] Aegos,</hi> he told true. And yet they who have ascribed these things to the Wisdom of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> will not allow <hi>Apollonius</hi> to foresee things by Wisdom, but say that he did such things by Magick Art: Wherefore thinking it convenient to remove so great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of the minds of many, and to search diligently of this Man both the times when he said, or did any of these things, as also the kind of Wisdom, by which he acquired to himself the reputation of so divine a Person. Now whatever I here propose to write concerning him, is collected partly from those Cities which enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him, partly from the Writings of those Priests with whom he had convers'd, or rather from those Temples whose Rites he had restored, and partly from those things which others have reported of him. He wrote also Epistles to Kings, Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Philosophers, at <hi>[6] Elea, [7] Delphos, [8] Aegypt</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> concerning their Gods, Customs, Manners and Laws, among whom he reform'd whatsoever was done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the most certain I have thus collected.</p>

                  <p n="1">[1] SElf-love is so predominant in mankind, that no person how good or how just soever can be exempt from partiality to himself and his profession: 'Tis that which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>Mahumetanism</hi> so odious to <hi>Christians,</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> so contemptible to the <hi>Turks,</hi> as also <hi>Popery</hi> to the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> to the <hi>Papists.</hi> This made <hi>Hierocles</hi> the <hi>Heathen</hi> so much extol <hi>Apollonius</hi> above <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> the <hi>Christian</hi> so highly prefer <hi>Christ</hi> before <hi>Apollonius. Apollonius</hi> is by many accused of Magick, and so was <hi>Christ</hi> himself by <hi>Celsus</hi> and others: Therefore whether one, both, or neither, did justly merit such accusation, ought to be impartially examined without any regard either to Interest or Religion; since whatever person tryes matter of fact by his own Catechise, gives the same reason to his enemies Negative as to his own Affirmative, and so leaves the contest in <hi>statu quo prius.</hi> Therefore he who would indifferently judge between both, must consider three things, 1. Their Doctrine. 2. Their Miracles. And 3. Their Evidence: After which, if you find them equal in all three points, then how to prove that one acted by a diviner spirit than the other, is a work too difficult for any but he that can remove Mountains, which grain of Mustard-seed I pretend not to: Nor do I need it, for that I am satisfi'd in Christ's preheminence. Most men are apt to flatter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98416:8"/>
their own Party, calling that Religion in themselves which in others they term Irreligion or Superstition; how often have I heard a pretended Zealot call the same passion Love in himself and Lust in another, the same noise chiding in himself and scolding in others. Concerning this Partiality we have frequent Examples in ancient History, as well sacred as prophane: For instance, how mightily can <hi>Tertullian</hi> inveigh against the <hi>Heathens</hi> for persecuting a few <hi>Christians,</hi> but never exclaim against <hi>Vespasian</hi> for murthering so many hundred thousand of the <hi>Iews</hi>; and why, because whoever is our enemy, we also make him to be God's enemy, that we may have the better pretence to kill him. Again <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in his Apology denies the Divinity of the heathen Gods, because says he, had they had the power of making themselves, they would never have been born men, and subjected themselves to mortality, when they might have enjoy'd so much a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent condition; which Argument is not only partial but dangerous, when the wicked <hi>Heathens</hi> urge the same Objection even against <hi>Christ</hi> himself, saying, How then was he a God, who subjected himself to far more miseries both in life and death, than ever any of the heathen Gods underwent; which according to his Rule he must never have done, had he been a God. <hi>Tertull Apol. chap.</hi> 11. Furthermore <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the same Chapter speaking of the heathen Deities, says, He knows not what need God has to communicate himself to men; that 'twere an injury to the Divinity to require the assistance of any person living, much l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ss that he should imploy to so excellent an end the ministry of dead men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Argument the wicked <hi>Pagans</hi> are too apt to retort. So that nothing can be of a more pernicious consequence than such an over-active and partial zeal, which snatching up all weapons to defend its Cause, most commonly lights upon one with a double edge. If you believe the <hi>Monks,</hi> such as <hi>Suidas</hi> and others, <hi>Lucian</hi> was torn in pieces by Dogs which scandal they rais'd upon him for being an enemy to their Religion; notwithstanding other Historians tell us he died in much honour, being Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of <hi>Egypt.</hi> They will also tell you, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was blear-ey'd, hump-shoulder'd, and crook-legg'd, because he betray'd <hi>Christ:</hi> Again, that the <hi>Iews</hi> (notwithstanding their mixture with other Nations renders it impossible) have a particular ill savour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their aversion to <hi>Christianity</hi>; not distinguishing whether a <hi>Iew</hi> converted, or a Child begot between a <hi>Iew</hi> and a <hi>Christian,</hi> shall retain its ill scent, if such an one there be? Thus (like some of the primitive <hi>Christians</hi> with their <hi>piae fraudes</hi>) many do still pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate their Religion and Interest with lyes. Dare we not say a Thief is handsom, if he really be so? or that a Woman hath a good Breath, because she is dishonest? or that a Lawyer pleads well, because he is for my Adversary? Many are so zealous to help their Prophet into the Saddle, that they endanger tumbling him over and breaking his Neck. <hi>Will you</hi> (says <hi>Iob) talk deceitfully in God's Cause, and tell a lye for his sake?</hi> No, we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, 'tis not for God's sake, but for their own. I have heard the <hi>Heathens</hi> object it as a stumbling-block, that <hi>David,</hi> who murther'd his Friend <hi>Vriah,</hi> and then lay with his Wife, should be accounted a man after God's own heart; whereas (say they) if one of us had done so, we should have been counted worthy of death here, and damnation hereafter: And when I told them of <hi>David</hi>'s Repentance, they reply'd, that so much was usual in all Malefactors at the hour of condemnation. But to conclude this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, we must have great care lest (like <hi>Esop</hi>'s Ape) when we too much commend our selves, we procure that laughter at our selves which would otherwise never have happen'd: For 'tis a great mistake to think, that our own Opinions or the custom of our own Countrey is always infallibly the best; and it betrays a narrowness of fancy in us, when our Party infects our understanding.</p>

                  <p n="9">[9] <hi>India</hi> is a name now applied to all far distant Countries, not only in the extreme limits of <hi>Asia,</hi> as the Ancients describe it, but even to all <hi>America,</hi> through the errour of <hi>Columbus,</hi> and his Comrades; who at their first arrival in the Western World, mistook, and thought that they had met with <hi>Ophir,</hi> and the <hi>Indian</hi> Regions of the East.

               <head>CHAP. III. Of <hi>Damis, Apollonius</hi>'s Companion; as also of the Commentaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sayings and Actions of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> in reference to the Empress <hi>Julia.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere was a certain ingenious man call'd <hi>Damis,</hi> (sometimes dwelling in the ancient City of <hi>[1] Niniveh</hi>) who applying himself to the Philosophy of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> wrote both his <hi>[2]</hi> Travels, (wherein he saith he was his Companion) and also his Sentences, Sayings, and Predictions. One that was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Acquaintance of this <hi>Damis</hi>'s, brought the Empress <hi>Julia</hi> to the knowledge of his Commentaries, which till then had not been publish'd: (this Empress <hi>Julia</hi> was much addicted to the study of <hi>[3]</hi> Rhetorick) therefore I conversing frequently in her Court, she commanded me to transcribe those Commentaries, and bestow some pains on the Relations contain'd in them: for <hi>Damis</hi> had given a plain, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eloquent description of them. I had moreover the Assistance of one <hi>Maximus</hi> an <hi>Aegean</hi> his Book, wherein was contained all the Deeds of <hi>Apollonius</hi> in the City of <hi>[4] Aegis.</hi> There is likewise a Testament written by <hi>Apollonius</hi> himself, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it plainly appeareth, how much he was enamour'd with Philosophy. Neither is there any credit to be given to <hi>Moeragenes,</hi> who writing four Books concerning <hi>Apollonius,</hi> seemeth to be altogether ignorant of his Actions. In what manner therefore these dispers'd Relations of <hi>Apollonius</hi> were gather'd together into one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98416:9"/>
Volume, as also the cause which incited me to compose these Books, I think is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared. Now this Work procureth both Honour to the person of whom such things are written, and Benefit to such as are lovers of Learning, for that they may by this means attain to the knowledge of things whereof they were before ignorant. <hi>Apollonius</hi> had for his Country the <hi>Greek</hi> City <hi>[5] Tyana,</hi> scituated in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>[6] Cappadocia:</hi> his Father was of the same name with him, and descended from a very ancient Family, wherein there had been many famous men: for Wealth he exceeded most of his fellow Citizens. When his Mother was with Child of him, there appeared unto her a Vision of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> God <hi>[7] Proteus,</hi> who (as <hi>Homer</hi> reports) used to transform himself into divers shapes. The Woman not being terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd hereat, ask'd the Apparition what she should bring forth? to whom <hi>Proteus</hi> answer'd, Thou shalt bring forth me. Whereupon she further demanding of him, Who he was? I am (said he) the <hi>Egyptian</hi> God <hi>Proteus.</hi> Now of what great Wisdom <hi>Proteus</hi> was, I think it superfluous to relate, especially to them who have read the Poets: for out of them, I suppose, every one can tell how various <hi>Proteus</hi> was, shifting himself one while into this form, another while into that; so as it was very difficult to seize him. Also how he seem'd to know and fore-know all things. And indeed it was very material to make mention of <hi>Proteus</hi> in this place; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the sequel of our discourse will demonstrate, that <hi>Apollonius</hi> fore-knew more things than ever <hi>Proteus</hi> did. He likewise unriddled many Mysteries, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded things that were most difficult to be understood, not failing in any one; more especially at the time of his death.</p>

                  <p n="2">[2] It is more the business of Travellers to learn, than to teach; wherefore 'tis not amiss for all Travellers to imitate <hi>Damis,</hi> in keeping a Journal of all things remarkable that occur in their Travels. Now as Travelling does much advantage Wise men, so does it no less prejudice Fools; adding Affectation to Folly, and Atheism to the Curiosity of many not well principled by Education: Such wanderers imitating those Factors of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> who together with Gold, returned Apes and Peacocks; <hi>Osborn,</hi> 3. The Ancient Philosophers were most of them addicted to Travel, as knowing how much it enlarges mens minds, to know the different manners of Countries remote from their own. For my part, the too great indulgence of my Parents heretofore, and the concerns of my Family now, hath deny'd me that happiness which I so much envy in others, and must endeavour to repair by my Studies. They only advantage themselves by Travel, who well fraught with the experience of what their own Country affords, carry over with them large and thriving Talents, as those Servants did commended by our Saviour: for he that hath nothing to venture, hath nothing to improve, and will hazard losing his small parts, either in the <hi>French</hi> Levity, <hi>Spanish</hi> Pride, or <hi>Italian</hi> Treachery: Because, not being able to acquaint himself abroad of more prudence then what he meets with in the Streets, or other publick places, the Activity of his Legs and Arms may possibly be

augmented, and he by tedious Complements become more acceptable in the eyes of silly Women; but altogether useless, if not pernicious to the Government of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in creating doubts and dislikes by way of a partial Companion. I have never met with more ridiculous subjects for Laughter, than are most of our young Sparks newly come out of <hi>France,</hi> tyed to their Swords with a broad Belt upon their Loins, like a Monkeys Chain; when with their Hat under one arm, and the other hand at their Cod-piece, you shall hear nothing but of what they did in the <hi>French</hi> Camp, or at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> beginning each sentence with a <hi>Iarné,</hi> or <hi>Mort de Dieu</hi>; and when they speak to their Lacqueys, ever mistaking <hi>Garçon,</hi> for Boy: nothing can be more insipid, than such a Coxcombs discourse; he magnifies Tyranny, because he convers'd with none but the Commanding party; and extols Popery, for its Pageantry: and this is all that most of our young Gallants profit by their <hi>French</hi> Voyage. Travelling (says <hi>Montaign</hi>) is very necessary, not only (as half-witted men use) to report how many yards the Church of <hi>Sancta Rotonda</hi> is in length or breadth, or what rich Garments, costly Stockings or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters such a great Lady weareth; or as some do, nicely to dispute how much longer or broader the face of <hi>Nero</hi> is, which they have seen in some old ruines of <hi>Italy,</hi> than that which is made for him in other old Monuments elsewhere: But they should principally observe, and be able to make a certain relation of the Humours and Fashions of those Countries they have seen, that they may the better know how to correct their own Wits, by those of others. Certainly nothing can be more pleasant or profitable, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold variety of new Objects, and to propose to ones self the diversity of so many other mens Lives, Humours and Customs. As it is more pleasant to Travel up and down ones own Country, than always to remain in ones own Parish; so is the pleasure no less heightned in Travelling into other Countries: for which purpose, he that can shelter himself under the protection of an Embassador, as one of his Retinue, will Travel the safest, cheapest, and have more respect shew'd him upon all occasions. Concerning this subject, see those two admirable discourses in the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Essays, and Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi>'s Advice to his Son.</p>

Whether Rhetorick be an Art or no, remains to this day a dispute amongst the Learned: <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> demonstrates it to be neither an Art, nor a Science, but a certain kind of Subtlety neither noble nor honest, but low, illiberal and servile Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: which made the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> altogether refuse it, believing that the speech of good men ought to proceed from sincerity of Heart, and not from the hypocrisie of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Artifice. The first who ever taught or wrote of Rhetorick, were <hi>Thisias, Coraces,</hi> and <hi>Gorgias</hi>; however there were many others among the Ancients, who through the strength of their natural parts, became very famous for Eloquence: whereof the chief were these, <hi>Antiphon, Isocrates, Demosthenes, Aeschines, Lysias, Demades, Cicero, Marcus Seneca, Petronius Arbiter, Hermogenes, Quintilianus, Lucianus, Aelianus, Aristides, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> &amp;c. The force of Eloquence may be proved by sundry Examples, whereof this one may suffice, concerning <hi>Hegesias</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian</hi>; who representing the miseries of this Life, made so deep an impression upon the hearts of his Auditors, that many of them cast away their own Lives voluntarily: in so much that King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For this reason <hi>Cicero</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> call'd King, because he ruled and guided the Senate which way he pleas'd by his Orations. For my own part, I confess my self to be a great enemy to all long formal Speeches, which seldom have wit or fancy sufficient to make amends for the tediousness of the Discourse: For

We read in <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> of an Orator who was allow'd two hours to plead in behalf of a Prisoner his Clyent; whereof the first hour he spent in lamenting his want of time to plead in such a Cause; the second hour he spent in his <hi>Exordium ad captandam benevolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam</hi>; and so the time being expired before he came to the merits of the Cause, the Council was suffer'd to speak no longer, and his Clyent fairly hang'd. Most of these Orators do so much study words, that they little at all regard either sence or matter: Nor can any thing be more insipid and impertinent than such a Sir <hi>Formal Trifle,</hi> who is at best but the stately figure of a Fool: The most eloquent of these Discourses are like our Syllabubs, little else but froth. Whenever I hear any Author of a Book, or Orator, spend much time in complaining of his own weakness, I always take him at his word, and so listen no more to what he says. Rhetorick presents all things by a false light, when (like the magnifying Glass) it makes small things appear great. When I hear a Physician thunder out his Terms of Art, I always suppose him an ignorant Quack; however it gives them a Reputation with Women: which made <hi>Pliny</hi> observe, that Physicians get their Living by Rhetorick. <hi>Montaign</hi> says, That Rhetorick is little better than a Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids Tittle-tattle; when (like fine Cloaths upon a Monkey) Orators do generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to repair the deformity of a bad Cause, with multiplicity of words.

               <head>CHAP. IV. Where <hi>Apollonius</hi> was born; also concerning the marvellous Vertue of a certain Water.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>APollonius</hi> is reported to have been born in a certain Meadow, near unto which there is now a Temple erected to him; therefore let not the manner of his Birth be unknown, as something worth relating: That when his Mother was near the time of her delivery, she was admonish'd by a Dream to go forth into a Meadow to gather Flowers; which accordingly she did the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Where having stay'd somewhat long, and her Maidens being all dispers'd and imploy'd in gathering Flowers, she her self fell asleep in the Grass. Whereupon the Swans that fed in the Meadow encompass'd her round in a Circle whilst she slept, and clapping their Wings, (as their manner is) fill'd all places round about with a great noise, a South-west Wind blowing gently at the same time over the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. Now she being awaken'd from her sleep with the singing of these Swans, was presently brought to bed of a Boy; any fright being apt to make a Woman fall in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour before her time. Moreover the Inhabitants of that place say, that at the time of her <hi>[1]</hi> delivery, a flash of Lightning fell down from Heaven upon the Earth, which was no sooner seen, but immediately ascending up on high into the Air, it vanish'd quite away: This very thing (as I conceive) portending that the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Child should transcend all earthly things, and dwell near unto the Gods; they foreshewing a brightness above all things below, with a vicinity to the Gods, and all the greatness this man arrived to. Now there is near unto <hi>Tyana</hi> a <hi>[2]</hi> Water for Oaths, consecrated (as they report) to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which the Inhabitants call <hi>[3] Asbestos,</hi> that is to say, such as will not be consumed by fire. The Spring it self is very cold; however it boyleth and bubbleth up like a Kettle over the fire. This Water (as they say) is mild and sweet to the taste and sight of all such persons as are just and careful in keeping their Oaths; but unto them that are false and <hi>[4]</hi> perjured, it is a present punishment; in so much that having drank thereof, it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98416:11"/>
seizeth their hands, eyes and feet, taking them with Dropsies and Consumptions. Nor are they able to depart from thence, but abiding by the Water-side, they there confess their perjuries, and lament their calamity. The Inhabitants of that place acknowledge <hi>Apollonius</hi> to be the Son <hi>[5]</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> notwithstanding he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self affirm'd that he was the Son of <hi>Apollonius.</hi> Now in process of time, being grown up to those years that are capable of Discipline, he soon gave remarkable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of his great Wit and Memory. He used the Attick, nor would he so far comply with the custom of the place to use any other. He drew the eyes of all men upon him for his incomparable Beauty.</p>

                  <p n="1">[1] TIs well known to all men that have search'd into the Records of ancient Time, how necessary it hath ever been esteem'd for <hi>Heroes</hi> to have a Birth no less mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous than their Life; as it appears by the several Histories of <hi>Semiramis, Cyrus, Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and many of the heathen Gods. We have a common saying, That a good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning makes a good ending; and a miraculous Birth goes half way towards the making of a Prophet. A seventh Son (because unusual) without any Daughters between, is naturally born with a healing Hand, according to the Vulgars opinion. A Prodigy at any persons Birth (like a Comet hanging over a Kingdom) hath ever been esteem'd an <hi>Omen.</hi> Thus was <hi>Plato</hi>'s swarm of Bees that lighted upon him in his Cradle, lookt upon with admiration; although perhaps, had not his Life been so eminent, it would never have been regarded or remembred. Now when Poets or vain Historians do tell of such prodigious Births of great persons. I conceive that such Wonders may be Lyes that have been added after their Deaths, to compleat the strangeness of their Lives: since no Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loses by its carrying; for every man improving his Talent in those Cases, desires to make his Tale more wonderful. I have heard the Story of a Bastard-child, that being cast off <hi>London-bridge</hi> in a Hand-basket, was miraculously caught and saved by a Boat, that was accidentally going underneath: The strangeness of this Child's preservation, gave many curious persons great expectation what he would come to; but he disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all; for he was no sooner grown up to be a lusty young Fellow, but he was hang'd for stealing; verifying that old Proverb, He that's born to be hang'd, will never be drown'd. This matter of Fact is certainly true, and happen'd in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign. But to conclude this Subject, I question not but <hi>Hierocles</hi> in his Parallel, did impiously compare this Miracle of the Swans and Lightning, at <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s Birth, with that melody of holy Angels, and new Star appearing at Christ's Nativity, as being both equally strange, but not alike true. For to believe any Stories that are not approved of by the publick Authority of our Church, is Superstition; whereas to believe them that are, is Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">[2] Not only Groves and Woods, but Waters, such as Rivers, Lakes and Fountains, were often consecrated by the Ancients, having some God or Nymph of their Name: The River <hi>Nilus</hi> was worshipped as a God by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and so was the River <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> by the <hi>Indians,</hi> by reason of the benefit which both Countreys receiv'd from them. Many and famous are the Stories of the consecrated <hi>Pagan</hi> Waters: As for instance, There is a Lake in the <hi>Lesser Armenia</hi> call'd <hi>Arethusa,</hi> wherein it is said nothing will sink, and that the River <hi>Tigris</hi> (though it runs through it) mixeth not with it; the Fable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it is this: That one <hi>Arethusa,</hi> a Virgin and Favourite of <hi>Diana</hi>'s, being beloved by <hi>Alpheus,</hi> and unable to escape his violence, was by <hi>Diana</hi> transform'd into a Fountain of that Name; when le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Antigonus</hi> relates, that in <hi>Athamania,</hi> near a Temple dedicated to the Nymphs, there is a Fountain exceeding cold of it self, yet heats whatsoever hangs over it, setting dry Wood, or any combustible matter on fire.

There are Lakes in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which procure to the drinker at least a Lethargy, if not down-right madness. Among the <hi>Cicones,</hi> a people of <hi>Thrace,</hi> there is a River which congeals the Bowels of all who drink thereof, and converts whatsoever it receives into stone: Neither are we without many such Springs in <hi>England,</hi> which will in a short time petrefie any Stick.

We read in Scripture of the Pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> so famous to heal the Bodies of men diseas'd; wherefore our Hero <hi>Apollonius</hi> to outdo the other, pretends a Cure for the Soul, by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing all dishonesty and perjury; for the truth of which, it is much easier and more reasonable to deny, there was ever any <hi>Tyanaean</hi> Water had such a vertue, than either to justifie or confute it by Reason; because in all storms of Credulity, he that would avoid those two dangerous Rocks of malice on the one side, and folly on the other, his safest way is to put into the Harbour of <hi>Scepticism.</hi>

They frequently used to burn the Bodies of their Kings and Emperors in Sheets made of this Linen, to prevent the Ashes of their Bodies (when burnt) from mingling with the Ashes of the Wood. <hi>Pliny (lib.</hi> 19. <hi>ch.</hi> 1.) tells us, that this Flax is esteem'd above all other Flax in the World; that 'tis rarely to be found, and as difficult to be woven, by reason of the shortness thereof; and that in price it equall'd the most excellent Pearls. <hi>Nero</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have had a Garment of the same, but at this day it is not any where to be met with. I have seen a small piece of Mineral, (as I suppose) though resembling a grey Stone, and of an equal hardness, which my Father brought with him out of <hi>Italy,</hi> had the same quality not to be consumed with Fire; but whether it were of this Flax, or that Flax of <hi>Cyprus</hi> which <hi>Podocatanus</hi> (a Knight of <hi>Cyprus</hi>) brought to <hi>Venice, Anno Dom.</hi> 1516. I know not, for as much as that <hi>Cyprus</hi> Flax would likewise prevail against the Fire. This Flax proceedeth from no Plant, as ours does, but from the Stone <hi>Amiantus,</hi> which being found in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and broken with a Hammer, the Earthy dross purged from it, there remains fine hairy threds like Flax, which are woven into Cloath.

                  <p n="4">[4] Perjury is the highest degree of Lying, wherein we vouch God for the truth of what we say; each mans Oath being recorded as well in Heaven as upon Earth: A Prince that is made Mediator in any Treaty of Peace, resents the violation of such a Peace for so high an affront to his Mediatorship, that he immediately thinks his Honour engaged to fall upon them that first break it. Even a private person receives it as a baffle and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect, to elect him Arbitrator, and afterwards to recede from his Arbitrement. What then can we think of our selves, when we dare to do that to God, which we fear to do unto man? Wherefore <hi>Montaign</hi> well observes, that he who tells a Lye, is bold towards God, and a coward towards man; for a Lye faces God, and shrinks from man.

               </head>
               <p>WHen he was arrived to <hi>14</hi> years of age, his Father brought him to <hi>[1] Tarsus,</hi> there to be instructed by that famous Rhetorician <hi>Euthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> the <hi>Phoenician. Apollonius</hi> well approved of his Masters dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, but thought the manners of that City absurd, and not fit for one to study Philosophy amongst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that the Citizens being very much addicted to Luxury, Scoffing and Insolence, resembled the <hi>Athenians</hi> only in their outward Garb, but not in their Wisdom and Manners. The River <hi>[2] Cydnus</hi> runneth thorow this City, on whose Banks the Citizens are used to fit like Water-Fowl. <hi>Apollonius</hi> therefore wrote to them in an Epistle, that they should give over making themselves drunk with Water. When having obtain'd leave of his Father, he removed his Master to <hi>Aegas,</hi> a City not far distant from <hi>Tarsus;</hi> where was not only a fit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation for the study of Philosophy, but also such exercises as were suitable to Youth, together with the Temple of <hi>[3] Aesculapius,</hi> wherein <hi>Aesculapius</hi> himself did sometimes appear unto men. He there came acquainted with divers Sects of Philosophers: having the conversation of <hi>Platonists, Chrysippeans</hi> and <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks.</hi> He likewise made an inspection into the Doctrine of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> thinking that even that was not to be despised. But for the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> he had little or no opportunity to learn their abstruse Tenents, in that his Tutor was not very studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of that kind of Discipline, nor cared much to conform the Actions of his Life thereunto; for totally resigning up himself to Gluttony and Lust, he rather seem'd to frame his Life after the prescript of <hi>Epicurus:</hi> his name was <hi>Euxenus</hi> of <hi>[4] Heraclea</hi> in <hi>[5] Pontus.</hi> As for the Opinions of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> he <hi>[6]</hi> knew

Euxenus</hi> perceiving him to be of so great Spirit, asked him how he would begin such a course of Life? to whom <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, He would begin as Physicians used to do; who having first purged the Entrails, prevent some from falling into diseases, and cure others that are already fallen into them. And having said this, he began to abstain from eating the flesh of living Creatures, as being impure, and stupifying to the understanding. Wherefore he fed only on Fruits and Herbs; saying, that such meats were pure, which the Earth did afford unto men. He was also of opinion, that Wine was a pure kind of drink, as proceeding from a mild Plant; yet nevertheless he esteem'd it an enemy to the settled state of the mind, in respect that it sometimes disturb'd the Air of the Soul.</p>

And here <hi>Aesculapius</hi> is said to have converted himself into that form, because by health men seem to renew their youth, like a Snake that hath cast her Hackle. In this shape, saith <hi>Lactantius,</hi> he sail'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and is said by <hi>Pherecides</hi> to have Serpentine feet.

Orpheus</hi> writes, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> struck <hi>Aesculapius</hi> with his Thunderbolts, because he had restored to life <hi>Hyppoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who had been torn in pieces by his own Chariot-Horses, when he fled from the fury of his Father, as we may see in the Story of <hi>Theseus.</hi> And that <hi>Apollo</hi> being much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted at the death of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> but not being able to revenge himself upon <hi>Iupiter,</hi> he kill'd the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> that had made the Thunderbolts wherewith his Son had been slain. <hi>Orph. de Aesculapio in Hymn.

If the primitive Christians had been so little curious or inquisitive, how could Christianity ever have been received in the World? when they should have persisted in the blind Heathenish Idolatry of their Forefathers, esteeming Christ rather as an Upstart and Innovator, than what he really was, the only legitimate Son of God. The generality of men are but like so many Religious Parrots, who are taught to say they believe the Scriptures, but why or wherefore they know not, only

that Mr. <hi>A.</hi> the Minister of their Parish bids them. For my part, neither <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> or <hi>Aristotle,</hi> shall perswade me, if my Judgment be not convinced by Reason of what they say; Reason is the only Mistress I court, and to her alone will I pay my Devotion. Those Arguments which will deceive in a false Religion, cannot instruct in a true one; but the beginning at Faith, and ending at Reason, would deceive in a false Religion; therefore it cannot instruct in a true. What proceeds from common Reason we know to be true, but what proceeds from Faith we only believe it; and there is a vast difference between <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>believing.</hi> I will never embrace an Opinion, only because a great many hold it; because then I must turn <hi>Turk,</hi> that Religion being the most universal of any we know. Neither will I build my Religion upon that weak Basis of Antiquity, lest some <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> come and supplant me. Nor upon Martyrs, lest the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala</hi> (who crush themselves to pieces under the wheels of their Idol) compare with me, or lest the Hereticks we our selves have put to death, put in their claim to a share in the Crown of Martyrdom. Nor will I altogether depend upon Miracles, lest <hi>Simon Magus, Pharoah</hi>'s <hi>Magicians, Apollonius,</hi> and others, pretend to be my Rivals. Nor to those Rules of Self-denial, Mortification, and Patience, which our Doctrine teaches, since Monsieur <hi>Tavernier</hi> gives us an account of some <hi>Indians</hi> that may likewise exceed us in that way. No, I will rely wholly upon my Reason, and yet not obstruct my Christianity. Men do not any where more easily err than where they follow a guide, whom they think they may safely trust; and the greatest part of the World is led rather with the Names of their Masters, and with the reverend Respect they bear their Persons and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, than with the soundness and truth of the things they teach. For as <hi>Vadian</hi> saith in his Paradice, <hi>Magnos errores magnorum virorum autoritate persuasi transmittimus.</hi> Whilst we are young, our Judgment is raw and green; and when we are old, it is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled: so that <hi>Inter Iuvenile Iudicium, &amp; Senile Praejudicium, veritas corrumpitur.</hi> I cannot but laugh at those Pedants, who have no stronger Argument for the truth of what they say, than to alledg, 'tis a Maxim; as if their Maxims are more certain than their other Propositions. However, I'le believe them when they shew me a Philosophy, whose Principles can neither be question'd nor doubted of, and wherein all the World agrees; otherwise 'tis ridiculous: for 'tis easie to prove any thing, when one adjusteth Principles to Opinions, and not Opinions to Principles. Again, one main Argument which I have often heard used, is that St. <hi>Ierom</hi> or <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> says so: In the same manner one told Dr. <hi>Harvy,</hi> that <hi>Galen</hi> was of a contrary opinion to him; whereupon he wisely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I have read as much, and lived longer in the World than ever <hi>Galen</hi> did, therefore he is no Authority to me. Moreover, how do we know but that those Ancients no more than we, have not always written what they believed? The Law and Religion of their Countrey, may have often obliged them to accommodate their Precepts to the Politicks of their Government; for as <hi>Montaign</hi> well observes, The wisest man must write some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to his own Genius to get his Book Licensed. All men ought to reverence Antiquity, but not conclude it infallible: yet (says Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi>) I should take her word sooner in Divinity, than any other Learning, because that is clearest at the beginning; whereas all other Studies more muddy, receive clarification from experience. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we may likewise in these matters, for fear of running upon infidelity, split upon credulity: Therefore let us remember, that when <hi>Livy</hi> says, the Gods made an Ox speak; in not believing the miracle, 'tis not the Gods, but <hi>Livy</hi> we disgrace. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God can do every thing, yet I am not bound to believe he does all things that men report; <hi>Enim à posse ad esse non valet consequentia.</hi>

First, That it is not Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, appears, for that the greatest people of the World in their most flourishing condition, have always permitted it. As for instance, The <hi>Romans</hi> that had conquer'd the greatest part of the then known World, made no scruple of tolerating any Religion whatsoever in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, unless it had something in it that could not consist with their Civil Government: nor do we read that any Religion was there prohibited, save only the <hi>Iews</hi>; who (thinking themselves the peculiar people of God) held it unlawful to acknowledge subjection to any mortal King or State whatsoever. The Inquisition-Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

of Persecution lost <hi>Holland</hi> from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> notwithstanding all the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Treasure of the <hi>Indies.</hi> All wise Princes, till they were over-born with Faction, or solicited by peevish persons, gave toleration to differing Sects, whose Opinions did not disturb the publick Interest. And the experience which Christendom hath had in this last Age is Argument enough, That toleration of differing Opinions is so far from disturbing the publick Peace, or destroying the Interest of Princes and Commonwealths, that it advantages the publick, and secures peace; because there is not so much as the pretence of Religion left to such persons to contend for it, being already indulged to them. When <hi>France</hi> fought against the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> the spilling of her own bloud was Argument enough of the imprudence of that way of promoting Religion, together with the prosperity she hath enjoy'd, ever since she gave permission to them. The Affability and Clemency of <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi> had almost extinguish'd that flame, which afterwards the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> made greater than ever, when by managing the matter of Religion with Fire and Sword, his Religion and his Prince too had almost both been turned quite out of the Countrey: for the being restrain'd and made miserable, mutually endears the discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed persons, creating more hearty and dangerous Confederations. In <hi>England,</hi> although the Pope had as great power here as any where, yet there were no Executions for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion known till the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, who (because he usurped the Crown) was willing by all means possible to endear the Clergy to his purpose, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying their enemies. Secondly, Persecuters, like men always in a passion, have sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Reason on their side; for the great God and giver of Reason, is not to be found either in the Whirlwind of Passion, or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the Earthquake of Persecution, but in the still voice of Love and mutual forbearance. <hi>Grotius</hi> (in his Book <hi>de Iure Belli &amp; Pacis</hi>) saith, It is unreasonable to punish any man for not assenting to the things of the Gospel, since they cannot possibly be discover'd by the light of Nature, but must be made known by Revelation. As for us, the very Revelation, whereby we have a knowledge of them, is not so clear, as that a man should incur civil punishment for doubting of it: since this Revelation, though at first confirm'd by Miracles, and so infallible to them that saw those Miracles; yet is it not so to us, for that both the Miracles and Doctrine come down to us only by Tradition. And Christ says, <hi>Had I not done these things among ye,</hi> (observe those words, <hi>among ye) your want of faith had not been imputed to you for sin.</hi> To the same purpose speaks <hi>Salvianus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Marcelles,</hi> who (concerning the punishment of the <hi>Arrians</hi> for denying the Divinity of Christ) saith, They are Hereticks, but against their knowledge; they are so in our opinion, but not in their own; for they think themselves so far Catholick, that they defame us with the title of Hereticks; therefore what they are in our opinion, we are in theirs: We say they do wrong to the divine Generation, in saying the Son is less than the Father, and they believe we do wrong unto God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in saying the Son is equal unto him: We say the Truth is with us, but they say the Truth is with them: The Honour of God is with us, but they think they honour the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head more: They are impious, but they think it true Piety: They err, but they err with a good mind, not out of hatred, but out of affection to God, believing that by this they honour and love the Lord: Though they have not the right faith, yet they think theirs the perfect love of God; and how they are to be punish'd at the day of Judgment for this errour of a false Opinion, none knows but the Judg himself: In the mean time, as God lends them his patience, so may we lend them ours. <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has more advantaged Christianity than Persecution; for, says he, the <hi>Romans</hi> by every cruel act did but tempt others to come over to their Party; the oftener they were mowed down, the faster they sprang up again; the bloud of Christians making the Churches soyl more fat and fertil. <hi>Tertul. Apol.</hi> Nor is Persecution less powerful to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a false Religion than a true. There is no Religion, saith <hi>Lactantius,</hi> so erroneous, which hath not somewhat of wisdom in it, whereby they may obtain pardon, having kept the chiefest duty of man, if not in deed, yet in intention. Thirdly, It does no ways advantage Religion; for the Apostles themselves, although they were infallibly assured of their Doctrine, and could also make their Hearers assured of it by Miracles, yet never desired that the Refractory should be compell'd to embrace it. Therefore I could wish, that men would use one another so charitably and so gently, that no errour or violence tempt men to hypocrisie, rendring sincerity both troublesom and unsafe. For credulity
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98416:16"/>
breeds hatred and malice against unbelievers, whereas incredulity does only pity belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; so that by how much malice is worse than pity, by so much is credulity worse than incredulity. How vain a thing is it for men to pretend every Opinion necessary in so high a degree, that if all said true, or indeed any two of them in 500 Sects, (and for ought I know there may be 5000) it is 500 to one but that every man is damned; for every Sect damns all but it self, and that is damned of 499. and it is excellent fortune then if that escape. For 'tis natural to all Zealots to call their own enemy God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's enemy, and we may as well hang all men that are not like us in feature, as in opinion.</p>

There resorted to <hi>Aegas</hi> the <hi>Cilicians,</hi> and all such as dwelt round about those parts, to see <hi>Apollonius:</hi> in so much that it became a common Proverb amongst them, <hi>Whither go you so fast? to see the young man.</hi> Here I conceive it will not be improper to relate what then happen'd in the Temple; for that I have undertaken to give you a Narrative, containing the Deeds of such a man as was in esteem with the very Gods themselves. An <hi>Assyrian</hi> Youth that came to <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> was riotous even whilst he was sick, and liv'd (or rather died) in Drunkenness. He was taken with a Dropsie, but pleasing himself with his Drinking, he took no care of curing his Drought. Whereupon the God neglected him, and would not so much as appear to him in a <hi>[5]</hi> Dream; and when he complain'd of this hard usage, <hi>Aesculapius</hi> appearing to him, said, If thou wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult <hi>Apollonius,</hi> thou shalt have ease. Accordingly the young man going to <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius,</hi> demanded of him what benefit he might receive from his wisdom, for (saith he) <hi>Aesculapius</hi> commanded me to come unto thee. To whom <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, That he knew something would be much worth to him in that condition: for that (as he thought) 'twas only Health which he wanted. Whereupon the man replied, That (indeed) was the thing which <hi>Aesculapius</hi> did promise, but not perform. Be favourable in your words, I pray, (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) for he always bestows Health upon such as are willing to have it; but thou dost those things which are contrary to thy Disease: for addicting thy self to Debauchery, thou satiatest thy moist and almost rotten Entrails with delicious Food, thereby adding Mud to the pre-existent Water. And herein he deliver'd his mind plainer than the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>[6] Heraclitus,</hi> who told one that came to him for the same Distemper, <hi>That he must turn wet Weather into dry:</hi> which words were obscure and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be understood.

or Feasting, I am extremely well pleas'd with the order and discipline of our Church, which prescribes both; since as the one advances Health, so doth the other Religion, many of the Common people holding their Christianity by no stronger Tenure, than that of Mine'd-pyes and Plum-pottage. <hi>Asclepiades</hi> rejecting the use of Medicaments, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all Cure to the order of Diet, observing the quantity, quality, and seasoning of Meats. <hi>Gellius,</hi> citing out of <hi>Varro</hi> the most delicate Meats used by the Ancients, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents us with this Bill of Fare; the <hi>Samian</hi> Peacock, the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Turkey, the <hi>Ambracian</hi> Kids, the <hi>Tartesian</hi> Mullet, Cranes from <hi>Melos,</hi> Trouts from <hi>Pessinuntium, Tarentine</hi> Oysters, Crabs from <hi>Chios, Tatian</hi> Nuts, <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Dates, and <hi>Iberian</hi> Chesnuts. For my own part, I ever eat rather out of necessity, than pleasure; and as <hi>Montaign</hi> says, hate a multitude of Dishes, as much as any other throng, being no Friend either to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy or variety; and am naturally apt to give God thanks as well when I empty my self, as at my Meals; since a man may as well live without eating, as without evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Nor do I ever receive a bag of Money without as solemn a Thanksgiving, as over a dish of Meat, since without the one, I could not enjoy the other. As for the times of Eating, let them that can do it, comply with the custom of their Country; but for my self, neither in this nor any other thing will I ever be a slave to Presidents, but by eating when I am an hungry, and drinking when I am a dry, enjoy more satisfaction in one Meal, than in ten eaten without an Appetite. However, were I to choose any one time for my chief Meal, it should be at six in the Evening, like the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> since I can by no means approve of that great interruption of Business occasion'd by our Dinners; when we break off at Mid-day, and most commonly render our selves unapt for action all the day after.</p>
                  <p n="2">[2] The mighty influence which Custom hath over mankind, appears in nothing more than in the several Fashions of mens Apparel, which becomes agreeable or unpleasant to behold, according to the usage of the Country. As for fine Cloaths, were all men wise, nothing would appear more ridiculous, but the folly of the Vulgar renders them in some measure necessary; for they, being only able to judge of the outside, set an estimate upon the man, according to the number of his Tags, Laces and Ribbons. I never see any persons wear Cloaths above their quality, but I fear they come dishonestly by them, and either receiv'd them from a Gallant, or run on the score for them: And whether they paid for them or no, yet they are little to be trusted; since he that lives above his Fortune, is generally tempted to feed his own extravagancy with dishonest and indirect dealing. The Ancients were much addicted to this Vice; <hi>Pliny</hi> (lib. 9. ch. 35.) speaks of the great abundance of Pearl and Purple that was worn as well by men as women: First, as for the men; we read that when a Praetor (being to set forth a magnificent Show) came to <hi>Lucullus</hi> to borrow of him some short Cloaks, he lent him (as saith <hi>Plutarchus</hi> in <hi>Lucullo</hi>) two hundred out of his own Wardrobe, <hi>ducentas accipere jussit:</hi> But <hi>Horace</hi> speaketh of a far greater number, no less then five thousand;

There is no modern Folly or Vice which was not parallel'd by the Ancients; amongst whom this Luxury of wearing rich Apparel was much in use by all, excepting either those whose poverty denied them the opportunity, or those whose Philosophical wisdom shew'd them the vanity of it: as we see <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s did. <hi>Diodorus</hi> writeth, that <hi>Pallas</hi> first taught the use of Cloathing and Apparel. <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, that one <hi>Vso,</hi> a <hi>Sicilian</hi> born, was the first that made Cloathing for men of Beasts Skins. However the History of Faith deduces Cloaths from <hi>Adam</hi>'s green Breeches. <hi>Boethoius</hi> invented the Shoomakers Art. <hi>Attalus</hi> first taught men to weave Gold in Cloaths. And the <hi>Phrygians</hi> invented Imbroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering. The <hi>Greeks</hi> devised the Mantle. And the <hi>Hetrurians,</hi> Robes of State. There is no time in my opinion so ill spent as that of Dressing and Undressing, which like <hi>Penelope</hi>'s Web is nothing but doing and undoing, with a Parenthesis of ten hours betwixt the one and the other. Nor are other Creatures to be a little envy'd in this respect, whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath exempted from this trouble. <hi>Montaign</hi> is of opinion, that our Skin may as well bear nakedness as theirs: witness divers Nations, which yet never knew the use of Cloaths. The ancient <hi>Gauls</hi> were but slightly apparell'd. No more were the wild <hi>Irish,</hi> in so cold a Climat. Nor do I believe the ancient <hi>Britains</hi> receiv'd any great warmth from their Woad, the only guard they had from the cold. If there be any weak part in us, which in likelihood should seem to fear cold, it ought to be the Stomach, where dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion is made: and yet our Forefathers used to have them bare, and our Ladies are many times seen to go open-breasted. <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">[3] The Hair of a Man (though no other then an Excrement) hath been more taken notice of, than any part of the Body, in so much that several Laws have been produced about it. Heretofore in <hi>Greece,</hi> as also in most of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Countreys, it was esteem'd for a great punishment to have the Head or the Beard shaven. In many places the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fornication was to have the Beard cut off, as a mark of the highest Infamy. <hi>N. Boyer</hi> saith, that it was the custom in <hi>France,</hi> (also <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itus</hi> writeth the same of the <hi>Germans</hi>) that the Wife being convicted of Adultery, should be shaven, and her Cloaths cut off round about her to the middle of her Waste, in which posture she should be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the Towns and Villages to be seen of all people. Also <hi>Gandinus (de malefic. in tract. poen. nu.</hi> 56.) reports, that in <hi>Lombardy</hi> the Thieves and Firers of Forrests, were for the first offence poll'd on the top of their Heads; but for the second, had all their Hair cut off. <hi>Thevet</hi> (in his Cosmography) tells us, that 'tis at this day a punishment in the Isle of <hi>Candy</hi> to cut off any mans Beard. The <hi>Salick</hi> Law (saith <hi>Camerarius</hi>) setteth a Fine upon them that shall shave young Boys or Girls. We read also among the ancient Laws of the <hi>Germans,</hi> made in the time of <hi>Clotarius,</hi> this Edict: That if any one cuts off the Hairs of a Freeman against his will, let him pay him twelve shillings to make
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98416:18"/>
him amends; and six shillings if he makes his Beard be shaven. Again, By an Ordinance of the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> it was enacted, That if any person shall pluck off the Hairs of anothers Head or Beard, he shall forfeit ten pounds to the party offended, and twenty pounds more for the satisfaction of Justice. <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaking of the custom of the <hi>Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> saith, That the Conquerors were mounted upon Horses crowned with Bays, and that the Prisoners being shaved, were led in triumph. Heretofore among the <hi>French,</hi> the Subjects were shaved in token of Vassallage, but the Princes wore long Hair as a mark of Ruling: And this appears by the Pictures of their Kings in the Churches of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and <hi>St. Germain des prez..</hi> In former times likewise, the <hi>Turks</hi> were used to let the Hair of their Heads and Beards grow to a very great length; for we read in their Histories publish'd by <hi>Leonclavius,</hi> that to cut the Beard with Scissers was not a thing in use. The Counsellors and Bassaes of the <hi>Sultan</hi> wore very long Beards; and if the <hi>Sultan</hi> were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with any one, he presently caus'd his Beard to be cut off for a shame and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: as <hi>Leonclavius</hi> reports the <hi>Sultan Emir Suleyman</hi> did by <hi>Chassan,</hi> a Captain of the <hi>Ianizaries; Anno Dom.</hi> 1512. This custom of wearing Beards or Whiskers may be more necessary in those Parts, than in our more cold and Northern Climates, where that brutish Vice of carnal Copulation with our own Sex is not so usual, nor by consequence a smooth Chin in so much danger. Moreover there have been others who were enemies to long Hair: As we see <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, when ready to joyn Battel, expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his <hi>Macedonians</hi> to shave their Beards, that so their Enemies might want that hold, when they grappled with one another. <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> writeth, that the <hi>Abantes</hi> and the <hi>Mysians,</hi> a People of <hi>Arabia,</hi> did the same thing in time of War, and for the same reason. The like also do the <hi>Americans,</hi> and other <hi>West-Indians</hi> at this day. St. <hi>Paul</hi> followed this Rule, as most conformable to wisdom and reason, when he saith, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14.) that it is a dishonour to the man to wear long Hair. <hi>Plutarch</hi> telleth us, (<hi>Vita Thesei</hi>) that the custom of the young men was, when they came to full age, they went and shaved their Hair in the Temple of <hi>Delphos.</hi> And that for a man to swear by his Beard, was esteem'd a most holy and Religious Oath. Now whether our Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Apollonius</hi> neglected his Hair, and let it grow, out of superstition, affectation, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness, is uncertain; but if I might judg by my self, I should guess the latter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the invention of Perriwigs is of so great use, and saves men so much trouble, that it can never be laid aside: It helps to disguise the Thief; to make an ill Face, tolerable; the tolerable, handsom; to ease the lazy of trouble; and to make men their Vassals, if women would but wear them.</p>
                  <p n="4">[4] <hi>Aesculapius</hi> himself rejoyced to have <hi>Apollonius</hi> a witness of his Cures; that is, the Priests of the Temple were exceeding glad to have so crafty a man as <hi>Apollonius</hi> was, confederate with them in their Cheat: he being of no less service to them, than <hi>Sergius</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> was to <hi>Mahomet. Apollonius</hi> did as it were bind himself Apprentice to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle-Trade, when being one of the <hi>Sacris Initiati,</hi> and so receiving his freedom from <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> he afterwards (as we see) set up for himself. If I bear record of my self, my record is vain, therefore in all such cases the testimony of others is requisite. For two conspiring, one to seem dead and buried in a hollow Vault, (which is easie to be done) and the other to raise him again, will deceive many; but many conspiring, one to be dead, the other to bring him to life, and all the rest to bear witness, will deceive more. So that the main stress of all these things relyes upon the nature of the Evidence. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is to be examined the Interest and Credit of the Witnesses: First, For their Interest; some out of vain-glory think to acquire to themselves no small reputation, by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Story for a Companion to a God, or any such divine Person: We see how fond half-witted men are of conversing with such as are eminent either for Wit, Quality, or Courage, boasting of the Honour they had in being acquainted with such a Poet, Author, Lord, or General. Again, Others affect to cause admiration by relating wonderful Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but in such a case, which is most rational to believe, either that an old Woman flew through the Air in a Sieve, or that he who related it, told you a Lye. Nay, 'tis possible for a man to tell that Tale which he made himself so often, till at last the Author of it really believes it true. Furthermore, Some have got vast Revenues by professing a Doctrine to be true: and like Knights of the Post make money of their Evidence: which Lye being at first planted out of policy, is afterwards believ'd out of folly, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98416:19"/>
believed even unto Martyrdom. Others have gone so far in their false Testimony, that they could not with Honour dis-engage themselves; and so before they were aware, have been drawn into a forfeiture of their own Lives, rather than recant. In the next place, Let us consider the Credit of the Witnesses, that they be neither Women, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or Fools, that is to say, rude, ignorant, common people, such as are susceptible of belief: who believe all things Miracles that are above their understanding, taking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious men for Conjurers, and think that God never shews his Power, but when he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the course of Nature, building their Religion upon some monstrous Birth, or the like: Were those men to write the Life of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> they would have presented you with another Dr. <hi>Faustus.</hi> Should any man go to <hi>London-bridge</hi> with one of Sir <hi>Samuel More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Trumpets, and from thence proclaim Destruction to the City, I question not but many silly Watermen and Fishermen would receive it as a Voice coming from God. Now the more easie they are to be imposed upon, the less credit ought their Testimony to have.</p>
                  <p n="5">[5] God appear'd to him in a Dream; that is, he dream'd that God appear'd to him: for so the <hi>Malmsbury</hi> Philosopher very ingeniously expounds it. Dreams (saith he) are the reverse of our waking Imaginations; beginning at one end when we are asleep, and at the other when we are awake: For instance, As Anger when we are awake, heateth such and such parts; so if when we are asleep we over-heat the same parts, it produceth angry Dreams: Also as Fear when we are awake causeth a palpitation of the Heart; so if by lying on our left side, those humours which flow to the Heart causes the like palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, there likewise succeed frightful Dreams. The Ancients were very superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous concerning Dreams, as we may see by the many remarkable Observations which were made of them: <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us, that a Vision appear'd two several times to <hi>Xerxes</hi> in his sleep, and by threats constrain'd him to make War upon the <hi>Graecians</hi>: whereof his Uncle <hi>Artabanus</hi> being inform'd, he making slight of it as a Dream, and perswading his Nephew to Peace, the same Vision came likewise to him, with a pair of burning Tongs in his hands, as if he would have put out his eyes, for opposing the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of War. <hi>Herod. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Xenophon</hi> writes, that one time as <hi>Cyrus</hi> lay asleep in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, an Apparition came to him resembling an old man, with a venerable and divine Aspect, bidding him, Prepare thy self O <hi>Cyrus</hi> to go a Journey, for shortly thou must go to the Gods; which Dream awaking him, gave him warning of his death, which soon followed. Much such Stories as these, are those Dreams of <hi>Artorius,</hi> Physician to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> of <hi>Calpurnia,</hi> Wife to <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> of the two Consuls, <hi>Decius Mus,</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Torquatus,</hi> of <hi>Titus Atinius,</hi> of <hi>Cicero,</hi> of <hi>C.

Also the Dreams of <hi>Dio,</hi> the <hi>Syracusan,</hi> related by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in his Life. And of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, written in <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus, lib.</hi> 20. But that which is the most remarkable Story of all, is that of <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> related by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and thus descanted on by <hi>Hobbs:</hi> We read (saith he) of <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> (one that had his Life given him by <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> was also his Favourite, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing murther d him) how at <hi>Philippi,</hi> the night before he gave Battel to <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> he saw a fearful Apparition, which is commonly related by Historians as a Vision: but considering the Circumstances, one may easily judg to have been but a short Dream. For sitting in his Tent pensive and troubled with the horror of his rash Act, it was not hard for him, slumbering in the cold, to dream of that which most affrighted him; which Fear, as by degrees it made him wake; so also it must needs make the Apparition by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to vanish: and having no assurance that he slept, he could have no cause to think it a Dream, or any thing but a Vision. And this is no very rare Accident; for even they that be perfectly awake, if they be timerous and superstitious, possess'd with fearful Tales, and alone in the dark, are subject to the like fancies; and believe they see Spirits and dead mens Ghosts walking in Church-yards; whereas it is either their fancy only, or else the knavery of such persons as make use of such superstitious fear, to pass disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the night, to places they would not be known to haunt. From which ignorance how to distinguish Dreams and other strong Fancies from Vision and Sense, did arise the

Many great Philosophers have been given up to this delusion of Dreams, as <hi>Democritus, Aristotle,</hi> and his Follower <hi>Themistius,</hi> as also <hi>Synesius</hi> the <hi>Platonick,</hi> so far building upon examples of Dreams, which some accident hath made to be true, that from thence they endeavour to perswade men that all Dreams are real. <hi>Macrobius</hi> distinguishes Dreams into five several kinds: 1. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Nay the distinction of Dreams was so accurate, that in the making of them <hi>Somnus</hi> was feigned to have no less than three Servants wait upon him: for if he would have a Dream that should concern Men, he made use of <hi>Morpheus</hi>; if Beasts, of <hi>Phobetor,</hi> (as men called him) or <hi>Icolos,</hi> (as call'd by the Gods;) if inanimate Creatures, of him whose name was <hi>Phantasos.</hi> As to the external or internal causes of Dreams, there are different opinions: For <hi>Aristotle</hi> refers the cause thereof to common sence, but placed in the fancy: the <hi>Platonicks</hi> reckon them among the specifick and concrete Notions of the Soul: <hi>Avicen</hi> makes the cause of Dreams to be, an ultimate intelligence moving the Moon in the middle of that light, with which the fancies of men are illuminated while they sleep. <hi>Averroes</hi> places the cause in the imagination; <hi>Democritus</hi> ascribes it to little Images, or Representatives separated from the things themselves; but <hi>Iulius Caesar Vaninus,</hi> together with all Physicians, refer the variety of Dreams, to the variety of Meats we eat, imputing the cause thereof to the vapours and humours which ascend up to the Brain. <hi>Montaign</hi> saith, that Dreams are the true Interpreters of our Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, proceeding from the cares and affections predominant in persons when they are awake; according to that of the Poet:

Historians say, that the Inhabitants of the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Isles never dream, who feed on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that hath been slain; which might perhaps be the reason. The Ancients had many Ceremonies relating to this exposition of Dreams, which are too tedious here to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted: Sometimes they would go and sleep in the Temple, with Laurel about their heads, and sacrifice to <hi>Brizo</hi> the Goddess of Dreamers. Also the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> kept men of purpose to sleep in the Temple of <hi>Pasithia,</hi> to watch for Dreams: as silly people use amongst us to go watch at the Church-door, and know who should dye the next year: The like was done in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Serapis:</hi> Also <hi>Pluto</hi> in <hi>Aristophanes</hi> did the same. In fine, there were great advantages accrued both to the Priest and Civil Magistrate hereby; who were not only paid for their exposition, but also made such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations as ever rendred them serviceable to the publick. Many have written upon this subject of Dreams, whereof the most eminent are <hi>Artemidorus</hi> and <hi>Daldianus.</hi> Some Books of this subject go about under <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Name, whom <hi>Philo</hi> in his Book of the Gyants, asserts to have been the first practiser hereof: however, <hi>Pausanias</hi> attributes it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98416:20"/>
to <hi>Amphiaraus. Plutarch</hi> mentions other Books concerning this Art, which were found in <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Study. <hi>Artemon Milesius</hi> wrote two and twenty Books of it himself; and there is a Copy of about fourscore <hi>Senarii</hi> Verses in <hi>Greek,</hi> shewing the signification of such or such a sight in a Dream. Other Treatises there are, falsifyed under the Names of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> containing nothing but Dreams upon Dreams: however <hi>Marcus Cicero</hi> in his Book of Divination, hath given sufficient Reasons against the vanity and folly of those that give credit to Dreams.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>APollonius</hi> on a certain time beholding much Bloud sprinkled on the Altar, and Sacrifices laid thereon, together with <hi>Egyptian</hi> Oxen and Swine of a vast bigness lying slain, some fleying them, and others cutting them into pieces; also two Golden Bowls dedicated, wherein were placed most incomparable and precious <hi>Indian</hi> Stones, he went to the Priest and ask'd him what was the meaning of all this? saying, surely some magnificent person is liberal towards the God. To whom the Priest answer'd, But you would more wonder, if you consider, that this man hath yet made no Request, nor stayed the usual time, nor received health from the God, nor had that which he desires; for he came but yesterday, and yet sacrificeth so generously. Moreover, he promiseth to sacrifice and dedicate more largely, if the God will but grant him his request: for he is very rich, and possesseth more Wealth in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> than all the rest of the <hi>Cilicians</hi> put together. Now his Petition to the God is, to restore him his Eye that is lost. <hi>Apollonius</hi> (as his manner was, even in his old age) having fix'd his eyes upon the ground, enquired what was the mans name? which being told him, he reply'd to the Priest, That

it was unfitting such a Fellow should be admitted into the Temple, as being of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Spirit, and one that had procured this blemish by no good: wherefore that he should be so prodigal in his Sacrifices, before he had obtained any thing at the hands of the God, argueth that he doth not so much Sacrifice, as expiate his own base and criminous actions: Thus far <hi>Apollonius.</hi> But <hi>Aesculapius</hi> appearing by night to the Priest, said unto him, Let this rich man be gone, having according to his deserts; for he deserves to lose his other Eye which remains. The Priest therefore having enquired of the man, found that this <hi>Cilician</hi> had a Wife which had a Daughter by a former Husband, with whom this <hi>Cilician</hi> being extremely ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd, was accustom'd to lye with her; so as it was no longer conceal'd, for the Mother coming suddenly to their Bed, with Needles prick'd out both her Daughters eyes, and one of her Husbands.

                     <hi>Illustrations</hi> on Chap. 7.</head>
                  <p>IN this whole Chapter we find but two things remarkable: the first, concerning the extravagancy of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Sacrifices; the second, of their Gods appearing to them; both which were the main support of their Idolatry, and gives me a just occasion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the same. Now the original of all the false Doctrine, Idolatry and Superstition among the Heathens, proceeded from these causes: First, Revelations from above, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and forged by their Priests. Secondly, Oracles of the same stamp. Thirdly, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Prophecies, (such as those of the <hi>Sybils</hi>) either applied to future events, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited after them; thereby to gain Authority for any thing they would have credited by the people. Fourthly, Interpretation of Dreams in what sence they pleased. Fifthly, doing things which seem'd Miracles to the Vulgar, only by Natural means, or otherwise by the confederacy of Priests and Impostors amongst themselves. Sixthly, by intruding Traditions of great Persons or Actions in former times, without alledging any certainty of them. And lastly, by adventuring to tell more Fables and Lyes, because the foolish could not, and the wise durst not contradict them. Out of all which they extracted and composed a Doctrine of Rites and Ceremonies, (such as Sacrifices, Oblations, and the like) according to their own fancy, and possess'd the easie people therewith; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them as coming from God himself. Nothing was more usual among the ancient Priests, than to affirm to the people, that while they watch'd in the Temple their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gods reveal'd several things to them, (as we here see <hi>Aesculapius</hi> is reported to have done) which they were commanded to communicate to the people; while for the rest, the said Priests (being of great Authority and esteem as well with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates themselves, as with the Vulgar) did with much gravity (for it behoved them to keep their countenances) communicate to their Auditors the said supposed Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; adding, that it concern'd both People and Magistrates to take notice of, and obey those counsels and precepts which they gave. In the mean while the Vulgar, not presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming so much as to question the least syllable of what was told them, neither heard with their own ears, nor saw with their own eyes; in so much awe did Religion hold them: For the Priests did interest themselves in almost all manner of publick business, especially in the times of War, and publick calamities, well knowing that all men are more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane in prosperity, and more Superstitious in adversity, as being less apt to give thanks, than to ask pardon. Who but their Priests had (I do not say Wit to invent, but) Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to introduce Novelties into Religion? Who (but those that got by it) would be so wicked to withdraw men from the practice of a Godly life, such as many of their Philosophers taught, to a barbarous and sottish form of Rites and Ceremonies, more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Puppet-shew, than the Service of God? Again, could any else get thereby but the Priests, who profiting themselves more by mens ignorance, than knowledge, and by mens vices, than their virtues, cared not how often and how much they imposed and multiplied their Commandments; that so the Prevaricators might be more obnoxious
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98416:21"/>
to their censure and punishment. That which is of a Divine Nature, (like the Deity it self) admits of neither mixture nor pollution from any gross and Elementary substances; therefore it is not to be believed, that those necessary and Divine Truths which do really come from God, can be any more shaken in mens minds, or defiled by any Superstitions, than the Sun-beams could be defiled by shining on a Dunghill: the Heathen Religion was mixed, alter'd and corrupted; therefore did it not come from God, as a necessary and Divine Truth. Universality is esteem'd a main Argument of a true Church; now the several Sects in any Religion, takes away this Universality. Another Argument that Priests make use of to prove a true Religion, is Antiquity: and here, that Priest who begins his Religion at a later time than the beginning of History, comes short of this mark of Antiquity, and casts a blemish on Gods providence for the former times. <hi>Campanella</hi> in his <hi>Atheismus Triumphatus,</hi> reduces the wicked Objections of our modern Atheists against Christianity, into six principal Quaeries, whereof the first reflects upon the Antiquity of our Religion: however because they are short, and of no force, I will here venture to insert them, just as I find them in him. 1. <hi>Si Christus est Deus provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, cur prioribus non venit saeculis, ad salvandum homines?</hi> 2. <hi>Et cur nunc tam innumerae damnantur Gentes?

But to proceed: The definition of Religion, according to St. <hi>Austin,</hi> is that which prescribeth the reverence and ceremony of some superiour Nature, which they call Divine. <hi>Lactantius</hi> distinguisheth Superstitious persons, from those we call Religious, thus; the Superstitious are those who reverence the surviving memory of the Dead, or who out-living their Parents, adore their Images at home, as their Houshold Gods: which many of the Heathens did. <hi>Plutarch</hi> defines them to be such, who are by fear brought to believe Daemons or Gods. But Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> makes Religion to be Tales publickly allow'd, and Superstition to be Tales that are not allow'd of by publick Authority. Now he that will examine all the Religions in the World, must in the first place cast off all menaces and threats; Secondly, he must comfort himself with the assurance that God is the <hi>communis Pater</hi> of all mankind; and Thirdly, he must learn how to distinguish the True, from the Likely, the Possible, and the False, in all Religions. First, there are holy precepts for a good Life, in honour of the Supreme God, contain'd in the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Secondly, which cannot come but from one extraordinarily endued with Gods holy Spirit.

As for the fourth proposition, it is absolutely false; there being a more perfect Religion than <hi>Mahomets,</hi> (since it contains many absurdities) and therefore not such as in it men can only be saved. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> tells us, that in these four things, opinion of Ghosts, ignorance of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond causes, Devotion towards what men fear, and taking of things casual for Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, consisteth the natural Seed of Religion; which by reason of the different Fancies, Judgments, and Passions of several men, hath grown up into Ceremonies so different,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98416:21"/>
that those which are used by one man, seem ridiculous to another. Now the first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Religion amongst the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whose ends were only to keep the people in peace and obedience, have in all places taken care; First, To imprint in their minds a belief, that those precepts which they deliver'd, might not be thought to proceed from their own device, but from the dictates of some God, or else that they themselves were of a higher nature than meer mortals, thereby to have their Laws more easily received: like the first King of <hi>Peru,</hi> who pretended himself and his Wife to be the Children of the Sun. Secondly, They have had a care to make it be believ'd, that the same things were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to the Gods, which were forbidden by the Laws. Thirdly, To prescribe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, Supplications, Sacrifices, and Festivals, by which they were to believe the anger of the Gods might be appeas'd; and that ill success in War, great contagions of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Earthquakes, and each mans private misery, came from the anger of the Gods; and their anger from the neglect of their Worship, or the forgetting or mistaking some point of the Ceremonies required. And though among the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> men were not forbidden to deny, that which in the Poets is written of the pains and pleasures after this Life; which divers of great Authority and Gravity in that State have in their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues openly derided; yet that belief was always more cherish'd than the contrary. By these and such other Institutions, they obtain'd in order to their end, (which was the peace of the Commonwealth) that the common people in their misfortunes, laying the fault on neglect or errour in their Ceremonies, or on their own disobedience to the Laws, were less apt to mutiny against their Governours. Also being entertain'd with the pomp and pastime of Festivals, made in honour of their Gods, they not only imbibed their Religion, (by drinking the Founder's Health, as is usual at such times) but likewise needed only Bread, to keep them from discontent, and murmuring against the State. And thus you see how the Religion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was a part of their Policy. <hi>Leviath. ch.</hi> 12. <hi>part</hi> 1.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Whether or no the Gods know all things? And how we are to pray? Also what things are due to men from the Gods? And last of all, the words of <hi>Apollonius</hi> to <hi>Aesculapius.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHen upon the repulse given to the <hi>Cilician,</hi> many flock'd to the Temple, <hi>Apollonius</hi> demanded of the Priest, whether the Gods were just? The Priest answering they were most just, <hi>Apollonius</hi> further ask'd him, whether they were wise? What (said the Priest) is wiser than God? Then he again asked him whether they were acquainted with humane Affairs, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were ig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rant of them? To which the Priest replied, that therein the Gods seem'd most of all to excel men; for that they through the weakness of their Vnderstandings do not sufficiently know their own Affairs, whereas the Gods know not only their own, but also the Affairs of men. You have answer'd very well and truly, said <hi>Apollonius</hi> to the Priest; wherefore seeing the Gods know all things, it seems very reasonable that he who cometh to the Temple of God, should <hi>[1]</hi> pray after this manner: <hi>O ye Gods, give me that which I ought to have!</hi> Now to good and holy men, good things are due, but to wicked, the contrary. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Gods, when they find a man to be sound and untainted with sin, send him away crown'd, not with a golden Crown, but with all manner of good things; whereas if a man be polluted, stain'd or corrupt, they give him over to punishment: being the more offended at him, for daring to approach their Temples in his impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98416:22"/>
                  <hi>Apollonius</hi> having spoken this, and looking back upon <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> he said, Thou, O <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> dost practise such a kind of Philosophy as is abstruse and agreeable to thy self, not permitting the wicked to have access here, no, not though they should present thee with all the wealth of the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Sardians;</hi> for they do not sacrifice or offer up these things because they honour the Deity, but for that they would buy off that vengeance, which because you are most just, you will never yield unto them. Many such pieces of Philosophy did <hi>Apollonius</hi> utter, whilst he was but a Youth, and lived at <hi>Aegas.</hi>

                     <hi>Illustrations on</hi> Chap. 8.</head>
                  <p n="1">[1] WE find in the holy Scriptures that Prayer was from the beginning; for <hi>Abel</hi> prayed, and so did <hi>Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> with the other Patriarchs, pray unto God in all their doubtful Affairs, and returned thanks for their good success. Also <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> with others, as <hi>Hannah</hi> the Wife of <hi>Elcanah,</hi> shewed us an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Prayer. But Christ was the first that ever instructed us in any set form of Prayer, as appears by St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Gospel. Afterwards, when men began to count their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as though God were indebted to them for begging of him, there were devised, by one <hi>Petrus Heremita,</hi> a <hi>French-man</hi> of the City of <hi>Amiens,</hi> Beads, whereby to number them: <hi>Anno Domini,</hi> 1090. Now for the custom of turning our faces towards the East when we pray, that (as <hi>Folyd. Virgil</hi> observes, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>ch.</hi> 7.) is taken from the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> who <hi>Apuleius</hi> tells us, used to look Eastward, and salute the Sun. The actions of divine Worship are signs of our intention to honour God: and such are Prayers and Thanksgiving. First, Prayers; for not the Carvers, when they made Images, were thought to make them Gods, but the people that pray'd to them. And so sings the Poet:
<q>
                        <bibl>
                           <hi>Mart. lib. 8. Epig. 23.</hi>

                           <l>Qui fingit sacros auro vel marmore vultus,</l>
                           <l>Non facit ille Deos, qui rogat, ille facit.</l>
                        </lg>

                        <lg>
                           <l>'Tis not the Workman, nor the precious Wood,</l>
                           <l>But 'tis the Worshipper that makes the God.</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
Secondly, Thanksgiving; which differeth from Prayer in divine Worship, no otherwise, than that Prayers procede, and Thanks succeed the Benefit; the end both of the one and the other, being to acknowledg God, for Author of all Benefits, as well past as future. However, I cannot but prefer Thanksgiving above Prayer; for that every man would serve his own turn by Prayer if he could, but few are so generous to give thanks when their turns are served. In giving thanks I serve God, in praying I serve my self: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the ten Cripples, nine prayed, and the tenth praised God, and him our Saviour regarded most. To this purpose <hi>Cyrus</hi> told his Father <hi>Cambyses,</hi> That he shall more easily obtain any thing of the Gods, who doth not fawn upon them in distress, but in prosperity calls most upon them. <hi>Xenoph. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 8. The <hi>Heathens</hi> together with their Sacrifices made use of solemn forms of Prayer for the invoking those Gods, whom the Priests in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to propitiate. These <hi>Seneca</hi> calls <hi>Sacrificae preces.</hi> This custom was general, not only among the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> but the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>yptians</hi> themselves; as <hi>Diod. Sicul.</hi> relates. In some Countreys, the praise of the present King or Magistrate was set forth; but this was not ordinarily used. <hi>Iamblicus</hi> saith, that Prayers were not the least part of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, since by them the <hi>Sacra</hi> were fulfill'd and perfected. And in another place he writes, that nothing can be done in the Worship of God <hi>ritè &amp; auspicatò,</hi> without Prayers and Supplications. <hi>Plato in Alcib.</hi> That the most sumptuous Sacrifices that could be made, were not so acceptable to the Gods, as Supplications offer'd with a pious Soul. The word <hi>precari,</hi> which more properly than <hi>orare</hi> signifies to pray, is yet taken in an ambiguous sence; for unless the <hi>Preces</hi> be limited with either <hi>bonae</hi> or <hi>malae,</hi> it is not easie to know in what sence they are taken: therefore the ancient <hi>Iews</hi> were used to say, <hi>Bonas preces precamur.</hi> The <hi>bonae preces</hi> were address'd in a most solemn manner to <hi>Iupiter optimus maximus,</hi> and the <hi>Dii Deae<expan>

Psal. 42.14. The Ancients when they came to pray to their Gods, presented themselves <hi>Capite obvoluto,</hi> or their heads cover'd with woollen, and an Olive-branch in their hands, casting themselves down at the feet of the Image of that God to whom they address'd their Prayers and Vows. Petitioners both to the Gods and Men used to go with <gap reason="foreign">

In those Boughs they put Wooll, (as we do Silk in Posies) and so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Vittatas laureas.</hi> The Wooll was not tyed, and so fasten'd to the Boughs, but only wreath'd and wrapped up in them: from whence (it may be) <hi>Aethea,</hi> in the Tragedy of the <hi>Theban</hi> Women Petitioners (<hi>v.</hi> 31.) called it, The Tye without a Knot. The <hi>Italians</hi> likewise used such Boughs; for <hi>Virgil</hi> says,
<q>
                        <l>Iamque oratores aderant ex urbe Latina</l>
                        <l>Velati ramis oleae veniamque rogantes.</l>
                     </q>
Also <hi>Livy</hi> speaks of the like practice of the people of <hi>Rhodes</hi>; their Boughs were either of Laurel or Olive: <hi>Vittatae Laurus, &amp; sup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Theb. l. 12. for the Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel was a sign of prevailing, and the Olive of peace and good will, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> says, <hi>Per quam pax petitur supplicando.</hi> Now the custom was with these Boughs, if they were doubtful of prevailing, to touch the Knee of the Statue of the God. It is said by <hi>Pindar</hi> in his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that when they desired the parties consent, they touched the Head, to have it <hi>annuere</hi>; when his help, his Hand; and when success, the Knee. Their usual gesture in praying was to hold up their arms towards Heaven, as you may see it in <hi>Eurip. Helen. v.</hi> 1200. and to rest their hands as far as they could upon their Wrists: according to that of <hi>Eschylus,</hi> where he says of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> that though the Gods had tyed him fast to the Hill, his stomach was so great, that he said he scorn'd to submit or pray <hi>manibus supinis,</hi> with bended hands, like Women and Children: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Another cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom when they presented themselves before their Gods, was, that as they saluted and adored them, turning their bodies to and fro sometimes to the right hand, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the left, they prostrated themselves, when putting their right hand to their mouths they kiss'd it, and afterwards sate down: <hi>Quò me vortam, nescio: Si Deos salutas, dextro vorsum censeo.</hi> Plaut. in Curculi. Now sometimes if they obtain'd a Request which was of consequence, you should have them relate it to the Priest of the Temple to be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred; or write it down in a Table, and leave it behind them for a Testimony. In the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prayers of the <hi>Romans, Ianus</hi> and <hi>Vesta</hi> were first preferr'd, (as <hi>Fabius Pictor</hi> hath it) because they first taught the Religious use of Corn and Wine; and as they were first used in Sacrifices, so they had the first place, though not the chiefest, which was ever reserved for <hi>Iupiter optimus maximus.</hi> After them, the several other Gods had their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Carmina &amp; Precationes,</hi> addressed to them; and some Priests for that purpose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to say or sing them in a certain Tone, (like our <hi>Te Deum</hi> in the Cathedral Churches) whilst others stood by to assist them. At the same time another commanded the people <hi>Favere Linguis,</hi> or to be silent, whilst the Tibicen or Musician play'd by fits on the Pipe. Furthermore, Prayers to the Gods were used not only in Temples but also at Sepulchers, the words of them being for the most part barbarous and obsolete, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to seem the more mysterious: although some Prayers may be found fitted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion, and deliver'd in good language. In some Countreys much clamour and loud speaking was used when they called upon their Gods; which we see <hi>Elias</hi> wisely derided in the Priests of <hi>Baal.</hi> The Poets used to say, that Prayers were the Daughters of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but lame, because they did not always obtain what they desired. There are hardly any forms of publick Prayer made by their Priests extant; and if any, they are too obscure to be understood. I have never read but of one, which was the form of Prayer used by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and mention'd by that learned Emperor <hi>Antoninus,</hi> in these words: <hi>O rain, rain, good</hi> Jupiter, <hi>upon all the Grounds and Fields that belong to the</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians. Which Petition had in it so little charity for others, that <hi>Antoninus</hi> well observes, either we should not pray at all, or pray more absolutely and more charitably. For Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made by private men in Temples, (whether for themselves alone, or for the publick)

                     <hi>Plato</hi> recommendeth to us that wise Petition of the Poet <hi>Ion,</hi> who used to pray thus, <hi>Zeus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O</hi> Jupiter, <hi>give us good things whether we ask them or no; but those things that are evil give us not, though we crave them never so much.</hi> Plat. in Alcib.

Other Examples of this kind may be found among the Ancients, as in <hi>Virgil, Cicero</hi>'s Prayer to <hi>Iupiter Stator</hi> in the name of himself and the <hi>Romans</hi>; (where after repetition of what he had done) he begins thus; <hi>Imperii Statorem,</hi> &amp;c. I beseech the stay of the Empire, that he would be pleas'd to give assistance to the Commonwealth, the whole State, and my Fortunes. Also <hi>Romulus</hi> when his men ran away pray'd thus; (saith <hi>Livy) At tu Pater,</hi> &amp;c. But thou O Father of Gods and Men, chase the Enemies from hence, take away terror from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and stop their shameful flight, <hi>&amp;c. Scipio</hi> going also against the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> used this following Prayer out of the Pretorian or Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in presence of his Souldiers, in these words; <hi>Dii, Deaeque,</hi> &amp;c. Ye Gods and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses that possess both Sea and Land, I pray and beseech you, that those things which during my Command have been, are, or shall be done, may succeed well to me, to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> to our Allies, and to the <hi>Latine</hi> Name, who follow my Command and Conduct: As also to the people of <hi>Rome</hi> both by Sea and Land; may you give them all prosperity; increase their Numbers; bring them home again in safety, laden with spoyls, and triumphing over their conquer'd Enemies; grant likewise both to me and the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> to do such Feats against the City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> as the City of <hi>Carthage</hi> thought to have done against our City: Of this kind you may find divers in <hi>Livy, Valerius Maximus, Velleius Paterculus,</hi> and others. I shall give two Examples more of the Vestal Virgins, one whereof carried Water in a Sieve to the Temple of <hi>Vesta,</hi> after using these words, <hi>Vesta si sacris,</hi> &amp;c. O <hi>Vesta,</hi> If I have always imploy'd chaste hands in thy sacred Rites, grant that I may with this Sieve draw Water out of <hi>Tiber,</hi> and carry it into thy Temple. Another of a Vestal mention'd in <hi>Suetonius</hi>'s <hi>Tiberius</hi> is remarkable, if it be true: That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he alone drew after her a great Boat that stuck in the Sands or Mud. But these were only private Prayers, and not the publick used at dedication of Temples, and making of the more solemn Sacrifices, and which were used in the morning, at mid-day, and at night, after great Victories obtain'd, when sometimes Supplications, or Prayers, with Thanksgivings, were made for the space of fifteen days; as you may see in <hi>Cael. Rhodig.</hi> The order and manner of celebrating them, were set down in their Books called <hi>Rituales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in Prayer there are two things to be consider'd: First, The person petitioning; and Secondly, The thing petition'd for. As to the first, The person petitioning was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be clean, pure, and without guile. Wherefore <hi>Cicero</hi> says, (<hi>de Legib. lib.</hi> 2.) <hi>Let men that approach the Gods, be chaste and Religious, for they that do otherwise, shall be punish'd of God himself.</hi> Again also, <hi>Let not the wicked presume to pacifie the wrath of God by Presents.</hi> This made <hi>Bias,</hi> one of the seven wise men of <hi>Greece,</hi> forbid the wicked Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to call upon God in a Storm, saying, <hi>Hold your peace, for fear lest the Gods should know you are here.</hi> Plut. Mor. <hi>Pliny (lib.</hi> 18. <hi>ch.</hi> 3.) saith, <hi>That all things are better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, when they come from honest and pure hands.</hi> Also <hi>Plato</hi> interdicted all wicked men from attempting to appease the Gods: <hi>Plato de Legib.</hi> Upon this Consideration, the Ancients took care, that those Women who were imploy'd about their sacred places and Temples, should abstain from all filth and pollution nine days and nights, before they were admitted to that Office. Thus were <hi>Cybeles</hi> Priests gelded with a sharp Stone, only to preserve them chaste. Also in <hi>Athens</hi> they drank Hemlock, to allay their desires of coming to their Wives; and the Women that vow'd a Religious Life, lay upon a sort of Leaves, that were proper for the same purpose. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> likewise speaking of the chief Priests and Overseers of the holy Ceremonies, saith, I am of opinion that he who handleth sacred things, and taketh care of what belongs to the Service of the Gods, ought to be chaste and continent, not only such a number of days, but that in his whole Life, he abstain from all dishonesty. Thus also the Emperor <hi>Iustinian</hi> in his Institutes,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98416:23"/>
(<hi>Novell.</hi> 9. <hi>Collut. tit.</hi> 16. <hi>ch.</hi> 5.) strictly enjoyneth Godliness and Chastity to all Friers and Nuns. Methinks <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in his Sermon of Covetousness, hath a pretty similitude upon this subject: The face of the Soul (saith he) is the Conscience; and as a fair face delighteth those that behold it, so is a clean Conscience no less beautiful in the eyes of God. When an impious suppliant makes his address to God, instead of expiating his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer crimes, he aggravates them, by presenting him with an heart full of irreverence, sin, and malice, to whom we should sue for grace and forgiveness: Therefore <hi>Xenophon</hi> pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently advises us very rarely to pray unto God; for that it is not easie to settle our minds often in so regular and so devout a frame, as is required when we pray aright and effectually. Much more of this subject you may find in all the <hi>Fathers,</hi> but more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Lactantius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second thing to be considered in Prayer, is the Boon petition'd for: and herein great caution must be used, that it be such a thing as is fit for God to grant, and us to implore. Now as <hi>Montaign (lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 56.) well observes, many men invoke the Divine assistance, to abet their greatest Villanies; according to that old saying, <hi>In nomine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini incipit omne m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lum</hi>; endeavouring (as much as in them lies) to make God a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, or accessory at least to all their wickedness. Thus the Covetous man prayeth for the vain increase and preservation of his superfluous ill-gotten Treasure; <hi>det vitam, det opes, Horat.</hi> The Ambitious petitioneth for Honours and Victories, to satisfie his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable pride; <hi>cupit hic Regi proximus ipsi, Senec. in Herc.</hi> The Envious imploreth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; like that hot angry Prophet, who cursed the poor little Children, and made them be destroyed with Bears, only for calling him Bald-pate, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.23. The Lover prays to satisfie his Lust; and he that hath purchased Bishops-Lands or Crown-Lands, prays for the ruine of Episcopacy and Monarchy: He that is possess'd of Abby-Lands, prays devoutly for the downfall of Antichrist; as I do my self, upon the same occasion. The Thief, the Pyrate, the Murderer, nay and the Traytor all call upon God, all implore his aid, and all solicite him to give them courage in their Attempts, and constancy in their Resolutions, to remove all obstructions and difficulties that in any sort withstand their wicked Executions; and sometimes they give him thanks if they have met with good success: the one, if he have met with a good booty; the other if he return home rich; the third, if no man see him kill his Enemy; and the last, if his Treason took effect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discovery. The Souldier, (if he goes to Fire a Town, batter a Castle, force a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious House, storm a Fort, or enter a City that would not surrender, to put Man, Woman and Child to the Sword, or any such villanous act) before he attempt it, prayeth to God for his assistance, though his intentions and hopes are full of nothing but Cruelty, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Covetousness, Luxury, Sacrilege, and the like; according to that of the Poet:

There are few men would dare to publish to the World those secret requests they make unto God; wherefore the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> very wisely ordain'd them to be made in publick, that all might hear them; and that no man should dishonourably invoke God, or require any undecent or unjust thing of him. Now such kind of Petitioners were not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful, but many times severely punished for their impious requests: We see how severely the Gods dealt with <hi>Oedipus,</hi> in granting him his request; for his prayer was,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98416:24"/>
that his Children might between themselves decide his succession by force of Arms: and he was taken at his word. Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> is of opinion, <hi>that it is not a ridiculous Devotion to say a prayer before a Game of Tables; because</hi> (saith he) <hi>in Sortiligies and matters of greatest uncertainty, there is a settled and pre-ordered course of effects:</hi> and so there is in Murder; but yet I should think it a presumption to implore the Divine assistance either in one, or the other.</p>
                  <p>Again, some there are, who without any evil intent, but merely out of their own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, pray for such things which (if granted) would certainly prove their ruine: This foolish desire of men the Poets signifyed by the Fable of <hi>Phaeton,</hi> who having by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity obtain'd o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We are taught by many of the Ancients, what requests we ought to make at prayer; <hi>Solomon</hi> begg'd for Wisdom. That best of Poets <hi>Iuvenal</hi> advises, <hi>Orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano.</hi> But that learned Emperor <hi>Antoninus</hi> says, <hi>Whereas one prayeth that he may compass his desire to lye with such a Woman; pray thou, that thou mayst not lust to lye with her: Another, how he may be rid of such a one; pray thou, that thou mayst so patiently bear with him, as that thou have no such need to be rid of him. Another, that he may not lose his Child; but pray thou, that thou mayst not fear to lose him. To this end and purpose let all thy prayers be, and then see what will be the event.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some few of the Heathens used no prayers at all, as we may gather from that old verse of <hi>Ennius; Desine fat a Deum flecti sperare precando:</hi> or at least no other then, <hi>Thy will be done</hi>; and that rather by way of Acquiescence, than Petition: But all other enlargement of request they declined, partly because they thought not the Deity flxanimous, to be won by entreaty, or bribed by Sacrifice; and partly because they held it a presumption in man to direct God what to do, and what to forbear; thinking that such a boldness
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98416:24"/>
would be but slenderly excused, by an additional clause of submission to his Will. From hence <hi>Cardan</hi> took his Notion, when he writes, <hi>Deum non flecti precibus, esset quasi unus è nobis, passionibus &amp; doloribus obnoxius.</hi> Of this boldness in directing God, I know not any amongst us so guilty as those gifted Brethren,
<q>
                        <l>— Who with short Band and Hair,</l>
                        <l>Do belch and snuffle to prolong a Prayer.</l>

These are the men who pray by the Spirit, till the Dinner is spoil'd, and their Auditors almost starved with hunger and cold; for the Spirit will neither feed us within, nor warm us without. I do not find anciently either among the <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that long Prayers were approved of, or publickly permitted, especially according to the Spirit (that is, the Fancy) of him that prays. Nay our Saviour himself (whose example we ought to imitate in this, as well as in all other things) teaches us the contrary, by his short, but Divine Prayer. Besides, in these long <hi>ex tempore</hi> Prayers, how many Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, Irreverences and Undecencies are they guilty of! for all Prayers and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings ought to be made in words and phrases, not sudden, nor light, nor plebeian, but beautiful and well composed; or otherwise we do not honour God as much as we can. Who would go into a Presence-Chamber to make a Petition to his Prince, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before-hand what he had to say? besides let us remember, that God is in Heaven, and we upon Earth, therefore should our words be few. However, Prayer in general is most commendable; for what can be greater relief and comfort to a man in affliction, than to have a God to flee to in his distress? The greatest ease in sorrow, is to have a Friend to break our mind to; and if so, how much greater relief and satisfaction must it be for an afflicted man to have God for his refuge, who is so well able to counsel, direct and assist him! Wherefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, that a Christian while he is at his Prayers with his hand lift up to God, is insensible of all punishment. Take a Dog (says the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>) and mark what courage he assumes when back'd by a man, who is to him as a God, or <hi>melior Natura</hi>: now of the same use is confidence in God to men; for it animates them with that assurance, as ever renders them successful. Of the power of Prayer, hear what the generality of the Ancients thought:

               <head>CHAP. IX. A <hi>Cilician</hi> being captivated with the Beauty of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> as also with his discourse, solicited him to Incontinency: whereupon within three days he died.</head>
               <p>ONe of the Principal men among the <hi>Cilicians,</hi> being very infamous, and much addicted to his Lusts, no sooner heard of <hi>[1] Apollonius</hi>'s Beauty, but setting aside all other concerns, went immediately from <hi>[2] Tarsus</hi> (where he was at that time upon business) to <hi>Aegas;</hi> pretending himself sick, and that he wanted <hi>Aesculapius</hi>'s assistance. Therefore coming to <hi>[3] Aesculapius,</hi> as he was walking alone by himself, he intreated him to introduce him to the God. Whereupon <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, What need have you of one to introduce you, if you your self be a good man? for the Gods are ready to entertain such as are virtuous, without an <hi>[4]</hi> Advocate. But (replied he) the God hath made you his Guest, but not me as yet. 'Tis true, said <hi>Apollonius,</hi> the study of Honesty and Virtue hath gained reception for me; when by practising that (as far as a young man is capable) I am the Servant and Friend of <hi>Aesculapius</hi>: wherefore if you be likewise addicted to Honesty and Virtue, you may go with confidence to the God, and ask whatsoever you desire. By <hi>[5] Jupiter,</hi> said he, I will do it, after I have made one request to you. What may that be which you would request of me, said <hi>Apollonius?</hi> Even the same, answer'd he, that is frequently begg'd at the hands of such as are beautiful; namely, that they would not envy others the fruition of their Beauty, but freely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to them. And this he spake very effeminately, watering his Cheeks with Tears: for there is nothing so mean or base, to which such vicious and infamous men will not condescend. Then <hi>[6] Apollonius</hi> looking upon him with a stern countenance, said, Oh vile wretch, thou art mad! Whereupon the other falling into a Rage, threatned to cut off his Head. At which <hi>Apollonius</hi> smiling, cryed out, <hi>[7] Oh that pleasant day!</hi> for indeed within three days after, the Villain was slain upon the High-way by the Executioners, (or <hi>Lictors</hi>) for being in a Conspiracy with <hi>[8] Archelaus</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> against the <hi>Romans.</hi> These and many other such like things are written of him by <hi>Maximus</hi> the <hi>Aegean.</hi> Moreover Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves vouchsafed to write Letters to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> by reason of his great Fame.</p>

We in these Northern Climes represent Hell for a place of extraordinary heat and burning; whereas on the contrary, I have heard of some <hi>Indians</hi> inhabiting hot Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countries, that describe those Torments to be extremity of cold: and so amongst them the blackest complexion is the handsomest; but with us, the fairest skin is the greatest Beauty. In <hi>Peru</hi> the greatest Ears are ever esteem'd the fairest; those of <hi>Mexico</hi> esteem the least Foreheads, the most beautiful. And blubber'd thick Lips, with a broad flat Nose, is generally beloved amongst the <hi>Indians</hi>; as also Teeth spotted with black or red, and long great Dugs, wherewith they may give their little ones suck over their Shoulders. The <hi>Turks</hi> love great saucer Eyes, in so much that one pleasure which

Fair and Good are near Neighbours, and express'd by the self-same words both in <hi>Greek</hi> and in the Scriptures. Many great Philosophers have attained to their Wisdom by the assistance of their Beauty. <hi>Bacon</hi>'s <hi>Essays, and Charron of Wisd.</hi> Deformed persons are generally even with Nature, and as Nature hath doneill by them, so do they by Nature, being for the most part <hi>void of natural affection.</hi> Certainly there is a consent between the Body and the Mind, and where Nature erreth in the one, she ventureth in the other: <hi>Vbi peccat in uno, periclitatur in altero.</hi> Deformed persons, saith the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> chiefly endeavour to free themselves from scorn, which must be done either by vertue or malice: therefore let us not wonder, if there have been persons eminent not only for Beauty, but also for Deformity, that yet have been both eminent for Vertue. <hi>Augustus Caesar, Titus Vespasian, Philip le belle</hi> of <hi>France, Edward</hi> the 4th. of <hi>England, Alcibiades</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Ismael</hi> the Sophy of <hi>Persia,</hi> were all high, great Spirits, and yet the most beautiful men of their Times.

Wherefore I cannot but condemn that Law of <hi>Aristotle</hi> as barbarous and unjust, who thinking all lame and deformed Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren not worth the rearing, ordained them to be exposed and destroyed.

It's true, a crooked Body is often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by a crooked Mind: and because they are not good enough to be esteem'd in this World, they for that reason promise themselves happiness in the next: making Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Crookedness, Squinting, great red Nose, Pimples, or Carbuncles, to be infallible marks of Election, or divine Grace: <hi>Deformed enough to be a Saint:</hi> They owe their Vertue to Necessity; and as an ugly Face is an Antidote to anothers Venery, so is it a Call to their own Chastity. In a great Wit Deformity is an advantage to his Rising: for in ancient Times (as well as at this present in some Countreys) Kings were used to put great confidence in Eunuchs; because they being envious towards all, are more obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and officious towards one. The first distinction which is thought to have been amongst men, and the first consideration that gave pre-eminence to some over others, 'tis very probable was the advantage of Beauty; as the Poet seems to hint:

Only they said, that this supream God being of so high a Nature, and there being other intermediate Beings betwixt God and Mankind, they were to address themselves to them as Mediators, to carry up their prayers, and bring down his blessings: so as the opinion of a Mediator, was the foundation of the <hi>Heathens</hi> Idolatry; they not being able to go to the Fountain of Good it self.

However, considering the dull apprehensions of the Vulgar, I could wish that some more execrable form of words were inserted in our Oaths, which might (I am perswaded) more terrifie the unthinking Crowd, than the phrase we now use.

Sometimes by their Head, as he does in <hi>Virgil, Per Caput hoc Iuro, per quod Pater ante solebat.</hi> Ecc. lib. 2. which was the reason (says <hi>Athenaeus</hi>) why they esteem'd the Head holy and sacred.

However, for any man to violate his Faith or Oath, when made upon just grounds, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more dishonourable or more destructive to humane Society. And if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Historians, those violaters of Faith have been oftentimes severely punish'd for so doing: First, In sacred Writ, we find how <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were cursed by their Father <hi>Iacob,</hi> for violating their League with <hi>Sichem,</hi> Gen. 49. How <hi>Saul</hi>'s posterity were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd for his breach of the League with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> 2 Kings ch. 21. How <hi>Andronicus,</hi> a Favourite of King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> was punished for his Treachery to <hi>Onias</hi> the high-Priest, 2 <hi>Machab. ch.</hi> 4. Also we see the great regard that <hi>Ioshua</hi> had of his Oath and League with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>; saying, (when the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> murmur'd against it) <hi>We have sworn unto them in the Name of the Lord God of Israel, and therefore may we not touch them,

lest the wrath of God fall upon us for breaking our Oath,</hi> Joshua 9. Neither is prophane Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story less filled with Examples of this nature: for <hi>Plutarch</hi> to the same purpose instances in that Story of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> King of <hi>Lacedaemonia,</hi> who making a Truce with the <hi>Argives</hi> for seven days, set upon their Camp in the night, excusing himself with this Equivocation, that the Truce was made for the days, and not for the nights: however this perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was his ruine, as the sequel of the Story shews. <hi>Plut. in Apoth.

Therefore returning again to his Philosophical Studies at <hi>Aegas,</hi> he there instituted both a <hi>Temple</hi> and a <hi>[3] Lycaeum</hi>: for there was in him an Eccho of all manner of Philosophy. In a short time after, being arrived to full age, and become Master of his Estate, he return'd to <hi>Tyana,</hi> where when one told him that it was his duty to reclaim his Brother, and reform his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, <hi>Apollonius</hi> replied, Truly this would argue great confidence in me; for how should I being a younger, reform an elder? Nevertheless, I will endeavour as

well as I am able to cure him of these Distempers. Therefore in the first place, he bestows on his Brother half his own Portion, saying, that he wanted many things, whereas himself needed but little. Then insinuating himself into his company, and wisely alluring him to yield to one that would reform him: our Father (said he) who used to instruct and admonish us, is now departed; it remains then, that you admonish me, and I you. By this means, as men are used to do when they break Colts, he by little and little prevail'd with him to reform his Life, and give over his numerous Vices, being addicted to Dicing, Drinking and Whoring, and so proud of his Hair as to dye it, walking in a haughty and stately manner. Now he had no sooner reform'd his Brother, but he began to work <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pon his other Kindred; and to render them the more observant of his Admonitions, he bestow'd on such as were in want the remaining part of his Estate, reserving but very little to himself. For he was used to say, that <hi>[4] Anaxagoras</hi> the <hi>Clazomenian</hi> spending his Estate on stocks and herds of Camels, was a Philosopher for Sheep rather than for Men: And that <hi>[5] Crates</hi> the <hi>Theban,</hi> who threw his Money into the Sea, was useful neither to Men nor Cattel.

                  <hi>That a man should inwardly converse with none but his own Wife, Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> reply'd, This I conceive was spoken unto others; but as for me, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd never to marry, but to abstain from the company of all Women whatsoever. In which respect he seem'd far to surpass that of <hi>[6] Sophocles,</hi> who being grown old, said, that he was deliver'd from a mad and fierce Master. Whereas <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> by his own vertue and temperance, was not overcome by him even in his youth: for being both youthful and of a strong Body, he master'd and subdued that mad passion. Yet some still accuse him of Venery, as following the errors of Love, and for that very reason continuing one whole year among the <hi>Scythians;</hi> whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did never go into <hi>Scythia,</hi> nor was he ever captivated with the passions of Love. And therefore notwithstanding <hi>Euphrates</hi> hath composed false Accusations against him, yet did he never accuse him of Venery; as we shall demonstrate, when we come to speak concerning the business of <hi>Euphrates.</hi> This <hi>Euphrates</hi> had a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with <hi>Apollonius,</hi> because he jeer'd him for his love of Money, and endeavour'd to withdraw him from the study of gain, and from making merchandize of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

The Ancients had great respect for Old Age, vainly judging of mens wisdom by the length of their Beards; in so much that they had their particular years prescribed for such and such undertakings: The Age of one and twenty, freed them from the Tyranny of Masters and Tutors; therefore <hi>Philostratus</hi> here tells us, that <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s Brother being 23 years of Age, was exempt from the Jurisdiction of a Tutor. They had also their particular years wherein they were capacitated for Marriage, and publick imploys: the <hi>Iewish Talmud,</hi> as also the Civil Laws and Canons of the Church, allow a woman to be married at twelve; <hi>Hesiod,</hi> at fifteen; <hi>Xenophon,</hi> and the Comedian, at sixteen; <hi>Aristotle,</hi> at eighteen; and <hi>Plato,</hi> at twenty: of all which, I conceive the marrying at twelve to be the most unreasonable; first, because there is not one in a hundred but what is fitter for a Joynted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Lex Papia,</hi> made by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> prohibited such men as were past sixty, or women above fifty, to marry, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unapt for Generation; the chief end of marriage: which Law was repeal'd in part by <hi>Claudius,</hi> but more fully by <hi>Iustinian.</hi> The blessed Virgin, when she brought forth our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> was but fifteen. Secondly, for publick imploys, particular Ages were required, and that both in Church and State: <hi>Lancelot</hi> in his Institutions of Canon Law, saith, No man ought to be made a Bishop till he be 30 years of Age, for as much as we read that <hi>Christ</hi> was baptized, and preach'd not till that Age.

Some of his near Friends that came to disswade him from this course of Life, he beat away; being of a most resolute Spirit: his House was from <hi>Alexander,</hi> and his Wives from <hi>Philip.</hi> Furthermore <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Magnesian</hi> saith, he deposited some Money in the hands of a Banker, upon this condition, that if his Sons betook themselves to any Civil imployment, it should be repaid to them again; but if to Philosophy, that it should then be distributed amongst the people, for as much as a Philosopher stands in need of nothing. <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> likewise relates, that <hi>Crates</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Son named <hi>Pasicles</hi> by his Wife <hi>Hipparchia,</hi> so soon as he arrived at mans estate, he brought him to the house of a young Maid that was his Slave, saying, this is an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Matrimony to you: but those who commit Adultery, are according to the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedians punished with banishment or death; and those who keep Concubines, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Comedians, by luxury and drunkeness transported to madness.

I cannot present you with a true Character of this Philosopher's Vertue, without ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it morose and ill natured to the brisk and airy, affected to the complaisant, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som and unclean to the nice, clownish to the well-bred, prodigal and extravagant to the covetous, and unimitable to the licentious and youthful; however, since his Vertue (which consisted in a self-denying temperance) was great, the custom and discipline of his Sect, may justly attone for all his other ill-bred errors. Now besides our <hi>Theban</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, (whom <hi>Philostratus</hi> here speaks of) there were other eminent men of the same Name, <hi>viz.

There was likewise another <hi>Crates</hi> of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> that wrote a Book containing the wonderful Curiosities of many Countreys; of whom <hi>Pliny (lib.</hi> 7.2.) and <hi>Aelian (de Animal.</hi> 17.9.) make mention.</p>

He was

Co-partner with <hi>Euripides</hi> and <hi>Pericles</hi> in the Office of Praetor. He wrote, as <hi>Suidas</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, one hundred and twenty three Tragedies: and in his contention for the Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with other Poets, he obtain'd no less than twenty four Victories, whereof there were three most eminent. The first was the Victory which he got in his youth over <hi>Aeschylus,</hi> for the which, (as some say) <hi>Aeschylus</hi> retiring into <hi>Sicily,</hi> did there die of grief. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch. in Cimone.</hi> The second was, when his own Sons accused him in his old age for want of Wit before the Judge; whereupon <hi>Sophocles</hi> producing a Tragedy which he had lately written, and asking the Judg's opinion, whether that seem'd to be the Work of an Idiot? The Judg did so highly esteem of it, that reproving his Sons very severely, he dismiss'd them with disgrace, and their old Father with honour. <hi>Cicero, Cato Maj.</hi> 20. The third and last Victory of <hi>Sophocles</hi> was that which cost him his life, as some say; for being very ancient, and having rehears'd a Tragedy at the publick place for tryal of Wit, after a long Dispute, remaining at last Victor by one voice, he died for joy that he had won. <hi>Valer.

Actors. Also <hi>Vossius</hi> writes, that he first made use of <hi>Tribus Histrionibus,</hi> by adding, as <hi>Eschylus</hi> a second, so he a third Actor, who was therefore called <hi>Tritagonista,</hi> viz. an Actor of the third and last part.

Wherefore laying a restraint upon his Tongue, yet nevertheless both with his Eyes and Mind reading many things, he committed all that he either heard or saw to his memory; by which exercise of his memory, when he was even an hundred years of Age, he was thought to excel <hi>[3] Simonides.</hi> He did likewise sing an <note n="*" place="margin">

However, during the time of his Silence, he was no unpleasing Company; for his eyes and hands, as also the nodding of his head, signified something to all that was

said: nor was he found unpleasant or morose, being of himself a lover of his Friends, and of an agreeable conversation. Moreover he affirm'd, that this course of Life which he continued for five years together, was very irksom to him: being one who had many things to say, yet not to say them, that heard many exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating speeches, yet not to hear them; and when provoked to reprove sundry things, only to say within himself, <hi>Be quiet Heart and Tongue!</hi> for he received with silence many opprobrious terms against himself. Now all this time of his silence he resided partly in <hi>[4] Pamphilia,</hi> and partly in <hi>[5] Cilicia;</hi> where notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he lived amongst such a soft and effeminate people, yet did he never speak one word. Sometimes when he came into a City that was full of sedition and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion about vain Shows, he going to the People, and presenting himself to them in publick, would by his hands and looks express that reproof which he intended against them, and thereby appease their discords; making them as mute as if they were conversant about the mysteries of Religion. For when men are at variance about such small matters as Shows or Horses, it is no great difficulty to pacifie them; because they who are disorderly about such things, with blushes recollect themselves, and come to their right mind at the sight of any <hi>[6]</hi> grave person amongst them. Nevertheless when a City is oppress'd with <hi>[7]</hi> Famine, it is no easie matter to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease their wrath, with ever so powerfull restraining words: But the meer silence of <hi>Apollonius</hi> was able to work such an effect; for coming to <hi>[8] Aspendus,</hi> (the third eminent City of <hi>Pamphylia,</hi> which is situate by the River <hi>[9] Eurymedon</hi>) he there found nothing to be sold but Vetches, and such kind of mixt Grain, whereon so many people fed; because whatsoever Corn there was, a few Rich men that were of Power in the City, had hoarded it up, that so it might be sold adulterate out of the Country. Whereupon a great number of people of both Sexes, and of all Ages, flock'd to the Governour, and carrying Fire along with them, threatned to burn him alive, notwithstanding he were fled to the Emperor <hi>[10] Tiberius</hi>'s Statues; which were a more reverend and a safer Sanctuary, than those of <hi>Jupiter</hi> himself in <hi>[11] Olympia:</hi> in so much that one was thought to be impious, because he beat his own Servant, who had about him a Silver drachm signed with the Image of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Apollonius</hi> coming to the Governour, made signs to him to know what was the matter: The Governour answer'd, he had done nothing unjustly, but was unjustly wronged together with his people; and that unless he had reason done him, both he and his people should be destroyed. Vpon this, <hi>Apollonius</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to those that stood about him, and admonishing them by his Becks to hear what their Ruler could say for himself, they not only kept silence, but also depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited the Fire upon the Altars that were there. Then the Governour taking courage, said, It is this and that man (naming several of the Citizens) who are the Authors of this Famine, by hoarding up the Corn some in one place, and some in another. The <hi>Aspendians</hi> hearing this, and encouraging one another to fall upon their Farms, <hi>Apollonius</hi> prevail'd with them by signs, not to do that, but rather to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon those who were accused, and receive Corn from them of their own accord. Wherefore they being come to him, he had much ado to forbear relating his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Silence, by perswading them with an Oration to do what he would have them: For he was exceedingly moved with the Tears of Women, Children, and Old men, who bewailing their misery, complain'd that they should speedily perish with hunger. Nevertheless <hi>Apollonius</hi> holding firm to his resolution of Silence, dictated in a Writing-Table this Reproof, which he deliver'd to the Governour to be read. Apollonius <hi>to the</hi> Aspendian <hi>Corn-Merchants, sendeth Greeting: The Earth is the Mother of all, for she is just; but ye being unjust, have made

This would be a very fit Inscription for the doors of all our Coffee-houses, wherein you can seldom behold a dozen persons, without their <hi>Iudas</hi> amongst them. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Knight that was Fined in our late Kings time, for some words that he had spoken, would have made a rare disciple for <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ever after, when he desired leave only to <hi>Tickle it with tinking.</hi> Words make all sorts of men our Enemies, and none but Fools our Friends; therefore, <hi>Vir sapit, qui pauca loquitur.</hi> He that makes others afraid of his wit, ought himself to be afraid of their memory: for as much as I have known many men, who (though they could not break a Jest) could break a Head. So that whether it was to avoid these inconveniences of speech, or whether to enjoy the benefit of a tacit contemplation, that the Soul retiring into her self, might be diverted from all external objects and irregular passions; whether for the one reason, or the other, yet evident it is from all their own Writings that the Ancients as well <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> as others, did greatly esteem silence. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> obliged the <hi>Spartans</hi> to initiate their Children to silence from their very youth, <hi>Coel. Rhod. Lect. Antiq. lib.</hi> 13. <hi>ch.</hi> 5. <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus (lib.</hi> 21.) tells us, that Silence amongst the <hi>Persians</hi> was worshipped as a Deity. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> says, that Silence argueth deep and profound Wisdom, it implyeth Sobriety, is a mystical Secret, and Divine Virtue: <hi>Mor. of Intemperate speech.</hi> The same Author like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise tells a story of <hi>Zeno,</hi> who dining at a Feast in company of some <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassadors, and not having spoken a word all Dinner-time, they (by way of jeer) asked him what account they should give the King their Master of him? Marry (said <hi>Zeno</hi>) you may only tell him this, that there is an Ancient man at <hi>Athens,</hi> who can fit out a whole Meal without saying any thing: and so turn'd the laughter upon them. <hi>Hesiod</hi> says, that the Tongue ought not to be spent upon every body, but reserv'd as a Treasure. And of later times we find an Institute of <hi>Iustinians, (in Oratione ad Antecess.)</hi> commanding all Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Law their set times for silence, and for speaking, after the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>Loqui ignorabit, qui tacere nescit, Auson.</hi> But of all the Scholars that ever <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> had, there never was any comparable to our Hero <hi>Apollonius,</hi> who not only perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in his resolution, but also during the time of his silence, he did more works of piety and charity without speaking, than any other Philosopher ever did with it: besides those many opprobrious terms and provocations which were daily offer'd unto him, though not with more malice then his great patience could bear.</p>

Furthermore, observing the Springs how quietly they ran, without making any manner of noise, he said, The silence of this place is such, as it doth not permit so much as the Springs to speak. And when he beheld <hi>[5] Ladon,</hi> he said, Not only thy Daughter, Oh <hi>Ladon,</hi> is changed into another form, but also thou thy self, in that of a <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Arcadian,</hi> thou art become a <hi>Barbarian.</hi> After this, when he minded to discourse with them, he refused the rude and disorderly manners of the Inhabitants, saying, That he had need of Men and not of Clowns. Yet nevertheless, if he saw any civil persons, and such as were of good behaviour, he admitted them into his Conversation. He dwelt amongst the Priests, and at Sun-rising perform'd certain Religious Rites in private, which he communicated only to those who had exercised four years silence with him. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards if he happen'd to be in any <hi>Greek</hi> City, where the Religious Rites were made publick, he would discourse Philosophically with the Priests of the Temples concerning the Gods, and correct what errors he found amongst them. But if he came into any barbarous City, that had peculiar Manners of their own, he always enquired who were the Founders of their Rites and Customs, as also how long they had continued in that discipline; and then endeavour'd to perswade them to change for the better. Afterwards applying himself to his Disciples, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to ask whatsoever they would; and told them, that whosoever would Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophize so as he did, should in the <note n="*" place="margin">

Now when he had answer'd all such Questions as were asked him by his Companions, and was satisfied with their Converse, he would then apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the multitude; yet never in the forenoon, but only towards the evening. And when he had discours'd with them so much as he thought convenient, he would be <hi>[6]</hi> anointed; and afterwards being rubbed, he went into cold Water, saying, that <hi>[7]</hi> Hot Baths were the old age of Mankind: from which, when the <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians</hi> were expell'd for their enormous vices, <hi>Apollonius</hi> said, the King hath grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you long life for your wickedness.

Thus <hi>Daphne</hi> is said to be changed into a never-withering Tree, as an Emblem of what immortal honour a Virgin obtains by preserving her Chastity inviolable.

Urns were also wrought of the same, to enclose the Bones of them who died for the Publick good: thinking it preserved them from putrefaction. The branches they stuck at the doors of the deceased, lest any ignorantly entring, should be polluted with the dead Body; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law: wherefore <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, that the Cypress is consecrated to <hi>Pluto, lib.</hi> 16. <hi>ch.</hi> 33.</p>

And surely, the fabulous inclination of those days, was greater than any since; which swarm'd so with Fables, and from such slender grounds, took hints from Fictions, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning the World ever after; wherein, how far they amplified, may be drawn from <hi>Palephatus</hi> his Book of Fabulous Narrations.

That <hi>Medea</hi> the famous Sorceress could renew Youth, and make old men young again, was nothing else but that from the knowledge of Simples, she had a Receipt to make white Hair black, and reduce again old Heads into the Tincture of Youth.

We read also, that both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> used to anoint their Heads, — <hi>habent unctae mollia serta comae,</hi> Ovid. which they did either to keep out any Fumes ascending thither from drink, or to open the pores that so they might eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the sooner: wherefore it was generally used at great Entertainments.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98416:38"/>
ancient times men could sleep, eat, and drink in their Baths, without over-heating their Bodies. Now however some few among them used Bathing for their health sake, yet <hi>Artemidorus</hi> tells us, that a Bath in his time was little else but a passage to Supper; so as they which eat often, wash'd as often: it being therefore observed of <hi>Commodus</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror how often he eat, by his Bathing seven or eight times in one day. And among the Christians, <hi>Sisinius</hi> a Bishop was censured as intemperate, for washing twice in a day. Many there have been, saith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> (in his <hi>Precepts of Health</hi>) who have brought themselves to this pass, that they could neither eat nor drink unless they had first either Bathed, or sweat in a Stove; among whom <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperor was one, as they did te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie who had the cure of him when he lay sick. And in the same Book, he bringeth in <hi>Zeuxippus</hi> giving precepts of Diet, and perswading men not to think it strange, if they come now and then to the Table without having been at the Bath or Hot-house before: so common a thing was it in those days at <hi>Rome,</hi> to make use of their Baths before they came to their Meals. Many have declaimed against Bathing in excess, and some have preferr'd hot Baths, and others cold Baths, as we see <hi>Apollonius</hi> did, but few have ever decry'd them altogether. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> reckons up the several good effects of Bathing, as cleansing, warming and comforting the Body, besides the great pleasure of it. <hi>Suidas</hi> says, that Baths are uncertain cures for pains, but certain guides to pleasure; which agrees with that old Inscription which was written over the Baths:
<q>
                        <l>Balnea, Vina, Venus corrumpunt corpora nostra;</l>

                     <hi>Camerarius</hi> (in his <hi>Hor.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uously, yet both before and since it was a thing prohibited by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws; and was then only practised for a time, <hi>Regis ad exemplum:</hi> for <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> the first King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ordained, that whatever man should suffer himself to be seen naked by a woman, should dye. <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaking of the modesty of <hi>M. Cato,</hi> writeth, That in old time Fathers were ashamed to bathe before their Children, and the Father-in-Law before his Sons-in-Law: he further addeth, that <hi>Cato</hi> was as much asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to utter an unhandsom word in his Sons presence, as in presence of the Vestal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins: that they never bathed together, for that the Sons-in-Law being out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to uncover their Bodies before them, never met in Baths or common Stoves with their Fathers-in-Law. To this we may annex the Speech of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to his Sons a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death: If any of you (saith <hi>Cyrus</hi>) desire to take me by the hand, or to see my eyes, let him come while the breath is in me; for after I am dead and cover'd, I command you, my Sons, not to let my Body be uncover'd or looked on, either by your selves or any one else; <hi>Xenoph. lib.</hi> 8. And as I have been inform'd, <hi>Maximilian</hi> the first Emperor of that name, did the same. It is written that the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> made a Law, That men should have their Baths apart from the women: which Law was confirm'd by <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> and afterwards followed by <hi>Iustinian.</hi> Moreover the ancient Canons admitted not of this ignominy, for in them it is forbidden that men should bathe and wash with women, because the very Pagans were against it: notwithstanding to our shame we see it allow'd amongst the Christians of this Age. Finally now, to conclude this discourse of Baths, let me not be unmindful of those hot ones at <hi>Bath,</hi> which providence hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd this Nation with, and which by relation are no way inferiour to any of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, curing many distempers of all sorts, and that as well inward as outward, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since they take to drinking them, which of late years they have done; in so much that <hi>Nechams</hi> Verses, may as justly be verified of their goodness at this present, as they were 400 years since, about which time he is said to have written them in these words:

               <head>CHAP. XIII. What kind of speech <hi>Apollonius</hi> used; and what Answer he made to the Question of a Logician.

               <p>
                  <hi>APollonius</hi> used a kind of speech neither <hi>[1] Dithyrambical,</hi> or swelling with Poetical expressions, nor on the contrary very Refined and <hi>[2] Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perattick;</hi> for he esteem'd such expressions unpleasing as exceeded the <hi>[3] Attick</hi> mediocrity: Neither in his discourse did he affect curious niceties. No man ever heard him speak <hi>[4]</hi> Ironically, or act the <hi>[5] Peripatetick</hi> to his hearers; but as out of the <hi>[6] Tripos,</hi> when he discours'd he said, <hi>This I know;</hi> or, <hi>Thus it seemeth to me; To what purpose are these things? You must know, &amp;c.</hi> His sentences were compendious and smart; his words very signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and fitted to the things themselves; also what he utter'd, carried the sound of Authority with it, as if enacted by the Scepter. Being asked by a certain Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, why he did not seek and enquire; his answer was, <hi>That he sought when he was a Youth, and that now it became him no longer to seek, but to teach the things which he had found.</hi> When he further ask'd him, how therefore a wise man ought to speak; he answer'd, <hi>as a Law-giver; for a Law-giver must make those things Injunctions to the people, which he himself is first perswaded of.</hi> This was the manner of his behaviour at <hi>Antioch,</hi> whereby he drew unto him even those that were the least given to Learning. Afterwards he resolved to take a longer Iourney, and go to the <hi>Indies,</hi> that he might there talk with those wise men, who are called <hi>[7] Brachmans</hi> and <hi>Hyrcanians:</hi> for he said, that it chiefly concerned Young men to Travel abroad into the World. He likewise expected to learn many things by the way, of the Magicians of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>[8] Susa;</hi> and therefore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd his resolution to his disciples, who were seven in number. They endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to divert him from it; but he said unto them, I have consulted with the Gods about this affair, and told you now what I resolved upon, only to try whether you be hardy enough to undergo the same things with me: therefore since ye disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your selves to be soft and effeminate, farewell! do you study Philosophy, but I must go whither both Wisdom and the Gods lead me. Thus having finish'd his discourse, he departed from <hi>Antioch</hi> with only two Servants, who were his Country men; one of which could write a very swift, and the other a very fair hand: with whom he travell'd along to the ancient City of <hi>[9] Ninus,</hi> wherein he beheld a Statue erected after a barbarous fashion: it was <hi>[10] To</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Inachus,</hi> having little horns ready to shoot out on both sides her forehead. Now as he was admiring this Statue, and variously contemplating about that and other things which he had heard from the Priests and Prophets, there came to him one <hi>Damis</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Ninus,</hi> whom I before <note n="*" place="margin">

And here it will not be amiss to insert what Answer he gave to one that found fault with this his Commentary: an impertinent and envious Fellow carping at him, said, That in other things <hi>Damis</hi> wrote well, when he described the Sentences and Opinions of <hi>Apollonius;</hi> but when he took notice of flight things that casually dropt from him, he did like Whelps who eat that which falleth from their Masters Table. To whom <hi>Damis</hi> replied, If the Gods have any Feasts, or eat at all, they have Serviteurs who take care that the least fragments of <hi>Ambrosia</hi> be not lost.

As for example:
<q>
                        <hi>Christ</hi> (saith he) being asked by the <hi>Iews,</hi> whether the Adulteress was to be stoned? denieth it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Law hindred: nor affirmeth it, because in so doing he had given an example of a cruel mind, which might probably have seduced away many from his Law; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent the ill consequence of either, he wisely answer'd, <hi>Let him of you that is without sin, cast the first stone at her:</hi> whereupon none durst to condemn the Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress. Another time, the Scribes ask'd him, whether they were liable to pay Tribute to <hi>Caesar?</hi> He fear'd to deny it, lest he should render himself guilty of Treason; neither would he affirm it, because it overthrew the Law of <hi>Moses:</hi> therefore not to incurr the penalty either way, he asked them, <hi>Whose is this Image?</hi> to which they answer'd, <hi>Caesars</hi>; whereupon he concludes, <hi>Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.</hi> Another time also, when the Pharisees demanded by what power he taught? he observ'd himself to be in a streight on either side; for if he had said, by Humane Authority, they had convinced him of falshood, he not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been initiated in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Holy Orders: neither durst he openly affirm that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was given him from God, for fear of the <hi>Iews</hi>; therefore he subtlely demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with what power <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> did baptize, put the Pharisees in a like streight; for Reason of State forbad them to attribute the preaching of <hi>Iohn</hi> to God, because therein they had presently condemned themselves, who had opposed: nor durst they say the Baptism of <hi>Iohn</hi> was an Humane invention, for then they had brought the wrath of a credulous multitude upon themselves. These are some of the most wise Acts of <hi>Christ</hi>: But that which surpassed them all, was the Prophecy which he made concerning <hi>Antichrist,</hi> whereby the Eternity of the Christian Law was best provided for; and herein he excell'd the Ancient Law-givers: For they foretold, that the <hi>Messias</hi>

But to say no more of this Subject, <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> (in his Preface to his Book <hi>de Hebraicis Idiot.</hi>) giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> this Character of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, that it comprehends much matter in a few words, is very significant, hath gravity, sweetness, vivacity, and marvellous efficacy in its words and Periods. However the scarcity of words hath sometimes gravell'd its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, when one word many times hath two contrary Expositions, as Blessing and Cursing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Chaldee</hi> is as it were a Dialect of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> differing not much more than the <hi>Dorick</hi> from the common <hi>Greek,</hi> or than the Northern and Western Speech from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98416:41"/>
plain English; nevertheless it is nearer related to the <hi>Syriack,</hi> in so much that <hi>Mercerus</hi> makes them to be both one. Now during the seventy years Captivity of the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> there was a mixture of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> Languages, as is evident by the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> composed of both, as <hi>Ierom</hi> hath well observ'd in his Preface upon that Prophet, as also by the Writings of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and more evidently by the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrases.</hi> This Language is much used by the Learned in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> You may find in <hi>Iob,</hi> the <hi>Proverbs, Ieremiah,</hi> and elsewhere, a mixture of some <hi>Chaldaick</hi> words. Many <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> use this Language <hi>in Grammaticis &amp; sacris,</hi> about the Mountain <hi>Libanus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Samaritan</hi> Language hath no other Letters or Characters proper to it, but those of the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> the <hi>Samaritans</hi> therefore used only twenty two Letters, as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> did, until <hi>Ezra</hi> (after the restauration of the Temple under <hi>Zorobabel</hi> found out other Letters, which we now use. Many of the <hi>Iews</hi> dwelling at this day in <hi>Syria,</hi> but more particularly in the Town of <hi>Sichem,</hi> are called <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and speak this <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Language.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Syriack</hi> Language, (which is call'd, <hi>Isa</hi> 36.11. <hi>Lingua Aramaea,</hi> or according to the new Translation, the <hi>Syrian</hi> Language; according to the old, the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> Language) is certainly thought (saith <hi>Masius in Praef. Gram. Syr.</hi>) to have had its beginning in the time of the <hi>Iews</hi> Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> while they were mingled among the <hi>Chaldeans</hi>; in which long revolution of seventy years, the vulgar sort of the <hi>Iews</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their own Language, and began to speak the <hi>Chaldee</hi>; but yet pronouncing it amiss, and framing it somewhat to their own Countrey fashion, in notation of Points, Affixes, Conjugations, and some other properties of their ancient Speech, it became a mixt Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chaldee:</hi> a great part <hi>Chaldee</hi> for the substance of words, but more <hi>Hebrew</hi> for the fashion, and so degenerated much from both: especially after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's time, when it likewise receiv'd much mixture of <hi>Greek,</hi> also some of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> words, as in the <hi>Ierusalem Talmud</hi> gather'd about 300 years after Christ by <hi>R. Iochanan,</hi> is apparent, being far fuller of them than those parts of the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase</hi> on the S. S. which were made by <hi>R. Ionathan</hi> a little before Christ; and by <hi>R. Aquila,</hi> (whom they call <hi>Onkelos</hi>) not long after. <hi>Breerw. Enq. ch.</hi> 9. <hi>Fabricius</hi> clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, that the vulgar Tongue of <hi>Iury</hi> (in the days of our Saviour's pilgrimage here upon Earth) was <hi>Syriack. Waserus</hi> (in his Comment upon <hi>Gesner</hi>) writes, that Christ with his own lips did consecrate this Language, as also that his Apostles did sometimes use it, as appears from these words, <hi>Abba, Aceldama, Bar, Barrabba, Bar-Iesu, Barjona, Bar-Timi, Bel,</hi> or <hi>Beel, Beelzebub, Bethabara, Bethania, Bethesda, Belial, Benerehem, Ephphata, Gabbatha, Genesara, Golgotha, Korbona, Mammona, Rabbi, Talitha-Kumi,</hi> and others, all which occur in the New Testament, and are meerly <hi>Syriack.</hi> In this Language there is likewise extant a most ancient and elegant Translation of the New Testament, which is much esteem'd of among the Learned. <hi>Crinesius</hi> much commends the <hi>Syriack</hi> Grammar of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Arabick,</hi> is now the common Language of the East, especially among such as embrace the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion: This Language in the first division of Tongues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> was begun by <hi>Armot,</hi> the first speaker and Author thereof. <hi>Epiph. contra Sethian.</hi> It is now the most universal in the World, as <hi>Bibliander, Postellus, Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Claude Duret,</hi> (in his <hi>Histor. del Origine des Langues</hi>) do prove at large, from the <hi>Herculean</hi> Pillars to the <hi>Molluccas,</hi> and fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>here and there some scatter'd remnants of the old <hi>Africans</hi> in the Inland parts, the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue is become the vulgar Language, although somewhat corrupted, and varied in Dialect, as among so many several Nations it is unpossible but it should be. And although I be far from their opinion, who (like <hi>Postellus</hi>) write, that the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue is in use in two third parts of the inhabited World, or more, yet I find that it extendeth very
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98416:41"/>
far, and especially where the Religion of <hi>Mahumed</hi> is prosessed; for which cause (over and besides the parts above mention'd, wherein (as I said) it is the native Language) moreover in all the Northern part of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, lying Northward from the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean Sea,</hi> as also among the <hi>Mahumetan Tartars,</hi> (though not the vulgar Tongue) yet is it familiar with very many, both because the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and all their Religion is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten only in that Language, and for that every Boy which goeth to School is taught it, as amongst us <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek:</hi> in so much that all the <hi>Turks</hi> write their own Language in <hi>Arabick</hi> Characters. <hi>Ioseph Scaliger (Annotat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Euseb. Chron.</hi>) writes, that neither this Language, the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Syrian,</hi> are capable of Geometrical Measures by quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Syllables. Now this <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue is to be esteem'd not only for its Extent, but also for its Antiquity, Elegancy, and Profitableness. 1. For its Antiquity, whereof St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> testifies in his Comment upon <hi>Isa.</hi> as likewise <hi>Erpenius</hi> in his first <hi>Orat. Ling. Arab.</hi> 2. For its Elegancy, whether we consider the plenty of words, and force of signification, or the sweetness of the Phraseology, or the facility and gravity of the whole Language. Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Greaves</hi> saith, it exceeds both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> in number of words: also he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it for its facility, as having no Dialects, turnings of Elections, nor Anomalies. 3. and lastly, It is a profitable Language, since he that hath the knowledge thereof, may without an Interpreter travel almost all over <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Asia.</hi> There are many words in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible and in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Translation of it, with sundry manners of speaking, whose signification and sence cannot be had but out of this Language. Neither are the Opinions of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be faithfully learnt without it. Moreover this <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue gives great light to the <hi>Syriack, Aethiopick, Persian,</hi> and other Languages; as also to the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> they having invented <hi>Algebra,</hi> and having amongst them <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> more accurate than <hi>Ptolomy</hi>; also to Physick, <hi>Avicenna, Mesua, Serapio,</hi> and <hi>Rasis,</hi> were famous <hi>Arabian</hi> Physicians. Neither will that <hi>Platonist, Avicenna,</hi> or that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelian, Averroes,</hi> appear less eminent in Philosophy to them who shall consult their two Tracts <hi>de Anima,</hi> which I have with much satisfaction perused; not to mention their larger Volumes. Likewise many famous Poets and Historians have they had amongst them; as Mr. <hi>Greaves</hi> in his Oration informs us. Finally, <hi>Mercer, Ioseph Scaliger, Rophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengius, Isaac Causabon, Iunius, Tremelius, Clenard, Golius,</hi> and our <hi>Pocock,</hi> and <hi>Greaves,</hi> did highly prize this <hi>Arabick</hi> Language, and promote the study thereof.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The <hi>Aethiopick</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Language is so near (saith <hi>Bibliander de Rat. Ling. ch.</hi> 2.) to the <hi>Hebrew, Chaldee,</hi> and <hi>Arabick,</hi> that there is scarce any Diction which is not found in some of them. The <hi>Aethiopians</hi> write from the left hand to the right. This Language (which differs only in Characters from the fore-mention'd Tongues) is used very much through all the Kingdom of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> which is of great extent. Some think the Prophets were written in the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Tongue, from the times of our Saviour Christ and his Apostles; also that the Eunuch (who was Treasurer under the Queen of <hi>Candace</hi>) read it, by which Eunuch all <hi>Aethiopia</hi> was afterwards converted to the Faith of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The <hi>Persian</hi> Language (saith <hi>Bibliander</hi>) is of all others the most easie. There are many footsteps of this Language in the Scripture, especially in <hi>Esther,</hi> as <hi>Ahasuerus, Esther, Hammedatha, Phur,</hi> or <hi>Phurim, Gaza, Susa, Zeres, Mordochai,</hi> and others. Mr. <hi>Greaves</hi> saith, that at this day the <hi>Persian</hi> Language is much used through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Asia:</hi> but more especially in Eastern Princes Courts by the Grandees and better sort, as amongst us the <hi>French</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, The <hi>Armenian</hi> Language is the most difficult of all others, as <hi>Bibliander</hi> writes. <hi>Agrippa</hi> saith, 'tis a corruption of the <hi>Chaldee. Sixtus Senensis</hi> informs us, that St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> being by the Emperor's Decree banish'd into <hi>Armenia</hi>; he did there tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate the holy Scriptures into the <hi>Armenian</hi> Tongue; which Translation is at this present in solemn use amongst them: they likewise exercise their common Divine Service in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Tongue. But of this see more in a late Treatise publish'd upon this Subject by Mr. <hi>Paul Ricaut.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly and lastly, The <hi>Copticks,</hi> or <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in their Liturgy use the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Language, but read the Gospel in the <hi>Arabian.</hi> And thus much for the <hi>Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Tongues.</p>
                  <p>In the next place being to speak of the <hi>Occidental,</hi> I shall begin with the <hi>Grecian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:98416:42"/>First then, The <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue came in esteem by its Elegance, Sweetness, and Richness, as also by the Philosophy, Arts and Sciences, which hath therein been handled; it hath likewise been propagated by the Navigations, Commerce, and Colonies of the <hi>Athenians</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as by <hi>Macedonian</hi> Arms, which ruling in <hi>Asia, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> made their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage known in many Countreys. Likewise the New Testament being first written in <hi>Greek</hi> did not a little promote it. It would be too prolix and tedious here to insert the many Provinces and Countreys that were acquainted with this Language, therefore in that matter I refer you to <hi>Breerwood</hi>'s Enquiries, chap. 1. only in general I must acquaint you, that <hi>Cicero</hi> declares in his time the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue was read almost in all Nations. Now in this great glory and splendor continued the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue in the Eastern parts, till by the inundation of the <hi>Saracens</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> it came to ruine in those Provinces, about 640 years after the Birth of Christ, in the time of the Emperor <hi>Heraclius,</hi> when the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> introduced their Language together with their Victories into all the Regions they subdued: even as the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue is supposed to have perish'd by the inundation and mixture of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and other barbarous Nations in the West. So that at this day, the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue is very much decay'd; and that not only as touching the largeness and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garness of it, but also in the purity and elegancy of it. Now the greatest part of the corruption of that Language ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, they pronounce <hi>Icos, Icon, Stithi, Lipi.</hi> Fourthly, By translation of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents from the Syllables, to which in ancient pronunciation they belong'd to others. All which four kinds of corruption, are very common in their Language, and may have produced the unelegant variation in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue. The <hi>Greek</hi> Language (more especially in their Poets) is difficult, by reason of the several Dialects, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Attick,</hi> which was the purest of all, and used only at <hi>Athens</hi>; the <hi>Dorick,</hi> which was the most gross; the <hi>Eolick,</hi> and <hi>Ionick</hi>; which three last were used in other <hi>Greek</hi> Countreys re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from <hi>Athens.</hi> But the <hi>Greeks</hi> are now at this day (by reason of their slavery to the <hi>Turk</hi>) so ignorant and unlearned, that they have (saith <hi>Cabasilas</hi>) about 70 Dialects of the modern <hi>Greek,</hi> whereof the purest is at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the most barbarous of all at <hi>Athens.</hi> I think I may say without vanity, that both for understanding and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the pure ancient <hi>Greek,</hi> there is at this day no people under Heaven more expert at it than the <hi>English,</hi> which all Travellers acknowledg. Wherefore having so eminent <hi>Grecians</hi> amongst us, and since by the <hi>French</hi> example we see how much good Translations benefit a Language, I cannot but lament to see such noble Authors as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch, Josephus, Appian,</hi> and others, translated into <hi>English</hi> at second hand out of the <hi>French</hi> Translations, and not out of the original <hi>Greek:</hi> a thing not only highly scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to our Nation, but also unfaithful and prejudicial to the Authors themselves; since notwithstanding the <hi>French</hi> are sometimes to be commended for their Notes, Print, Cuts, and Paper, yet I have known very great Judges which will not allow their very best Translations to be any other than Paraphrases; nor will their Language admit of so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious and exact a Version as ours. But to proceed; there is no Language of more use than the <hi>Greek:</hi> First, For that there is none so happy in composition, nor so fit in joyning and coupling one word with another as the <hi>Greek,</hi> which <hi>Iulius Pollux</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Author in his <hi>Onomasticon</hi> fully demonstrates. <hi>Aul. Gell. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>ch.</hi> 16. All the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Eloquence, know not with their mystery and gravity how to express and utter so properly and naturally many Nouns and Verbs, as are to be found frequently in the Books of <hi>Greek</hi> Authors. <hi>Turneb.

Secondly, Many terms of Art both in <hi>Grammar, Logick, Physick, Rhetorick, Musick, Arithmetick, Geometry, Chronology,</hi> and <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> derive their original from the <hi>Greek:</hi> so that <hi>Ignoratis terminis, ignoratur &amp; Ars.</hi>

                  <p>The next of the three Learned Tongues, is the <hi>Latine,</hi> in comparison of which, all others are said to be barbarous. Some hold that the flourishing pure, and incorrupt Age

of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, was from <hi>Terence</hi> to the times of <hi>Quintilian</hi>: for in that Age lived <hi>Terence, Pacuvius, Lucretius, Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Tibullus, Catullus, Ovid, Persius, Seneca, Silius Italicus,</hi> and <hi>Martial,</hi> Poets; <hi>Varro, Cicero, Iulius Caesar, Salust, Columella, Livy, Quintus Curtius,</hi> Historians and Orators. The <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue grew to perfection by degrees, and in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s and <hi>Cicero</hi>'s times, (whereof the one for purity, the other for copiousness, were the best that ever writ) it came to the highest flourish, together with the Empire under <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> Among the Poets, <hi>Plautus, Naevius, Accius, Pacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, Ennius,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> most refined it; among the Orators and Historians, <hi>M. Cato, Sisenna, Caesar</hi> and <hi>Cicero.</hi> Both <hi>Iulius</hi> and <hi>Ioseph Scaliger</hi> held, that many Originals of the <hi>Latine</hi> Speech were deduced from the <hi>Greek</hi>; however <hi>Crinesius</hi> derives the <hi>Latine</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Mr. <hi>Breerwood</hi> in his Enquiries, produces five several examples to prove the variation of the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, before any Foreign inundation happen'd: First, because <hi>Quintilian</hi> records, that the Verses of the <hi>Salii</hi> which were composed by <hi>Numa,</hi> could hardly be understood by the Priests of later times in the Commonwealth, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> writes, <hi>Instit.

Fourthly, Because <hi>Polybius (lib.</hi> 3.) writes, that the Articles of a League betwixt the people of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> made soon after the expulsion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kings, could in his time very hardly be understood by the best Antiquaries in <hi>Rome.</hi> Fifthly and lastly, For as much as there remaineth at this day in the Capitol at <hi>Rome,</hi> though much defaced by the injury of time, a Pillar (called <hi>Columnam rostratam</hi>) dedicated to the memory of a <hi>Roman</hi> Consul, upon a Naval Victory which he obtain'd in the first <hi>Punick</hi> War: the words inscribed on the Pillar, together with the later <hi>Latin</hi> under them, are these, and thus written:

Now that the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue did refine and vary from the impurity of its Original, we cannot op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: neither by any thing I have yet read or heard, do I see any just grounds to recede from that common opinion, which supposeth, that the mixture of the Northern barbarous Nations among the ancient Inhabitants, was the cause of changing the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Languages which now they speak, the Languages becoming mingled, as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions themselves were. Now from hence two things are observable; First, The Persons who thus over-ran <hi>Italy:</hi> and they were the <hi>Huns</hi> in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> the East-<hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Longobards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the West-<hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> The second thing to be observ'd, is the time of the dissolution of the Empire, which happen'd in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> in the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the third, and about the year 450. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caused by the barbarous Nations of the North: as afterwards the like dissolution of the same Empire happen'd in <hi>Asia</hi> by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> in the time of <hi>Heraclius,</hi> about the year 640. when together with the Rule of the Empire in the West, by the inundation of the said barbarous Nations, the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue became likewise corrupted.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongue as now it is, consisteth of the old <hi>Spanish, Latin, Gottish,</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,</hi> as there is good reason it should, <hi>Spain</hi> having been so long in the possession of the <hi>Romans, Goths,</hi> and <hi>Moors:</hi> of which, the <hi>Latin</hi> is the greatest part, and next to it the <hi>Arabick,</hi> wherefore they themselves call their Language <hi>Romance.</hi> And <hi>Breerwood</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self says, that he hath seen an Epistle written by a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whereof every word was

both good <hi>Latin</hi> and good <hi>Spanish</hi>; also an example of the like is to be seen in <hi>Merula: Cosmog. part.</hi> 2. <hi>l</hi> 2. But the Language of <hi>Valentia, Catalonia,</hi> and part of <hi>Portugal,</hi> is much temper'd with the <hi>French.</hi> Now the ancient and most general Language used in <hi>Spain</hi> before the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquest, without question seemeth to have been the <hi>Cantabrian</hi> Tongue. See more of this in <hi>Breerwood</hi>'s <hi>Enqu. ch.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Tongue, what it was of old remaineth doubtful, some thinking it to have been the <hi>German,</hi> others the <hi>Greek,</hi> and some the <hi>Welsh.</hi> But these suppositions were grounded upon an error, of thinking that one Language was vulgar throughout all <hi>France</hi>; whereas both <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> record, that divers Languages were spoken in the several parts of <hi>France. Strabo</hi> tells us, that the Speech of <hi>Aquitain</hi> had much affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the <hi>Spanish:</hi> as also that part in <hi>Caesar</hi> call'd <hi>Belgia upon the Rhine,</hi> did partake much of the <hi>German</hi> Tongue: And the <hi>Celtae</hi> who inhabited the middle of <hi>France,</hi> (as <hi>Hottoman,</hi> and from him <hi>Breerwood,</hi> are of opinion) used (as now they do) a Language compounded half of a <hi>Latin</hi> Original; and the other half made up of the <hi>German, Greek,</hi> and <hi>British,</hi> or <hi>Welsh</hi> words, with an equal proportion of each. Of the deduction of the <hi>French</hi> words from the <hi>Greek,</hi> you may read <hi>Perionius, Postellus,</hi> and others: of those from the <hi>German, Tschudus, Goropius, Isacius,</hi> &amp;c. of the <hi>Welsh, Lhuid, Cambden,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Italy</hi> was heretofore divided into many ancient Tongues, (as well as Dialects) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its several Provinces: In <hi>Apulia,</hi> the <hi>Mesapian</hi> Tongue; in <hi>Tuscany</hi> and <hi>Vmbria,</hi> the <hi>Hetruscan,</hi> now quite perish'd, (whereof some few Monuments (though understood by no man) are registred by <hi>Gruter</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi> in the Book of ancient Inscriptions;) in both the higher and lower <hi>Calabria,</hi> as also far along the Maritime Coast of the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> Sea, the <hi>Greek</hi>; in <hi>Latium,</hi> (now <hi>Campagna di Roma</hi>) the <hi>Latin</hi>; in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guria,</hi> the old <hi>French</hi> Tongue, whatsoever it was. And though besides these five, we find mention in ancient Writings of the <hi>Sabine,</hi> the <hi>Oscan,</hi> the <hi>Tusculan,</hi> and some other Tongues in <hi>Italy,</hi> yet were they no other than differing Dialects of some of the former Languages; as may be easily proved out of <hi>Varro, Festus, Servius, Paulus Diaconus,</hi> and others. Now people speak the best <hi>Spanish</hi> in <hi>Castile,</hi> best <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Blois</hi> and <hi>Orleance,</hi> and best <hi>Italian</hi> in <hi>Hetruria.</hi> The modern <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongue is near to the <hi>Italian,</hi> and seems to come nearer the <hi>Latin</hi> than the <hi>French,</hi> but not so near as the <hi>Italian.</hi> The Language of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> is said to be Manly, the <hi>Italian</hi> Courtly, and the <hi>French</hi> Amorous. <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> prefers the <hi>French</hi> Language for its elegancy and sweetness, before either the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> or <hi>Italian.</hi> But for my own part, I have as ill an opinion of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue as Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; since the very Language it self is a Cheat, being written one way, and pronounced another: moreover that which they call the beauty and grace of their Language, seems altogether tedious and impertinent to me. <hi>Ioseph Scaliger</hi> saith, the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue was the Mother of the <hi>Italian, French,</hi> and <hi>Spanish,</hi> all which in a barbarous manner were called <hi>Romanse</hi> instead of <hi>Roman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>German</hi> Tongue hath also divers Dialects, or Idiomes; the chief whereof are the <hi>Dutch, Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Danish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Slavonick</hi> Tongue is the vulgar Language of many Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> and some in <hi>Asia.</hi> It is also much spoken in the <hi>Turk</hi>'s <hi>Senrail</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as well as by his <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> and Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the Antiquity of Languages in general: <hi>Herodotus (lib.</hi> 2.) tells us, that one <hi>Psamneticus,</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> caused two Children to be closely brought up by a Shepherd, with order to suckle them with Goats Milk, and not ever suffer them to hear any humane Voice: whereupon after two years spent in this Education, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren utter'd these words, <hi>Bec, Bec,</hi> having learnt so much from the Goats; which the King finding to signifie <hi>Bread</hi> in the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Language, and not knowing how they had learnt it, very weakly concluded the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Tongue to be the most ancient.</p>
                  <p n="12">[12] <hi>I pretend to understand all the Languages of men: Philostratus</hi> herein thinks not only to outvy the Gift of Tongues, which the Holy Ghost bestow'd on the Apostles, by entitling his Prophet <hi>Apollonius</hi> to the same power; but likewise to exceed them, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Apollonius</hi> acquainted with the most secret thoughts of mens hearts.</p>

Many ascribe their heaviness of Complexion to the Air of their Countrey, which is imprison'd in the vast Mulberry Woods, as also thicken'd by the Vapours of their Fens, and Marshes, and Winds, from the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, together with the ungrateful steams arising from the Cauldrons, wherein they boyl their Silk-worms. As for the Rites and Ceremonies of this Church, whilst subjected to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, they were the same with the <hi>Grecian,</hi> maintaining the same Doctrine, and acknowledging the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> for the Head of their Church, till afterwards, Differences arising in Government, have divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them both in Doctrine and Discipline. The <hi>Armenian</hi> Church (as Mr. <hi>Ricaut</hi> informs us) is at present govern'd by four Patriarchs, whereof the chiefest resides at <hi>Etchmeasin</hi> in <hi>Persia</hi>; the second at <hi>Sis</hi> in <hi>Armenia minor</hi>; the third at <hi>Canshahar</hi>; and the fourth at <hi>Achtamar:</hi> for those <hi>Armenian</hi> Patriarchs which remain at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> are only titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, made to please the <hi>Turks.</hi> As for the Doctrine of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church, they allow and accept of the Articles of Faith in the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>; they also make use of the Apostles Creed. Notwithstanding they have made a Creed or confession of Faith of their own, which is as follows:
<q>I confess that I believe with all my heart in God the Father uncreated, and not begotten, and that God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, were from all eternity; the Son begotten of the Father, and the Holy Ghost proceeds only from the Father. I believe in God the Son increated and begotten from eternity. The Father is eternal, the Son is eternal, and equal to the Father; whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Father contains, the Son contains. I believe in the Holy Ghost which was from eternity, not begotten of the Father but proceeding, three Persons, but one God. Such as the Son is to the Deity, such is the Holy Ghost. I believe in the holy Trinity, not three Gods but one God, one in Will, in Government, and in Judgment, Creator both of visible and invisible. I believe in the holy Church, in the remission of sins, and the communion of Saints. I believe that of those three Persons one was begotten of the Father before all eternity, but descended in time from Heaven unto <hi>Mary,</hi> of whom he took bloud, and was form'd in her Womb; where the Deity was mix'd with the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without spot or blemish. He patiently remain'd in the Womb of <hi>Mary</hi> nine months, and was afterwards born as Man, with Soul, Intellect, Judgment, and Body, having but one Body, and one Countenance; and of this mixture or union resulted one composition of Person. God was made Man without any change in himself, born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humane Generation, his Mother remaining still a Virgin: And as none knows his Eternity, so none can conceive his Being or Essence; for as he was Jesus Christ from all eternity, so he is to day, and shall be for ever. I believe in Jesus Christ, who convers'd in this World, and after thirty years was baptized according to his own good will and pleasure, his Father bearing witness of him, and said, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</hi>; and the Holy Ghost in form of a Dove descended upon him; he was
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98416:45"/>
tempted of the Devil, and overcame, was preached to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was troubled in his Body, being wearied, enduring hunger and thirst, was crucified with his own will, died corporally, and yet was alive as God, was buried, and his Deity was mixed with him in the Grave; his Soul descended into Hell, and was always accompanied with his Deity; he preach'd to the Souls in Hell, whom after he had releas'd, he arose again the third day, and appear'd to his Apostles. I believe that our Lord Jesus Christ did with his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ascend into Heaven, and sits at the right hand of God; and that with the same Body by the determination of his Father, he shall come to judge both the quick and the dead; and that all shall rise again; such as have done good shall go into Life eternal, and such as have done evil into everlasting Fire.</q>
This is the sum of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Faith, which they teach their young Children and Scholars, also is repeated by them in the same manner as our Apostles Creed is in our Divine Service. But he that would read more of their Fasts, Feasts, Ceremonies, Penances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let him peruse that late excellent Treatise, call'd, <hi>The present State of the</hi> Armenian <hi>Church,</hi> written by the ingenious Mr. <hi>Paul Ricaut,</hi> who conversed sometime amongst them.</p>

All our Wit or Art (says <hi>Montaign</hi>) cannot so much as represent the contexture, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and use of the least Birds Nest, or Spiders Web. On the other side, those words that import Lying, Falshood, Treason, Dissimulations, Covetousness, Envy, Detraction and Pardon, were never heard of amongst them: <hi>Hos Natura modos primum dedit.</hi> Whilst we detract from others, we flatter and dissemble with our selves; and whilst we condemn them for eating men that are dead, we forget how much worse it is to crucifie, torment, and roast men alive, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have done under the name of Christians. So that to me this Calumny seems to be grounded rather upon envy, than any thing else: as we often see it in private Families, where if one Brother hath more wit or sense than the rest, the others shall presently conspire together against him, thinking to repair their own folly or weakness, by traducing him with Lyes, and slanders of debauchery, wickedness and intemperance:

Again, if he never so strictly keeps and observes the Moral part of the Christian Law, and omits but the least point of the Ceremonial, he shall presently be decryed for an Atheist; when in the mean while they who so accuse him, lending their outward man to the Church, and their inward to the Devil, covet, lye, back-bite, censure, envy, detract, and violate the most sacred Oaths, Vows, and Contracts made before God and man; when yet notwithstanding, by the help of reading a few Psalms and Chapters, or repeating daily a few Prayers, they think they have expiated all their other failings, which at the most they will allow to be only Sins of infirmity.

Now the Religion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ran much upon the Answers of Oracles, Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Soothsaying, upon which all the rest of their Sacrifices, Rights, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, did depend; for they did not doubt, but that the same thing which could presage your fortune, (be it good, or be it bad) could as easily confer it. Among other kinds of Foretellers, we read of three principally used in former times, namely, <hi>Auruspices, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spices,</hi> and <hi>Augures</hi>; all which we <hi>English,</hi> Soothsayers, though the Latin words do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a main difference: for the <hi>Auruspices</hi> did divine or foretel things to come, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Entrails of Beasts sacrificed; whence they had their Name, <hi>ab Aras inspicien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> from beholding the Altars. The <hi>Auspices</hi> did foretel things by beholding the flight of Birds; so that <hi>Auspices</hi> are said <hi>quasi Avispices, ab Aves aspiciendo.</hi> Lastly, The <hi>Augures</hi> did divine from hearing the chattering or crowing of Birds; as <hi>Philostratus</hi> here says the <hi>Arabians</hi> did; whence they are called <hi>Augures, ab Avium garritu,</hi> from the chirping and chattering of Birds; which Art (as our Author here says) they learn'd, by eating the Heart or Liver of Dragons; also <hi>Solinus</hi> affirms, that for this purpose the <hi>Arabians</hi> used to eat Serpents. Now for the particular kinds of Soothsayings, I shall not trouble you with here, but refer you to <hi>Caelius Rhodiginus, Rosini Antiquitates Romanae, Godwin</hi>'s <hi>Antiquities,</hi> and others, who describe the manner of them at large; I shall only give you some short hint of their politick Institution, and so conclude. First then, <hi>Iulius Caesar Vaninus (dial.</hi> 56. <hi>lib.</hi> 4) saith, that the Soothsayings of the Ancients are the fables and illusions of Priests, to get money and praise, as also the figments of heathen

On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when the General was unwilling to hazard a Battel, he offer'd meat to the Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens when their bellies were full, and when they refused it, the Augurs who were ever of the secret Council of War, did beseech the Souldiers by the bowels of the Gods, not to engage the Enemies, for that the Gods being angry for the sins of the Army, did threaten their ruine; whereupon all obeying those Admonitions of so great an high-Priest, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd from Battel; neither was that attributed to the cowardise of the General, but to destiny. Also when they were vanquish'd or put to flight, that it might not reflect on their valour, they feign'd that they fought contrary to the Answers of their Augurs. Thus <hi>Flaminius</hi> perish'd together with his Army for not being obedient to the Augurs. The chief and most eminent Office among the <hi>Romans</hi> was that of the Augurs; the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and honour given to them was so great, that they were look'd upon not only as the Gods Interpreters, but also as Messengers and Agents betwixt them and mankind. Besides, they were ever advanced to the Senate, and the rather as is conceiv'd, because from the first foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> until the change of the Government, Kings themselves were Augurs, as thinking it unsafe to dis-joyn from the Regal Power, a discipline so full of Authority: like as our King here in <hi>England</hi> is Head as well of the Church as State, which Power in Catholick Countreys is divided between the King and that old <hi>Roman</hi> Augur, the Pope. Now the chief end of Auguries, was to encourage Souldiers to fight with more alacrity and confidence, which contributed much to their success; nor was any Magistrate chosen till they were first consulted:
<q>
                        <l>Those who to Empire by dark paths aspire,</l>
                        <l>Still plead a Call to what they most desire.</l>

                     </q>
Thus (as <hi>Livy</hi> informs us) <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Numa</hi> could receive their Scepters only from the Augurs hands. Neither did they begin to build Cities, till they had first por'd into the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of Beasts: for if they were found, they argued the temperateness and fruitfulness of the Soyl; but if they were lean and shrivell'd, that shew'd the Clime to be unhealthy: for many times they drew their Conjectures from other natural Causes, and yet ascribed them to Augury. Now this Art of Augury is very ancient, especially in <hi>Italy, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Asia minor,</hi> where one <hi>Car</hi> or <hi>Cara</hi> is said to have invented it, and <hi>Orpheus</hi> to have am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified it; for as they then wanted the knowledge of Divination by the Stars, in such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had it, so they devised these Arts to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves esteemed Prophets; as if the Counsels of the Gods were hidden in the filthy dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill of the Livers and Entrails of dead Men and Beasts: for we read, that both <hi>Heliogaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> sacrificed men for this purpose, as thinking, that from their bowels the most

               <head>CHAP. XV. How <hi>Apollonius</hi> leaving <hi>Ctesiphon,</hi> came into the Confines of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and what Answer be made to a certain Governour that demanded who he was, and whence he came. Also, how afterwards becoming intimate with the Governour, he refused Treasure and other rich Presents offer'd to him, accepting only of Bread and Herbs.</head>
               <p>AFterwards <hi>Apollonius</hi> going above <hi>[1] Ctesiphon,</hi> passed into the Confines of <hi>Babylon;</hi> where the King had placed a Guard that suffer'd not any to pass without enquiring who and whence he was, also what his business was there. The Governour set over this Guard, was (in my opinion) as an Eye to the King: for the <hi>Median</hi> King being new come to the Kingdom, thought not himself secure, but fearing as well Chimaera's as real Dangers, lived with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Trembling and Apprehensions. Therefore <hi>Apollonius</hi> and his Companions are brought before this Governour, who had made himself a Tent on a Waggon, and was riding abroad; but seeing a man in a very sordid Garb he cry'd out like any timorous Woman, and hid his face. But afterwards with much ado looking up upon him, he asked him, as if he had been some Daemon, From whence art thou sent to come among us? <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, From my self; to try if you can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come men even against your wills. The Governour ask'd him again, Who he was that durst thus enter the Kings Territories? To which <hi>Apollonius</hi> reply'd, The whole Earth is mine, and I have liberty to pass thorow the same. Hereupon the Governour threatning to put him to torture, unless he answer'd more plainly those things which he ask'd him, <hi>Apollonius</hi> said to him, If thou touch me, thou shalt be tormented with thine own hands. The Eunuch amazed at him, for that he saw him want no Interpreter, but understanding his speech with ease, and without any
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98416:47"/>
trouble, spake now more mildly to him, and changing his Tone, asked him, In the name of the Gods, who art thou? <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, For as much as you now ask me in a fair and courteous manner, hear thou who I am! I am <hi>Apollonius</hi> the <hi>Tyanaean,</hi> and my Iourney is to the King of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that I may see the things there: I would also willingly be admitted to your King, because such as have been with him say, he is no bad man; if it be <hi>[2] Vardanes,</hi> who hath lately reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Kingdom which he had lost. It is the same (said the Governour) O thou divine <hi>Apollonius,</hi> of whom we have long since heard the same, and he would yield his very Throne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o a wise man; no doubt therefore but he will send you to <hi>India,</hi> every one with his Camel. As for me, I make you my Guest, and give you leave (shewing him a great Treasure of Gold) to take of this what you please, not only once, but ten times over. Now <hi>Apollonius</hi> refusing his Money, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour said unto him, Nevertheless you shall accept this Vessel of <hi>[3] Babylonish</hi> Wine, whereof the King himself doth drink to the ten Governours. You shall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise take these pieces of roasted P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Governour had no sooner utter'd these words, but he reprov'd himself, saying, How extremely have I been mistaken, to entertain a man that neither eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of living Creatures, nor drinketh Wine so absurdly and clownishly. To which <hi>Apollonius</hi> reply'd, Notwithstanding my Diet is slender, yet, Sir, you may Feast me with Bread and Fruits. That (said he) I will willingly do, for I will present you with leaven'd Bread, and great yellow Dates; together with all sorts of the best Herbs that the Gardens of <hi>Tigris</hi> produce. But those Herbs and <hi>[4]</hi> Fruits (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) are sweeter to me that grow wild of their own accord, than those that are forc'd and produc'd by Art. Those Herbs (reply'd the Governour) are indeed the sweeter: but our ground about <hi>Babylon</hi> being full of <hi>[5]</hi> Wormwood, brings them forth unpleasant and bitter. Wherefore he accepted of such Herbs as the Governour proffer'd him, and at parting said unto him, Oh thou good man, be not only courteous at the end, but also in the beginning: implicitely upbraiding him with the Torments that he had before threatned; as also, for the other <hi>[6]</hi> Barbarous Language he at first receiv'd from him.</p>

As Vessels are known whether they be broken or whole, full or empty, by the sound, and Metals by the touch; so Man by the sound of his Tongue, or Speech. Of all the visible parts of the Body which shew themselves outward, that which is nearest the Heart is the Tongue, by the root thereof; so that which comes nearest unto our Thought, is our Speech: for <hi>from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.</hi> Life and Death are in the power of the Tongue: so that there is nothing better, and nothing worse than the Tongue. Hearing and Speech are the two Gates whereby the Soul does traffick: at the one all things enter in, and at the other all go forth. But Hearing is the first Gate, through which all must first pass; for there can nothing come forth of the Soul, but that which first entreth: and therefore he that by Nature is born deaf, the same is likewise dumb. Now from the communication of these two, as from the stroke of two Flints or Irons together, there comes forth the sacred Fire of Truth. The Tongue, like other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Nature, is bestow'd upon us as a singular blessing; yet nevertheless, as with those Legs which are given us to walk about our necessary occasions, we may leap into a River, or off from a Steeple; or with those Hands which are lent us by providence for our defence and service, we may cut our own Throats; so likewise our Tongues, though an eminent gift of Nature, may (if irregularly managed) prove our destruction; as I have already shew'd in the 11th Chapter of this Book. A man's wit should serve rather for a Buckler to defend himself by a handsom reply, than a Sword to wound others, though with never so facetious a Reproach; remembring, that a word cuts deeper than a sharper weapon, and the wound it makes is longer in curing. A sudden blow is the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98416:48"/>
effect of an inconsiderate Passion; but a disgraceful Speech, is the result of a low and base esteem settled of the party in your Heart: Therefore nothing blows up Anger into mischief, like Bitterness of words, especially if they be aculeate and proper; for <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munia maledicta</hi> are little resented. No sharp expressions are so much allow'd of, as smart Repartees, which being both <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and on the defensive part, are not only pardonable, but commendable: wherefore all applauded that Nobleman, who being given the Lye by a Physician, told him he had rather take that of him, than Physick. I must confess there is nothing for the which I have a greater aversion, than foul words, in so much that I can sooner Study with twenty Drums beating about my ears, than with two people a Scolding; for not only the noise, but also the curiosity to hear what they say, too much commands my attention, and that out of an opinion I have, that there is not so much Truth spoken any where, as at <hi>Billinsgate,</hi> when the Orange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wenches call one another Whore, Thief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis the same reason induces me to peruse those Polemical Books, which are written in a more refined <hi>Billinsgate</hi> Dialect, such as the <hi>Friendly Debate</hi> its several Parts, the Books in Answer to Mr. <hi>Hobbs, Marvel</hi>'s and <hi>Parker</hi>'s several Contests, as the <hi>Rehearsal Transpos'd, &amp;c.</hi> in all which, an impartial Reader may discover the several Rogueries (if there be any) of each Sect; whose Pastors (though all Christians) agree in no one Article so Catholically, as in that of paying them Tithes.

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Of a huge Lyoness slain by Huntsmen, and of eight Whelps found in her Womb; also what is reported concerning the Birth of Lyons: Likewise <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s Prediction from the Lyoness and her Whelps: Also of the eight Birds and their Dam that were devoured by a Dragon in <hi>Aulis.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THey had not travell'd above twenty Furlongs, before they light on a Lyoness slain in hunting; the Beast was of so vast a proportion, as they had never seen before. There was a great Outcry of <hi>[1]</hi> Huntsmen about her, as well as of others, who from the neighbouring Villages stockt in, as seeing some wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing in the Beast: And there was indeed a strange thing; for her Belly being ript open, they found eight Whelps in her Womb. Now it is reported, that a <hi>[2]</hi> Lioness bringeth forth in six months, and that but thrice in all her life: At the first time, three Whelps; at the second, two; and at the third, one; which last is (I suppose) more big and fierce than ordinary. For we must not give credit to <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pliny, and Herodotus.</hi>
                  </note> them who say, that when the Whelps are grown to perfection, they tear the Womb of their Dam, and so come forth: for that which doth breed, and that which is bred, seem naturally to be serviceable to one another, for the conservation of their kind. <hi>Apollonius</hi> therefore casting his eyes upon the Beast, and with-holding his speech a long time, at last said, O <hi>Damis,</hi> the time of our sojourning with the King will be a year and eight months; for neither will he let us go sooner, neither will it be easie for us to depart sooner: and this I conjecture from the number of the Whelps, each of which signifieth a month, and the Lyoness her self a whole year; for perfect things are to be compared with things that are perfect. But what will the <hi>[3]</hi> Sparrows in <hi>Homer</hi> say to this, (answer'd <hi>Damis</hi>) whom, being eight in number, the Dragon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98416:49"/>
devoured, taking also the Dam for the ninth? which <hi>[4] Calchas</hi> interpreted to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the nine years that <hi>Troy</hi> should be besieg'd. Look to it therefore, lest (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the determination of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Calchas</hi>) our residence be prolong'd for nine years. Whereunto <hi>Apollonius</hi> reply'd, <hi>Homer</hi> did rightly compare the eight Birds when they were hatch'd unto years; but why therefore should I liken unto years such unperfect Beasts as were not yet born, and perhaps would never have been born? for such things as thwart the course of Nature, are either never brought forth, or if they be, do soon perish. But confide in what I have said, and let us be upon the march, making hereafter our prayers to the Gods, who shew us these things.</p>

                  <p n="1">[1] <hi>HVntsmen:</hi> That Hunting is a Princely Recreation, we find by the Testimony of <hi>Cyrus, Alexander,</hi> and all other Princes, both ancient and modern, who have used it. Also that this Pastime is of great use and advantage to all Princes that follow it, we have the judgment of that wise <hi>Florentine, Machiavil,</hi> who says, (in his <hi>Prince, ch.</hi> 14.) A Prince ought to inure himself to Sports, and by Hunting, Hawking, or such like Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, accustom his Body to hardship, hunger, and thirst; also at the same time inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the Coasts and Situation of the Countrey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hunting (saith a modern Author) is a Recreation commendable not only for Kings and Princes, but likewise for private Gentlemen: And as it is a noble and healthy Pastime, so it is a thing which hath been highly prized in all Ages; for that it trains up youth to the use of manly Exercises in their riper age, being encouraged thereto by the pleasure they take in pursuing either the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Lyon, the stately red or fallow Deer, the wild Boar, the cunning Otter, the crafty Fox, or the fearful Hare. This Exercise neither remits the mind to sloth, softness, or effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy, nor (if used with moderation) doth it yet harden it to inhumanity. It is no small advantage to be inured to bear hunger, thirst, and weariness, from our Childhood; to take up a timely habit of quitting ones Bed early; and loving to sit well and safe upon a Horse. What innocent and natural delights are they, when we see the day breaking forth with those Blushes and Roses, which Poets and writers of Romances only paint, but the Huntsman truly courts? When he heareth the chirping of small Birds pearching their dewy boughs? When he draws in the fragrancy and coolness of the Air? How jolly is his spirit, when he suffers it to be transported with the winding of Horns, and noise of Hounds, which leap up and play round about him? Nothing doth more recreate the Mind, strengthen the Limbs, whet the Stomach, and clear up the Spirit when it is heavy, dull, and overcast with gloomy cares, than Hunting. Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> is an enemy to this Sport, who from Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi>'s example, next to Hunting likes Hawking the worst. As also the learned <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> who (in his <hi>Satyrical Invectives</hi>) saith, Hunting is a most dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable Recreation, a vain Exercise, unprosperous and unhappy Sport, with so much labour and watching night and day to rage and make War against the poor Beasts; a Pastime cruel, and altogether tragical, chiefly delighting in bloud and death. And therefore from the beginning it was ever esteem'd the chief Exercise of the worst of men; for <hi>Cain, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech, Nimrod, Esau,</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> are reported in Scripture to be mighty Hunters: Nor do we read of any one in the New Testament that was given to Hunting; nor of any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were greatly addicted to that Sport, unless the <hi>Ishmaelites, Idumeans,</hi> and other people that did not know God. Hunting was the first original of Tyranny, which cannot find a fitter Author, than such an one, as by continual sporting himself in Bloud and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, has learn'd to despise God and Nature. The <hi>Persian</hi> Kings however esteem'd it as an imitation of warlike Exercises: For Hunting hath in it self something fierce and cruel, while the poor Beast overcome at length by the Dogs, becomes a spectacle of delight, in having its bloud shed, and bowels torn out; at which the barbarous Hunter laughs, whilst the foe Beast routed with an Army of Dogs, or entangled in a Toyl, is carried home by the triumphant Huntsman, with a great troop at his heels, where the fatal prey is cut up in bloody terms of Art, other than which it is not lawful to use. A strange madness of such kind of men, where they themselves casting off their humanity, become Beasts,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98416:49"/>
when by perverting of their manners, like <hi>Acteon,</hi> they are changed into irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Now the Inventers of this fatal Exercise are said to be the <hi>Thebans,</hi> a Nation fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Fraud, Theft, Perjury, and Incest; from whence the practice thereof was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Phrygians,</hi> a Nation equally abominable, foolish and vain, which therefore the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had in great contempt. Afterwards when the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> had repeal'd their Law against Hunting, and that the exercise was admitted pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly among 'em, then was the City of <hi>Athens</hi> first taken; which makes me wonder to find Hunting so much commended by <hi>Plato</hi> Prince of the <hi>Academicks</hi>; unless the Event, honesty of the Invention, or Necessity should be the occasions of its commendations: Thus <hi>Meleager</hi> slew the <hi>Caledonian</hi> Boar, not for his own pleasure, but to free his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from a common mischief: and so likewise <hi>Romulus</hi> hunted Deer, not for pleasure sake, but to get food; <hi>Agrip. Van. ch.</hi> 77. Thus much <hi>Agrippa</hi> produces against Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which in my opinion he did, rather to shew his wit in inveighing against that which is generally approved of, than for any other reason. I have my self been sometimes Master of a Pack of Hounds, and although I must acknowledge that had its inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, (which all other things have) yet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>od doth far exceed the evil of it; and the only thing which makes this exercise so lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> esteem'd of in Books, is, for that the Learned (who are the chief Authors of our publick Writings) have seldom had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to be acquainted with this Recreation. As for my self, (who profess not to be one of those, and who never laid Pen to Paper, but for want of something else to do) I have ever found the advantage of Hunting, far to exceed the inconveniences of it: it's true, the expence and ill company may in some measure be objected, yet a prudent man may so manage himself, as not to be incommoded with either. Rising early is troublesom, but yet 'tis wholesom; and, provided the young Bride suffers not for it,
<q>
                        <l>(— manet sub Iove frigido</l>
                        <l>Venator tenerae conjugis immemor.</l>
                        <bibl>
                           <hi>Hor. lib. 1. Od. 1.</hi>)</bibl>
                     </q>
not to be discommended. A speculative man, may observe in Hunting many things not unworthy his contemplation: as the natural instinct of Enmity and Cunning, whereby one Beast (being as it were confederate with Man, by whom he is maintain'd) serves him in his designs upon others: The perfect scent and smell of the Hound, who never leaves it, but follows it through innumerable changes and varieties, even over the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and into the very Earth. Again, how soon will the Hound fix his eye on the best and fattest Buck of the Herd, single him out, and follow only him through a whole Herd of Rascal Deer, without changing, and not leaving him till he kills him. The wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful knowledge of Dogs, who coming to three several ways, shall try two of them, when not finding the scent there, shall betake themselves to the third, without laying their Noses to the ground: as if they argued within themselves, since he is not here, nor here, he must be there. Moreover, the docibleness of Dogs is as admirable as their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; for as a right Huntsman knows the Language of his Hounds, so do they know his: also the meaning of their own kind, as perfectly as we can distinguish the Voices of our Friends and Acquaintance, from Strangers. When an old Stanch Dog cries it, how will all the others run in to him; whereas if a young Whelp that is newly enter'd doth the like, the others will take no notice of it. Again, how satisfy'd is a curious mind to observe the Game fly before him, and after it hath withdrawn it self from sight, to see the whole Line where it hath pass'd-over, with all the doublings and cross-work which the amazed Beast hath made, recover'd again, by the intelligence of the Dogs. Neither is it less curious to observe the several passions of the Huntsmen, when one for singling a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at Buck out of the Herd, values himself upon his Horsmanship; another for closing in with the Deer when he is at Bay, for his Valour in saving the Hounds; a third, by unkennelling a Fox in a brake of Bushes, tells you but for him you had gone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sport that day; a fourth, by hunting the Foyl, boasts that you had lost the Hare if he had not hollow'd her; a fifth, to shew his great learning in finding a Hare, reproves you for not riding abreast, and at an equal distance; then the Huntsman, with his green Coat, and that by his side which belongs to many a greater persons head, shews his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary skill, in reproving you with much violence for riding upon the Dog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; as also having rated a Dog, tells you they had gone away with a wrong Game, had not he rid
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98416:50"/>
hard for it. Neither are all these several humours and passions of the Huntsmen more diverting to observe, than the pleasant relations they give of their Pastime, when the Ceremony being over, they retire to some Country-Alehouse, to debauch in Cheese and Ale; there you shall hear how <hi>Iowler</hi> led it in such a Field, how <hi>Tomboy</hi> cry'd it in such a Wood, how <hi>Boman</hi> recover'd it in such a Lane, and how <hi>Rockwood</hi> hit it off at such a Path; as also how boldly such a man (crying Neck or nothing) took such a Gate, Hedge, or Ditch; how successfully another headed the Game from the Wood in such a place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which repetitions must be highly diverting even to the most wise obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who from thence may reflect on the weakness of mans Passions, when each one stands up for the honour of his Favourite Dog, with no less heat and zeal then for his Religion, nay then for his Mistress: so that all these things consider'd, Hunting (when used with moderation and discretion) is a very innocent and commendable Recreation. Now the sort of Hunting which our Author here mentions, is that of Hunting the Lion: <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, that they used to hunt him with Dogs, and that the Huntsmen rid armed with Darts, wherewith when they had an opportunity they wounded him, and then the Dogs pluckt him down. Also speaking of the Generosity of this Creature, he saith, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> be there never so many Hounds and Hunters following after him, so long as he is in the open Plains where he may be seen, he seems to contemn both Dog and Man; retiring with honour, and sometimes making head at them: but having once gain'd the Woods and Thickets out of their sight, he then skuds away, and makes what haste he can to save his Life by his flight; as knowing full well, that the Trees and Bushes conceal the dishonour of his Retreat. The same Author likewise reports, that the way of taking them in old time was by Pit-falls; but that in the Emperor <hi>Claudius's</hi> time, a <hi>Getulian</hi> Shepherd taught the <hi>Romans</hi> another manner of catching them, which seem'd at first very incredible; it was by throwing any Mantle or Covering over his head, and that his eyes being cover'd, his Spirit and Strength fail'd him, in so much that you might seize him, fetter him, or do what you pleased with him. <hi>Pliny lib.</hi> 8. <hi>ch.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">[2] <hi>It is reported that a Lioness bringeth forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth, (what our Author here mentions as Fabulous) that the young Lions in their Dams Bellies, tear their way out with their Claws; as also that a Lioness brings forth but one in all her life time. To which the Fable of <hi>Aesop</hi> alludes, where the Lioness being upbraided by the Fox for bringing forth but one Whelp in her whole life, replies, It is true, but that is a Lion. <hi>Solinus</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> write, that Lions have five young ones the first Litter, four the second, three the third, two the fourth, and one the last, all which is in the space of five years, and after that, bears no more: but this doubt, saith <hi>Camerarius,</hi> (<hi>Medit. Hist. par.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 22.) is now clear'd, for that in Parks and Chases of Lions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Lioness brings forth young oftentimes, without any certainty of Number or Time. Now concerning the Nature and great Courage of this Beast, we read many wonderful and almost incredible things. The Whelps at first (saith <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>ch.</hi> 16.) are without shape, like small Gobbets of flesh, no bigger than Weasels; for the two first months they stir not at all, and when six months old they can hardly go. <hi>Africa</hi> breedoth the most and the greatest Lions; now the colder the Climate is, the gentler they be: Lions are the most lustful of all other Creatures, and in time of their coupling, eight or ten will follow one Female, whereupon arise very terrible and bloudy Battels among them. The Lion knows by the scent and smell of her Pard, when the Lioness hath play'd false with him, and layn with another, for the which (if he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it) he chastizes her very severely: whereupon, after she hath jilted him in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, she either goeth to the Water, and washeth away the rank savour of the Pard, or else keepeth some distance off from the Lion, that he might not smell her. They engender backward, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their Nature is highly generous and grateful; for their Generosity makes them spare Women rather than Men, and prey not at all on Infants, unless in case of extream hunger; and albeit the Lion be a fierce and cruel Beast, yet is he said to shew great clemency to the humble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and such as submissively prostrate themselves before him. They naturally are apt to set upon the best man in the company, as we see by the Lion that set upon <hi>Alexander</hi> himself, not medling with <hi>Lys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

it stirreth not, he is gentle and peaceable; but moving, he is angry. These Beasts will keep revenge in mind a long while, either against Man or Beast that hurt them; witness the memorable example in the Story of <hi>Iuba,</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania</hi>; for this King having in his Train a young Gentleman of Quality, that march'd with his Army by the Desarts of <hi>Africa,</hi> this Gentleman meeting in his Journey with a Lion, wounded him with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; whereupon the Lion laying wait for his return, did among so many several Troops pick out this very man, and to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e him in pieces, notwithstanding all possible means were used to save him. In like manner, they will as long be mindful of a Benefit, and do their best to express their gratitude: as is famous by those Stories of <hi>Mentor</hi> the <hi>Syracusian, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drodus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Slave, and <hi>Helpis</hi> the <hi>Samian</hi>; which are thus related in History. First, As for <hi>Mentor</hi> the <hi>Syracusian,</hi> he happening in <hi>Syria</hi> to meet with a Lion, who in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner seem'd to fawn and lye down before him, was very much surpriz'd thereat, and began to fly away from him; but the Beast still pursuing, and in a loving manner lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very tracks of his Feet, <hi>Mentor</hi> looking back upon him, espy'd a great Wound and Swelling in the Lion's Foot; whereupon taking courage, and gently lifting up the Beast's Foot, he gave him great ease, by plucking out a Splinter of Wood that had gotten into it, and occasion'd the Sore; for the which the Lion express'd much thanks, by his gentle and innocent carriage towards him. <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>ch.</hi> 16. Secondly, Concerning <hi>Androdus,</hi> he flying from his Master, for some hard usage that he had receiv'd at his hands, by chance happen'd to take up his Lodging in a Cave which (unknown to him) was a Lion's Den; where having been lodged some time, a little before night the Lion came in from hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having gotten an Hurt upon his Foot, he no sooner espied the trembling man, but going gently to him, he stretch'd forth his Foot, and made moan, as though he desired help. The poor Slave at the first expected nothing but death, till at last perceiving what the matter was, he took the Lion by his Paw, search'd the Wound, pull'd out a Thorn, bound up his Foot, and gave him ease; which kind office being perform'd, was first of all requited with a daily portion of provision which the Lion brought in for his Guest, and the poor helpless Slave roasted in the Sun as well as he could, and then eat it. But being weary of this kind of Diet, as well as of his solitary Life, he one day when his Host was gone abroad to forage, stole away; for whose absence the Lion (as himself could hear) made great mourning and lamentation: Now this man was no sooner parted from <hi>Charybdis,</hi> but he fell into <hi>Scylla,</hi> and was apprehended by some whom his Master had sent to seek him, whereupon he was condemn'd to be torn in pieces by wild Beasts in the Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But it happen'd that in the interim this very Lion was likewise taken; who being brought into the Theatre, greedily devour'd such Malefactors as were thrown to him, till at last his old Guest <hi>Androdus</hi> coming to suffer in his turn, the Beast forgot his fury, and turn'd it into fawning, whereby the poor Slave perceiv'd what Lion it was, and thereupon gather'd up his spirits, renewing again his acquaintance with his former Friend, even to the admiration of all spectators: Whereupon the whole matter being made known and related to <hi>Caesar,</hi> he had not only pardon for his Life, but the Lion also was bestow'd upon him; so that he ever after got his livelyhood by leading him up and down, and shewing him; which made the people where-ever he came cry out, <hi>Hic est Leo Hospes Hominis; Hic est Homo Medicus Leonis:</hi> Here goeth the Lion which was the Man's Host; and there is the Man who was the Lion's Physician. This Story is related both by <hi>Appian,</hi> who was an Eye-witness of it, also by <hi>Aelian,</hi> and <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> in his <hi>Noct. Attic. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>ch.</hi> 14. The third Instance of this nature, is that of <hi>Helpis</hi> the <hi>Samian</hi>; who upon a certain Coast of <hi>Africa,</hi> having drawn out a Bone that stuck in a Lion's Throat, was in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of that Cure, fed and maintain'd by the Lion's hunting, so long as his Ship lay at Anchor on that Shore. <hi>Pliny. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>ch.</hi> 16. And this may suffice to shew the generous Nature of this Beast; of which you may read at large in <hi>Pliny, Leo Africanus, Camerarius,</hi> and <hi>Gesnerus.</hi> The male Lion useth not to feed with the female, but either of them apart by themselves. <hi>Aelian (Var. hist. lib.</hi> 1.) writes, that when a Lion is sick, nothing will cure him but to eat an Ape. And some say, that a Lion trembles at the crowing of a Cock; but Dr. <hi>Hakewill</hi> tells us, that King <hi>Iames</hi> upon tryal found this to be fabulous. <hi>Apol. for Provid. lib.</hi> 1.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. The Dream of <hi>Apollonius</hi> in <hi>Cissia,</hi> with the Interpretation thereof. Also the History of the <hi>Eretrians;</hi> and the Epistle of <hi>Apollonius</hi> to the <hi>Clazomenian</hi> Sophister. Likewise how the <hi>Eretrians</hi> came out of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boea</hi> into <hi>Media;</hi> and what <hi>Apollonius</hi> said whilst he repaired their Sepulchres: together with his Request to the King in behalf of the Eretrians.</head>
               <p>BEing now come into the Country of <hi>[1] Cissia,</hi> and near unto <hi>Babylon,</hi> he receiv'd from God in a dream a Vision to this purpose: Certain Fishes being driven ashore, and lying panting on the ground, seem'd to complain like Men, lamenting that they had come from their proper habitation They also seem'd to implore a Dolphin, swimming hard by the Land, to help them, being as fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of pity, as men bemoaning themselves in a strange Country. Now <hi>Apollonius</hi> being nothing terrified at this Vision, consider'd with himself what it might signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. Nevertheless, intending to frighten <hi>Damis,</hi> for as much as he knew him to be timorous, he related the Vision to him, and made as though he himself was afraid of what he had seen, as ominous. Whereupon <hi>Damis,</hi> as if he had seen the same things himself, cryed out, and disswaded <hi>Apollonius</hi> from going any farther; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let us beware lest we our selves (like the Fishes) being cast out from our own Country, should suffer much hardship, and utter many sad complaints in a Foreign

Land, when falling into inextricable distress, should at length extend our suppliant hands to some King or Potentate, who might slight us, as the Dolphin did the Fishes. Whereat <hi>Apollonius</hi> smiling, said, Tou are no right Philosopher, being afraid of such things as these: therefore <hi>[2]</hi> I will turn Prophet, and explain what this dream portends. The <hi>[3] Eretrians</hi> inhabit this Country call'd <hi>Cissia,</hi> being formerly transplanted by <hi>[4] Darius</hi> out of <hi>[5] Euboea</hi> into these parts, almost 500 years ago: And these, like the Fishes in the dream, are said to lament and mourn at their Captivity, being all (as it were) taken in a Net; Therefore the Gods seem to enjoyn me, in as much as I am come into these parts, to take care of them so far as I am able. And perhaps the Souls of those <hi>Greeks</hi> who lost their Lives in these parts, may by a certain destiny have drawn me hither for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Country. Wherefore let us a little go aside out of our way, and enquire for that Well, by which they only inhabit: For they say it is mixed with Bitumen, Water, and Oyl; so that if any one drawing Liquor from thence, poureth out the same, they separate and may be discern'd severally. Now that <hi>Apollonius</hi> came into <hi>Cissia,</hi> he himself testifieth in his Letter to the <hi>[6] Clazomenian [7]</hi> Sophist: For <hi>Apollonius</hi> was so kind and desirous of commendation, that so soon as he had seen this, he gave an account thereof to the Sophist, as also what he had done for the sake of the Inhabitants, exhorting him through the whole Epistle to take pity of the <hi>Eretrians,</hi> and that when ever it happen'd that he spoke in their behalf, he would not forbear to shed tears for them. And herewith agreeth that which <hi>Damis</hi> wrote concerning the <hi>Eretrians;</hi> for they dwell in the Kingdom of the <hi>Medes,</hi> not farther from <hi>Babylon</hi> then an able Footman can travel in one day. The Country hath no Cities, for <hi>Cissia</hi> is all Villages; There are also a sort of the <hi>[8] Nomades</hi> dwelling amongst them, who live almost continually on Horse-back: but the Village of the <hi>Eretrians</hi> is situated in the middle of the Country, encompass'd with Ditches cut out of the Rivers, which they are said to have cast up about the Town instead of Walls, to secure them from the incursion of <hi>Barbarians.</hi> The Country is full of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuminous Waters, wherefore Plants do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They are nourish'd chiefly by a certain Hill near the Village, which being rais'd up above the other Land, they sow, and esteem good Ground. The Natives report they have heard how above 780 of the <hi>Eretrians</hi> were taken Prisoners, not being all fit to bear Arms, also for that amongst them there were Women, Old men, and I suppose some Children: for a great part of the <hi>Eretrians</hi> had fled to <hi>[9] Caphareus,</hi> and the mountainous parts of <hi>Euboea;</hi> but about <hi>400</hi> men, and <hi>10</hi> women, made their escape in Ships; whereas the rest (beginning from <hi>Ionia</hi> and <hi>Lydia</hi>) did all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, being driven into the upper parts. But their Hill giving them opportunity for the digging of Stone, and many of them being skilful in the hewing of Stones, they erected Temples after the <hi>Greek</hi> fashion, together with a <hi>[10] Forum,</hi> suitable to the condition of the place. They likewise set up Altars, two to <hi>Darius,</hi> one to <hi>[11] Xerxes,</hi> and several to <hi>[12] Daridaeus.</hi> They lived after their Captivity unto the time of <hi>Daridaeus,</hi> above 88
years. They write their Letters, as also the inscriptions upon their ancient Monuments, in <hi>Greek</hi> Letters, which Epitaphs seldom contain any more than this, <hi>Here lyeth such a one, the Son of such a one:</hi> The Letters are <hi>Greek,</hi> but they say they never saw such before. They reported likewise that Ships were engraven on the Tombs, according as every one had lived in <hi>Euboea,</hi> either as Ferryman, or Fisher for Purple, or of some other Sea-faring employment. They also relate, that there is an Elegie written upon the Sepulchre of the Mariners and Pilots:

Furthermore <hi>Damis</hi> says, that <hi>Apollonius</hi> with his own hands repair'd and shut up those Sepulchres which were decayed; also that he made such Libations and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as were accustomed, excepting that he would kill nothing, nor make any expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That he shed Tears, and being fill'd with an inward impulse, express'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thus: O ye <hi>Eretrians,</hi> who were brought hither by the appointment of Fortune, though ye be far removed from your Native Country, yet wanted ye not Burial: whereas those that cast you hither, perished about your Island, lying ten years after you Vnburied; for the Gods declare what hath been done in hollow <hi>Euboea.</hi> Again, <hi>Apollonius</hi> in the end of the Epistle which he wrote to the Sophist, saith, I being yet but a young man, have nevertheless taken care of your <hi>Eretrians,</hi> and have afforded them what help I was able, both to the living and to the dead. But in what manner did he assist the Living? even thus: When the <hi>Eretrians</hi> had sown the Hill, (whereof I spake before) the <hi>Barbarians</hi> adjacent coming upon them about Harvest time, used to prey upon the ripe Corn: whereby the <hi>Eretrians</hi> were likely to perish with hunger, whilst they had labour'd for other men: Thereupon <hi>Apollonius</hi> made a good motion to the King when he came into his presence, that he would grant to the <hi>Eretrians</hi> the sole use of the Hill.</p>

                        </gap>s Agrippa</hi> observes) the Writers of Holy Writ, notwithstanding they were fill'd with the Holy Ghost, did sometimes stray from the Truth; which they did not willingly, but through Humane frailty: Thus <hi>Moses</hi> fail'd in telling the people he would bring them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and carry them into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>; for though he brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> yet did he not bring them into the Land of Promise. <hi>Ionas</hi> fail'd in predicting the destruction of <hi>Niniveh</hi> within fourty days, intended; but delay'd. <hi>Elijah</hi> fail'd in foretelling many things to come to pass
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98416:53"/>
in the days of <hi>Ahab,</hi> which yet were not fulfill'd till after his death. <hi>Isaiah</hi> fail'd in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling the death of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the next day, when his life was prolonged 15 years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Many other Prophets also failed, and their predictions are found either not to have come to pass at all, or else to have been suspended. Amongst 400 Prophets of whom the King of <hi>Israel</hi> asked counsel concerning the War he made against <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> only <hi>Micaiah</hi> was a true one. The Prophet that was sent to Prophecy against the Altar set up by <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> (though a true Prophet, and that by two miracles done in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence appears to be sent from God) was yet deceiv'd by another Old Prophet, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him as from the mouth of God, to eat and drink with him. So that if one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet deceive another, what way is there of knowing the Will of God, but by Reason? The Apostles and Evangelists also fail'd: <hi>Peter</hi> fail'd, when he was reprehended by St. <hi>Paul</hi> for telling a Lye craftily. <hi>Matthew</hi> also fail'd, when he wrote, that <hi>Christ</hi> was not dead till the Lance had pierced his side. From whence it follows, that all Prophets and Writers in some things seem to fail and erre, according to the Scripture which faith, <hi>all men are Lyars.</hi> Now the occasion of this failing may be, for that the Holy Spirit did sometimes leave them: This Spirit was sometimes with <hi>Moses,</hi> but when he struck the Rock, it was departed; it was with <hi>Aaron,</hi> but departed when he made the Calf; it was with <hi>Miraim</hi> their Sister, but not when she murmur'd against <hi>Moses</hi>; and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise was it with <hi>Saul, David, Solomon, Isaiah, &amp;c.</hi> but rested not constantly with them. Neither are Prophets always Prophets, or Seers, or Foretellers of things to come; nor is Prophecy a continual habit, but a Gift, Passion, or transient Spirit. The Prophecies in the Old Testament concerning the coming of a <hi>Messias,</hi> are certainly more exactly and truly fulfill'd in the Birth, Life, and Death of our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> than ever any Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or Predictions were: yet the <hi>Iews</hi> do most impiously object against them. Some of their Manuscripts I have now by me, amongst which there is one of so remarkable a subject, that I thought fitting here to insert it; it being a Dialogue between a <hi>Turk</hi> and a <hi>Iew,</hi> where the <hi>Turk</hi> (invading that Province which of right belongs only to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians) doth in a very extravagant manner attempt to prove his Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be the true and only <hi>Messias</hi> prophecied of in the Old Testament, whilst the <hi>Iew</hi> opposes it out of the same, as follows.</p>

                        <p>The chief Arguments I shall produce, are the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Prophecies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Old Testament. And of them, we will first begin with that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.4. where <hi>Moses</hi> bids them hearken unto the Prophet whom the Lord their God should raise up unto them from amongst their Brethren: whereby <hi>Mahomet</hi> seems to be poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at, according to my apprehension.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Iew.</speaker>
                        <p>I cannot allow of that: For first, although it is a sin not to hearken to God's voice, yet doth it not therefore follow, that they were to listen to every one that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended himself a Prophet, since Experience taught, that there arose up many false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets amongst them. Secondly, To believe that <hi>Moses</hi> promised <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as the only Prophet to whom they should hearken, is without any grounds from <hi>Moses</hi>'s words, and rather a subversion of them, as will appear, if we consider the end for which <hi>Moses</hi> said, a new Prophet would come; also if we examine the Directions he gave them to know if the Prophet spake in the Lord's Name, or presumptuously. First, For the end of this Prophet's coming, <hi>Moses</hi> knowing they desired God himself might not speak to them, told them, that God would raise up a Prophet, putting his words into his mouth, and he shall speak to
you, <hi>viz.</hi> direct you in the right way, and tell you of your sins. Secondly, This Prophet should be from among them, which we are no where told that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was; and if (as some <hi>Arabick</hi> Historians write) his Mother was a <hi>Iew,</hi> yet that doth not argue his Father of the same Tribe, since ever after the Captivity the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> married amongst Strangers. Thirdly, <hi>Moses</hi> promis'd his people to receive great
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98416:53"/>
peace and plenty from the coming of this Prophet, whereupon the <hi>Christians</hi> so much startle us, when they tell us of <hi>Augustus</hi>'s peaceable Reign during Christ's abode upon Earth; but for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> his Doctrine is supported only by the Sword; also there were never more Frauds, Thefts, Wars, Massacres, Murders, and Bloudshed, known in the World, than since the first planting of the <hi>Mah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Because we have a Law amongst us which says, that if any Prophet teaches contrary to that Covenant which God hath made with us at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet shall be stoned to death, for endeavouring to withdraw them from the Lord their God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.

                        <p>A pretty Religion indeed, which (like Popery) regards only the directing your intentions; so that if the end be good, you care not for the means, though you wade through innocent Bloud to attain it. But to proceed. The Lord God in making a new Covenant, hath destroyed the old; wherefore though ye were to hearken to <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Covenants which God made with him at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> so long as ye lived in the Land God gave you to possess; yet notwithstanding you had broken that Covenant, and the Prophet had said in the Name of the Lord, he would make a new Covenant with you, not according to that which he had made with your Fathers; and therefore you are now to hearken and walk according to the new, and not to the old; which new I conceive to be that Covenant which the Lord made by his Prophet <hi>Mahomet.</hi>

                        <speaker>Iew.</speaker>
                        <p>To this we answer, by considering, 1. With whom the Lord will make this new Covenant. 2 The Covenant it self. 3. The manner of it. And 4. the time when it was made. But first, with whom the Lord will make this new Covenant. The Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> saith, <hi>ch.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, and I will make a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> &amp;c. So as here he promises to make a new Covenant with the house of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> a people to whom he had given his Laws by the hand of <hi>Moses</hi>; but they having transgress'd those Laws, the Lord had brought evil upon them, and suffer'd them to be led away captive out of the Land which he had given them: but then God raising up his Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> at the time when he did these things to his people, it pleased the Lord to reveal unto <hi>Ieremiah</hi> their Return after 70 years, <hi>ch.</hi> 29. So as this Prophecy seems only to point at the new Covenant which the Lord design'd to make with them, after their Return from their 70 years Captivity, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.3. Secondly, By considering the Covenant it self, which was, that God would write
his Laws in their hearts, that he would give them hearts to know him, that they should be his people, and he would be their God; and this is the Covenant it self which the Prophet foretold the Lord would make with his people after their Return from Captivity. Thirdly, By considering the manner and not the matter of this new Covenant, which consists in giving them hearts capable to receive this Law, eyes to see it, and ears to hear it, so that he never made them fitting to receive it till now. The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and last thing is to consider the time when the Lord would make this Covenant, which will the better appear, if we observe that after he had promis'd to write his Laws in their hearts, he gives this Reason for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>I will forgive their iniquities, and remember their sins no more</hi>: Now the time when he forgave their iniquities was, when he caused them to return from their Captivity, as 'ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From hence we may conclude, that this Prophecy makes no promise of a new Law, but only of new hearts to receive their old Law, which Prophecy also seems to

have been fulfill'd after their Return from Captivity, and so to have no tendency either to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or his Alcoran.</p>

So that with the Prophet to be here rais'd, was to save them from their enemies,
that they being deliver'd, might serve him upon earth without fear, in holiness and righteousness, all the days of their life. Also those Prophesies of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> do hold forth, that God would raise up to <hi>David</hi> a righteous Branch, and that a King should reign and prosper, executing iustice on the earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in his days <hi>Iudah</hi> shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and <hi>Israel</hi> dwell safely.

                        <p>If you think that Prophecy hath relation to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> sure it is very far fetched; nor would a reasonable man (as I conceive) expound it otherwise, than that the Serpent should be in subjection to man, and that there should be a perpetual enmity betwixt them, which should excite the children of men, to endeavour their destruction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they met them. This I conceive to be the sole intent of that Curse upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and no other; and this likewise we see daily put in execution. Nevertheless I have known some ingenious men wonder, why the whole species should be cursed for the Devils assuming their shape upon himself, which was no act nor error of theirs; however the Lord hath done it, and 'tis marvellous in our eyes.</p>

                  <p>Now the <hi>Iews</hi> (however a credulous people) would never hear a man pretend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, but did always require a <hi>Sign</hi> of him: First, Because in so doing, they imitated their faithful Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> who did the like, as we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. and <hi>Gideon</hi> Judg. 6. and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 King. 20. Secondly, 'Twas the manner of the Prophets to confirm what they spoke in the Name of the Lord by a <hi>Sign,</hi> witness <hi>Exod. ch.</hi> 4. and <hi>Exod. ch.</hi> 16.6, 7, 8. the 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.2, 3, 4. the 1. <hi>King.</hi> 13.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> said to the Children of <hi>Israel; At Even shall ye know that the Lord hath brought you out of the Land of Egypt, and in the morning shall ye see the glory of the Lord</hi>; viz. when the Lord shall give you in the evening Bread to eat, and in the morning Flesh to the full. And this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive was the reason why the <hi>Iews</hi> required a Sign, as 'tis written, <hi>Iob.</hi> 6. when the <hi>Iews</hi> ask'd him, What Sign he shew'd to prove himself to be sent from God, as the Prophets of old did? saying, <hi>Our Fathers did eat Manna in the Wilderness,</hi> &amp;c. To set up for a Prophet, the chief thing necessary is a lively strong Fancy and Imagination They who have the strongest Imagination, are least apt to understand things clearly; as on the contrary, they who have more Understanding, and chiefly esteem that, retain the imaginative power dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, as it were with a Bridle, not to confound the Imagination with the Intellect: wherefore they who study to find out the wisdom and knowledge of things Natural and Spiritual, from the Writings of Prophets, are mistaken. All Prophets have express'd things Spiritual by Corporal, making God like our selves, knowing this to be more natural to our Imaginations, for that there is nothing in the Understanding, which is not first in the Senses. Thus we see <hi>Michaias</hi> makes God sitting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> makes him an old man cloath'd with a white Garment; <hi>Moses</hi> makes him walk in the Garden in the cool of the Evening, as also ask <hi>Adam, Where art thou? Ezekiel</hi> makes God a Frier; Those who were with Christ, made the Holy Ghost a Dove; The Apostle made it consist of Fiery Tongues; And last of all St. <hi>Paul</hi> represents God as a great Light. <hi>Spinosa</hi> (in his <hi>Ingenious Tractat. Theolog. Politic.</hi>) observes, that the Signs given of the Prophets, were according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of each particular Prophet, and therefore they varied in them all, according to their several humours, and temperament of their Bodies. If the Genius of the Prophet was merry and chearful, his Revelations were always of Peace, Victory, and things that produce Mirth; on the contrary, if he was melancholy and splenatick, he reveal'd nothing but Wars, Miseries, Pestilences, Overthrows, and the like. Also if the Prophet was a man of Elocution, he receiv'd the Dictates of God in an elegant style; and so the contrary, if he was uneloquent. The same Rule may likewise be observ'd in their Revelations or Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: thus if the Prophet had receiv'd a Countrey Education, his Visions were most of Cows and Oxen; if he was a Souldier, his Visions were of Armies, Wars, Battels, Sieges, and the like; if a Courtier, of Princes, Palaces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As we see to the <hi>Magi</hi> (whose chief Study is Astrology) was therefore reveal'd the Nativity of Christ, from an imagination of a Star arising in the East, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. Now to justifie the premisses, you may read, that when <hi>Moses</hi> was angry, God reveal'd unto him that dreadful destruction of the First-born, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11.4, 5. When <hi>Ieremias</hi> was sad, and troubled with a <hi>Taedium vitae</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he prophesied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Calamity of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Also <hi>Michaeas</hi> never foretold any good to <hi>Ahab</hi> throughout his whole Life, but always evil, whereas other more chearful Prophets told him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.7. Also you may observe how the style of the Prophesies varied, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Eloquence of the Prophet that deliver'd them, if you compare the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ough style of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Amos,</hi> with those eloquent Writings of <hi>Esaias</hi> and <hi>Nahum,</hi> and so of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98416:55"/>
rest. All which being well consider'd, it will soon appear, that God had no peculiar style of expressing himself, but only according to the Learning and Capacity of the Prophet he spoke to.</p>
                  <p>We find in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is said, that <hi>Micaiah</hi> saw God sitting on his Throne, and all the Host of Heaven standing on his right hand and on his left; and that after debate had concerning <hi>Ahab,</hi> God sent a Lying Spirit into the Prophets of <hi>Ahab,</hi> perswading him to go up to <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> to the intent he might fall and perish there. Upon which, I have heard this wicked Syllogism raised: Whatsoever God commandeth, is good, just, and fit to be done; but God commanded a Lying Spirit, in the manner above-recited; <hi>ergo,</hi> it is good, just, and fit to be done. Here the <hi>Major</hi> is unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true; but concerning the <hi>Minor,</hi> much may be consider'd. First, whether <hi>Micaiah</hi>'s single Testimony concerning this Vision, could bind his Auditors to an undoubted belief thereof, in a point so unusual that no other History can parallel it. Secondly, that this his Testimony, for inducing us to believe that God sate on a Throne, having a right hand and a left, is contrary to the notions we have of Gods Infinity, even by our Divines own confession. Thirdly, that he sent a Lying Spirit in the manner aforesaid; since it seems inconsistent not only with his attribute of Faith, but also of his Goodness. Besides, I conceive my self bound to believe, that God had many other means to destroy <hi>Ahab,</hi> then in such an oblique way as this. I would gladly know therefore, whether the <hi>Minor</hi> may be reputed of equal validity and force with the <hi>Major,</hi> for framing a good Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to this Syllogism? It may be answer'd, That we find (in the Book of <hi>Iudges, ch.</hi> 9.15. &amp; <hi>Isa.</hi> 19.14.) something to this purpose in the point of Gods imploying wicked Spirits: which also will not seem so strange, if we consider, that in some cases God may imploy them as his Ministers, for the execution of Justice, as the Prince does the Hangman, for the punishment of Malefactors. But as concerning the particular of <hi>Micaiah</hi>'s saying, that he saw God sit on his Throne, and that the Host of Heaven was on his right hand, and on his left, unless it be taken otherwise than in a Literal sence, I hope I may (without offence) so far declare my self, as that I should not easily give the <hi>Minor</hi> in the ballance of Reason at least, an equal poize with the certainty of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> unless our Divines help it out with some Allegorical Interpretation. Especially when I consider'd, that the narrative part of <hi>Micaiah</hi>'s Vision (as was said before) depended only on his single Testimony, and seem'd to be approved of no otherwise, than by one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle event in the fall of <hi>Ahab,</hi> which in a Battel might yet happen upon many occasions. Others, and particularly the Adversaries of our Faith, will more boldly object, that <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Prophets being confident, that the Armies of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> when joyn'd together would get the day, perswaded the King to fight, whilst themselves according to their usual manner, stay'd at home and prayed; and that it was not unlikely that all things might come to pass as they did, without God's sending a lying Spirit into the mouths of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Prophets. And finally, because God had so many ordinary ways to procure <hi>Ahab</hi>'s distraction, they would say, that it seems incongruous for the divine Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to choose this. For which, and many other Reasons also, if they rejected not the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative part as improbable, they would however not allow it to go in equal ballance with the <hi>Major.</hi> Nevertheless in this, as in all other controverted points, it were good to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult our Divines, before any thing be determined: Now the Reason why many false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have deliver'd most of their Precepts Aenigmatically and Parabolically, is either upon the same account as the <hi>Heathens</hi> did their Oracles, that they might be expounded several ways, according to several Interests, and so likely to speak truth one way or t'other; or else that some might get their Living by expounding them, knowing that all who live upon their Doctrine, will not fail to speak well of the giver of it, as we see by <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Priests. Prediction or Prognostication are in a manner the same with Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, differing only as Credulity and Faith, whereof the former is usually applied to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, and the latter to things divine. Now Prognostication is thought by many to be but a happy guess, which from the vast experience of what is past, directs its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to judge of things to come, when meeting with the same actions and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as in former times, (also well knowing that mankind ever was, is, and will be the same, and subject to the same Passions) they have reason to expect the like success for the future. Now of all sorts of Prophesies, those which respect general Things, and remote
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98416:55"/>
Times, are most of all to be suspected: To foretell that such a Kingdom shall be invaded, or embroyled in Wars, as (were we now at Peace throughout the whole World) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie that there should be great Wars between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or that in time the <hi>Mexicans</hi> and <hi>West-Indians</hi> should revolt from the Dominion of <hi>Spain,</hi> that such an Empire should be destroy'd, such a Countrey infested with the Plague, or such a great City fir'd, are things that require little Art or skill; for that (unless some time be limited wherein these things should happen) such a Prophesie can never be proved false, until it be fulfill'd, which in all probability (if they be any of the foremention'd things) will come to pass once in a thousand years. Again, To prophesie of the end of this World, or of the other World, (without some divine confirmation by a Miracle) renders the truth of such a Prediction very uncertain, and makes men jealous that the Prophet spoke of so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a time, and laid the Scene of his Prophesie at such a distance, only that he might not live to see himself contradicted, well knowing, that whilst the World endured, no man could disprove him.

Prognostications and Prophecies do often help to further that which they foretell, the silly people wilfully running into such a predicted Fate, as if inexorable, because fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told: Again, others as craftily may endeavour to fulfil a Prophecy which is to their advantage, so that the first Prophecy may produce a second Prophet: as some of the Ancients receiv'd their titles of Wise, only from the Oracles.

For my part, this ignorance of my own Destiny, I look upon to be one of the greatest blessings Almighty God hath bestow'd upon me. I would not know the time or manner of my death, for the World: if I knew the time, I might not (as perhaps I now may) live with that joy, content and pleasure, till the very hour before my death; nay it might then he irksom to me some years before it happen'd, when I could positively say, on such a day, in such a year, and such a month, I must certainly dye: so that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of the time, doth in some measure extenuate the certainty of the suffering. Neither would a certain knowledge of the manner and place of my death, be less irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som to me: for if I knew it was to be by some fall out of a Coach, or off from a Horse, it might disable me from travelling either way, lest the first time I rid so, might prove the fatal hour. Again, if I knew I should dye at such a Relations House, this might ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me from visiting him, for fear of making his Habitation my Sepulchre. So that the All wise disposer of all things, who doth nothing in vain, hath for the good of mankind conceal'd this prescience from us.</p>

Upon his being defeated by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> rebell'd against him, and were subdued: which encouraging him to think of conquering all <hi>Greece,</hi> and thereupon marching with 600000 men against it, he was shamefully overthrown by <hi>Miltiades</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> who brought but 10000 against him, in the Field of <hi>Marathon,</hi> and register'd (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith) by almost 300 Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. In this Fight <hi>Themistocles</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> gave sufficient proofs of his valour; wherein also one <hi>Cyneris</hi> (a common Souldier) was so fierce, that when both his hands were cut off, he fasten'd his Teeth upon a flying Ship of the <hi>Persians,</hi> as if he meant to stay it. Afterwards, <hi>Darius</hi> thinking to repair this ignominious loss, the Rebellion of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> and quarrel between his Sons for the Succession, brought him to his end: for <hi>Artabazanes</hi> his eldest Son claimed it as Heir, but (in regard he was born whilst his Father was but a Subject) the younger
Son <hi>Xerxes</hi> carried away the Crown, he being Grandchild to <hi>Cyrus</hi> by <hi>Atossa.</hi> Of this Prince you may read at large in <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus, lib.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6. also in <hi>Iustin, lib.</hi> 1, 2. in <hi>Valerius Maximus, Aelian,</hi> and others.

The Palaces are cover'd with Brass, and glister with it; also the Chambers both of Men and Women, together with the Porches, are adorn'd, some with Silver, some with Tapistry of Gold, and some with beaten Gold, instead of Pictures.

parts of the World, as also made provision of materials requisite for so great a Fabrick, she imploys three millions of men about it, which she had summon'd together from all parts of her Dominions; and that it might be the sooner built, dividing it into several Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, she committed the care of each particular Furlong to some one of her Confidents, supplying them continually with money wherewithall to defray charges. This City was founded (as <hi>Philostratus</hi> here writes) on each side the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which ran through the midst of it: the Walls whereof were in circuit 22 Leagues and an half, (as <hi>Diodorus</hi> tells us) all planted thick with high Turrets, and the breadth of them such as six Chariots might pass afront on them, besides their heighth almost incredible, if you will believe <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>; but according to others, so broad that two Chariots might go on breast: As for the length, it had so many Furlongs as there were days in the year, their manner being on each day to erect a Furlong of Wall, saith <hi>Diodorus Sic. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>Herodotus, Pliny, Solinus,</hi> and our <hi>Philostratus</hi> say, that these Walls of <hi>Babylon</hi> were 480 Furlongs in compass, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing situate in a large four-square Plain, environ'd with a broad and deep Ditch full of Water; <hi>Strabo</hi> saith, the compass of the Wall was 380 Furlongs; and <hi>Curtius</hi> will have it but 358. whereof only 90 Furlongs inhabited, and the rest allotted to Husbandry. Again, Concerning the thickness and heighth of the Walls they also disagree: The first Authors affirm the heighth 200 Cubits, and the thickness 50. and they which say least cut off but half that sum; so that well might <hi>Aristotle</hi> esteem it rather a Countrey than a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being of such greatness, that some part of it was taken three days by the Enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other heard of it. <hi>Lyranus</hi> out of <hi>Ierom</hi> upon <hi>Esay</hi> affirmeth, that the four-squares thereof contained 16 miles apiece, wherein every man had his Vineyard and Garden to his degree, wherewith to maintain his Family in time of Siege. The Fortress or principal Tower belonging to this Wall, was (saith he) that which had been built by the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi>; and not without cause was it reckon'd among the Wonders of the World. It had an 100 brazen Gates, and 250 Towers. This Bridge which <hi>Philostratus</hi> mentions, was 5 Furlongs in length. The Walls were made of Brick and Asphaltum, a shiny kind of Pitch which that Countrey yieldeth. She built two Palaces, which might serve both for Ornament and Defence: one in the West, which environed 60 Furlongs with high Brick Walls; within that a less, and within that also a less Circuit, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the Tower. These were wrought sumptuously with Images of Beasts, wherein also was the game and hunting of Beasts display'd; this had three Gates. The other in the East, on the other side the River, contain'd but 30 Furlongs. In the midst of the City she erected a Temple to <hi>Iupiter Belus</hi> (saith <hi>Herodot. lib.</hi> 2.) with brazen Gates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and four-square, (which was in his time remaining) each square containing two Furlongs, in the midst whereof is a solid Tower, of the heighth and thickness of a Furlong, upon this ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so one higher than another, eight in number.

And this, saith <hi>Diodorus,</hi> is the account which Fables give of <hi>Semiramis</hi>'s Birth, which, as <hi>Sabellicus</hi> observes, very much resembles the Fictions which Posterity invented of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Romulus,</hi> not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the true and sacred Narrative of <hi>Moses.</hi> Now <hi>Semiramis</hi> surpassing all other Virgins in beauty, and being then marriageable, <hi>Menon,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Syria,</hi> (who had been sent by the King to take an account of his Cattel, and residing at <hi>Simma</hi>'s House) fell in Love with her, and married her; then carrying her back with him to the City of <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi> he there had two Sons by her, <hi>Iapetes</hi> and <hi>Idaspes.</hi> Now her beauty did so totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence <hi>Menon,</hi> that wholly resigning up himself to <hi>Semiramis,</hi> he would do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her advice. But Fortune (who envies nothing so much as the happiness of Lovers) would not permit them long to enjoy this mutual and calm satisfaction; for the Prince is engaged in the Fields of <hi>Mars,</hi> and the Subject must not lye sleeping at home in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of <hi>Venus:</hi> King <hi>Ninus</hi> is storming the City <hi>Bactria</hi> and <hi>Menon</hi> his Officer must no longer absent himself from the Camp.

Thereupon, she being a most prudent Woman, and endued with more courage than is usually found in that Sex, making use of this opportunity of shewing her extraordinary vertue, undertakes the Journey, in obedience to her Husband, notwithstanding it was long and tedious.

self in such a Garment, as she might pass either for Man or Woman upon occasion, and which would not only protect her from the heat of the Weather, but was withall so light, as it could no ways incommode her, in case of any Action; which Habit was so generally approved of, that first the <hi>Medes,</hi> and afterwards the <hi>Persians,</hi> (when they possest the <hi>Asiatick</hi> Empire) did for a long time use no other than this <hi>Semirian</hi> Garment. Now in this Dress she arrived <hi>incognito</hi> at the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Camp, where having observ'd the posture of the Siege, as also the situation of the City, she discover'd that the Castle (naturally strong, and difficult of access) was therefore neglected, and unprovided of men for its Guard, the <hi>Bactrians</hi> at that time being wholly imploy'd in defending the Outworks of the City, which the <hi>Assyrians</hi> only assaulted, as looking upon the Castle impregnable. Whereupon <hi>Semiramis</hi> having privately made this observation, selects out of the whole Army a Detachment of such men, as were best skill'd in climbing up steep Rocks and Mountains, who with much difficulty ascending up thorow the rough and narrow passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, made themselves Masters of one part of the Castle; when to amaze the Enemy, she makes a dreadful noise, withall giving notice to the Besiegers that the Castle was taken; whereat the Besieged within were so terrified, that evacuating themselves, they abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the defence of the Town, and attempted nothing more but the saving of their own Lives by flight. The City thus taken, and <hi>Semiramis</hi> discover'd, all persons were in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her heroick Vertue and Beauty; in so much, that King <hi>Ninus</hi> himself (who is call'd in the Scripture, <hi>Ashur</hi>) falling desperately in Love with her, did first by fair means require her Husband <hi>Menon</hi> to resign up his Wife to him; which he refusing to do, the King at length threatned him with the loss of both his Eyes: to prevent which Torture, <hi>Menon</hi> (desiring of Evils to choose the least) did with his own hands strangle himself. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King married his Widow <hi>Semiramis,</hi> by whom he had one Son called <hi>Ninus</hi> the second, or <hi>Ninyas</hi>; and soon after died, leaving the Government both of his Son and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>Semiramis.</hi> There are various Reports concerning this <hi>Ninus</hi>'s Death; for some with <hi>Orosius</hi> and <hi>Reusnerus</hi> will have it, that he died of a Wound receiv'd by a Dart in the <hi>Bactrian</hi> War: but <hi>Diodorus</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> and other Historians affirm, that <hi>Semiramis</hi> presuming upon the influence of her Beauty, requested <hi>Ninus</hi> that she might be invested with the Royal Robes, and rule absolutely but for five days; whereunto he assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, she after having made experiment of the Fidelity and Obedience of some of her Guards, commands them to imprison the King her Husband, which immediately they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and by this means she assumed the Government of the Empire. Herewith like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise both <hi>Aelian</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> agree, differing only in these Circumstances, that whereas <hi>Diodorus</hi> saith, she imprison'd him, they affirm, that she kill'd him: also whereas <hi>Diodorus</hi> and <hi>Aelian</hi> write, that she requested to rule five days, <hi>Plutarch</hi> says, her petition was but for one day. Now for <hi>Semiramis</hi>'s Government after her Husband's Death, <hi>Iustin</hi> gives us this Account of it; That <hi>Ninus</hi> himself being slain, and his Son <hi>Ninus</hi> but young, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis</hi> not daring to commit the Government of so great an Empire to a Boy, nor open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to exercise the Command of it her self, (so many and so powerful Nations being scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedient to a Man, would be much less to a Woman) did counterfeit her self to be the Son instead of the Wife of <hi>Ninus,</hi> and a Boy instead of a Woman. They were both of a middle Stature, their Voice but soft, their Complexion and Features of Face, as likewise the Lineaments of their Bodies were alike both in Mother and Son: she therefore with Rayment cover'd her Arms and Thighs, putting a Tire on her Head; and that she might not seem to conceal any thing by her new Habit, she commanded the people all to be cloath'd in the same Attire, which that whole Nation have ever since observ'd: having thus counterfeited her Sex, she was believ'd to be a young Man.

She builded <hi>Babylon,</hi> (as I shew'd before) and being not contented to defend the bounds of the Empire obtain'd by her Husband, she not only made an addition to the same of all <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> but also carried the War into <hi>India,</hi> which (besides her self and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great) never any invaded.

                        <hi>Orpheus</hi>'s Musick (saith he) is of two sorts; the one appeasing the Internal Powers, the other attracting Beasts and Trees: whereof, the first may be fitly apply'd to Natural Philosophy; the second, to Moral or Civil Discipline. The most noble work of Natural Philosophy, is the restitution and renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things corruptible: The other (as a lesser degree of it) the preservation of Bodies in their estate, detaining them from dissolution and putrefaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if this gift may be performed in Mortals, certainly it can be by no other means, than by the due and exquisite Temper of Nature, as by the melody and delicate Touch of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument. But seeing it is of all things most difficult, it is seldom or never attain'd unto; and in all likelihood, for no other reason, more than through curious diligence and untimely impatience. And therefore Philosophy, hardly able to produce so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an effect in a pensive humour, (and that without cause) busies her self about Humane objects, and by perswasion and eloquence, insinuating the love of Vertue, Equity, and Concord in the minds of men, draws multitudes of people to a Society, makes them subject to Laws, obedient to Government, and forgetful of their unbridled affections, whilst they give ear to Precepts, and submit themselves to Discipline: whence follows, the building of Houses, erecting of Towns, planting of Fields and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards with Trees, and the like; in so much that it would not be amiss to say, that even thereby Stones and Woods were call'd together, and settled in order. It is also wisely said in the Fable, that <hi>Orpheus</hi> was averse from the love of women and marriage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the delights of Wedlock, and the love of Children, do for the most part hinder men from enterprizing great and noble designs for the publick good, holding Posterity a sufficient step to Immortality, without Actions.</q>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>Apollonius</hi> being enter'd into <hi>Babylon,</hi> would not worship the Kings Golden Image: His words to the Kings Officers; and how he was brought before the King; as also concerning the Kings dream.</head>
               <p>WHen therefore <hi>Apollonius</hi> had made his entrance into <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Officer that guarded the great Gates, having heard that he was come only to see the City, presented to him the <hi>[1]</hi> Kings Golden Image, which if any one refused to worship, he might not be admitted entrance; only those that came Embassadors from the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, were exempted from this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. But with that <hi>Barbarian,</hi> if any one came only to view the Country, it was an affront for him not to worship the Image; so foolish Customs have great Officers set over them among the <hi>Barbarians. Apollonius</hi> therefore beholding the Image, asked who it was? and when they told him, it was the King; <hi>Apollonius</hi> reply'd, This man whom ye worship in this manner, if I commend him as appearing to be a good and virtuous person, it shall be a great honour to him. And having thus spoken, passed thorow the Gates; but the Officer admiring at the man, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, and taking him by the hand, asked him by an Interpreter, what was his Name? his Family? his Employment? and the cause of his coming into those parts? Then setting down <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s Answer in a Writing-Table, together with his habit and feature, he bad him stay, when running to the men that are called the Kings Ears, he describeth <hi>Apollonius</hi> to them, telling them that he would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Kings Image, and was unlike to other men. Whereupon they commanded the Officer to bring him in an honourable manner before them, and to offer him no affront. Who being come, the Eldest man ask'd him, what it was that made him thus slight the King? whereto he answer'd, I have not yet slighted him. The man asking him, But would you slight him? By <hi>Jove,</hi> I may do so (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) if by conversing with him, I find him not to be a good and virtuous person. Do you bring the King any Presents? said the man. I bring (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Iustice, and the like. Do you (said the other) bring these to the King as supposing him destitute of them? By <hi>Jove,</hi> (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) only as to one that shall learn how to use them, if he hath them. The King (saith the man) hath by the use of such Virtues, both recover'd his lost Kingdom which thou seest, and regain'd his Palace, not without much Toyl and Trouble. How many years is it since he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd his Kingdom? said <hi>Apollonius.</hi> The other answer'd, Two years and two months. Hereupon <hi>Apollonius</hi> raising his voice, (as he in like cases was used to do) said, O Keeper of the Kings person, (or by what Title soever you are call'd) <hi>[2] Darius</hi> the Father of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>[3] Artaxerxes,</hi> having possess'd this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98416:61"/>
about <hi>60</hi> years, when he suspected that the end of his Life drew near, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have sacrificed to Iustice, and to have said these words, <hi>O Lady, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thou art!</hi> as having a long time been a Lover of Iustice, but not yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, nor possessed her; in that he educated his Children so foolishly, as that they waged War upon one another, and one was wounded, the other slain. But you (though the King perhaps scarcely knoweth how to sit in the Kingly Throne) suppose him to have already acquired all kinds of Virtue, and so puff him up beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: if he become better than he is, I bring profit to you, and not to my self. Whereupon another <hi>Barbarian</hi> standing hard by, looking upon <hi>Apollonius,</hi> said, This man was brought hither as a Present of the Gods: For so good a man as this, conversing with so good a man as the King, will make him far better, more modest, and of a sweeter disposition; in as much as he seemeth not a little to surpass other men. Wherefore they ran to divulge the good news to all, that there stood at the Kings doors a certain <hi>Greek,</hi> who was a Wise man, and an excellent Counsellor. It happen'd when this News was brought to the King, he was offering up Sacrifice in the presence of the Magicians; (for Sacred Rites are perform'd by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:) wherefore calling one of them, he said to him, I perceive my Dream is out, which I related to you this day, when you came to visit me as I lay in bed: For such a Dream as this had happen'd to the King; <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> He seem'd to himself to be <hi>[4] Artaxerxes</hi> the Son of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and that his countenance was changed to be like him. Wherefore the King was much afraid, lest his affairs should fall into some alteration, interpreting to that purpose the change of his countenance. But when he had further heard that the Stranger which was come was a <hi>Greek,</hi> and a Wise man, he call'd to mind the <note n="‡" place="margin">Plutarch <hi>in</hi> Themist.</note> Story of <hi>[5] Themistocles</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> who sometime coming out of <hi>Greece,</hi> convers'd with <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and did improve the King, as well as shew his own worth: Wherefore stretching forth his right hand, he bid them call in the man, that so he might both sacrifice and pray with him.</p>

The sacred Images of the Heathens, were a great part of their Religion; to them they address'd themselves, when many times their Imaginations were so much stronger than their Reasons, that they fancied they either heard the Image speak, saw her Nod, or found her Sweat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> like timerous persons, who in looking stedfastly on a dead corpse, fancy they see its Eyes open, or its Lips or Nose move. Thus at the sacking of <hi>Vrii,</hi> some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers entring into the Temple of <hi>Iuno,</hi> accosting her Image, and asking it, <hi>vis venire Romam,</hi> will you come to <hi>Rome?</hi> to some of them she seem'd to becken by way of consent, and others fancied she said <hi>Yes</hi>; For those men being more then ordinary Religious, (as <hi>Titus Livy</hi> infers from the Devotion, Reverence, and Quietness wherewith they enter'd the Temple) fancied they heard that Answer, which 'tis possible they expected before; and <hi>Camillus,</hi> with the other Magistrates of the City, promoted their belief. The reason why many of these Images have been observ'd to sweat, (saith <hi>Vaninus</hi>) is either from the warmth of the Air, or from Candles melting the colours of the Image, or else the Priests did secretly die the Skin of the painted God with the bloud of a Beast or Man, or privately convey a small stream of bloud by certain Pipes to the Eyes of the Idol; whereupon when the doors of the Temple were open'd, the people that came thither were amazed, and not understanding or considering the Natural cause of the Event, said it was a

Miracle. Now when any one was in danger of his Life, he presently made his address to these Images, with Vows, Supplications and Prayers; then if perhaps he obtain'd his wish, he thought himself bound by his Vow to return thanks for it to the Gods, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he was declared by the Priest to be guilty of breaking his Vow: and if the thing did not succeed according to his wish, and the Votary as yet survived, the Priests did then inculcate, that his own wickedness was the cause why his Prayers were not heard by the Gods. Again, if a pious man was deluded, they endeavour'd to perswade him to acknowledge the mercy of the Gods, who chastise in this life those whom they Love; but if he that had Vow'd, did perish, there would none be then left to raise any such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections against the Gods: <hi>Careat successibus opto quisquis ab eventu, &amp;c.</hi> and by these frivolous Superstitions the Priests deluded the People. It's true, some object that <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> having taken money out of the Treasury of <hi>Proserpina Locrensis,</hi> was punish'd with the calamity of Shipwrack: To which it may be answer'd, that after <hi>Dionysius</hi> had robbed the Treasury of the same <hi>Proserpina Locrensis,</hi> he sail'd with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous Gale, and jeering the Gods, spake to his Companions in this manner: See what a prosperous Voyage is given by the immortal Gods to Sacrilegious persons! <hi>Vanini Dialog.</hi> 55.

                     </gap> Worship. Also an Image in the largest sence, is either the Resemblance or the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of something visible; wherefore there can be no Image of an Infinite, because it is not visible: Thus there cannot be made any Image of God, nor of the Soul of Man, nor of Spirits, but only of Bodies visible; therefore when Poets describe their Centaurs, although such Monsters were never yet seen, yet however they compose the Figure of parts that they have seen, adjoyning to the Body of a Man, the Feet, Tail, or Horns of a Beast; for <hi>Nil fuit in intellectu, quod non fuit prius in sensu.</hi> Having thus therefore shew'd you the signification of the two words <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Image,</hi> we may infer from thence, that to worship an Image, is voluntarily to do those external Acts which are signs of honouring either the Matter of the Image, (which is Wood, Stone, Metal, or some other visible Creature) or the Phantasm of the Brain, every man applying a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and whimsical Image of his own making, over and above that which is visible to his Eyes. Now this kind of worshipping Images, is that Idolatry which God so strictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad in his Commandments; being not only a dishonour to the Infinite Being, (as much as in them lies) to attempt to make his Image, but also it was a means to withdraw them from the worship of the True God, for a False. Images were used as well by the ancient Heathens, as by our modern Catholicks, of which you may read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.26, 27. And Mons. <hi>Daillée</hi> (in his most excellent Treatise call'd, <hi>La Religion Catholique Romain instituée par Numa Pompile</hi>) demonstrates with great Learning and Wit, that the Papists took their Idolatrous worship of Images, as well as all their other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, from the old Heathen Religion; so that they may justly plead for the Antiquity of their Church-worship, it being many hundred years older than <hi>Christ</hi> himself. The <hi>Trojans</hi> had their <hi>Paladium,</hi> or Statue of their Goddess <hi>Pallas,</hi> in whom they confided: The <hi>Rhodians</hi> dedicated to <hi>Apollo</hi> that famous <hi>Colossus</hi> of Brass, 800 foot in height, which was broken down by the <hi>Saracens, Anno Dom.</hi> 684. We read also of the Statue of <hi>Iupiter Olympias,</hi> made by <hi>Phydias,</hi> 150 cubits high; <hi>Apollo Capitolinus,</hi> that stood at <hi>Rome, cum multis aliis, &amp;c. Eusebius (Eccles. Hist. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>ch.</hi> 17.) affirms, that Images are taken from the Pagans, who were wont to honour after this manner such as they accounted Saviours: Also <hi>Arnobius</hi> spends most of his sixth Book in confuting this practice of Images. Now to compare the use the <hi>Romanists</hi> put their Images to, with the use the <hi>Heathens</hi> made of theirs, let us consider; First, how the Heathens adorn'd their Images? they deckt them with Silver and Gold, as you may see, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.4, 5. <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.22. Also <hi>Tursellinus</hi> mentions several Garments richly embroider'd and adorn'd with Gold and Jewels, presented by Princes and Noblemen for the Blessed Virgin: <hi>Iustus Iusteius</hi> Earl of <hi>Verona,</hi> gave to the Lady of <hi>Loretto</hi> a Garment of Cloth of Gold, faced with costly Skins and Furs, gotten at the Games of <hi>Florence</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Dutchess of <hi>Cleves</hi> presented her with a Chain of Gold, and other rich Jewels; <hi>Hist. Lauret. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>ch.</hi> 13. Secondly, the Heathens dedicated their Images with Prayers and Solemnities, before they paid any Veneration to them; <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.2, <hi>Then Nebuchadnezzar the King
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98416:62"/>
sent to gather together the Princes and Governours, to come to the Dedication of the Image which he had set up</hi>; and <hi>Arnobius</hi> mentions as much, <hi>lib.</hi> 1.6.8. <hi>Minucius, Tertullian,</hi> and others: Also the <hi>Romanists</hi> do as much at the Consecration of their Saints; for which (it being too tedious here to insert) I shall refer you to <hi>Pontif. Rom.</hi> pag. 367. Thirdly, the Heathens paid great honour to the Statues and Images of their Gods, which they express'd several ways: As first, by cringing, bowing, and kneeling, <hi>adorant simulachra in terram prostrati,</hi> saith <hi>Arnobius, lib.</hi> 6. Secondly, by kissing them, as it is 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.18. <hi>Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.</hi> Now the Papists do as much as this; for the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> speaking of Images, (<hi>Sess.</hi> 25.) saith, We kiss them, uncover the head, and fall down before them. Fourthly, the Heathens lighted Candles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and burnt Incense before their Images, <hi>Baruch</hi> 6.19, 21. and <hi>Arnobius</hi> tells us, that the Images perfumed and discolour'd with Smoak, grew black, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. Now the Papists use the same; for <hi>Thomas Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Fifthly, the Heathens pray'd before their Images, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.17. <hi>He falleth to it, and saith, Deliver me, for thou art my God:</hi> also <hi>Minucius</hi> witnesseth the same. And thus do the Papists; Whosoever (being in the state of Grace) shall devoutly say these seven Prayers before an Image of Piety, with seven <hi>Pater Nosters</hi> and <hi>Ave Maria</hi>'s, shall merit a Pardon for 56000 years; which was granted by three Popes, <hi>Gregory</hi> the 14. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the 5. and <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4 <hi>Hor.

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus you see the <hi>Romanists</hi> give the very same Adoration to the Images of their Saints, as the <hi>Pagans</hi> did to the Statues of their Gods.

Secondly, the Papists however do more than this: for <hi>Suarez</hi> (one of their own Writers) tells us, That the Image may and ought to be worshipp'd with the same Adoration with the Original: moreover the Authority of the seventh General Synod, as also the Council of <hi>Trent, part</hi> 3. say, That 'tis the constant opinion of Divines, that the Image is to be honour'd and worshipp'd with the same honour and worship, which is due to the person whereof it is an Image; <hi>Azor.

So that this third Brother (who was at first call'd <hi>Ochus,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Darius Nothus</hi>) took possession of the Throne, wherein he was no sooner seated, but by the advice of his Wife <hi>Parysatis,</hi> (who was a Woman of great cunning and cruelty) he endeavour'd to get into his possession another of his Brothers, call'd <hi>Secundianus,</hi> who was yet alive, (as thinking it his safest way to spend and destroy all such of the Blood Royal, that might contend with him for Title.) Wherefore alluring <hi>Secundianus</hi> by fair promises and oaths, he at last prevail'd with him to trust himself in his hands, notwithstanding <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now <hi>Darius Nothus</hi> had no sooner gotten <hi>Secundianus</hi> into his power, but he immediately put him to death. This King had one policy beyond his Ancestors; for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Forces had been often routed, he chose rather to bribe and conquer with the Purse, than to fight upon an uncertainty with the Pike. The old observation was, that no Town is so strong, but an Ass loaden with Gold might enter therein. The corruption of mens Natures is so great, that all honesty depends upon who bids most. This will (I fancy) in time render all strong holds and fortifi'd places useless, since if any one of the Officers within the same be dishonest, (and what principles can such men have, who live upon Rapine, Fire, and Sword?) the place is lost. Moreover, if Princes consider'd the lives of their common Souldiers when lost in their service, any more than dead Dogs or Crows, they would all follow the example of this <hi>Darius,</hi> and rather purchase a Fort with the Bribe of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> than with the loss of 10000 mens lives. But of this more hereafter. Now <hi>Darius</hi> by this means closed with the stout <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and recover'd most of what his Predecessors lost in <hi>Asia.</hi> In Scripture it is said, that he promoted the building of the Temple, which by his Father had been interrupted, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. His chief Favourites were three Eunuchs, <hi>Artoxares, Artibarxanes,</hi> and <hi>Athous</hi>; but his chiefest Counsellor was his Wife <hi>Parysatis,</hi> by whom he had thirteen Children, whereof only his Daughter <hi>Amistris,</hi> and his three Sons, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his first <hi>Cyrus</hi> his second, and <hi>Oxendras</hi> his third, outlived him. <hi>Ctesias</hi> writes, that <hi>Arsites,</hi> the King's own Brother, together with <hi>Artyphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> the Son of <hi>Megabyzus,</hi> joyn'd with the <hi>Greeks</hi> in a revolt, whereupon they were both taken by <hi>Darius</hi>'s General <hi>Artasyras,</hi> and immediately by <hi>Parysitis</hi>'s advice put to death, both being cast into ashes; which manner of death, <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> saith, was invented by <hi>Darius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hystaspes,</hi> though others attribute it to this <hi>Darius Nothus.</hi> Now soon after this, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At this time it was, that <hi>Artaxerxes (Darius</hi>'s eldest Son) married <hi>Statira,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Idarnes,</hi> a man of great quality among the <hi>Persians</hi>; and <hi>Terituch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Soon after the <hi>Greek</hi> Cities, under, <hi>Thymbro</hi> their Captain-General, declared against the King, and from a small power grew very considerable, and successful, chiefly from an Emulation and Dissention between the two <hi>Persian</hi> Generals, <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> and <hi>Pharnaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus:</hi> which produced frequent Miscarriages abroad, and Accusations at home, one of another, to the King, till at last <hi>Agesilaus</hi> obtaining a considerable Victory over the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> near the River <hi>Pactolus,</hi> for want of their Foot, which was occasion'd by <hi>Tissapher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>'s absence, they accused him to the King of Treachery, which Accusation being vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously prosecuted by <hi>Parysatis,</hi> (who bore him a mortal grudge upon the account of her Son <hi>Cyrus) Artaxerxes</hi> made <hi>Tithraustes</hi> General in his stead, with a particular Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to put to death <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> which accordingly was done; for <hi>Ariaeus</hi> alluring him to <hi>Colossus</hi> in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> under pretence of a new Commission for him, did there seize <hi>Tissapher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> in the Baths, and send him Prisoner to <hi>Tithraustes,</hi> who forthwith cut off his Head, and sent it to the King, also the King sent it as a Present to his Mother <hi>Parysatis,</hi> who greatly rejoyced at the sight.

When this was done, <hi>Artabanus</hi> calling his Sons together, told them, that if ever they thought to obtain the Kingdom, then
was the time, and that it could only be done by <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s death. Hereupon they drawing their Swords with a design to kill him, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> receiving but one slight wound, defended himself so bravely, that he slew <hi>Artabanus</hi> on the place, as some will have it; though others with more reason defer the time of <hi>Artabanus</hi>'s death, to whom also seven months in the Empire are attributed by <hi>Eusebius.</hi> Now by this means, <hi>Darius</hi> being slain, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> came to the Empire in his youth, being the 4th. year of the 78th. <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad,</hi> or in the beginning of the 79th. <hi>Lysitheus</hi> being then <hi>Archon</hi> at <hi>Athens, A.M.</hi> 3540. and 463 years before the Birth of Christ.

About this time it was that <hi>Megabyzus, Artaxerxes</hi>'s General, who had done him that service in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was disobliged by the King, in putting those <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prisoners to death, whom he had promis'd their Pardons; in so much, that <hi>Megabyzus</hi> leaving the Court in discontent, and retiring to his Command in <hi>Syria,</hi> did there with the assistance of some <hi>Greeks,</hi> begin an open Rebellion against the King his Master, and obtain'd two famous Victories over him. Nevertheless, by the mediation of Friends betwixt both, together with the assurance of a free Pardon, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> and <hi>Megabyzus</hi> were again reconciled,

But soon after being both together hunting of a Lion, and <hi>Megabyzus</hi> happening to kill the Lion just as the King was going to strike him, the King was so greatly offended thereat, that he commanded <hi>Megabyzus</hi> his Head to be cut off; however, by the intercession of Friends, the King for that time gave him his life, and only banished him; <hi>so unmindful are Princes of all past services!</hi> when after five years exile, he made Friends with <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and was restored again to his Favour, so as to eat at his own Table: but soon after he died, being 76 years of age, whose loss was much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the King, and all others. Nor did the King himself <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> long survive him, but departed this life, having reign'd, according to <hi>Diodorus,</hi> 40 years; according to <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> 41 years; according to <hi>Ctesias,</hi> 42 years: but the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion is, that he died in the beginning of the 42d. year of his Reign, being the 2d. year of the 89th. <hi>Olympiad; A.

                  <p>For <hi>Astyages</hi> and <hi>Belsazar</hi> gave a period to this first Monarchy, whereof <hi>Cyrus</hi> became sole Monarch.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning this second Monarchy, some will have it that <hi>Darius Medus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Astyages,</hi> began it, and that <hi>Cyrus (Astyages</hi> his Grandson by his Daughter <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>) did enlarge and perfect it, for that (they being both Kings, one of <hi>Media,</hi> and the other of <hi>Persia</hi>) when joyning their Forces together, they overthrew <hi>Belsazar Darius,</hi> thereupon annex'd <hi>Babylon</hi> to his part of the Empire. Yet nevertheless the most general and most reasonable opinion is, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> alone was the first Founder of the second Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, because that whilst <hi>Darius</hi> lived, the Empire was divided betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> and himself; for as <hi>Xenophon</hi> testifies, <hi>Cyrus</hi> out of his liberality and bounty, permitted <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> to possess the Kingdoms of <hi>Media</hi> and
<hi>Babylon</hi> during his life, both which, after <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>'s death, he united to his own: from which union we may most properly derive the original of the second Monarchy, and by consequence attribute its sole foundation to <hi>Cyrus.</hi> It was call'd the Monarchy of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> because the Empire did chiefly consist of those two Kingdoms. The principal Enlargers of this second Monarchy were <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Great, <hi>Darius Hystaspes,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi>; as for the rest of the Kings that ruled it, they were so tyrannical and vicious, that the Empire suffer'd much under their Government, till it was totally subverted under the Reign of <hi>Darius Codomannus,</hi> who being overcome by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, lost both his Life and Empire; which was immediately thereupon translated into <hi>Greece,</hi> where <hi>Alexander</hi> began the third and <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy from that fall of <hi>Darius Codomannus.</hi> This second Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> lasted (from its beginning under <hi>Cyrus</hi> to its subversion under <hi>Darius</hi>) 228 years: wherein there were two Families possest the Empire; the first was of <hi>Cyrus</hi>; the second of <hi>Darius Hystaspes:</hi> as for the Family of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his Son <hi>Cambyse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After which, <hi>Cambyses</hi> having left behind him but only one Daughter <hi>Pantaptes,</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire being left without a Prince to govern, it was agreed on by those seven Noblemen, (<hi>Otanes, Intaphernes, Gobryas, Megabysus, Aspathines, Hydarnes,</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> afterwards call'd <hi>Hystasp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that nothing is a greater help to an Historian, than a right understanding of the several Descents and Falls of one Monarchy into another, which method being so useful, brief, and new, I hope may not prove less beneficial to others than to my self.

XX. <hi>Apollonius</hi> as he was brought to the King, discours'd concerning the Wife of a certain <hi>Pamphylian,</hi> who was acquainted with <hi>Sappho,</hi> to the end he might not seem to admire the King's Bravery: afterwards being come into the King's Presence, he had a large Conference with him; and how the King admired him.</head>
               <p>THereupon <hi>Apollonius</hi> made his entrance, being attended with a numerous Train; for they thought to <hi>[1]</hi> gratifie the King by so doing, in that they perceiv'd him to be delighted with the Arrival of <hi>Apollonius;</hi> who being come into the Palace, did not so much as cast an eye upon those things which were admired by others, but passed by them unconcern'd, as if he were travelling; and calling <hi>Damis,</hi> said unto him, You asked me of late what was the Name of that <hi>[2] Pamphylian</hi>'s Wife which is said to be acquainted with <hi>[3] Sappho,</hi> and to have composed those Hymns which are at this day sung in honour of <hi>[4] Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana Pergaea,</hi> after the <hi>[5] Aeolian</hi> and <hi>Pamphylian</hi> manner. I ask'd you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, (said <hi>Damis</hi>) but you told me not her Name. I did not, (reply'd <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>) but only declared to you the measure of the Verses, with their Names, and how the <hi>Aeolian</hi> in their highest pitch and propriety differ from the <hi>Pamphylian</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Afterwards we turn'd our Discourse to some other thing, and you no more ask'd me concerning the Womans Name: wherefore now know, that her Name is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mophyla,</hi> and she had like her, Virgins to her Scholars, and composed Poems, partly of Love, and partly of the Praises of <hi>Diana,</hi> in imitation of her, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Poems of <hi>Sappho.</hi> Wherefore how far he was from admiring a King and his Grandeur, he made appear by this, in that he vouchsafed not so much as to cast an eye on them, but all the way discours'd of other things. The King seeing him come, (for the Court of the Temple was somewhat large) spake to his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, as if he knew the man, and when he drew near, cried out with a loud voice, This is <hi>Apollonius,</hi> whom my Brother <hi>Megabetes</hi> said he saw at <hi>Antioch,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd and admired by all good men; for he then describ'd him to be such an one, as the person I now see. <hi>Apollonius</hi> coming to the King, and saluting him, the King spake to him in <hi>Greek,</hi> and bade him sacrifice unto the Gods with him, for he was then about to offer a choice <hi>[6] Nisaean</hi> Horse to the Sun, having adorn'd him as if he was to be led in pomp. Whereupon <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, Do you (O King) sacrifice after your manner, and give me leave to sacrifice after mine. Having thus spoken, he took Frankincense, and said, O Sun, conduct me so far as it seemeth good to me and thee! and let me know vertuous men! but as for the wicked, let me neither know them, nor they me! When he had spoken thus, he threw the Frankincense into the fire, and then beholding how the smoak ascended, what turnings it made, and with how many heads it lifted up it self, and how high; also touching the fire, and observing it appear'd of a good Omen, he said to the King, Do you now sacrifice according to the custom of your Countrey, for I have observ'd the fashion that we have. Thereupon he withdrew himself from the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that he might have nothing to do with bloud. After the Sacrifice was ended, he return'd to the King again, saying, O King, Are you acquainted with all the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98416:70"/>
                  <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, or only with some little thereof, to the end you may more freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and not seem unpleasing, if any <hi>Grecian</hi> come hither? I understand the whole Language (said he) as well as my Mother-Tongue, wherefore speak what you please, for that is the reason why you ask. It is so indeed, reply'd <hi>Apollonius,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hearken to what I shall say! The intention of my Iourney is to visit the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> but I was unwilling to pass by you, hearing you to be such a man, as I now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently perceive you are; and desiring to understand the Wisdom which the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> amongst you do profess, as namely, whether they be skill'd in divine matters, as report goeth of them. As for me, I am addicted to the Wisdom of <hi>[7] Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> the <hi>Samian,</hi> who taught me in this manner to worship the Gods, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand from them both the things that are seen, and those that are not seen, also to talk with the Gods, and cloathe my self with this fleece of the Earth, which was not shorn from the Sheep's back, but springeth up purely from the pure, being a gift of Water and Earth, even made of linen. Likewise the length of my Hair was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up from <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> as also my abstinence from living Creatures comes to me from his Wisdom. Wherefore you must not expect that in Drinking and Revelling I should be a companion to you or any other. As for doubtful and intricate matters, I can resolve them; for I do not only know, but also foreknow the things that are to be done. This is the Discourse that <hi>Damis</hi> said he had with the King, and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> himself hath written an Epistle of the same, as he also digested many of his other Discourses into Epistles.</p>

This may justly give us occasion to reflect on the servile and obsequious Flatteries of Courtiers towards their Prince. <hi>Titus Livy</hi> well observes, that the speech of men educated in Courts is ever full of vain ostentation and flattery; every man indifferently extolling the King beyond all the bounds of modesty and reason. <hi>Quicquid calcaverit hic, Rosa fiat.</hi> If a Prince knows but the four corners of the Winds, (whereof no mean Subject is ignorant) yet how greatly is this vertue extoll'd in him, for being so Weather-wise? If he understands but how to steer a small Barge or Cock-boat in a calm River, (wherein many thousand Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pawlins exceed him) yet how greatly do they magnifie his wonderful skill in Navigation? If he knows but when a Fiddle is out of tune by its squeaking, they presently cry him up for a Musician; if he can ride a Horse but a foot pace, for an expert Horseman; and if he can distinguish between a Sign-post, and some famous <hi>Italian</hi> piece drawn by an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Master, for his great knowledge in Painting. Thus are they abused by the servile Wretches about them, and never suffer'd to come to the knowledge of truth. What the King loves, they love; and what the King does, they do, be

If a Prince be as effeminate as <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> himself, his Courtiers shall indulge him in his Lusts, and be more ambitious of <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s favour, more proud of a smile from her, than of the greatest honour in the World. This made an ingenious Author observe, that a Courtier's Face as well as his Cloaths must ever be in the fashion, for that he amongst them who cannot upon all occasions shift his Countenance, will not in time be able to shift his Linen. When <hi>Sempronius</hi> so basely kill'd <hi>Pompey</hi> on the <hi>Egyptian</hi> shore, it was only to curry favour with <hi>Caesar,</hi> and had <hi>Caesar</hi> himself been in the like adversity, they could have done the same for him. There is nothing so treacherous and base which to gratifie their Prince they will not undertake, even to the ruine both of King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. If he be inclin'd to Tyranny, they shall promote it, by advising to a standing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to oppress the people with illegal Exactions, and to govern without Law: and if he be addicted to Women, they presently turn his Pimps. Now he that most eases the Prince of Care and Business, or she that contributes most to his pleasures, are always his chiefest Favourites, and these (though the greatest grievances of the Subject) are idolized by the inferior hangers on; for every young Courtier is like a Hop, that must have a Pole to support him; and therefore in the fall of one great Favourite, several others perish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now as 'tis said of the Whale, that she is steer'd in her course through the guidance of a far smaller Fish, so fares it with too too many Princes, who hearing less truth than any one sort of men, are in their weightiest affairs guided by no higher Dictates, than those of a perfidious Mistress or Favourite.</p>

Book, and 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ch. of his Dodecacord) tell us, that the Ancients distinguish'd their Musick into four Moods, deriving them from sundry Countreys, for whose particular Genius they seem to have been at first contrived: Of these, the three first were named the <hi>Phrygian,</hi> the <hi>Lydian,</hi> and the <hi>Dorick</hi>; which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of <hi>Polimestres,</hi> and <hi>Saccadas,</hi> a Native of <hi>Argos,</hi> are said to be of greatest Antiquity. Now to these three former <hi>Sappho</hi> the <hi>Lesbian</hi> added a fourth, term'd the <hi>Myxolydian,</hi> thereby compleating the number of the four Tetrachords: she called it the <hi>Myxolydian,</hi> because it was intermixed with the <hi>Lydian</hi>: nevertheless, of this some make <hi>Tersander,</hi> others <hi>Pythoclides</hi> the Piper, and others <hi>Lamprocles,</hi> the Inventer. Others there be who to these four have added three more, which they term Collateral, as the <hi>Hypodorian, Hypolydian,</hi> and <hi>Hypophrygian</hi>; to the end there might be seven corresponding to the number of Planets: and to all these <hi>Ptolomy</hi> adds an eighth, call'd the <hi>Hypermyxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydian,</hi> being sharper and shriller than any of the rest. But <hi>Lucius Apuleius</hi> (in his <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid.</hi> lib. 1.) names only five, <hi>viz.</hi> the simple <hi>Ionian,</hi> the various <hi>Iastian,</hi> the complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <hi>Lydian,</hi> the warlike <hi>Phrygian,</hi> and the Religious <hi>Dorick.

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if Musick did comprehend all Sciences, seeing, as <hi>Plato</hi> observes in his first Book of Laws, that Musick cannot be understood without the knowledge of all the other Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Amongst the four first and most ancient Moods, they approved not of the <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian,</hi> for that it distracts and ravishes the Mind; wherefore <hi>Porphyrius</hi> gave it the Name of Barbarous, as exciting men to fury and battel: others gave it the Appellation of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chick,</hi> furious and turbulent; which being generally used in <hi>Anapesticks,</hi> were those Charms that formerly incited the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Cretans</hi> to War. The <hi>Lydian</hi> Mood <hi>Plato</hi> refuses as too sharp and shrill, coming short of the modesty of the <hi>Dorian</hi>; being most agreeable to mirth and jollity: this made the <hi>Lydians,</hi> a merry and jocund people, to be very much affected with that sort of Musick. The <hi>Dorick</hi> Mood, being more grave and solemn, was most agreeable to the serious Affections of the Mind, and in great esteem amongst the <hi>Cretans, Lacedemonians,</hi> and <hi>Arcadians:</hi> we read that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> being to go to the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, left behind him at home a <hi>Dorick</hi> Musician, to the end he might by his grave Spondaick Songs preserve the Chastity of his Wife <hi>Clytemnestra</hi>; in so much that <hi>Aegysthus</hi> could not obtain his desires of her, until he had murder'd the said Musician. Lastly, As for the <hi>Myxolydian</hi> Mood invented by <hi>Sappho,</hi> it was only fit for Tragedies, to move pity and compassion. <hi>Agrippa de Vanit.

Now as for the praise or dispraise of Musick several things may be said: First, By way of commendation, Musick being the Art of Harmony; they who love it not, are as extravagant, as they who make no difference between a fair and an ugly Face, proportion being the chief difference of both, Musick cures some Diseases, as the biting of the <hi>Tarantula</hi> and Melancholy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it asswage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98416:72"/>
their young people, by causing them to sing them; and we see the Rules of Grammar are for the same reason contriv'd into Verse. <hi>Achilles</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> diverted himself with his Harp, when he was at leisure from his military Employs; the Gally slave, Plow-man, Carter, and Labourer, ease the tediousness of their Toyl and Journey with singing and whistling; Artificers and Shepherds sweeten their Labours with Songs, and Maids spin more nimbly with the humming of an old Ballad or Song. The <hi>Romans</hi> sung Spondaick Verses whilst they offer'd their Sacrifices; and <hi>David</hi> danced before the Ark, all his Psalms being fitted to the Harp, and other harmonious Instruments. Musick excites both sadness and mirth; for as Physick either quiets or purges the Humours of our Bodies, so doth Musick the Passions of the Mind. The Emperor <hi>Theodosius</hi> was averted from destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> by the melodious Sonnets of little Children, instructed therein by <hi>Flavianus</hi> their Bishop. The Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> caused the Harp to be play'd on to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he prophesied the overthrow of the <hi>Moabites</hi>; and <hi>Michaia</hi> in the presence of King <hi>Aha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> refused to prophesie, till one had first play'd before him on a musical Instrument. Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> saith, that a handsom Woman who sings well is a <hi>Mouse-Trap baited as both ends:</hi> and thus we see <hi>Stratonice</hi> captivated <hi>Mithridates</hi> with a Song. Therefore conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the great influence which Musick hath over the Minds of men, it is no small policy in Ecclesiasticks to assign the use of Organs in Churches, which gets men a stomach to their devotion, whether it be good or bad; as in an <hi>Italian</hi> Ayr, the young Ladies mind not the sence and words, but the Musick. Finally, The Ancients had no small Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Musick, when they feign'd <hi>Apollo</hi> the God of Wisdom, to be the God of Musick too. However some there have been that have decry'd it; thus <hi>Antisthenes, Scipio, Aemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> utterly despised this Science; thus <hi>Alexander</hi> was reprov'd by <hi>Philip</hi> for singing, and had his Harp broke by his Schoolmaster <hi>Antigonus.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> (as <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> witnesseth) forbad the use of Musick to their youth, as rendring them luxurious and effeminate; also <hi>Ephorus</hi> (according to <hi>Polybius</hi>) condemns it as an Art invented only to deceive and debauch men. Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> is a great enemy to this Art, saying, that Musick is so unable to refund for the time and cost required to be perfect therein, as he cannot think it worthy any serious consideration or endeavour; the owner of that quality being still oblig'd to the trouble of calculating the difference between the morose humour of a rigid Refuser, and the cheap prostituted levity and forwardness of a mercenary Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; denial being as often taken for pride, as a too ready compliance for ostentation.

Those so qualified seldom know when 'tis time to begin, or give over; especially Women, who often decline in modesty, proportionably to the progress they make in Musick. As for my own part, I have spent some time in practising Musick, and repent not my self of it, since though I pretend not to divert others, yet can I divert my self, when retiring from my more tedious Studies, I play over some new set of Lessons, which is neither so dangerous or expensive as almost all other Recreations are. <hi>Senectam non cithar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ous Silence which with so much rigor he imposed upon his Disciples, was an Art to procure himself the more respectful attention. The Life of that Philosopher, as well as his Doctrine, is even at this day a great Subject of Controversie: he was indeed a man of a deep reach, a quick penetrating apprehension, and of indefatigable industry and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. His usual way of teaching was by Geometry and Numbers: he explain'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and sensible things by Geometry, and intellectual by Musick and Numbers. He was of too solid a Judgment, to imagine any reality in Numbers, which are but only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional Beings, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> proves in his Metaphysicks. It is true, he found so great a facility in explaining the perfection of every thing by harmony and proportion, after the manner of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that he express'd himself no other way; and that he made use of Numbers as of Symbols and Signs to teach with: and all that Science of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which was so familiar to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> is still to this day a kind of Mystery, whereof the Secret is not very well known. <hi>Iamblicus</hi> in the Life of that Philosopher says, that he invented a Musick proper for the Cure and quieting of the Passions. In his Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy there is nothing regular; only fair Maxims without Principles: his Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy is the same almost with that of the <hi>Platonists.</hi> His Doctrine of two Principles, the one of good, and the other of evil, whereon the <hi>Manichees</hi> built their Faith, is false<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for of real Beings there is but one real Principle. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> boasts, that the greatest fruit which he had reap'd from Philosophy was, (as his Disciple <hi>Apollonius</hi> here does) not to wonder at any thing: for that Philosophy discover'd to him the cause of every thing, as <hi>Horace</hi> expresses it to <hi>Numicius, Nil admirari prope res est una Numici.</hi> In fine, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had so extraordinary a Genius for Philosophy, that all the other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers have gloried to stick to his Sentiments: <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> have hardly any thing that is good but from him.

be as frequent with you as you please. Wherefore the King condescended to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, to the end he might not displease him, appointing a certain honest and good <hi>Babylonian</hi> to entertain him. Now as they were at Supper, an <hi>Eunuch</hi> (one of the King's Messengers) came to them with this Message to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> The King giveth you liberty to ask of him twelve Boons, such as you your self please, entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you that they may not be small ones, in that he hath a desire to make known his Magnificence as well to your self, as to us. <hi>Apollonius</hi> commending the Message, asked him, When it would be seasonable to make his Demands? To whom the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> reply'd, To morrow: and moreover went to all the Friends and Kinsmen of the King, and enjoyn'd them to be present with the Petitioner, a man whom the King so much honour'd. But <hi>Damis</hi> said, He understood that <hi>Apollonius</hi> would ask nothing, in that he knew his disposition, and had sometimes heard him pray to the Gods in this manner, <hi>O ye Gods, grant me to have a few things, and to stand in need of none!</hi> But nevertheless, observing him to stand in a brown stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he concluded that he would ask something, and that he was then pondering within himself what it should be. But <hi>Apollonius</hi> said to him, O <hi>Damis,</hi> I am musing with my self this evening why the <hi>Barbarians</hi> should think <hi>Eunuchs</hi> to be modest, and should make use of them to keep Women? I (said <hi>Damis</hi>) think this to be manifest even to a Child, in as much as gelding having depriv'd them of the faculty of Copulation, they are permitted not only to keep Women, but even to lye with them. Whereto <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, Do you think that gelding cutteth away their loving, or Copulation with Women? Yes, reply'd <hi>Damis,</hi> for if the part be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisht that doth infuriate the whole Body, none will be stricken with Love. Whereupon <hi>Apollonius</hi> after having paus'd a while, said unto him, To morrow <hi>Damis</hi> you shall understand that <hi>[2] Eunuchs</hi> are in Love, and that the Lust which cometh in through the Eyes is not extinguisht, but that there remaineth some heat and vigor in them: for something shall come to pass that will disprove your Discourse. But were there any humane Art that is so powerful to expel such Lusts out of the Mind, yet should I not think fit to reckon <hi>Eunuchs</hi> in the number of the chast, as being enforced thereunto, and by a violent Art drawn to an abhorrency of Love: for it is the part of Chastity, when a man is exceeding lustful, not to yield to the allurements of <hi>Venus,</hi> but to abstain and overcome that rage. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>Damis</hi> reply'd, O <hi>Apollonius,</hi> we will consider of these things again hereafter: but now we must advise with our selves what answer is to be made to morrow, to the great and excellent Offers of the King; for you perhaps will ask nothing, but you ought to beware that you seem not out of pride to refuse the King's Bounty. This therefore is to be heeded, as also in what Countrey you now are, and that we lye at the King's mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But above all you must take heed of Calumny, lest you be thought to reject good Offers out of arrogancy.

From hence it was, that <hi>Doedalus</hi> in the Fable enjoyn'd his Son <hi>Icarus</hi> to take his flight, neither too high, for fear lest the wax of his Wings should be melted with the heat of the Sun; nor yet too low, for fear of wetting them in the Sea: which course all men have follow'd that were happy. Liberality (which all men commend) is a mean between Avarice and Prodigality: the Avarous being excessive in receiving, and defective in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; as the Prodigal on the contrary is excessive in giving, and defective in receiving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Prodigal by doing good to others, does hurt to himself; the Miser does no good to others, and much less to himself: wherefore he alone that keeps a mean in his expences, deserves the name of vertuous, and makes his Liberality esteem'd. Now Magnificence hath the same respect to great expences, that Liberality hath to less, being the mid-way between two extreams. Again, Rashness does oftentimes prove of as ill consequence as Cowardise; but true Valour holding a mean between both, prevents it. The regular desire of moderate Honours, hath for its extreams, contempt of Honour, and Ambition. Clemency is between Choler, which is offended with every thing, and Stupidity, which is offended with nothing; Veracity, between Boasting and Dissimulation; Facetious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, between Buffoonry and Rusticity; Amity, between Flattery and Hatred; Modesty, between Bashfulness and Impudence; Anger, between Malice and Neglect.

                     </gap> was contriving with <hi>Dion,</hi> how to impede his sole Succession, conspired with the Physicians to get him poysoned; which being effected, the Government devolved solely upon him. At the beginning of his Reign, the people promised themselves much happiness under him, for he recalled back <hi>Plato</hi> from Banishment, as if he meant to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Advice and Instructions; but in a short time fell out with him, and sent him back to his Friends at <hi>Tarentum</hi> in <hi>Italy. Plato</hi> being thus dismiss'd, the next thing <hi>Dionysius</hi> did, was the striking up a dishonourable Peace with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> upon whom his Father had begun a War, which his Son's Sloth and Luxury permitted him not to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute. He likewise banish'd his Uncle <hi>Dion</hi> to <hi>Corinth,</hi> (for being the peoples Favourite) which occasion'd the falling out betwixt <hi>Plato</hi> and him, for that <hi>Dion</hi> had been <hi>Plato</hi>'s Disciple. Now <hi>Dion</hi> remaining thus discontented at <hi>Corinth,</hi> rais'd an Army of <hi>Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi> and invaded <hi>Sicily,</hi> where pretending he came to vindicate the ancient Liberties of the people, they flockt into his assistance from all parts, in so much that he took the principal City <hi>Syracuse</hi> with little or no opposition. Hereupon <hi>Dionysius</hi> retired into a strong Castle of the Island, from whence being likewise forced, he afterwards fled into <hi>Italy.</hi> Nevertheless the Citizens of <hi>Syracuse</hi> falling into Distractions for want of Money, and growing weary of <hi>Dion</hi>'s Government, several Plots were laid against him, whereof one (through the Treachery of his pretended Friend <hi>Callicrates</hi>) cost him his Life. Now after <hi>Dion</hi>'s death, <hi>Callicrates</hi> first, and then several others, possess'd the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Sicily</hi> for some few months, till at length <hi>Dionysius</hi> coming unawares upon them, in the 10th year of his Expulsion recover'd again <hi>Syracuse,</hi> and the whole Principality, which he had formerly lost. Now as the Restoration of a Prince may be esteem'd the more secure, when the people having so lately tasted of the Ruines of a Civil War, will be the less apt to run speedily into the same again; so on the other side there is always left remaining some of the old leaven, that will be ready to set things into the old Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation upon any slight occasion: And thus it fared with <hi>Dionysius,</hi> who being no sooner return'd to his old Dominions, but likewise beginning his old Extravagancies, was in less than four years time after his Restoration, banish'd by <hi>Timoleon</hi> a second time to <hi>Corinth,</hi> where being very poor and necessitous, he turned Paedagogue for his livelihood, and so ended his Life in great poverty and disgrace; being the 2d. year of the 109th.

His Life was wholly addicted to Voluptuousness and Luxury, in so much that his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy was tainted therewith; the Doctrine that he taught being soft and voluptuous, and therefore condemn'd by <hi>Xenophon, Plato, Phaedo, Aeschines,</hi> and <hi>Antisthenes.</hi> He used to say, that good Chear was no hindrance to a good Life. The Pleasures which he had, he used; and those which he had not, he despised. When he travell'd to increase his Knowledge, he made his Servants cast away their Money, that they might travel the lighter. He said, Pleasure was the end of good men, and Sorrow of ill. He liked no Pleasure, but that which might concern a man's own Happiness. But of his Doctrines, Apothegms, Writings, and Epistles, see them in Mr. <hi>Stanly</hi>'s Lives of the Philosophers, collected at large out of <hi>Laertius, Cicero, Athenaeus, Plutarch, Stobaeus,</hi> and others.

<q>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> has the smoothest tongue of Antiquity, and takes pleasure to make men hear him attentively, though he is not much concern'd whether they believe him or not: he is always florid, but not always solid; the false relish that was then in vogue through the credit of the <hi>Sophists,</hi> obliged him to that flourish of expression which he used. He is wirty, quick, and elegant, and as ingenious as a man can be; for with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Coherence and Method he observes in his Discourse a secret Oeconomy, which fails not to hit the Mark. And seeing he teaches only by way of Dialogue, that he may follow a free and disentangled Style, which has the Air of Conversation, he is rich in Prefaces, and magnificent in his entry on Discourses; yet he decides but little, no more than <hi>Socrates,</hi> and establishes almost nothing at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however, what he says is so natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally exprest, that nothing can be imagined more taking. The slight matters which he mingles with great in his Discourses, and the Trifles wherewith he circumstantiates what is essential and weighty in the Subjects he treats of, render him alluring; and it is by
this way alone that he amuses. But through the great desire he hath to be pleasing, he is too much for telling of Wonders. Most part of his Discourses are nothing else but Fables, Metaphors, and continual Allegories; he affects often to be mysterious in what he says, that he may keep himself the more within the verge of his Character; and it is commonly by Lying that he undertakes to perswade Truth. <hi>Rhodiginus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that his sence is more to be minded than his words, which are often Allegorical: Moreover, he was too much a Politician to be a Philosopher: for in one of his Letters to <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Syracusa,</hi> he acknowledges that he publish'd none of his Maxims, but under the Name of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he might not be accountable for his own Doctrine, in a time when the Nicety of the people of <hi>Athens</hi> was offended at every thing The Condemnation of <hi>Socrates</hi> made <hi>Plato</hi> so cautious, that to be in good terms with the publick, and to dispossess the people of the opinion, that he was addicted to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Master, he turned <hi>Pythagorean.</hi> Now how beit he was a man of vast Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, (for <hi>what did he not know,</hi> says <hi>Quintilian?</hi>) and had a wonderful Genius for S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After his death, his Disciples so alter'd his Doctrine, and fill'd his School with such rigid Opinions, that scarcely could there be known amongst them the least print of the true Doctrine of <hi>Plato:</hi> which was divided into so many

Sects, as there started up Philosophers in the Ages following.</q>
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> (in his Book <hi>de Divinatione</hi>) tells us, that <hi>Plato</hi> was accounted <hi>Deus Philosophorum</hi>; also <hi>Antimachus</hi> (in <hi>Cicero</hi>'s <hi>Brutus</hi>) saith, <hi>Plato unus mihi instar omnium millium. Maximus Tyrius</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that Nature her self never saw any thing more eloquent, no not <hi>Homer</hi> excepted; wherefore <hi>Panaetius</hi> stiles him, the <hi>Homer</hi> of Philosophers: <hi>Pliny</hi> calls him, <hi>Sapientiae Antistitem</hi>; and <hi>Salvianus, Romanum Catonem</hi>; also others term him, another <hi>Socrates</hi> of <hi>Italy.</hi> The ancient School of <hi>Plato</hi> degenerated by the Sentiments of the new, into the Sects of <hi>Scepticks</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhonists,</hi> who doubted of every thing. <hi>Marcilius Ficinus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that <hi>Plato</hi> knew the Mystery of the Trinity. The Emperor <hi>Iulian</hi> preferr'd the Doctrine of <hi>Plato,</hi> to that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught the <hi>Athenians.</hi> The Logick of <hi>Plato</hi> (which is the same with that of <hi>Socrates</hi>) consists more in Examples, than Precepts; it hath nothing that is particular for Reasoning, because <hi>Socrates</hi> valu'd not that part of Philosophy. Though both of them placed the first discerning of Truth and Falshood in the Senses, yet they pretended, that the Mind ought to be Judg thereof. And seeing the Soul of man was but a small spark of the universal Soul of the World, and according to them a Beam of the Divinity; they thought, that that particle united to its principle was ignorant of nothing; but that entring into the Body, by that Alliance it contracted Ignorance and Impiety, from which, Logick served to purifie it. <hi>Alcinous,</hi> who gives us an exact Explanation of the <hi>Dialectick</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> says, that this Philosopher made use of Division, Definition, and Induction, to resort to the fountain of the first Truth: Division was as a Ladder, whereby to ascend from things sensible to things intellectual; Definition was a way to lead from things demonstrated to those that were not; and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction the means to find the Truth by the principle of Suppositions: for by Division he came to Definition, as by Definition to Induction and Demonstration. Moreover, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Principles of the Logick of <hi>Plato</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which allow'd no Truth but in the Idea's, that his School made profession of knowing nothing; because men cannot judg of single and individual Beings, but by the Senses, which are fallacious: So that the Disciples of <hi>Plato</hi> placed all their Logick in not believing any thing too slightly, and in retaining the entire Liberty of Judgment, among the Uncertainties which are found almost in every thing: In fine, Upon that great Maxim of a general Incomprehensibility of all things, was that Academy reform'd under <hi>Lacydes</hi> and <hi>Arcesilas,</hi> and the Sect of the <hi>Scepticks</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhonists</hi> raised. As for Moral Philosophy, <hi>Plato</hi> brought it to greater perfection, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Model that <hi>Socrates</hi> had left him: for by his Idea's which he gave to every thing, as the universal Principle of Philosophy, he raised all Vertues to their highest perfection. In his <hi>Phaedrus</hi> he explains the Nature of Moral Philosophy, the end whereof is to purifie the Mind from the Errors of Imagination, by the Reflections that Philosophy suggest to him: However, the greatest part of his Dialogues are but good Discourses without Principles, which nevertheless fail not to hit the Mark, and to instruct in their way; for the Morals of this Philosopher are full of Instructions, which always tend either to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance Vertue, or to discourage Vice: and that Morality is spread in all his Discourses, though there be nothing in it extraordinarily singular. Some pretend, that the Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis of <hi>Apuleius</hi> his golden Ass, is an Allegory of the Moral Philosophy of <hi>Plato. Plato</hi> was the first that rectified the Opinion of the Souls Immortality, which he learnt of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Socrates</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras, Pythagoras</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (as some will have it) of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> by the means of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whilst he sojourn'd in <hi>Egypt. Plato</hi> made it the most important Principle of <hi>Pagan</hi> Morality, thereby obliging men to Vertue, out of hope of Reward, and fear of Punishment. His Doctrine had a tendency to that of the <hi>Stoicks</hi>; as appears by the Example of <hi>Antiochus</hi> of <hi>Ascalon,</hi> who having been bred in his Academy, afterwards turn'd <hi>Stoick.</hi> As for Natural Philosophy, <hi>Plato</hi> hath hardly written any thing on this Subject, which he did not take from the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Also for his Doctrine of Visions, Spirits, and Intelligences, (in his Dialogues of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie</hi> and <hi>Cratilus</hi>) he took it from <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Zeno</hi> had it from <hi>Plato</hi>; as <hi>Lipsius</hi> writes. <hi>Apuleius</hi> saith, that <hi>Plato</hi> of all the ancient Philosophers, hath discoursed best of God, Providence, Spirits, and divine matters.

When <hi>Dion</hi> came to <hi>Athens, Speusippus</hi> was his constant Companion, which he did by his Uncle <hi>Plato</hi>'s Advice, to soften and divert the morose humour of <hi>Dion</hi>; whereupon <hi>Timon (in Sillis)</hi> calls <hi>Pseusippus</hi> a good Jester: <hi>Plat. Vit. Dion.</hi> The last Voyage that <hi>Plato</hi> made into <hi>Sicily, Speusippus</hi> accompanied him, and grew much into favour with the Citizens of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> by reason of his free Behaviour. Afterwards <hi>Pseusippus</hi> at his return to <hi>Athens,</hi> instigated <hi>Dion</hi> (who was there in Banishment) to levy War upon <hi>Dionysius,</hi> which accordingly he did with great success, as I have already shew'd in the Life of <hi>Dionysius:</hi> upon this, when <hi>Dion</hi> had recover'd <hi>Sicily,</hi> he bestow'd upon <hi>Speusip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> his Countrey-house, which he had purchased at <hi>Athens,</hi> as a reward for his good counsel.

He affirmed, that the Mind was not the same either with <hi>good</hi> or <hi>one,</hi> but of a peculiar nature, proper to it self. And he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted Money of his Disciples, contrary to the custom of <hi>Plato.</hi> For though he followed <hi>Plato</hi> in his Opinions, yet did he not imitate his Temper, <hi>Speusippus</hi> being austere and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, nor had so great command over his Pleasures. In Anger he threw a Dog into a Well; and indulging himself in Pleasure, he went to <hi>Cassander</hi>'s Wedding in <hi>Macedonia: Laert. Philostrat.</hi> He was likewise a great lover of Money, as <hi>Apollonius</hi> here mentions, and also <hi>Laertius</hi> saith the same. In so much, that some indifferent Poems which he had made, he himself sung publickly for profit. These Vices, <hi>Dionysius</hi> writing to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides, saying, <hi>Plato took no money of his Scholars, but you exact it whether they are willing or not:</hi> as is extant in <hi>Athenaei Dipnos.</hi> lib. 12. ch. 24. He was (as <hi>Timotheus</hi> saith) very infirm of Body, in so much that he was fain to be carried up and down the Academy in a kind of running Chair. At length he died of grief, as <hi>Laertius</hi> (lib. 4.) affirms: who elsewhere citing <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in the Lives of <hi>Lysander</hi> and <hi>Scylla,</hi> saith, that <hi>Speusippus</hi> died of the <hi>Phthiriasis</hi>; but there is no such passage in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as now extant. Lastly, Concerning his Writings, <hi>Phavorinus</hi> (in the second Book of his Commentaries) saith, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> paid three Talents for them. He wrote many things, chiefly in Philosophy, as Commentaries and Dialogues; whereof you may see a large Collection in <hi>Stanly</hi>'s Lives, out of <hi>Laertius, Suidas, Plutarch, Apuleius, Stobaeus,</hi> and <hi>Athenaeus.</hi>

At the same time <hi>Polysperchon</hi> (who was a cunning old Souldier, and had been one of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Officers) the better to secure <hi>Greece</hi> from a Revolt, did abolish all such Oligarchies, as since the passing of <hi>Alexander</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> had been erected in any of the <hi>Greek</hi> Cities, thereby restoring them to their former liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in hopes to secure them from adhering to <hi>Cassander.</hi> Now <hi>Cassander</hi> having obtain'd of <hi>Antigonus</hi> 35 Ships, and 6000 Men, sailed with them to <hi>Athens,</hi> which together with the Haven he had got into his power, by means of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> whom he had sent before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand for that purpose. Against him came <hi>Polysperchon,</hi> intending to besiege him, but his Provisions failing him, he was forced to raise his Siege; when leaving his Son with a Party in <hi>Attica,</hi> he march'd himself with the chief of his Army into <hi>Peloponesus</hi> against <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> which was the only City amongst them that had adher'd to <hi>Cassander</hi>; where he being worsted, soon after the rest of the <hi>Greek</hi> Cities did thereupon revolt to <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> After this ill fortune of <hi>Polysperchon's, Cassander</hi> marching into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> found likewise many Friends there, who were for the <hi>Rising Sun.</hi> The year following, <hi>Polysper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon</hi> by the help of <hi>Aeacida</hi> (King of the <hi>Molossians</hi>) brought back <hi>Olympias,</hi> with <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Son of <hi>Roxane,</hi> her Grandchild, into <hi>Macedonia</hi>; whereupon <hi>Eurydice,</hi> the Wife of King <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> fortify'd her self, and sent to <hi>Cassander</hi> for aid; but the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi> fearing the Majesty of <hi>Olympias,</hi> fell away from her; so that she and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being both committed to Prison, he was first kill'd, and then <hi>Olympias</hi> sent her a Sword, an Halter, and Poyson, to choose which of them she pleas'd; who having pray'd to the Gods for Revenge, hanged her self with her Garter. This happened after <hi>Aridaeus</hi> had enjoy'd the Title of King 6 years and 4 months. <hi>Olympias</hi> also kill'd <hi>Nica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Cassander.</hi> But <hi>Cassander</hi> hearing she was arrived in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> marched out of <hi>Peloponesus</hi> against her; he also bribed all the Souldiers of <hi>Aeacida,</hi> as well as <hi>Polysperchon</hi>'s Army, on whose assistance she solely depended, when she being fled to <hi>Pydna,</hi> he there besieg'd her, took her, and afterwards put her to death, she refusing to fly for her Life. And such was the end of <hi>Olympias,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom she had outlived 8 years. In the next place, he privately order'd <hi>Roxane</hi> and her Son <hi>Alexander</hi> to be slain. Now <hi>Polysperchon</hi> to revenge himself on <hi>Cassander,</hi> set up <hi>Hercules,</hi> the Son of <hi>Alexander</hi> by <hi>Barsine,</hi> who was a Youth of 14 years of age, and had been educated at <hi>Pergamus.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Cassander</hi> fearing lest the <hi>Macedonians</hi> should be too well affected to this young <hi>Hercules,</hi> for his being descended of <hi>Alexander,</hi> did by way of Counterplot take to Wife <hi>Thessalonice,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Olympias,</hi> and Sister of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great: And this I conceive was the Wedding, whereat <hi>Speusippus</hi> recited his Poems, as <hi>Apollonius</hi> here mentions. Afterwards <hi>Cassander</hi> waged a second War, which was against <hi>Antigonus</hi>; and soon after died of a Dropsie himself, having reign'd 19 years, and leaving behind him three Sons of his Wife <hi>Thessalonice,</hi> viz. <hi>Philip, Antipater,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> who came all to an ill end.

Know then, that these <hi>Olympick</hi> Games were first instituted by <hi>Hercules,</hi> in honour of <hi>Iupiter:</hi> they were celebrated once every five years, beginning from the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and lasting to the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day of the first Month. Now an <hi>Olympiad</hi> (which comprehended the space of 5 years) was an <hi>Epocha</hi> of time, where by the <hi>Greeks</hi> reckoned their Chronology; for as we count by years, and the <hi>Romans</hi> by their <hi>Lustra,</hi> so did they by their <hi>Olympiads,</hi> beginning their first <hi>Olympiad, A.M.</hi> 3174. from which time, instead of saying, 26 years, they would say, the first year of the sixth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> &amp;c. Also they receiv'd their Name from their Situation, as being near the City <hi>Olympia,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Elide</hi>: Now the use made

of these Games, was to initiate the Youth of <hi>Greece</hi> in Feats of Activity, for that the greatest numbers of men that ever met upon any such Assemblies, used to resort thither, some as Spectators, and others, in hope of Victory. The original of this Institution was said to be thus: That <hi>Hercules,</hi> with his four younger Brethren, <hi>Paenaeus, Ida, Iasius,</hi> and <hi>Epimedes,</hi> being return'd from the Mountain <hi>Ida</hi> to <hi>Elis,</hi> proposed a Match of Running betwixt them all, only to make Sport; also that he who outrun should be crown'd with Olive Branches, which accordingly <hi>Hercules</hi> was, he being then the Victor: who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (from the number of those five Brethren) instituted the like Sport to be practised every 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year, to the honour of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> as I said before. Also the Victor was according to the first practice, ever after crown'd with Olive, which gives <hi>Aristophanes</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> occasion to deride <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s poverty, as being unable to bestow a Crown of Gold upon the Victor, when instead thereof he presented him with a Crown of Olive Branches; <hi>Nam magis auro decuit, si dives is esset:</hi> Transl. out of <hi>Aristoph.</hi> Some say, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> himself instituted these Pastimes upon his Victory over the <hi>Titans,</hi> when <hi>Apollo</hi> outran <hi>Mercury.</hi> In these Games, <hi>Eusebius</hi> writes, that <hi>Corilus</hi> an <hi>Arcadian</hi> wan the first Prize; but <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Isacius</hi> affirm, that <hi>Hercules,</hi> the Son of <hi>Alcumena,</hi> (and not the <hi>Hercules</hi> before-mention'd) was the first Founder and Victor of these Sports and Prizes.

The Victor was at first adorn'd with other Boughs, but afterwards they made use of the Laurel, which Tree was appropriated to <hi>Apollo.

The persons who chiefly frequented these Sports, were the Inhabitants of the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> and all the Islanders about <hi>Delos. Pythia</hi> was also the Name of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Priestess.</p>
                  <p>The third of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Games were the <hi>Isthmean,</hi> celebrated every fifth year in the <hi>Isthmus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> from whence they receiv'd their Name. They were instituted by <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus,</hi> in honour of <hi>Neptune,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch (in Vitâ Theses)</hi> testifies: Some say, they were dedicated to <hi>Palaemon,</hi> the God of the Havens, and I conceive that both Opinions may possibly be true, for as much as <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Palaemon</hi> are sometimes <hi>Synonyma</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets; however, they were both Gods of the Sea: <hi>Neptune</hi> of all, <hi>Palaemon</hi> only of the Harbours and Sea-shores. In these Sports the Victor was crown'd with a Garland of Pine-tree.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:98416:80"/>The fourth and last of the most eminent Games in <hi>Greece,</hi> were the <hi>Nemaean</hi>; so called, because they were kept in the Forrest <hi>Nemea.</hi> These Feasts were celebrated by the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives,</hi> in honour of <hi>Hercules,</hi> who had so valiantly overcome a Lion in that place, and afterwards wore his Skin for his Armour. Notwithstanding some say, that these <hi>Nemae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Games were ordain'd in remembrance of <hi>Archemorus,</hi> the Son of King <hi>Lycurgus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now besides these four above-mention'd, they had several inferior Sports and Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; such as <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s Dance, (invented in <hi>Creet</hi> by one of <hi>Cybeles</hi> Priests, so call'd) as a preparative of Youth for War, dancing it in Armour, and with Weapons on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; Naked Games, invented by <hi>Lycaon:</hi> Funeral Plays, by <hi>Arastus</hi>; Wrestling, by <hi>Mercury</hi>; Dice, Tables, Tennis, and Cards, invented by the <hi>Lydians,</hi> not for any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or lucre, but for the Commonwealths good; when in time of Famine, they asswaged their Hunger by eating every other day, and fasting by the help of these sedentary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes the next. Also the Game of Chess, invented, <hi>A. M.</hi> 3635. by a Politician, one <hi>Xerxes,</hi> thereby to demonstrate, how inconsiderable and impotent any Tyrant or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate is, without the strength and assistance of his Subjects. They used casting of the Bar, which was made either of Iron or Brass, and of a vast weight, which whosoever cast highest or farthest wan the Prize. They used Wrestling, when two men having anointed themselves, whosoever flung the other first to the ground, was esteem'd the Victor. They sometimes disputed at Cuffs, which Combatants (named <hi>Pugiles</hi>) did tye about their Hands hard Thongs of an Ox's Hide, call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and these Sports were call'd <hi>Gymnici,</hi> because the parties fought naked. <hi>Palaestra</hi> was the place where they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised Feats of Activity; and the Masters who taught there, were called <hi>Gymnastae.</hi> About this time there were in <hi>Greece, Athletes,</hi> (such as <hi>Apollonius</hi> here mentions) or Combatants of incredible strength, as <hi>Milon</hi> of <hi>Crotone,</hi> and <hi>Polydamas:</hi> whereof the one carrying a Bull along the <hi>Stadium,</hi> did afterwards knock him down with a blow of his Fist; and the other <hi>Polydamas</hi> strangled a Lion in Mount <hi>Olympus</hi> with his bare hands. Now these Games and Exercises of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Youth, caused them to be such good Souldiers, that with a small number of men they defeated millions of the <hi>Persians</hi> who invaded them. Neither were these Plays and Combats esteem'd of only as relating to War, or to divert the people; but they were also instituted (as appears by the four first I mention'd) in honour of their Gods, whose Festivals were celebrated with such kinds of Sports. Thus <hi>Homer</hi> tells us, how in the Temples they exercised themselves at many pretty Plays, when he speaks of those who did handle the Dice before the Altars of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva.</hi> See more of this Subject in <hi>Panciroll.

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. <hi>Apollonius</hi> asketh of the King, only that he would be merciful to the <hi>Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trians,</hi> saying, that he for his part needed nothing but Bread and Fruits: A certain <hi>Eunuch</hi> taken with one of the King's Concubines, is by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession of <hi>Apollonius</hi> saved from death: <hi>Apollonius</hi> telleth the King what is to be done that he may reign safely: Of the Embassy sent to the King.</head>
               <p>IN the mean time an <hi>Eunuch</hi> came and called him in to the King, to whom <hi>Apollonius</hi> return'd this Answer, that he would come so soon as he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd to his desire what concern'd the Gods. Accordingly, having finish'd his Offerings and Prayers, he approach'd the King in such a Garb and Habit as procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the admiration of the Spectators. When he was come into the presence, the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98416:80"/>
King said to him, I give you ten Boons, judging you to be such a man, as never yet came out of <hi>Greece.</hi> To which <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, Oh King, I refuse not all your Gifts, but there is one which I would ask rather than many tens; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, began to fall upon the Story of the <hi>Eretrians,</hi> taking his Rise from <hi>Datis.</hi> I pray you therefore (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) let not these poor Wretches be driven out of their Borders, and the Hill that hath been assign'd them, but constitute you unto them that portion of Land which <hi>Darius</hi> appointed for them. In as much as it is a sad case, if being driven out of their Countrey, they shall not enjoy that Morsel which was assigned them instead of their own Land. Wherefore the King assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, said, The <hi>Eretrians</hi> even till of late have been the Enemies both of me and of my Ancestors: and seeing they had begun the <hi>[1]</hi> War against us, they have been look'd upon with an evil eye, so that their whole Generation is almost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct; but for the time to come they shall be set down among my Friends, and I will appoint a good Governour over them, who shall do them right as touching the place assigned them. But why will you not accept the other nine Gifts? Because (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) I have as yet acquired no Friends here. But do you your self need nothing, said the King? Yes, (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) Bread and Fruits, which to me are pleasant and sumptuous Fare. As they were thus discoursing, a great noise was heard out of the Palace, both of the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> and of the Women: for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Eunuch</hi> was taken lying with one of the King's <hi>[2]</hi> Concubines, and acting as Adulterers are wont to do: whereupon they dragged him by the Hair about the Womans Chamber, after that manner as the King's Servants were used to be drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But when the eldest of the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> related, that he had long since observ'd this <hi>Eunuch</hi> to be in Love with that Woman, and therefore had forewarn'd him not to speak with her, nor touch her Neck or Hand, and to abstain from dressing her only of all that were within the Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nevertheless he had now found him lying with her, and doing the work of a man: Thereupon <hi>Apollonius</hi> looking upon <hi>Damis,</hi> tacitly admonish'd him, that now he had a demonstration of that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which was formerly Philosophised between them, concerning <hi>Eunuchs</hi> being capable of Lust. But the King said to the standers by, It is a shame that we should in the presence of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> adventure to discourse of Modesty or Chastity, and not refer the determination of such matters to him. What therefore do you <hi>(Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius)</hi> appoint this <hi>Eunuch</hi> to suffer? <hi>Apollonius,</hi> contrary to the opinion of all that were there present, answer'd, What else but to live? At that the King blushing, replied, Think you that such a Fellow is not worthy of many deaths, who durst vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late my Bed? But, said <hi>Apollonius,</hi> I spake not this for his pardon, but for his punishment, which shall gnaw him continually: for if this Love-sick <hi>Eunuch</hi> be permitted to live, longing for Impossibilities, neither will his Meat nor Drink please him, nor those Shews, which give great content to you and your Attendants. Moreover, his Heart will often pant, whilst his Sleep suddenly departeth from him, as it is used to happen to those that are in Love: and what Consumption can so pine him away, or what Pestilence can so fret his Bowels? Nay, if he be not a very <hi>[3]</hi> Coward, he will often supplicate you to kill him, or else will dispatch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, much lamenting this present day, wherein he was not put to death. Such was the Answer of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> so wise and so mild, that the King permitted the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> to live. Afterwards the King going forth to hunt in the Parks, where Lions, Bears, and Panthers, were enclosed for the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> asked <hi>Apollonius,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would go a hunting with him? To whom <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, You have forgotten (Oh King) that I would not be present with you whilst you sacrificed: and besides, 'tis no pleasing thing to look on while Beasts are tortured, and brought
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98416:81"/>
into bondage, contrary to their own Nature. Then the King demanding of him, by what means he might reign firmly and securely, <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, <hi>If you honour many, and trust few.</hi> When a certain Prince of <hi>Syria</hi> had sent Envoys to him, concerning two Towns that lay near the Confines of his Countrey, saying, that they had sometimes belong'd to <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Seleucus,</hi> but now were under his jurisdiction, as being part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: And though the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> durst not make any attempt upon those Towns, yet the King had invaded them, that he might enjoy the Profits of so remote a Countrey, as pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather to him, than to the <hi>Romans:</hi> The King having caused the Ambassadors to withdraw a little, said to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> These Towns were by the aforesaid Kings granted to my Ancestors, for the breeding of these wild Beasts, which being taken by us, do pass over <hi>Euphrates</hi> unto them; but they forgetting these matters, do seek after unjust Innovations. What therefore think you <hi>(Apollonius)</hi> is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Embassy? <hi>Apollonius</hi> replied, Their meaning seemeth very fair and reasonable, if being able to retain the possession of those Towns situate in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines whether you will or no, they had rather receive it of you of your own accord. He further added, that he ought not for the sake of certain Towns, (than which, many private persons have possessed greater) to enter into contention with the <hi>Romans,</hi> or to undertake a War upon so small an occasion.</p>

                  <p n="1">[1] <hi>THey had begun the War upon us,</hi> &amp;c. Man is nothing but Self-interest incarnate, which consists totally in love of Life, and fear of Death: These are in effect to man, as two Ears to a Pot, whereof the one is to be held by Love, the other by Fear; Love is the fairer, but Fear the surer, and of greater operation: wherefore <hi>Pallas</hi> the God of Wisdom is always pictured armed, and the modern Inscription upon our great Ordnance is, <hi>Ratio ultima Regum,</hi> to shew, that in perswading people to Submission and Obedience, after all Arguments of Conscience and Law used in vain, the Death-thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Cannon is the last and surest Motive; for Self-love is deaf to all Motives, but that of Death the King of Terrors: therefore Princes to express their Character by Herald Hieroglyphicks, are usually observ'd to choose Birds or Beasts of prey, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles, the <hi>English</hi> Lions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only <hi>France</hi> to outshine the Glory of <hi>Solomon,</hi> chose the Lillies. The Ancients to decipher the best Education of a Prince, report <hi>Achilles</hi> to have been bred up under <hi>Chyron</hi> the <hi>Centaur,</hi> who was half a Man, and the other half a Beast, and that very fierce. The Camel, a great and strong Creature, yet by reason of his meek and harmless Nature, is led by Boys, and heavy laden; whereas the Leopard, a small but mischievous Beast, frees himself from that slavery, by his own fierceness. What makes the Subject of <hi>England</hi> enjoy that Liberty and Property which other neighbouring Subjects want, but our own happy ill Natures? And when others called the King of <hi>England, Rex Diabolorum,</hi> they did it only out of envy, for that his Subjects were Men, and not Cowards, Leopards, and not Camels. In like manner, if Princes are tame and unwarlike, their Neighbours will invade them, as well as their own Subjects rebel; for if men continue long in peace, it is <hi>metu, non moribus.</hi> War either publick or private, is almost the only thing which commands and governs mankind; the Thief on a sudden with his Pistol against your breast, commands your Purse: a poor man's Back and Belly lay siege against him, and force him to hard labour: vulgar Souls are often forced from their lewd Lives, by the continual War which Preachers make against them, with their spiritual Weapons of Fire and Brimstone. The Life of all Creatures supports it self by a daily warfare upon one another; some upon living Creatures, some upon Plants, and Plants upon the Water of the Earth.

                     </hi> (the Husband of <hi>Semiramis</hi>) was the first King that ever made War upon his Neighbours. However, he that studies the Nature of men will find, that mankind hath ever continued in a state of War from its first Original: and if to disobey, be to offend, and to offend, is War, then was <hi>Adam</hi> in a state of War before his Fall, which made him have a desire to violate the Commands of God, in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the forbidden Fruit, since his appetite to commit the sin, preceded the sin it self; and therefore not wholly innocent before. For War (as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> well observes, <hi>Leviath. part</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 13.) consisteth not only in Battel, or the act of Fighting, but in a tract of Time, wherein the Will to contend by Battel is sufficiently known: and therefore the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Time is to be consider'd in the nature of War, as it is in the nature of Weather. For as the nature of foul Weather, lyeth not in a shower or two of Rain, but in an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereto of many days together, so the nature of War, consisteth not in actual Fighting, but in the known disposition thereto, during all the time that there is no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the contrary. Now that this War betwixt man and man proceeds originally from Nature, is evident: for Nature having made all men equal in the faculties of Body and Mind, at least in their own conceit, from this equality of Ability there ariseth equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Hope, in the attaining of our ends: And therefore if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become Enemies, and in the way to their end endeavour to destroy or subdue one another; from whence arises a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence betwixt them, and from that diffidence, War. Again, Every man looketh his Companion should value him at the same rate he sets upon himself; and upon all signs of contempt, or undervaluing, naturally endeavours (even to their destruction, if not prevented by some higher Power) to extort a greater value from his contemners by Victory, and from others by the Example: Moreover, To this War of every man against every man, this also is consequent, that nothing can be unjust. The Notions of Right and Wrong, Justice and Injustice, have there no place. Where there is no common Power, there is no Law; where no Law, no Injustice. Force and Fraud are in war the two Cardinal Vertues. Justice and Injustice are none of the Faculties neither of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor the Mind; if they were, they might be in a man that were alone by himself in the world, as well as his Senses and Passions: they are Qualities that relate to men in Society, not in Solitude. It is consequent also to the same condition, that there be no Propriety, no Dominion, no <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine</hi> distinct, but only, that to be every mans, that he can get; and for so long, as he can keep it. Methinks <hi>Horace</hi> gives us a pretty description of this state of war, and much to the same effect with Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s, in these lines:

It may (saith Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>) seem strange to him, that hath not well weigh'd these things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how Nature should thus dissociate and render men apt to invade, and destroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: wherefore, not trusting to these foremention'd Inferences made from the Passions, he may perhaps desire to have the same confirm'd by Experience. Let him therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with himself, what opinion he hath of his fellow-Subjects, when he rides armed upon the Road; of his fellow-Citizens, when he locks his Doors; of his Children and Servants, when he locks his Chests and Truncks? Does he not there as much accuse mankind by his actions, as I do by my words? Nay, as well the Civil Law, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains a punishment for Murder in this World, as the Sacred, which prohibits it upon pain of damnation in the next, are sufficient Arguments to justifie the rapacious and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent Natures of men. Men naturally desire to be govern'd by them that will govern them cheapest, and care not how often they change their Masters, so that they may gain but two pence in the pound by so doing: Thus we see the common Souldier fights for him that gives him the most Pay, when, without ever considering the justice of the Cause, or any thing but their own Interest for a brown George, and a Groat a day, they murder such as never did them wrong, and like Mastiffs upon a Bear, are set on by no other Motives, but the Claps of a luxurious and ambitious Master; never considering, that he who hath least to lose, ought to venture least: like that most wise Cobler, who refusing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

one hand upon his instruments of Pleasure, and the other hand upon his Sword, may happily succeed well; but he, who like <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> pinnions both hands upon those lower parts, and quits the possession of his Sword, for a spinning Wheel and a Mistress, will inevitably fall into the same ruine: neither indeed (as <hi>Cyrus</hi> bravely spoke) doth it belong properly to that man to command, who is not of more worth, than those whom he commandeth. When a Woman governs a Prince, she wears not only the Breeches but the Crown, War and Peace are wholly in her hands, to her Ambassadors solely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress themselves, to her all persons make their applications for Debts, Offices, and places of preferment, both in Church and State, she only can play the <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> when either by stealing his Papers of State, she betrays his most secret Counsels to Foreigners, or by constituting men of wicked principles in all Offices of Trust, she scandalizes both Church and State. Again, As with private men, so is it with Princes, the very expences of such women are often destructive to both; for as the one may bring himself to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, by paying a hundred pounds for that which is worth but a shilling; so may the other by raising his expences proportionably, so oppress his Subjects with Taxes, as shall endanger an Insurrection, leaving himself unable to oppose his Enemies, either abroad or at home. Therefore well might <hi>Solomon</hi> say, that women will bring a man to a morsel of Bread; since one <hi>Cleopatra</hi> can consume 600000 Sesterces at a draught, as if nothing but the richest Oriental Pearl would serve to quench her thirst:

Nay, in those Countreys, the Wives are not all offended at the Rivals of their Bed, for as custom hath taken off the shame, so also hath it extinguish'd their anger: Thus we read in holy Writ, that <hi>Leah, Rachel, Sarah,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Wives, brought their fairest Maiden-servants unto their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Beds; also <hi>Livia</hi> seconded the lustful Appetites of her Husband <hi>Augustus,</hi> even to her own prejudice; and <hi>Stratonica,</hi> wife of King <hi>Deiotarus,</hi> did not only accommodate the King with a handsom Maiden, but also enroll'd the said Concubine for one of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of her Bed-chamber, educating her Children, and using all means possible to have them succeed in his Thron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All things are importuned to kill themselves, and that not only by Nature, which perfects them, but also by Art and Education, which perfects her.

If then the Valiant kill himself, who can excuse the Coward? Or how shall man be free from this, since the first man taught us this, except we cannot kill our selves, because he kill'd us all. Yet lest something should repair this common Ruine, we daily kill our Bodies with Surfets, and our Minds with Anguishes. Of our Powers, Remembring kills our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; of Affections, Lusting, our Lust; of Vertues, Giving kills Liberality. And if these kill themselves, they do it in their best and supream perfection: for after perfection imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follows excess, which changing the Natures and the Names, makes them not the same things. If then the best things kill themselves soonest, (for no Affection endures, and all things labour to this perfection) all travel to their own death, yea, the frame of the whole World, if it were possible for God to be idle, yet because it began, must die. Then in this Idleness imagined in God, what could kill the World but it self, since out of it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is? <hi>Donn</hi>'s Paradoxes. The two chief Objections against self-Homicide, are the Law of God commanded in the Scriptures, and the Law of Nature, which obliges every man to self-Preservation. As for the first of these, I refer you to that excellent Treatise entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and written by that eminent Poet and Divine, Dr. <hi>Donn,</hi> the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi>; wherein, with no weak Arguments, he endeavours to justifie out of Scripture, the Legality of self-Homicide. As to the second Objection of self-Preservation, those that are for self-Murder, urge, that self-Preservation is no other than a natural Affection, and appetition of good, whether true, or seeming; so that if I propose to my self in this self-Killing a greater good, although I mistake it, I perceive not (saith the Doctor) wherein I transgress the general Law of Nature, which is an Affection of good, true, or seeming: and if that which I affect by death, (as Martyrs, who expect a Crown of Glory, and to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98416:83"/>
lye snug in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bosom, under the umbrage of his Beard) be really a greater good, wherein is the Law of self-Preservation violated? Therefore some that are Enemies to our Faith, will have Afflictions to be God's Call out of this Life, and by the same Reason as we preserve our well-being, ought we then to destroy our ill-being. Another Reason which prevails with them, as shewing self-Homicide to be consistent with the Law of Nature is this, that in all Ages, in all places, and upon all occasions, men of all conditions have affected i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though this may be said of all other sins, that men are propense to them, and yet for all that, frequently they are against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet if this sin (saith the Doctor) were against the particular Law of Nature, and that so it wrought to the destruction of our Species, any otherwise than intemperate Lust, Surfets, or incurring penal Laws, and the like, it could not be so general; since being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our sensitive Nature, it hath not the advantage of pleasure and delight to allure us withal, which other sins have. When I frame to my self a Martyrology (saith he) of all which have perish'd by their own means for Religion, Countrey, Fame, Love, Ease, Fear, and Shame, I blush to see how naked of Followers all Vertues are in respect of this Fortitude; and that all Histories afford not so many Examples, either of Cunning, subtle Devices, or of forcible and violent Actions, for the safeguard of Life, as for the destroying. <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi> who served <hi>Nero,</hi> a man of Pleasure, in the Office of Master of his Pleasures, upon the first frown went home and cut his Veins.

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. <hi>Apollonius</hi> whilst the King lay sick, told him many things of the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: Divers Speeches pass'd to and fro between them: <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> is at length dismiss'd by the King, with Camels and other Necessaries for his Iourney into <hi>India.</hi>

               <p>NOw the King being fallen sick, <hi>Apollonius</hi> standing by him, utter'd so great and so divine things concerning the Soul, that the King-plucking up his courage, said to the standers by, that <hi>Apollonius</hi> had by his words caused him not only to contemn a Kingdom, but even <hi>[1]</hi> Death it self; when the King shew'd the Trench to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> which was made under <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and whereof we <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> spake before, and ask'd him whether he thought it not a great wonder: <hi>Apollonius</hi> depressing the strangeness thereof, said to the King, It would be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der indeed, if you were able to pass over so deep and unpassable a Current on your feet. Afterwards, when he shew'd him the Walls of <hi>Ecbatana,</hi> saying, that they were the Dwelling of the Gods; <hi>Apollonius</hi> replied, They are not certainly the Dwelling of the Gods, and whether they be the Dwelling of men, I cannot tell; for the City of <hi>[2] Lacedemon</hi> (Oh King) is inhabited without Walls. Again, when the King had been administring Iustice to certain Towns, and boasted to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that he had spent two days in hearing and determining Causes; <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> answer'd, You were very slow in finding out what was just.

                  </gap> another time, after the Tributes coming in thick from his Subjects, the King opening his Treasury, shew'd his Wealth to <hi>Apollonius.</hi> alluring him to the desire of Riches: But <hi>Apollonius</hi> admiring at nothing which he saw, said to the King, To you (Oh King) these are <hi>[3]</hi> Riches, but to me, nothing but Straw. When the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what he should do to make good use of his Riches, <hi>Apollonius</hi>'s Answer was, <hi>If you make use of them, considering you are a King.</hi> Now having had many such Conferences with the King, and having found him ready to do what he advised him to, also thinking that he had sufficiently convers'd with the <hi>Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he said to <hi>Damis,</hi> Go to now <hi>Damis,</hi> let us begin our March towards the <hi>Indians;</hi> for they that sail towards the Eaters of <hi>[4] Lotus,</hi> being taken with the sweetness of that Plant, forget their own proper manners; but we, though we have not tasted of any thing that is here, do yet tarry in these parts longer than is fitting. I my self had the same thoughts, said <hi>Damis;</hi> but reckoning the time which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured from the Lioness which we saw, I waited till that space was expired, which is not yet pass'd; for 'tis now but a year and four <note n="*" place="margin">Months <hi>I have here supply'd, the</hi> Greek <hi>being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</hi>
                  </note> months with us; nevertheless, could we now get away from hence, it would do well: But the King (answer'd <hi>Apollonius</hi>) will not dismiss us before the end of the eighth month; for you see that he is full of Courtesie and Humanity, too good to reign over <hi>Barbarians.</hi> But when he was resolv'd to depart, and the King had given him leave so to do, <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> call'd to mind the Gifts which hitherto he had forborn to receive, until he had gotten Friends in that Countrey; wherefore going to the King, he said to him, Best of Kings, I have hitherto bestow'd no Benefit on my Host, also I owe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the <hi>Magicians;</hi> wherefore my Request is, that you would be mindful of them, and for my sake, take care of them, being wise men, and full of good will towards you. The King being exceedingly well pleas'd, said unto him, You shall see
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98416:84"/>
these men to morrow made marks of Emulation, and greatly rewarded; moreover, in as much as you your self have need of none of my Riches, permit at least that these men, pointing to those about <hi>Damis,</hi> may receive something of my Wealth, even what they will. But when they also turn'd away at this word, <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, Do you see (Oh King) my Hands, both how many they are, and how like one another? However, said the King, take a Guide to direct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you in your Iourney, and <hi>[5]</hi> Camels whereon you may ride, for the way is too long to travel it all on foot. Let this be done (Oh King) answer'd <hi>Apollonius,</hi> as you command, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that the way cannot be passed over by any who doth not so ride; also this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is easie to be provided for, and fed, where there is but little Forrage: I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose likewise, that we must provide Water, and carry it in Bottles, as men do Wine; for three days Iourney (said the King) the Countrey is without Water, but after that, there is great plenty of Rivers and Springs. I conceive it best for you to travel over <hi>Caucasus;</hi> for that Countrey is fertile, and affordeth good Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation. Now when the King asked him what Present he would bring him from thence, <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, It should be a pleasing one; for if (said he) my Converse with the men of that Countrey improve my Wisdom, I shall return to you far better than I leave you: Whereupon the King embracing him, said unto him, Go on your way, for this Present will be great.</p>

                        </gap>tiety,</hi> saying, that a man would die, though he were neither valiant nor miserable, only upon a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somness, to do the same thing so often over and over. Hence it is, that the Approaches of Death make so little alteration in good Spirits, that they appear to be the same men, to the very last instant: Thus <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> died in a Complement, <hi>Livia, conjugii nostri memor, vive, &amp; vale, Tiberius</hi> in Dissimulation, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith of him, <hi>Iam Tiberium vires, &amp; corpus, non dissimulatio, deserebant; Vespasian</hi> in a Jest sitting upon a Stool, <hi>Vt puto, Deus fio; Galba</hi> with a Sentence, <hi>Feri, si ex re sit Populi Romani,</hi> holding forth his Neck, <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timius Severus</hi> in Dispatch, <hi>Adeste, si quid mihi restat agendum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bac.</hi> Ess. Again, many vulgar persons are seen to bear Deaths, intermixt with Shame and Torments, with an undaunted assurance; some through stubbornness, and some through simplicity; who without any visible alteration, take leave of their Friends, and settle their domestick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, but an hour before they die; sometimes singing, jesting, or laughing, and sometimes drinking to their Acquaintance with their very last breath, even as unconcern'd as <hi>Socrates</hi> himself could be. One (saith <hi>Montaign</hi>) when he was led to the Gallows, desired it might not be through such a Street, for fear a Merchant should arrest him for an old Debt. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wish'd the Hangman not to touch his Throat, because he was ticklish. Another an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd his Confessor, who promis'd him he should sup that night with our Saviour in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Go thither your self to Supper, for I use to fast at nights. Another calling for Drink upon the Gibbet, and the Hangman drinking first, said, he would not drink after him, for fear he should take the Pox of him. Another seeing the people running before him to the place of Execution, told 'em, they need not make such haste, for that there would be no sport till he came. Another being upon the Ladder ready to be turn'd off, a lame Weneh came and offer'd to save his Life by marrying him; but he perceiving her Lameness, cryed out, Away, away, good Hangman, make an end of thy Business, she limps. And many other Stories of the like nature I could here produce, to shew with how little Concern
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98416:85"/>
some men look Death in the face. <hi>Quoties non modo Ductores,</hi> &amp;c. How often (saith <hi>Tully</hi>) have not only our Commanders, but also our whole Armies, run violently on to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Death? <hi>Tusc. Qu. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Pyrrho</hi> being in a violent Storm at Sea, made those that were timorous ashamed of themselves, by shewing them a Hog that was on board the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, what little Concern he had for the Storm. What cause have we then to boast of our Reason, if it only robs us of our Tranquility and Courage, making us more fearful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy than <hi>Pyrrbo</hi>'s Hog? <hi>Mont.</hi> Ess. Death is a debt due to Nature, our Lives are bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd and must be restored. What is it makes Death so irksom to us, when Sleep the image of Death is so pleasant? Is it the parting with a rotten Carcass, that is hardly one hour free from trouble, sickness, or pain? Is it the leaving that which we shall not need, our Estates? Is it the loss of Conversation, such as bely'd you, betray'd you, abus'd you, and deceiv'd you? Is it the fear of pain, or the fear of what shall become of you hereafter? If it be the fear of pain, and that you esteem of Death only as you do of drawing a Tooth, <hi>Emori nolo, sed me esse mortuum nihil estimo,</hi> wish it were out, yet fear to have it drawn, then take this for your comfort, <hi>Si gravis, brevis; si longus, levis.</hi> Cic. de fin. lib. 2. You shall read (saith the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>) in some of the Friers Books of Mortification, that a man should think with himself what the pain is, if he have but his Fingers end crushed or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, and thereby imagine what the pains of Death are, when the whole Body is corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dissolved; whereas many times Death passeth with less pain, than the torture of a Limb; for the most vital parts are not the quickest of sense. Death is but felt by Discourse, because it is the motion of an instant: <hi>Aut fuit, aut veniet, nihil est praesentis in illa.</hi> The Sickness that occasions our Death, is perhaps less painful than many other Sicknesses we have formerly had, however that is antecedent to Death, and so relates not to it; and for Death, (which is nothing but the seperation of Soul and Body) I cannot concei ve it to be any pain, or at most so short, as not worth an hours fear. If it were Death it self which caus'd the pain, then all men would have the same Agony at their departure, since Death is common to all. Secondly, If it be the fear of what shall become of us hereafter, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends altogether upon Faith, which Faith ought to be regulated by the holy Scriptures; but at this time writing in a Philosophical way, I shall treat only of such Opinions, as have been maintain'd according to un-enlightned Nature. Know then, that some have deny'd any Reward or Punishment hereafter, as thinking that the supream Being concern'd not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with humane Affairs:

Many other as vain and impious Tenents were held amongst the un-enlightned Heathens, which I shall treat of more at large in my Illustration of the Souls Immortality, and have only instanced these at present, to shew, that before the Gospel shin'd amongst them, many denied a future Reward and Punishment, and those who did so, could have no fear of Death, upon the account of what would become of them hereafter. But now writing in a Christian Government, I shall wave all such Arguments, and fly only to the infinite Attribute of God's Mercy, which were not infinite, did it not extend to the vilest Sinner in Hell. <hi>He delights not in the death of a Sinner,</hi> and we have found daily Experiments of his Mercy; may such a thought never enter into my heart, that the <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s optimus maximus &amp; communis Pater</hi> of all Mankind, should create men to damn them. The best natured of the Fathers, <hi>viz. Origen,</hi> had another opinion of God, and thought the very Devils themselves would not suffer eternally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which if it was an error, was an error on the right hand. Has God brought us into the World, preserv'd us in it several years, given us a comfortable subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, brought us to our Journeys end in peace and happiness, and shall we then at last di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust him? We knew not how he would dispose of us when we came into this World, and we know not how he will dispose of us when we go out of it; but since he dealt so bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with us before, why may he not do the same again? The very Dogs that wait at out Trenchers will upbraid us with this Diffidence, when after two or three meals meat, and one days sport, they chearfully follow us without any distrust at the first whistling Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Neither will I despair, when our Divines tell me, I have offended an infinite Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, unless I had infinitely offended him; which I neither can, nor would do. For I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him not only as my God and Creator, but also as my heavenly Father, who will own me for his, so long as I do nothing purposely to offend him; and that if through the sensual Nature in me I commit any frailties, he will give me only a filial chastisement, and with that his pardon. I think I may without vanity affirm, that the thoughts of Death are not at all frightful to me, and though an unprepared Death I dread, yet a sudden Death of all others appears to me least terrible.

Lastly, As for a future Account, I find the Bill to swell rather than shrink by continuance. From all which I conclude, that Death needs not seem terrible to any, out of a fear of what shall become of them hereafter, unless it be to such, who by their hard censures of God Almighty, make Salvation seem almost impossible: and of those, I wonder any will marry, since according to their belief, 'tis above ten thousand to one but the Children they get are damn'd. Men (saith the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>) fear Death, as Children fear to go in the dark: and as that natural Fear in Children is increas'd with Tales, so is the other. Nevertheless, the Groans, Convulsions, discolour'd Face, Friends weeping, Mourning, and Obsequies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present Death more terrible than really it is: <hi>Pompa mortis magis terret, quam mors ipsa.</hi> It is as natural to die as to be born; and to a little Infant perhaps the one is as painful as the other. Moreover, Death hath this advantage also, that it openeth the Gate to Fame, and extinguisheth Envy: — <hi>Extinctus amabitur idem:</hi> Horat. However, this fear of

Death, which Nature hath implanted in us all; is one of the greatest Benefits Mankind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys; since without it, there would be no Peace, no <hi>Meum</hi> or <hi>Tuum,</hi> and no security ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Life or Estate, all Laws then being rendred uneffectual. Now some are so base-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, to judg of men according to their Deaths, if they be of a Perswasion different to their own; when if the Heretick (as they call him) repent on his Death-bed, then they boast of such repentance, as a victory over his former Opinions, although perhaps it was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd only by the decay of his understanding with sickness: Also if he keeps firm and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute to his old Principles, then they cry his heart is hardned; so that in effect it is no more than, Cross I win, Pile you lose; let either way happen, they will have something to say for themselves. But let them have a care of stamping the impress of divine vengeance upon other mens sufferings, lest in so doing they pen a Satyr against themselves:

                  <p n="3">[3] <hi>These Riches are to me nothing but Straw,</hi> &amp;c. What <hi>Apollonius</hi> here speaks against Riches, I conceive to be meant rather as an Invective against Superfluity, than an Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium of Beggary and Want, for to that purpose was his former Prayer, <hi>To have a few things, and stand in need of none.</hi> Neither is Poverty less obstructive to the study of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy than Superfluity: the inconveniencies of Body and Fortune, are hindrances in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring those Goods of the Soul, namely, Knowledge and Vertue; for Knowledge requires a generous and liberal, not a sordid Soul, like that of a poor man, (whom <hi>Alciat</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem very well represents by a Lad, with one hand stretched up into the Air, with wings fastned to it, intimating a desire to fly higher, but the other hand fastned to a heavy stone, hinders him) for their spirit being loaden with misery, thinks of nothing but the means how to live, and to be deliver'd from the heavy yoke of Necessity, which deprives them of the opportunity of having either living or dumb Teachers. He that hath this <hi>Frierly</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Riches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let him consider, how comes it to pass, that in a cold Winters night, whilst others lye abroad starving in the Fields, I have my warm Bed to go to, read, made and warm'd, without any care of mine? Is it not Money makes the difference? When after I have rid a Journey, that another man takes my Horses, rubs their heels and dresses them, without giving me any further trouble; what may I thank for this but Money? When I sit down to a Table well furnish'd with several dishes of meat, have no other care but to please my Palate in eating them, whilst other poor Creatures stand starving at my door, desiring only to go halfs with the Dogs in the scraps that come from my Servants Table; to what can I impute this difference betwixt them and me, who are all one flesh and bloud, but to Riches? So that in fine, he who contemns Money, doth in so doing contemn all quiet, peace, and content of Life, without which a man would have but a very ill mind to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophize. Moreover, Poverty makes men despise the rigor of all Laws, and oft-times aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons them to rage and despair, which making them hate their own miserable Life, renders them Masters of those of others. Hence, not only Mutinies, Seditions and Revolts, are commonly made by the poor and miserable, lovers of Innovation, wherein they are sure to lose nothing, and may possibly gain; but also are almost the sole Authors of Theft, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Sacriledges. Whereas rich persons, having from their Birth receiv'd such good Instructions as the poor want, are more stay'd in their actions, and better inclin'd to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty and Vertue, which without Fortunes and Estates can never produce any thing great or considerable; whereupon in our Language Riches are justly styled <hi>Means</hi>; without the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance whereof, Justice can neither render to every man what belongs to him, nor repel the Enemies of the State by a just War; whereof Money is by some called the <hi>Sinew.</hi> Upon this account they are sought after by all the World, as being the only support of Nobility and Families in a State; in which, for this Reason some Politicians place Nobility; but all agree them to be the chiefest ornament belonging to it. And in Policy, whether Riches be
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98416:86"/>
acquired, or come to by Succession, they are always in esteem; as on the contrary, Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is disparaged with reproach, as a sign either of base Extraction, or of Negligence and Profusion. He that is born to be poor, is born to be a Slave; and such a one is as unfit to be trusted with a publick Charge, as with a sum of Money: whereas Wealth raises the Courage, incites to great Attempts, and serves as a Spur to Vertue. I confess, I am not Philosopher enough to desire to beg from door to door, or to lye starving under a Hedge in a cold Winters night, for so they must endure who want Money: no, I would not do so much as <hi>Democritus</hi> did, to fit contemplating on the Stars, whilst the Cattel was eating up his Corn.

When I hear a young pert Master of Arts new launch'd from the University, begin to decry Riches as Muck, Dirt, Straw, and the like, I cannot but call to mind the Fable of <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Fox, who complain'd the Grapes were sowr, when he could not reach them. But in this matter I think 'tis safest to refer this Subjects Debate to <hi>Agar,</hi> who prays of God to give him neither Riches, for fear of Pride, nor Poverty, for fear of becoming a Thief: since there is many a man hang'd for committing a Robbery, who had he been born to a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fortune, might have been as honest a man as the Judg that condemn'd him; and on the other side, we who are now his Spectators, might have been his fellow-Criminals, had we been born under the malevolent Influence of the same Poverty. But however in this as in all other things, a mean is best; and he that as a single man cannot live with 600 pounds a year, would not subsist with 6000. As the Baggage to an Army, so is excessive Wealth to Vertue; it cannot be spared, nor left behind, but yet it hindreth the March; yea, and the care of it sometimes loseth or disturbeth the Victory. Wherefore I am as great an enemy to Superfluity as to Poverty; for as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Where much is, there are many to consume it; and what hath the owner, but the fight of it with his eyes?</hi> Of great Riches there is no real use, except it be in distribution, the rest is but concelt; there is a custody of them, a power of Dole, or donative of them, or a fame of them, but no solid use to the owner. For my own part, although my poor Fortune would not admit of Extravagancies, yet did it never restrain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> prevents him from using those many base actions of cozening, cheating, pawning, and selling Cloaths, and the like, which necessity inclines them to. I ever observ'd, that Plenty produceth Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness sooner than Want; for as <hi>Bion</hi> said, <hi>The hairy man grieves as much at the pulling out of his hair, as he that is bald:</hi> and he that hath once accustomed, and fixed his thoughts upon a neap of Money, it is no longer at his service, he dares not diminish it; it is a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which if he touch or take any part from it, he thinks it will all fall; nay, he will sooner pawn his Horse, or sell his Cloaths, than make a breach into his beloved Purse; he is only a keeper or treasurer of his own Money, and deserves no more the name of a rich man, than he that keeps another man's flock of Sheep, which he dares neither sell nor kill. A covetous man is the person in the World, to save whose House from firing, I would not lend my helping hand; the bounty of Providence is shipwrackt on him; there is no villany he will not perpetrate for the lucre of Money. The Poets feign, that when <hi>Plutus</hi> (which is Riches) is sent from <hi>Iupiter,</hi> he limps, and goes slowly; but when he is sent from <hi>Pluto,</hi> he runs; meaning, that Riches gotten by good means and just labour, pace slowly; but when by the deaths of others, or by any unjust means, they come full gallop. According to the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, He that resolves to be rich within a year, 'tis an even Wager but he's hang'd before half the year comes about. The Expences whereby young men are most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ruin'd, are Gaming and Women; a little good fortune at first, which like Water put into a Pump, to make it give ten-fold, draws them to the love of Play, a Vice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by none thrive but the Box keeper: and for Women, many thinking it cheaper to buy a quart of Milk for a penny, than to keep a Cow, run into the Extravagancies of keeping Misses at such a rate, till at last the charitable Miss is fain to keep them. As for the Vices that bring men of riper years to poverty, they are commonly living above their Fortune in Equipage and Hospitality, or else being bound for a dear Friend over a glass of Wine. For the first of these, when by keeping a good Table, you fall into the distress of poverty, those
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98416:87"/>
that have lived upon your Bounty, shall only say, you are a brave Fellow, 'tis a thousand pities, and the like, but will not go one step out of their way to relieve you. And for being bound for men, they are commonly Relations that desire it, and I am confident, eighteen in twenty that are so bound, are left in the lurch by their Principals; which made me so soon as ever I came of age, voluntarily enter into a Bond, never to be bound for any one living but my own Children. These and the like Follies of our own bring us into misery, and then we lay the blame upon Fortune, as vicious and intemperate persons cast their own wickedness upon Nature, when Fortune no more than Nature is in the fault:

For the description of this <hi>Lotus, Pliny</hi> (lib. 16. ch. 30.) gives it thus: There are some Trees (saith he) that branch only towards the top, as the Pine and the <hi>Greek</hi> Bean, which at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the pleasant taste of the Fruit, (much resembling Cherries, although it be of a wild nature) they call <hi>Lotus.</hi> This Tree is much planted about great Houses in the Court-yards, by reason of the large spreading of the Boughs; for albeit the stock or bodyit self be but very short and small, yet it brancheth so, as that it yieldeth much shade; yea, and oftentimes the Boughs reach to the neighbouring Houses. Nevertheless the shade of this Tree expireth as soon as any, for when Winter comes, the Leaves drop off, and no longer exclude the heat of the Sun. Moreover, no Tree beareth a fairer Bark, nor more pleasant to the eye, nor carrieth either longer Boughs, more in number, or stronger, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that whosoever sees them, would think each Bough a several Tree. Now, for the use that is made of this Tree; the Bark serveth to colour Skins and Leather; the Root to dye Wool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Fruit or Apples which it bears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are a distinct kind by themselves, resembling the Snouts or Muzzles of wild Beasts; and many of the smaller sort seem to be joyn'd to one that is bigger than the rest. Also the same Author tells us, (<hi>lib.</hi> 13. <hi>ch.</hi> 17.) that the Fruit is as big as a Bean, and of a yellow colour like Saffron. See more of this in <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Iliad.</hi> 2. in <hi>Polybius, lib.</hi> 2. and in <hi>Athenaeus.</hi> The <hi>Lotophagites</hi> are Islands over against the Coasts of <hi>Barbary,</hi> as saith <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>ch.</hi> 7.

The third sort is meagre and small, not used to Burdens, yet able to travel above an hundred miles in a day; this kind they call <hi>Raguabill. Swan</hi>'s <hi>Specul.

They love Grass, especially the blades of Barley, and when they drink, the Water must not be clear, but muddy; the sirname therefore of the Camel is, <hi>Trouble-bank,</hi> for they will mud the Water with their feet, before they take any delight to drink it. The servile Tameness of this Creature is so great, that when their Masters load them, they will (like the Subjects of <hi>France</hi>) bow themselves, and stoop down to the very ground with their knees, patiently enduring to take up their Burden.

               <p>ABout Summer time they departed thence, riding together with the Guide, who was the King's Stable-groom of his Camels. They were plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully furnish'd by the King with all things which they wanted: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Inhabitants of the several Countreys gave them kind Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the Camel that went foremost, bearing a golden Boss on his Forehead, gave notice to such as met them, that the King sent some one of his Friends. When they were arrived at <hi>[1] Caucasus,</hi> they say, that they smelt a sweet odour breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Countrey. This Mountain we may call the beginning of <hi>Taurus,</hi> which runneth through <hi>Armenia, Cilicia, Pamphylia,</hi> even to <hi>[2] Mycale,</hi> which end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Sea where the <hi>Carians</hi> inhabit, may be accounted the end of <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and not the beginning, as some would have it. The heighth of <hi>Mycale</hi> is not very great; but the tops of <hi>Caucasus</hi> mount up to so high a pitch, that the Sun seemeth to be cleft by them. With the other part of <hi>Taurus</hi> it (viz. <hi>Caucasus</hi>) encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth also that part of <hi>Scythia,</hi> which bordereth on <hi>India,</hi> lying on the <hi>[3] Meo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> and having <hi>Pontus</hi> on the left hand, for the length of about <hi>2000</hi> furlongs; and so far stretcheth the Elbow of <hi>Caucasus.</hi> But that which is said, that on our side <hi>Taurus</hi> is extended through <hi>Armenia,</hi> (which thing hath sometimes not been believ'd) is apparent from the Panthers, which I have known to be taken in that part of <hi>Pamphylia,</hi> that produceth Spices; for they delight in Odours, and smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

them at a great distance, they come out of <hi>Armenia</hi> through the Mountains, after the tears of <hi>Storax,</hi> when the Winds blow from that quarter, and the Trees distil their Gum. I have also heard, that there was a Panther taken in <hi>Pamphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> with a gold Chain about his Neck, whereon was written in <hi>Armenian</hi> Letters, <hi>ARSACES the King, to the Nisean God.</hi> For <hi>Arsaces</hi> at that time was King in <hi>Armenia</hi>: he, as I suppose, having seen that Panther, consecrated it to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> for the bigness of the Beast; for the <hi>Indians</hi> call <hi>Bacchus, Nyseus,</hi> from a place in their Countrey call'd <hi>Nysa:</hi> the same Appellation is also given him by all the Eastern people. That Beast which I spake of, did for a while converse with men, suffering her self to be handled and stroked; but when the Spring was come, and she stirr'd up with a desire of Copulation, she withdrew into the Mountains to meet with a Male, having the same ornament upon her. And she was afterwards taken in the lower part of <hi>Taurus,</hi> being (as we have said) allured by the odour of the Spices. But <hi>Caucasus</hi> bounding <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> descendeth with another El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow to the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi>

For the colour of this Beast, <hi>Pliny (lib.</hi> 8. <hi>ch.</hi> 17.) tells us, that the ground of the Panther's skin is white, enamell'd all over with little black spots, like eyes. They differ little from a Leopard; some think there is no difference between them, but in Sex. In <hi>Greek</hi> the general Name is <hi>Panther</hi>; the special Names, <hi>Pordalis</hi> and <hi>Pordalis. Pordalis</hi> is taken for the Male, and <hi>Pardalis</hi> for the Female. And in <hi>Latin</hi> it is call'd <hi>Pardus</hi> and <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thera</hi>; where it must be again observ'd, that <hi>Pardus</hi> signifieth the Male, and <hi>Panthera</hi> the Female. Neither indeed is the difference between the Leopard and Panther only in Sex, but rather in respect of a mixt and simple Generation, for there is no Leopard or Libbard, but such as is begotten between the Lion and the Panther, or the Panther and the Lioness. This Beast hath a sweet Breath, and is very fierce and wild, in so much that some have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd him the <hi>Dog-Wolf</hi>; and yet being full, he is gentle enough. He sleepeth three days, (saith <hi>Munster</hi>) and after the third day, he washeth himself, and cryeth out, when with a sweet savour that cometh from his Breath, he gathereth the wild Beasts together, being led by the smell: and then, saith <hi>Pliny,</hi> doth he hide his Head very cunningly, lest his looks should affright them; whereupon, whilst they gaze upon him, he catcheth his prey amongst them. Now the Reason why these Beasts have such a sweet Breath, I take to be, in regard that they are so much delighted with all kind of Spices, and dainty aromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Trees: in so much that (as some affirm) they will go many hundred miles, in the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the year, out of one Countrey to another, and all for the love they bear to the Spices, But above all, their chief delight is in the Gum of Camphory, watching that Tree very carefully, to the end they may preserve it for their own use.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Barbarians</hi> relate many Fables concerning that Mountain, which are also chanted by the <hi>Greeks:</hi> namely, how <hi>[1] Prometheus,</hi> for the kindness which he shew'd to men, was there bound.

                  </gap> the <hi>[3]</hi> Eagle that fed on the Entrails of <hi>Prometheus.</hi> Now some say, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus</hi> was bound in a Cave that is shewn at the foot of the Hill, where also (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Relation of <hi>Damis</hi>) you may yet see the Chains fastned to the Rocks; nor is it easie to tell of what matter they are made. Others say, that he was bound on the top of the Hill, which is double, and therefore that one hand was fastned to one top, and the other to the other top, so great was his <hi>[4]</hi> stature; the space between the two tops, being no less than a furlong. The Inhabitants of <hi>Caucasus</hi> esteem Eagles as their Enemies, burning their Nests as many as they make among the Hills, and to that end, shoot fiery Arrows at them. Moreover, they set snares to take them, saying, that by so doing they revenge <hi>Prometheus,</hi> so much are they addicted to the Fable! But as they passed over <hi>Caucasus,</hi> they report, how they met with black men of four cubits high; and saw others of five <hi>[5]</hi> cubits, when they came to the River <hi>Indus.</hi> Also in their Iourney to that River, they found these things worthy rehearsing: As they travell'd in a clear Moon-shine, they saw the Apparition of an <note n="*" place="margin">A suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirit.</note> 
                  <hi>Empusa,</hi> one while turning her self into this shape, another while into that, and sometimes vanishing away into nothing. But <hi>Apollonius</hi> knowing what it was, both reproved the <hi>Empusa</hi> himself, and commanded his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to do the same, as being the proper Remedy for such an Occurrence; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apparition fled away with a shriek like a Ghost. When they were got to the top of the Mountain, and were walking thereupon, where it was very steep, <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> ask'd <hi>Damis,</hi> saying, Where were we yesterday? <hi>Damis</hi> answer'd, In the Plain. <hi>Apollonius</hi> ask'd him again, But where are we to day? <hi>Damis</hi> answer'd, On <hi>Caucasus,</hi> unless I have forgotten my self. When therefore were you in a lower place, said <hi>Apollonius?</hi> This is not worth the asking, reply'd <hi>Damis;</hi> for yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day we passed through a hollow Vale, whereas to day we are near to Heaven. Think you then, said he, Oh <hi>Damis,</hi> that yesterdays Iourney was beneath, and to days above? Yes, said <hi>Damis,</hi> unless I am out of my Wits. Do you imagine then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:98416:90"/>
reply'd <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that these Walks do one exceed the other, or that you have something more excellent to day than you had yesterday? I conceive so, said <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis;</hi> for yesterday I went where the many use to go, but to day I travel where few Passengers ever come. Even in a City, said <hi>Apollonius,</hi> you may turn aside out of the common Road, and go where few men pass. Whereto <hi>Damis</hi> answer'd, I did not speak to this purpose, because yesterday travelling through Towns and Villages, we convers'd amongst men, but to day we ascend into a divine Countrey, untrodden by men; for even now you heard our Guide say, how the <hi>Barbarians</hi> report, that this place is the Seat of the Gods. And with this word, he erected his eyes to the top of the Mountain. Wherefore <hi>Apollonius</hi> bringing him back to the first demand, said unto him, Can you, <hi>Damis,</hi> alledg any thing that you have understood of the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> since you came nearer to Heaven? Whereto he answer'd, I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce nothing. But you ought, said <hi>Apollonius,</hi> in as much as you are mounted on so vast and so divine a Frame, to utter some clearer Opinions touching the Heaven, the Sun, and the Moon; for you imagined your self to have come so near to the Heavens, as that you could touch them with a Wand. <hi>Damis</hi> answer'd, What Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions I had yesterday concerning divine things, the same have I also to day, nor have I made an addition of any new one. Then you are still beneath, said <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and have received no new Light from so great an Altitude, and are as far from Heaven as you were yesterday: wherefore the Question that I first proposed to you is pertinent; for you thought I made a ridiculous Enquiry. Certainly, said <hi>Damis,</hi> I thought I should come down far wiser, in as much as I have heard, that <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> the <hi>Clazomenian,</hi> was used to contemplate of the things in Heaven, from <hi>[6] Mimas,</hi> a Mountain of <hi>Ionia;</hi> and <hi>[7] Thales</hi> the <hi>Milesian,</hi> from <hi>Mycale,</hi> that is not far from thence: Likewise some are reported to have made use of <hi>[8] Pangeum</hi> to the same purpose; and others of <hi>Athos;</hi> but I, being gotten up into a Mountain higher than all these, am like to come down never a whit the wiser. Neither did they, (answer'd <hi>Apollonius</hi>) for such watch-Towers may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps shew the Heavens more blue, the Stars greater, and the Sun arising out of the Night, which things are manifest even to the Swains and Shepherds: but how God taketh care of Mankind, and how he delighteth to be worshipped by them, and what Vertue, what Iustice, what Temperance is, neither will <hi>Athos</hi> shew to those that ascend up thither, nor the <hi>Olympus,</hi> so much renown'd of the Poets; unless the Soul contemplate and pry into those things, which will, if it come pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted to such Contemplation, rise higher (in my opinion) than this <hi>Caucasus.</hi>

After this, it is said, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> being offended at <hi>Prometheus</hi> for his Theft, thought to be revenged on him, by laying some grievous affliction upon Mankind, in the forming of which, he so much boasted; for which purpose, <hi>Iupiter</hi> commanded <hi>Vulcan</hi> to frame a beautiful Woman; which being done, every one of the Gods bestow'd a Gift on her, who thereupon was call'd <hi>Pandora:</hi> to this Woman they gave in her hand a goodly Box full of all Miseries and Calamities, only in the bottom of it they put Hope; with this Box she went first to <hi>Prometheus,</hi> thinking to catch him, if peradventure he should accept the Box at her hands, and so open it; which he nevertheless with good providence and foresight refused. Whereupon she goes to <hi>Epimetheus,</hi> (the Brother of <hi>Prometheus</hi>) and offers this Box to him, who rashly took it and opened it: but when he saw that all kind of Miseries came flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering about his ears, being wise too late, he with great speed and earnest endeavour clapt on the Cover, and so with much ado retained Hope, sitting alone in the bottom. At last, <hi>Iupiter</hi> laying many and grievous Crimes to <hi>Prometheus</hi> his charge, cast him into Chains, and doom'd him to perpetual Torment; whereupon by <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Command, <hi>Prometheus</hi> was fast bound, and fetter'd to a Pillar of the Mountain <hi>Caucasus</hi>; as our Author here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Also that there came an Eagle every day, who sate feeding upon his Liver, which as it was devoured in the day, so grew again in the night, that matter for Torment to work upon might never decay: nevertheless 'tis said, there was an end of his punishment; for <hi>Hercules</hi> crossing the Ocean in a Cup which the Sun gave him, came to <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and set <hi>Prometheus</hi> at liberty, by shooting the Eagle with an Arrow. Moreover, in some Nations there were instituted certain Games of Lamp-bearers, in honour of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> in which they that strove for the Prize, were wont to carry Torches lighted, which who so suffer'd to go out, yielded the place and victory to those that follow'd; so that whosoever came first to the Mark with his Torch burning, won the Prize.</p>

Her sight is sharp and quick, in so much that being in the highest part of the Air, she can easily see what falleth on the Land, and thereupon the sooner find her prey.

She usually preyeth on Hares, Geese, Cranes, and Harts; as for her practice in killing the Hart, <hi>Munster</hi> saith, it is thus: When she laboureth to destroy the Hart, she gathereth much dust as she flyeth, then sitting upon the Hart's Horns, shaketh it into his eyes, and with her wings beateth him about the mouth, till she makes him fall fainting to the ground. The Eagle buildeth her Nest-upon high places, as Rocks and Mountains; and the property of the young Eagle is, when she findeth a dead Carkass, first of all to pick out his eye. Now although the Eagle be very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over her young, yet when they be able to fly of themselves, she casteth them out of her Nest, because she would have them shift for themselves, and no longer depend upon their Dam.

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the River <hi>Cophenus,</hi> and of Camels whose Knees are inflexible: Of Wine made of Dates, yet being as able to inebriate, as that made of Grapes: Also of Hon y from Trees.</head>
               <p>HAving now travers'd the Mountain, they light on men that rode upon Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and have their Habitation between Mount <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and the <hi>[1]</hi> River <hi>Cophenus:</hi> They are a very rude people, and keepers of such Cattel; some of them sate on such Camels as the <hi>Indians</hi> make use of for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in that they will go a thousand furlongs in one day, and have their Knees

inflexible. Wherefore one of them riding upon such a Camel, when he approached somewhat near, asked the Guide whither they were going; and being certifi'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the cause of their Iourney, he told it to the other <hi>Nomades,</hi> who rejoycing at the News, bade them come near, and offer'd them Wine, which they by an Art they have press out of Dates; likewise Honey made of the same Tree, as also the flesh of Lions and Panthers, whose skins had been newly fley'd off. Now having received all these things save the flesh, they passed by those <hi>Indians</hi> travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the East; and afterwards dining near a certain Fountain, <hi>Damis</hi> tasting the Wine which they had receiv'd from the <hi>Indians,</hi> said to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> This is the Cup of <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Saviour, whereof you have not drank a long time: but I suppose you will not refuse this Liquor, as you do that which is wrung from the Grapes. Having thus spoken, he offer'd a Libation, in that he had made mention of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> At this <hi>Apollonius</hi> smiling, said unto him, Do we not abstain from receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Money? Yes, said he, as you have often made it appear. What then, answer'd <hi>Apollonius,</hi> is to be done? Shall we abstain from Silver and Gold, not being tempted with that Money, which not only private men, but even Kings themselves, exceedingly affect; and yet if any man should offer us a piece of brass Money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of silver, or a counterfeit piece gilded over with gold, shall we receive the same, only because it is not such Money as most men so greedily pursue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? For the <hi>Indians</hi> have Money made of Copper, and black Brass, wherewith all such as come into those Parts must traffick. If then the <hi>Nomades</hi> (or Shepherds) had offer'd us such Money, would you, when you had seen me refuse the same, have better inform'd me, by s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ying, that that only is to be accounted <hi>[2]</hi> Money, which the King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> or Emperor of the <hi>Romans,</hi> coyneth, and that this is another kind of thing which the <hi>Indians</hi> have devised? Now should I be perswaded with such a Reason, what would you think of me? Should I not pass for a counterfeit, and one that casteth away Philosophy, in a worse manner than Souldiers cast away their Bucklers? For he that hath done so, may get another Buckler as good as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as saith <hi>Archilochus;</hi> but how can Philosophy be recover'd by him, that hath once rejected or despised the same? In like manner, <hi>Bacchus</hi> might pardon me, if I wholly abstain from all sorts of Wine whatsoever; but if I prefer that made of Dates, before that which distilleth from the Grape, I know he will certainly be moved with indignation, and say, that his Gift is slighted. Neither are we far distant from him, for even now you heard the Guide say, that the Mountain <hi>Nysa</hi> is hard by, where <hi>Bacchus</hi> (as I have heard) doth many strange things. Neither doth it, Oh <hi>Damis,</hi> proceed from Grapes only that men are drunken, but also from Dates; for we have seen many of the <hi>Indians</hi> intoxicated with this sort of Wine, whereof some dance and reel, others sing and nod, as they among us who sit up whole nights a drinking. Now that you your self imagine this Drink to be Wine, is evident, in that you offer'd a Libation thereof to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> using such a Prayer as is used at a Drink offering of Wine. But these things are spoken to you <hi>Damis,</hi> only in relation to my self; not that I would disswade you, or the rest of our Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from drinking it: nay, I would freely also give you liberty to eat of the Flesh; for I see that the abstinence from these things would be nothing advantagious to you, whereas they are suitable to that kind of Philosophy, to the which I have addicted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y self from a Child. The Companions of <hi>Damis</hi> heard this with delight, and were glad to be feasting, thinking they should the better perform their Iourney, if they used a plentiful Diet.</p>

                  <p>But Dr. <hi>Hakewill,</hi> who differs some small matter from his Lordship's Computation, reckons a Talent to be 750 ounces of Silver, which after five shillings the ounce comes to 187 pounds. The <hi>Sestertius</hi> (saith <hi>Hakewill</hi>) was among the <hi>Romans</hi> a Coyn so common, that <hi>Nummus</hi> and <hi>Sestertius</hi> came at length to be used promiscuously the one for the other; so called it was, <hi>quasi Semis-tertius,</hi> because of three <hi>Asses</hi> it wanted half a one, and is thus commonly express'd, <hi>IIS,</hi> or <hi>H-S,</hi> whereby is understood two <hi>Asses</hi> and an half. For the value of it, ten <hi>Asses</hi> make a <hi>Denarius,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> penny, so termed, because it contain'd <hi>Dena aera,</hi> which were the same with their <hi>Asses</hi>; so as the <hi>Sesterce</hi> containing two <hi>Asses</hi> and an half, must of necessity be found in the <hi>Denarius</hi> four times: now the <hi>Denarius</hi> being the eighth part of an ounce, and an ounce of Silver being now with us valued at five shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, it follows by consequence, that the value of the <hi>Denarius</hi> is seven pence half-penny: also the <hi>Sesterces</hi> being the fourth part thereof, amount to penny half-penny farthing half farthing, which is half a farthing less than the Bishop's Computation. Touching the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of counting by <hi>Sesterces,</hi> a Controversie there is betwixt <hi>Budae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98416:94"/>
incline, believing that <hi>Sestertium</hi> in the Neuter contains a thousand <hi>Sesterties,</hi> according to my Lord Bishop's Table above receited. But here two things are specially to be noted: First, That if the <hi>Numeral,</hi> or word that denoteth the Number, being an Adjective, and of a different Case, be joyn'd with <hi>Sestertium,</hi> (by an abbreviation put for <hi>Sestertiorum</hi>) in the Genitive Case plural, then doth it note so many thousand <hi>Sestertii</hi>; for example, <hi>Decem Sestertium</hi> signifies <hi>Decem millia,</hi> or ten thousand <hi>Sesterces.</hi> Secondly, If the <hi>Numeral</hi> joyn'd with <hi>Sestertium</hi> be an Adverb, then it designeth so many hundred thousand; <hi>ex. gra. Decies Sestertium,</hi> signifies <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ies centena millia,</hi> ten hundred thousand, or a million of <hi>Sesterces</hi>; and sometimes the Substantive <hi>Sestertium</hi> is omitted, but necessarily understood; the Adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive then, or Adverb set alone, being of the same value, as if the Substantive were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd: as thus, <hi>Decem</hi> standing by it self, is as much as <hi>Decem Sestertium</hi>; and <hi>Decies</hi> the same.

Of <hi>Nysa</hi> beset with Trees, like <hi>Tmolus</hi> in <hi>Lydia</hi>: Of <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple surrounded with Ivy and Vines; and of his Statue: That there be various opinions about the Countrey of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> but that by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription on a certain Quoite in <hi>Pythia,</hi> it is believ'd that he was a <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban:</hi> Concerning another <hi>Bacchus,</hi> Son to the River <hi>Indus;</hi> as also of the Name of the Hill <hi>Nysa:</hi> Whether <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> did celebrate the Orgies of <hi>Bacchus</hi> in <hi>Nysa?</hi>

               <p>AFter this, having passed over the River <hi>Cophenus,</hi> they themselves in Boats, and their Camels on foot, in as much as the River is not there very deep, they arrived in the Continent that pertaineth to the King, where the Hill <hi>Nysa</hi> reaching all along, is set with Plantations to the very top, as <hi>Tmolus</hi> in <hi>Lydia</hi> is. It is an easie matter for any one to get up into the same, in that passages are every where made by the Husbandry there used. When they were ascended, they lighted on the Temple of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which they say that he himself planted round about with Laurels, in a circumference of so much ground, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s would be sufficient for an indifferent Temple: and that round about the Laurels he planted Vines and Ivy; also erected his Image in the midst, as knowing that time would bring the Bought to meet, and so frame a kind of Roof; which now is so closely compacted,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98416:95"/>
that neither can the Rain descend, nor Wind blow upon the Temple. There be also Sickles, pruning Knives, and Wine-presses, with all things belonging thereunto, made of gold and silver, and dedicated to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> as to one concern'd in the Vintage: but the Image of <hi>Bacchus</hi> being made of white Stone, resembleth an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Lad. When <hi>Bacchus</hi> begins his Orgies, and moveth <hi>Nysa,</hi> the under-lying Cities are said to hear him, and to be moved together with it. Howbeit, there is no small Controversie between the <hi>Indians</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> about <hi>Bacchus;</hi> yea, the very <hi>Indians</hi> themselves are divided in their Opinions concerning him. For we say, that <hi>Bacchus</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> made an Expedition into <hi>India,</hi> leading an Army after a mad antick fashion: to prove which, we bring many probable Conjectures, more especially the Monument in <hi>Pythia,</hi> which is there conserv'd in the Treasury of the Temple: it is a certain <hi>Quoit</hi> or <hi>Discus</hi> made of silver, bearing this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription; <hi>[1]</hi> Bacchus, <hi>the Son of</hi> Semele <hi>and</hi> Iupiter, <hi>from the</hi> Indies, <hi>to</hi> Apollo <hi>of</hi> Delphos. But the <hi>Indians</hi> that dwell between <hi>Caucasus</hi> and the River <hi>Cophenus</hi> affirm, that <hi>Bacchus</hi> came out of <hi>Assyria</hi> into those Parts, and are said to be acquainted with the whole Story of <hi>Bacchus</hi> the <hi>Theban.</hi> Whereas they that inhabit the Region between <hi>Indus</hi> and <hi>Hydraotes,</hi> and the residue of that Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, which is bounded by the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> report, that <hi>Bacchus</hi> was the Son of the River <hi>Indus,</hi> and that there came to him that other <hi>Bacchus</hi> born at <hi>Thebes,</hi> who touch'd the Leavy-spear, and communicated to him the Orgies, saying, that he was the Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and was quicken'd in his Father's Thigh till his birth, and that he found a Hill near <hi>Nysa</hi> called <hi>Meros,</hi> [which signifies a Thigh.] They also report, that the Inhabitants having fetched Grape-kernels out of <hi>Thebes,</hi> plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole Hill with Vines in honour of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> and that <hi>Alexander</hi> celebrated the Orgies in the Hill <hi>Nysa.</hi> But those that dwell in <hi>Nysa</hi> say, that <hi>Alexander</hi> ascended not the Hill, (although he greatly desired it, as being both ambitious of Honour, and studious of Antiquity) fearing lest the <hi>Macedonians</hi> tasting of the Vines, which they had not done of a great while, should either long after home, or fall into a love of Wine, after they had so long been accustomed to Water. For these Reasons therefore he passed by <hi>Nysa,</hi> having only prayed and sacrificed to <hi>Bacchus</hi> at the foot of the Hill. Nor am I ignorant that some will be displeas'd with what I write, in that they who accompanied <hi>Alexander,</hi> and served under him, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed these things otherwise than the truth required. Whereas I am resolv'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the truth above all things, which if they also had done, they would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded <hi>Alexander</hi> of this commendation. For I suppose it to be more glorious for him, not to have gone up into the Mountain, to the end he might the better keep his Army within the bounds of sobriety, than to go up, as they say he did, and there play the <hi>[2]</hi> Drunkard and Mad-man in celebrating the Rites of <hi>Bacchus.</hi>

When <hi>Bacchus</hi> came to be of age, he passed through greatest part of the World, and made War upon the <hi>Indians,</hi> whom he overcame, and in their Countrey built the City <hi>Nisa,</hi> here mention'd by <hi>Philostratus.</hi> He is said to be the first that introduced the custom of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing; at which time he wore a golden Diadem about his head: his Chariot was drawn by Tygers; his Habit was the skin of a Deer; and his Scepter was a small Lance, adorn'd with branches of Ivy and Vine-leaves. He invented the use of Wine, which he gave to the <hi>Indians</hi> to drink, who at first imagined he had given them poyson, because it made them both mad and drunk. They did at first frequently sacrifice men unto him, but since his Expedition into <hi>India,</hi> he was content with other Sacrifices, such as Asses and Goats; to signifie, that those who are given to Wine, become as sottish as Asses, and as lascivious as Goats. <hi>Sine Cerere &amp; Bacch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He never had other Priests but Satyrs and Women, because the latter had follow'd him in great companies throughout his Travels, crying, singing, and dancing after him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in so much that they were called <hi>Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales, Mimallones, Lenae, Bassarides, Thyades,</hi> and <hi>Menades,</hi> Names that express fury and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

He did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appear young, because Wine moderately taken purifies the Bloud, and preserves the Body in a youthful strength and colour. His Temple was next to <hi>Minerva</hi>'s, to express how useful Wine is to revive the Spirits, and enable our Fancy to invent; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the <hi>Heathens</hi> did sacrifice to him the quick-sighted Dragon. The chattering Pye was also sacred to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> because Wine doth cause us to prattle more than is convenient: his Sacrifices were usually perform'd in the evening, and at night. Also it is reported of him, that he carried a Torch before <hi>Proserpina,</hi> when she was led to be married to <hi>Pluto</hi> the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God. <hi>Iuno</hi> could never endure the sight of him, wherefore she labour'd to drive him out of Heaven, and to banish him from all society; he fled from her fury, and as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing himself under a Tree, a Serpent named <hi>Ambisbaena</hi> bit him, but he kill'd it with a Vine branch, which is a mortal poyson to some Serpents. <hi>Iuno</hi> continued her hatred for him, because he was her Husband's Bastard, until she cast him into a Fit of madness, which made him undertake an Expedition against the <hi>Indians,</hi> and over-run all the Eastern Countreys: <hi>Lusus</hi> was his Companion, from whom <hi>Portugal</hi> is called <hi>Lusitania.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth of this Fable is; that <hi>Liber,</hi> otherwise call'd <hi>Dionysius, Bacchus,</hi> or <hi>Osiris,</hi> by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> was a King of <hi>Nysa,</hi> a City in <hi>Arabia Faelix,</hi> who taught his people, and the Inhabitants of the adjoyning Countreys, many useful Arts, as the ordering of the Vine, and the preserving of Bees. He establish'd several good Laws, and is therefore called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. He perswaded the people to sacrifice to their Gods, for the which he was much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd by all civil Nations. The <hi>Grecians</hi> establisht several Festival days in honour of him; the chief are their <hi>Trieteria,</hi> kept every three years, in remembrance of his <hi>Indian</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, perform'd in that space of time; also their <hi>Apaturia,</hi> their <hi>Phallica,</hi> and their <hi>Lenaea,</hi> in the beginning of the Spring, for his blessing upon their Vines. This latter Festival was named <hi>Orgya,</hi> because his Proselytes did express in it nothing but fury and madness, although this Name is sometimes taken for all his other Festivals. The <hi>Romans</hi> had appointed the <hi>Ascolia</hi> in honour of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> at which time they carried the Statues of this God about their Vineyards, as the <hi>Papists</hi> do beyond Sea their Host, or the Priest's God about their fields, that he might bless the Fruits of the Earth. Afterwards the Procession of <hi>Bacchus</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Altar, where raising the consecrated Victim on the top of a Lance, they did burn it to the honour of <hi>Bacchus</hi>; then taking his Statues and Images, they hung them on high Trees, imagining, that they would contribute to the increase of their Grapes and Vines. This Festival is called the Festival of God, and was celebrated about the month of <hi>May.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tit. Livius</hi> (lib. 39.) relates a strange Story of the Festivals of <hi>Bacchus</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a Fortune-teller of <hi>Greece:</hi> that three times in a year the Women of all qualities did meet in a Grove called <hi>Simila,</hi> and there acted all sorts of Villany; those that appear'd most reserved were sacrificed to <hi>Bacchus</hi>; when, that the cryes of the murder'd and ravish'd Creatures might not be heard, they did howl, sing, and run up and down with lighted Torches: but the Senate being acquainted with these night-meetings, and filthy unclean practices, banish'd them out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and punished severely the promoters of them.</p>
                  <p>Now the Beasts that were dedicated to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> were the Goats and the Dragons; the <hi>Egyptians</hi> offer'd Sows. The Trees consecrated to him were the Ivy-tree, the Oak, the Fig, the Vine, the Smilax, and the Fir-tree. It was the custom, that all those who sacrificed to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> did approach the Altars with a Branch or Grown of one of those Trees in their hands, which they offer'd unto him. <hi>Bacch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This God did (as the Poets tell us) punish all those persons who neglected or opposed his Worship: Thus <hi>Alcibous</hi> (as <hi>Philostratus</hi> writes) was transform'd into a Bat, because he would not sacrifice to him.

Every man's Heart is a den of Beasts, which Drink lets open: and this makes Drunkenness so much more dangerous to some than others; for if some dull flegmatick men open their dens with Drink, out will come only some silly Cur-dog, or harmless Lamb, <hi>viz.</hi> some baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Jest, ridiculous old Story, or the like. Whereas if others who have hotter brains, and more refined spirits and sense, open their dens, out comes a Lion against the State, or a Bear against the Church, or some mischievous Jest or Satyr against Superiors, which may prove their ruine. Drink does not so much create new Thoughts or Opinions in us, but rather divulge those which lay hid in us before; and he that calls you Knave and Fool when he is drunk, thinks you neither a Saint nor a <hi>Solomon</hi> when he's sober.

Some few I have known, who are more cautious to buy, sell, or make Bargains, when they are in Drink, than when they are sober; but such are very rare, and seldom arrive to that pitch, till they have serv'd out a Prenticeship in Drinking. Those that are of a dull, cold, flegmatick Complexion, Drink makes them stupid and sleepy, whereas the hot and sanguinary become mad and fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick therewith; however both render themselves sufficiently ridiculous, not only to others, but even to themselves, when they become sober. Therefore he that thinks to drink away sorrow, does but increase it, when on the morning after the Debauch, like a Clap ill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it returns with a violent Pox of Melancholy and ill Humour. The many and dear Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities

that are made over the Pot, have ruined thousands; as if nothing were too great or too good for him that helps to make me a Beast. To see the Hugs, Kisses, and close Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, that pass between Pot-Companions, would be most diverting to any slander by that were unconcern'd.
<q>For an instance of the ridiculous Fancies of men in Drink, <hi>Athenaeus</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 2.) tells a pleasant Story of some young men, who were so infatuated with Wine, that they fancied themselves in a Storm at Sea; whereupon they cast out of the Window into the Street, all the Bedding and Furniture that was in their Chamber, thinking to avoid Shipwrack by lightning the Vessel: now when many came running, and carrying away every one somewhat of the Goods that were cast out, and that this drunken Crew, neither all that day nor the night following, could be brought again to their right wits, there were some Officers that went into the House, where they found these Drinkers vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, as if they were Sea-sick, and giddy-headed; the Officers asking them what they were a doing, they answer'd, that the Tempest had so beaten them, that to save their Lives, they were forced to cast their Lading over-board. The Officers standing amazed hereat, one of the eldest of the Drunkards said unto them, As for me, noble <hi>Tritons,</hi> (taking them for Sea-gods) fear hath made me throw my self on this Bed, to be so much the safer in the bottom of the Vessel. The Officers pitying the madness of the poor Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, advised them from thenceforward to drink less Wine, and so left them. The young men thanking them reply'd, If after this Storm we ever come to Land, we will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you among the other Sea-gods for our Saviours, seeing you have appear'd unto us as Patrons to save and preserve us.</q>

The opinion that Coffee will recover men in Drink to their right senses, have exposed many in that condition to the laughter of a whole Coffee-house, and thereby cured them for the future, not with Coffee, but shame. The Examples of this kind of Luxury are many and famous among the Ancients, as well <hi>Greeks</hi> as <hi>Romans:</hi> Of this Art of Drinking, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was a Master, as also <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; and <hi>Cyrus</hi> preferr'd himself before his Brother <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> for being the better drinker. <hi>Lipsius</hi> (in his Epistle <hi>de potoribus Antiq.</hi>) tells us of one <hi>Firmus,</hi> who under the Emperor <hi>Aurelian</hi> drank off two Buckets full of Wine. <hi>Bonosus</hi> (who lived about the same time) was much such another, being used to say, <hi>Non ut vivat natus est, sed ut bibat</hi>; and afterwards he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hang'd for some misdemeanour, they used to jeer him, saying, <hi>Amphoram pendere, non hominem</hi>; that a Barrel or Tankard hung there, not a man. <hi>Capitolinus</hi> reports of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Maximinus, Bibisse saepe in die vini Capitolinam amphoram,</hi> which <hi>Amphora</hi> contains of our Measure nine Gallons, counting a Gallon and a Pint to the <hi>Longius,</hi> whereof the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phora</hi> contains eight. Also <hi>Vopiscus,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> tells of one <hi>Phagon,</hi> who drank out in one day, <hi>plus Orca,</hi> which <hi>Orca</hi> (saith <hi>Lipsius</hi>) is a Wine-Vessel, much bigger than an <hi>Amphora.</hi> Nay, the Emperors themselves were so much addicted to this Vice, that <hi>Tiberius Nero, propter nimiam vini aviditatem,</hi> (saith <hi>Suetonius,</hi> ch. 42.) was nick-named <hi>Biberius Mero</hi>; also that for their great drinking, he preferr'd <hi>Piso</hi> to the Provostship of the City, and <hi>Flaccus Pomponius</hi> to be President of the Province of <hi>Syria,</hi> styling them in his Letters Patents, <hi>Iucundissimos &amp; omnium horarum amicos.</hi> He likewise preferr'd a mean inconsiderable Fellow to the Treasurership, (before persons of great quality that stood in competition with him) only for drinking off an <hi>Amphora</hi> of Wine at a Feast. To these may be added that Epitaph which <hi>Camerarius</hi> (ch. 94.) mentioneth to be found at <hi>Rome,</hi> without the Gate <hi>Capena:</hi>

Their Rules of Drinking they borrow'd for the most part from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were the most debaucht people of all others. Of these Rules, one was to drink down the evening Star, and drink up the morning Star, <hi>Ad diurnam Stellam matutinam potantes,</hi> saith <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> Another commonly practised among them was the drinking of so many Healths, as there were Letters in their Mistresses Name:
<q>
                        <l>Naevia sex Cyathis, septem Iustina bibatur,</l>

Yet <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Symposiaks</hi> makes as if they were superstitious of drinking four Healths, perhaps because of the even Number: <hi>Aut quinque bibe, aut tres, aut non quatuor.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>Seneca</hi> assures us, that the Women excell'd the Men in this Vice of Drinking, saying, <hi>Non minus pervigilant, non minus potant,</hi> &amp;c. They no less sit up late in the night, they drink no less than men; nay, they challenge men to the anointing their Bodies, and swil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of Wine, evacuating upwards what they eat and drink, as well as they: <hi>Senec.</hi> Epist. 96. Above all others, their Poets were most infected with this kind of Debauchery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in so much that <hi>Martial</hi> tells us of himself, that sober, he was no body for Invention, but drunk, fifteen Poets strong:

This made them pass that severe Censure upon Water-drinkers, when <hi>Horace</hi> says,

For my own part, I never was a Poet, but I have been a Water-drinker, and must so far dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree with the Ancients as to declare, that when I drank other Liquors, (which I never did, but to prevent my-self from being the spy and wonder of the Company, or out of the difficulty of procuring such Water as was good) I ever found that small stock of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I had much debilitated and weaken'd, even by a moderate quantity of Wine, and othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Liquors, whose Fumes (if men rightly consider it) render them witty only in their own conceit: neither is this all, but the Palsies, Convulsions, Feavers, and other Sicknesses, which frequently attend upon Drinking, render other Liquors as unwholsom, as Water may seem unpleasant. All hot things do in some measure destroy natural heat; and to talk of comforting a healthful Stomach with Cordials, is to talk like a Quack: since I have never known men have colder Stomachs, than some that are great drinkers of Wine and Brandy. Now as this natural heat causes our disgestion, and as all hot Liquors tend to the destroying of this natural heat, so by consequence, Water (which many besides my self, by a glass after
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98416:98"/>
meals have experienc'd) must be of all Drinks the most helpful to a bad digestion. Water serving only for a Vehicle, agrees better with variety of Meats, being like the <hi>Menstruum</hi> of the <hi>Chymists,</hi> and the uniting <hi>Medium</hi> of the <hi>Lullists,</hi> which serves to re-unite all different Bodies into one alone; patiently attending their disposition without corrupting, as Wine and Vinegar doth; and without leaving behind in the Kidneys the Tartar, or Lee of Wine, which is the seed of the Stone, wherewith Water-drinkers are not so commonly troubled. Those that drink Water, have a better appetite than those that drink Wine, which is an argument that Wine helps concoction less than Water; and no wonder, since as <hi>Galen</hi> saith, Wine increases thirst instead of quenching it, as Water doth. Besides Beasts, there are a hundred drink only Water for one that drinks Wine, reckoning <hi>Tartars, Chineses, Indians,</hi> and the common people among the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are prohibited it by the Law
of their Prophet. Lastly, To object the coldness of the Climate there is little reason, since as I shew'd you before, Water cherishes and not destroys the natural heat within us; nay, if Wine may be thought natural to any, I should think Nature design'd it rather for those Countreys where the Vine prospers most, as <hi>France, Italy,</hi> &amp;c. Also the Life of man before the use of Wine, <hi>viz.</hi> before the Flood, is said to have been much longer than it hath been since.

Howbeit he writeth, that he heard that this place was taken by <hi>Alexander:</hi> also that it is call'd <hi>Aornus,</hi> not from its being fifty furlongs high, for the sacred Birds are seen to fly much higher than that; but because on the top of the Rock there is a certain Cleft, which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to it self the Birds that fly near it; as may be seen at <hi>Athens,</hi> in the Porch of the <note n="*" place="margin">Or Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va's Shrine</note> 
                  <hi>Parthenon,</hi> and also in many places of <hi>Phrygia</hi> and <hi>Lydia:</hi> for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was the Rock call'd <hi>Aornus,</hi> and is so without Birds. As they were travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling towards the River <hi>Indus,</hi> they light on a Lad who was about thirteen years old, and sitting on an Elephant, did grievously beat him. All admiring at this sight, <hi>Apollonius</hi> asked <hi>Damis,</hi> what he thought to be the part of a good Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? To which he answer'd, What else but sitting fast on his Horse, to govern him, to guide the Reins, and if he be unruly, to cudgel him; moreover to take care that he fall not into a Pit, Ditch, or Hole, when he passeth through a Lake, or through the Dirt. Is nothing else required of a good Horseman, said <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius?</hi> Yes, by <hi>Jove,</hi> answer'd <hi>Damis,</hi> when he goeth up a steep place, he must let loose the Reins to his Horse; and on the contrary, when he goeth down, he must hold him in. Likewise, sometime to stroke his Main or Ears, and not always to beat him, seemeth the duty of a wise Rider; and I should commend a man that rode in this manner. But what Arts must he have that rideth a War-horse, said <hi>Apollonius? Damis</hi> reply'd, He must have not only those which I before rehears'd, but to be able also to strike the Enemy, and defend himself, as also to pursue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and to enure his Horse not to startle at the sound of the Buckler, or glister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98416:98"/>
of the Helmet, or at the shouting of the Enemies when they begin to fight; for these things likewise belong to good Horsemanship. What then think you (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) of this Lad that rideth on the Elephant? <hi>Damis</hi> answer'd, He is a more admirable Rider, than those which I have described; for to command a Beast of so vast a bulk, when he himself in the mean time is of so small a Body, and to direct him with a Sheep-hook whither he pleaseth, casting (as you see) the same upon him as it were an Anchor, also not to dread the sight and height of the Beast, nor his great strength, seemeth unto me to be more than humane Art. And (so help me <hi>Pallas</hi>) I should not have believed another man, who should have told me this Story. But what if one would sell the Lad (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) would you buy him? Yes, answer'd <hi>Damis,</hi> that I would, though I gave all I had for him. For to exercise dominion over the greatest Beast the Earth seeds, as over a high Tower that he had seiz'd on, seemeth to me a thing agreeable to none but a most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and noble disposition. What would you do with the Lad (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) unless you bought the Elephant too? <hi>Damis</hi> reply'd, I would make him Comptroller over my House, and all that I have, supposing that he would order them better than I can do. But are not you your self (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) able to manage your own Affairs? Yes, answer'd <hi>Damis,</hi> as well as you are able; for laying aside the care of my own Affairs, I go about with you, out of a desire to learn and understand the things that are done in foreign Parts. But if you had bought the Lad, (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) and had two Horses, the one fit for the Race, the other for the War, would you set him upon both indifferently? I would set him upon the Race-horse, answer'd <hi>Damis,</hi> in as much as I see other men do so; for how could he manage a War-horse, who is not yet able to bear a Buckler, or Breast-plate, or Helmet, without which a Trooper cannot ride. Again, how could he possibly handle a Spear, who is not able to manage a Bow and Arrows, being as yet only accustom'd to Bracelets? Then is it some other thing (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) that rules and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns this Elephant, and not this Rider, whom you seem to adore for the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it. But what may that be, answer'd <hi>Damis,</hi> for I see nothing but the Lad upon the Elephant? This Beast (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) is the most docible of all Beasts, and being once accustom'd to live under a man, endureth any thing from him, confor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               <head>CHAP. VI. That there are three sorts of Elephants: Of an Elephant above four hundred years old; and that he had sometimes fought for King <hi>Porus</hi> against <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander:</hi> Also of another Elephant call'd <hi>Ajax,</hi> taken four hundred years after a certain War in <hi>Lybia</hi>: Their Opinion untrue, who would have the Teeth of Elephants to be rather Horns, than Teeth: Finally, what Teeth are blewish, what white, what great, what small, and what easie to be cut.</head>
               <p>MOreover, that they had heard how some Elephants live in the Fens, others in the Mountains, others in the Plains; that they are taken for the use of War, and fight with Turrets on their backs, wherein ten or fifteen <hi>Indians</hi> do stand, and out of them as out of Forts they throw Darts, or discharge Arrows, against the Enemies. The Beast himself accounteth his Trunk as his Hand, and useth it to dart things away from him. And as much as a <hi>Lybian</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant is bigger than a <hi>Nysaean</hi> Horse, so much is an <hi>Indian</hi> Elephant bigger than an Elephant of <hi>Lybia.</hi> As for the Age of Elephants, and that they are very long lived, is recorded by others. But they say, they lighted on an Elephant near <hi>[1] Taxilla,</hi> (the greatest of all the Cities in <hi>India</hi>) whom the Natives anointed and crown'd with Garlands, for that it was one of them that fought for King <hi>[2] Porus</hi> against <hi>Alexander;</hi> which for the ready service that he perform'd in that Battel, <hi>Alexander</hi> consecrated to the Sun. He hath also golden Chains about his Teeth, or (if you had rather call them so) his Horns; and on the Chains, these <hi>Greek</hi> Letters inscribed <hi>[3]</hi> Alexander <hi>the Son of</hi> Iupiter <hi>dedicateth</hi> Ajax <hi>to the Sun</hi> For this Name <hi>(Ajax)</hi> he gave to the Elephant, as beautifying him being great, with a great Name. Now the Natives conjecture, that it was about <hi>350</hi> years from the abovesaid Fight; not relating withal how old the Elephant was when he fought in the Battel. But <hi>Juba</hi> who sometimes reign'd over the <hi>Lybians</hi> report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the <hi>Lybian</hi> Riders mounted on Elephants, did on a time fall together by the ears, and that the one party of the Elephants had a Tower graved on their Teeth, but the other had nothing graved on theirs. Now when the night grew on, and gave a period to the Fight, that party which had the Tower graved on their Teeth being worsted, fled into Mount <hi>Atlas;</hi> one whereof he took <hi>400</hi> years after, and found the mark hollow in his Teeth not worn out by time. The said <hi>Juba</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, that they ought rather to be call'd the Horns, than the Teeth of Elephants, in that they grow out of their Temples. And for that they fasten them not on any other thing, they likewise abide the same that they grew at first, without any shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or growing again like Teeth. But I assent not to those Reasons: for Horns, if not all, yet at least those of Elephants, shed and grow again. But as for Teeth, indeed those of men do shed, and grow again: nevertheless there is no Beast whose Teeth fall out of themselves, being double or standing out, or come again in the place of them that fall out; for Nature hath implanted the Teeth in their Gums, to serve them instead of Arms. Besides, the Horns do every year draw as it were a certain Circle about their roots, like Sheep, Goats, and Beeves. The Teeth spring up very smooth, and unless they be broken, remain so perpetually: for they seem to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98416:100"/>
partake the matter and substance of a Stone; likewise those living Creatures only have Horns which part the Hoof. But an Elephant hath five Claws, and a Foot parted into many clefts, that he may not fasten his foot deep in the ground, when he standeth in a moist place. Furthermore, Nature giving hollow Bones to horned Beasts, produceth likewise outwardly a Horn; whereas the Bones of Elephants are full, and every where alike: so that if any one open them, and inspect the middle of them, he shall find in the midst a little hole, such as is wont to be in Teeth. As for the Teeth of such Elephants as live in the Fens, they are blewish, porous, and hard to be wrought: for in many places there are Crannies, and in other parts certain Knobs, like to Hail-stones, which do not yield to the Artist. But the Teeth of such as live in the Mountains are less than those, yet are white enough, and capable of being wrought: howbeit the Teeth of such as live in the Plains are the best; for they are the greatest and whitest, also easie to be cut, and may with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle labour be wrought into any fashion you please.</p>

What then meaneth that foolish Question of Wranglers, whether or no the <hi>[1]</hi> Love of Parents to their young be natural? for these Elephants openly proclaim that this Love cometh to them by Nature, in that they learned it not, as they have done many other things, from men, having never lived amongst them, but receiv'd it from Nature so to love their young ones. Say not this (Oh <hi>Damis</hi>) only of Elephants, for this <hi>[2]</hi> Beast I rank next after men for Vnderstanding and Prudence; but I consider likewise, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>en Beasts exceeding other Beasts in fierceness, do yet suffer any thing for their Cubs; also how <hi>[3]</hi> Wolves being continually intent on their prey, make the Female keep the Whelps, whilst the Male for the preservation of her young bringeth her in food. The like may be observ'd of Panthers, who by reason of their heat rejoyce to become Dams, for that they then rule over the Males, and govern the House, whilst the Males in the mean <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98416:102"/>
take them into the Bed of the Lions in the <hi>Champain</hi> Fields: but afterwards when the time of their Delivery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Furthermore they report, that a <hi>[6]</hi> Tyger being a most fierce Creature, will in this Countrey, as also about the Red-sea, run to the very Ships to fetch back their young ones, and having gotten them, will retur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Who likewise doth not observe the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Birds? how Eagles and <hi>[7]</hi> Storks never build their Nests, but they place in them the <hi>[8]</hi> Eagle-stone, and the Stork the Lamp-stone, both being to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

An Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant's Keeper in a private House in <hi>Syria,</hi> being used to rob him of half his Provender, he discover'd it thus: his Master feeding him one time himself, and giving him his whole quantity, the Elephant looking sternly on his Master, divided it in two parts with his Trunk. Another having a Keeper, who to increase the measure of his Provender, was used to mingle Stones with it, came one day to the Pot wherein his Keeper's Meat was seething, and filled it with Ashes. By all which we may justly conclude, that there is more difference in Understanding found between some men and others, than between some men and this Beast. We find mention of three sorts of Elephants, namely, of Marishes, of Mountains, and of Fields: They that are born and bred in Marishes, have more agility, but less wit; the Mountainers are wicked and trayterous; they of the <hi>Champain</hi> Countrey, are easilyest tamed, and most apt to learn; the Elephants of the <hi>Indies</hi> are the fiercest of all others, and very hard to tame; they of <hi>Lybia</hi> are the least, which cannot abide the smell nor voice of man, and fly away before the Elephants of <hi>India,</hi> as appear'd in that memorable Battel fought between the Kings <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> near to <hi>Raphi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When they come to the Sheep-folds, they observe which way the Wind bloweth, and then come marching against it, that thereby they may the better deceive the Shepherd and his Dogs. When they prey upon Goats, they hide themselves under the Leaves of Trees, that they may the more easily obtain their desires. And when they catch little Children, it is said, they will play with them for a while, (as a Cat plays with a Mouse) and at last devour them. The great cunning of this Creature appears by a Tradition they have in <hi>Ireland</hi> of a foot-Traveller; who having a Gun upon his Shoulder, and passing through a Wood, was assaulted by a Wolf, who no sooner observed his Gun, but presently quitted him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the man being gone a
mile or two from the place, far enough as he thought out of the Wolfe's reach, and meeting a Passenger, who was going the same way as he had come, he told him of the Wolf he had met, and lent him his Gun to defend himself; now being come where the Wolf was, and he spying the same Gun, immediately pursued the first Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, whom he overtook, and being then unarm'd, tore him in pieces: which must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his knowledge of the Gun, as well as from his observation, that the other must be therefore unarm'd. <hi>Pliny</hi> (lib. 8. ch. 22.) and from him <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> write, that <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> bring forth small Wolves, in respect of those which are in the Northern Parts of the World; for as the Elephant detests cold, so does the Wolf heat: therefore in those cold Countreys of <hi>Suetia</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> you may see whole herds of white Wolves upon the Mountains. <hi>Olaus Mag.</hi> lib. 18.

Some say, that if the Heart of a Wolf be kept dry, it will render a most fragrant smell; also in the Bladder of a Wolf is a certain Stone of a Saffron or Honey colour, which inwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth (as it were) certain weak shining Stars. The Ravens are in a perpetual enmity with Wolves, and the antipathy of their Natures is so violent, that if a Raven eat of the Carkass of a Beast, which the Wolf hath either kill'd or tasted of, she presently dieth. Wolves have no society but with Beasts of their own kind: and above all Creatures, they and Dogs are most subject to Madness, because their Bodies are cholerick, and their Brains increase or decrease with the Moon. Their manner of taking Fowl is by looking stedfastly on them, the piercing power of their Eye being such, as the Fowl will nod till he falls off from the Tree into his Mouth. As for seizing of Men or Beasts, they seldom fasten before,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98416:104"/>
but surrounding them, several times force them either to fall down with giddiness, or to give them an opportunity of seizing on them behind. Likewise 'tis reported, that when a Wolf thinks himself not able to set upon a Traveller singly, he will make such a hideous howling, that his Companions will presently come in to his assistance.

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Whether that be true which some speak concerning the breeding of Vipers: Hence that Iambick of <hi>Euripides, That the Children of all men are their very Soul,</hi> alter'd by <hi>Philostratus</hi> into this sentence, <hi>That the young ones of all living Creatures are their very Soul:</hi> Likewise the Reason why the least Elephants are the Guides in passing over Rivers: What <hi>Juba</hi> wrote concerning them: Then concerning the River its pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage and breadth.</head>
               <p>LEt us not assent (O <hi>Damis</hi>) to that foolish Story, which saith, that <hi>[1]</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are bred without a Dam; which neither Nature doth admit of, nor Experience justifie. Whereunto <hi>Damis</hi> reply'd, Will you then give me leave to <hi>[2]</hi> commend <hi>Euripides</hi> for that Iambick, where he bringeth in <hi>Andromacha</hi> speaking thus:
<q>
                     <l>The Children of all men are their Soul?</l>
                     <bibl>

                     </bibl>
                  </q>
I grant it, said <hi>Apollonius;</hi> for it seemeth to be wisely and divinely spoken: but he had spoken more wisely and truely, if he had extended that saying to all living Creatures. You seem then (said <hi>Damis</hi>) willing to have the Verse express'd in this manner:
<q>The young ones of all living Creatures are their Soul.</q>
Herein I assent unto you; for it is better. But (said he) did we not in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Discourse say of Elephants, that there is a Wisdom and Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what they do? We said so indeed, reply'd <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and 'tis very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for did not a <hi>Mind</hi> govern this Animal, neither would he be produced, nor the Nations themselves exist, where these Creatures are bred. Why then, said <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> do they swim over so foolishly to so little advantage to themselves? for the least of all (as you see) leadeth the way, and he that is somewhat bigger followeth him, after him another, and the greatest of all last; whereas it seemeth requisite that they should observe a contrary order, that the biggest should be made as it were the Ramparts and Bulwarks of the rest. But <hi>Damis,</hi> said he, first they seem to fly the pursuit of men, whom we shall meet following them by the print of their feet; wherefore it is very necessary that the Rear should be well guarded, as we see is the custom in War: and you must imagine this Creature to be the greatest observer of Tacticks of all Beasts. Besides, should the biggest of them swim over first, their passing over would be no sign to judge by of the depth of the Water, whether all of them could be able to do the like; for perhaps they might easily pass through as being taller, whereas these could not possibly do so, as being unable to overcome the depth of the Water: but after the least of them hath passed, it is evident there is an easie passage for the rest. Moreover, should the biggest go before, they would make the Channel deeper for the less, the mud yielding and making Ditches with the very weight and greatness of their feet; whereas the lesser are no whit prejudicial to the passage of the bigger, in that they make a less Cavity in the River. Furthermore, I have found in the Writings of <hi>Juba,</hi> how the Elephants help one another in their being hunted, and defend him that fainteth; when if they bring him off, they

                  <p>Secondly, For the Cause of the <hi>Nile</hi>'s Inundation, there are various Opinions, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reasons given: <hi>Diodorus, Seneca, Strabo,</hi> and others, upon good grounds believed, that the Inundation of <hi>Nilus</hi> proceeded from the Rains in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and the mighty source of Waters falling towards the Fountains thereof. For this Inundation unto the <hi>Egyptians</hi> happeneth, when it is Winter with the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> where, although they have no cold Winter, (the Sun being no farther removed from them in <hi>Cancer,</hi> than to us in <hi>Taurus</hi>) yet is the fervour of the Air so well remitted a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Theory of the Ancients is likewise since con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by Experience of the Moderns, as <hi>Franciscus Alvarez; Antonius Ferdinandus,</hi> and others; and is undoubtedly the most rational account that is given thereof. That the Cause of the Increase of <hi>Nilus</hi> was the melting of the Snow, and fleeting thereof from the tops of the Mountains of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> was the opinion not only of <hi>Auaxagora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this opinion, as I conceive, is very improbable, for that the heat of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate will not so easily admit of Snow, as Rain; as <hi>Philostratus</hi> well observes in the ensuing Chapter; at least of so vast a quantity, as would be sufficient to produce so great an Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: Therefore <hi>Lucan</hi> with good Reason calls it a vain opinion:

For the Increase and Inundation of <hi>Nile,</hi> beginning at the Summer Solstice, and this River running directly from South to North, from one Tropick to another, which is just the middle part of the Earth, when it comes to incline its Axis, and return the Antarctick part to the Sun, the Stream of this River, which is contrary to that motion, waxes slower; and being moreover augmented, by the continual Rains of Summer that descend from <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> swells and overflows the Plains of <hi>Egypt:</hi> which made many of the Ancients ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the <hi>Etesian</hi> Winds blew against the Stream at that time, and forced the Water back upon themselves. But <hi>Scaliger</hi> rejects this as a childish opinion. <hi>Democritus</hi> thought, that the <hi>Etesian</hi> Winds blowing the Snow from the North parts of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> occasion'd this Increase of the <hi>Nile. Herodotus</hi> (as we find in <hi>Diodorus</hi>) imputed it to the very nature of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98416:107"/>
the River, which as it sunk in the Winter, when the Sun went away into <hi>Lybia,</hi> so did it rise again in the Summer at the Sun's return. <hi>Ephorus</hi> saith, it was the Sweat of the Land, which evaporating with the heat of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>; wherein perhaps a larger speech were safer, than that which punctually prefixeth a day certain: for this expression is different from the Ancients, as <hi>Herodotus, Diodorus, Seneca,</hi> &amp;c. who deliver only, that it happeneth about the entrance of the Sun into <hi>Cancer</hi>; wherein they warily express themselves, and reserve a reasonable Latitude. Again, Were the day definitive herein, it had prevented the delusion of the Devil, nor could he have gained applause by its prediction; who notwithstanding (as <hi>Athanasius</hi> in the Life of <hi>Anthony</hi> relateth) to magnifie his knowledge in things to come, when he perceiv'd the Rains to fall in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> would presage unto the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the day of its Inundation. And this would also render useless that natural Experiment observed in Earth or Sand about the River, by the weight whereof, (as Mr. <hi>George Sandyes</hi> the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, <hi>Alpinus</hi> a Physician, <hi>Marchitus</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Consul, <hi>Elianus</hi> a Jesuit, <hi>Varrat</hi> an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman,</hi> and others report) they have unto this day a knowledge of its Increase. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the effects of this Inundation cannot be prognosticable with the same certainty as Eclipses, for that it totally depends upon the Clouds, and descent of Showers in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which having their generation from uncertain vapourous Exhalations, must submit their existence to contingencies, and endure Anticipation or recession from the moveable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Causes: Therefore (as many conceive) there have been some years without any Increase at all, as the years of Famine under <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the like, as <hi>Seneca,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers relate of the 11th. year of <hi>Cleopatra</hi>; not nine years together, as is testify'd by <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes.</hi> Some years it hath also retarded, and came far later than usually it was expected, as according to <hi>Sozomen</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> it happen'd in the days of <hi>Theodosius</hi>; whereat the people were ready to mutiny, because they might not sacrifice to the River, according to the custom of their Predecessors.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98416:108"/>
that lyes above it, is not cover'd with Snow. Besides I know, that God hath set the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians</hi> as the utmost Horns of the Earth, and made both swarthy, the one at the Eastern, the other at the Western part of the World; which could not be, unless they were both warm in the Winter: and if the Sun be hot there all the year, how is it possible that Snow should breed there? or that it should be in so vast a quantity, as when they melt, to cause so great Rivers to overflow? And if the Snow should descend into places so exposed to the Sun, how it should be spread into so great a Sea? or how it should suffice for a River to overflow all <hi>Egypt?</hi> In their passage over <hi>Indus</hi> they say, that they met with many <hi>[3]</hi> Sea-horses, and many <hi>[4]</hi> Crocodiles, like them that swim in <hi>Nilus.</hi> They likewise relate, that such Flowers grow about <hi>Indus,</hi> as about <hi>Nilus;</hi> and that the Seasons of the year are in <hi>India</hi> warm at Winter, but at Summer stifling: nevertheless they say, that God hath well provided against this, by causing much Rain to fall there. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more they report, that they have heard the <hi>Indians</hi> say, that the King (when the Seasons of the year call him to it) goeth to the River, and offereth up Horses and black Bulls to it in Sacrifice: for the <hi>Indians</hi> prefer the black colour before the white<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by reason (as I suppose) of their own Complexion. After the Sacrifice is ended, they say, the King sinketh a <hi>[6]</hi> golden Measure (like to that wherein they measure Corn) into the River, and that the <hi>Indians</hi> do not certainly know for what end this is done: but they suppose that the Measure is so sunk, either for the plenty of those Fruits which Husbandmen measure with it, or for the moderation of the River, that it might not too much overflow the Countrey. Now having passed the River, the Guide whom the Governour had given them, led them the direct way to <hi>Taxilla,</hi> where the King's Palace is. Moreover they report, that the men which dwell by the River <hi>Indus,</hi> are cloath'd with Linen of that Countrey, and Shoes made of the Bark of Trees, also a kind of Hat against the Rain. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of greater quality go clad in <hi>[7]</hi> Silk, which they report, groweth on Trees, like a white Asp for growth, and Leaves like those of the Sallow. <hi>Apollonius</hi> said, he was pleas'd with the Silk, in that it resembled the duskish Philosophical <hi>[8] Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium:</hi> this Silk, they say, is brought out of <hi>India</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> for many of their sacred Rites. As for <hi>Taxilla,</hi> they say, it is for bigness to be compared with the old <hi>Ninus,</hi> and walled proportionably, as the rest of the <hi>Greek</hi> Cities are: it was the Royal Seat of <hi>Mander,</hi> who govern'd that <hi>[9]</hi> Kingdom, which was formerly ruled by <hi>Porus.</hi> Before the Walls they saw a Temple erected, about an hundred feet high, of<note n="*" place="margin">Or Shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</note> purple-colour'd Stone, wherein stood a Chappel, though less than a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet so large, and so beset with Pillars, that it was worthy of admiration. There were several brazen Tables hanging on the Walls, whereon were written the <hi>[10]</hi> Deeds of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Porus.</hi> Their Acts were engraven on Copper, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Gold, and black Brass, together with Elephants, Horses, Souldiers, Helmets, and Shields. But the Lances, Darts, and Swords, were all made of Iron; and so artificially engraved, as if it were the Work of <hi>[11] Zeuxie, [12] Polygnotus,</hi> or <hi>[13] Euphranor,</hi> who were able to express the shadows, breath, descents, and ascents of things: so they say it appear'd there, the several matters being inserted into the Pictures instead of Colours. Nor was it an unpleasant sight, to discover the King's disposition by the Picture. For <hi>Porus</hi> set up the said Table in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, after the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> though <hi>Alexander</hi> be therein described as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and restoring <hi>Porus,</hi> whom he had wounded in Fight, and conferring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Region of <hi>India</hi> as his own. Furthermore it is reported, that <hi>Porus</hi> wept and lamented at the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as being a brave and generous Prince. Likewise, after <hi>Alexander</hi> was departed out of <hi>India, Porus</hi> never spake any thing

as a King, though <hi>Alexander</hi> permitted it; nor did he rule the <hi>Indians</hi> as a King, but as a Deputy; doing and speaking all things very modestly to the honour of <hi>Alexander.</hi> I cannot in reason here omit what is related of <hi>Porus:</hi> for upon the entrance of <hi>Alexander</hi> into <hi>India,</hi> when some of <hi>Porus</hi>'s Friends advised him to make a defensive League wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Such an one Historians report <hi>Porus</hi> to have been; also, that he was the most lovely man of all the <hi>Indians,</hi> and of so large a stature, as no man had been since the <hi>[15] Trojan</hi> Worthies; likewise, that he was very young when he fought with <hi>Alexander.</hi>

There is little difference between the matter of Snow, and the matter of Rain and Hail; excepting (as some think) that the vapour for Snow is of an hotter quality than the vapour for Rain, and yet not so hot as that which is the material cause of Hail. For it is a Tenet among Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, that hot things being cool'd are apter for Congelation than cold; as is seen in warm Water taken from the fire, which will more suddenly and thorowly be frozen, than that which never felt the heat. And this comes to pass, in regard of the pores or passages made into the Water through Heat, into which the Cold entring, it both cooleth it sooner, and congealeth it the more. Neither is there any difference between white Frost and Snow; excepting that Frost is made of a Vapour before it be turn'd into a Cloud; and Snow of a Cloud before it be turn'd into Water.</p>

His Eggs are like unto Goose Eggs, but the young which cometh of them taketh increase to 16 or 18 cubits in length. Strange it is (if true) that they tell, of the number of 60 in this Beast; as that his Age is 60 years, his Teeth 60. his Eggs and days of Hatching 160. his Back is hard, and full of Scales; his Teeth exceeding sharp, whereof two be far more terrible than the other, and much longer. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that Crocodiles have no Tongues; but Experience proves this to be false, for their Tongues are very short, flat, and broad; his Eyes are said to be very dull in the Water, but marvellous quick-sighted when he is out of it, his Tayl extends it self to a great length; his Bitings are so sharp and cruel, that they can never be heal'd; his Feet are short, but Claws or Nails very sharp, wherewith he helps to catch and dis-member either Man or Beast, which he can lay hold on: nevertheless it is said, that he flyes from those that persecute him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutes those that fly him. <hi>Aelian</hi> (Var.

               <p>WHilst they stay'd in the Temple, which was some time, till the King was made acquainted with their coming, <hi>Apollonius</hi> turning himself to <hi>Damis</hi> said, Do you think that there is any Art of Painting? Yes, said <hi>Damis,</hi> if there be any truth of the things themselves. But what doth this Art perform, said <hi>Apollonius? Damis</hi> answer'd, It mixeth Colours together, as blew with green, white with black, and red with pale. Whereto <hi>Apollonius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, For what end doth it mingle these Colours, since it is not meerly for Shew? Yes, said <hi>Damis,</hi> it is done for Imitation's sake, as to resemble a Dog, a Horse, a Ship, a Man, or any other thing that the Sun shine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> on: it also setteth forth the resemblance of the Sun himself; sometimes as if he rode on a Chariot drawn with four Horses, as 'tis said he is to be seen in this place; sometimes again as bearing a Torch in the Heavens, when he describeth the very Sky and House of the Gods: wherefore, Oh <hi>Damis,</hi> Painting is a certain Art of Imitation, said <hi>Apollonius.</hi> Whereto <hi>Damis</hi> answer'd, It is nothing else; for if Painting cannot perform this, it will seem very ridiculous, as making Colours to no purpose. Then said <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> What will you say to those things which are used to appear upon the separating of Clouds, as <hi>Centaurs,</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">A mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Goat and Hart.</note> 
                  <hi>Hirco-cervi,</hi> nay even Wolves and Horses? Are not these wrought by some Art of Imitation? To me it seeems so, said <hi>Damis.</hi> Then will God himself be a Painter, answer'd <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and leaving his winged Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot whereon he rideth, and ordereth divine and humane things, he will sit a sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and painting these things, as Children make Shapes in the dust.

blush'd, his Discourse appearing to conclude in such an Absurdity. But <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> not casting any Contempt upon him, (for he was not bitter in reproving) said to him, I suppose <hi>Damis</hi> you intended not to speak any such thing; only that for as much as concerneth the Deity, those many things are carried up and down through the Air casually, and without any intended resemblance, but that we, who natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have in us the principle of Imitation, do frame and devise such Forms. Let us therefore, Oh <hi>Apollonius,</hi> rather believe it to be so, said <hi>Damis,</hi> for this is the best and most likely opinion. Whereto <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, There is a two-fold Art of Imitation: one whereof doth with the Hand and Mind imitate whatsoever it pleaseth, and this is the Art of Painting; the other doth with the Mind alone frame Similitudes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not two-fold, said <hi>Damis;</hi> but that there is a more perfect sort of Painting, which both with Mind and Hand doth express the Similitudes of things: and that the other is but a part of the same, since by it a man can only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and imitate with the Mind, being not skill'd in Painting, nor able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press things by his Hands. Is it, said <hi>Apollonius,</hi> because his Hand hath been maim'd with some Blow or Distemper? No verily, answer'd <hi>Damis,</hi> but because he never used to handle a Pencil, or other such Instrument, or Colours, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skill'd in the Art of Limning. In this therefore, said <hi>Apollonius,</hi> we both agree, that the faculty of Imitating proceedeth from Nature, but that of Painting, from Art: the same thing may also be said of Carving and Moulding. But you seem to imagine, that a Picture it self consisteth not of bare Colours, in as much as the old Painters were contented with one Colour, whereas the modern have used four, and so by degrees a greater number. Moreover, they sometimes Limn with meer Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and without Colours, which kind of Pictures we ought to say consist only of Shade and Light; for in them the similitude of things appeareth, the Form, Mind, Modesty, and Boldness, although such things have no Colours. And however they express not the Bloud, the colour of the Hair, nor the Down on the Chin, yet do they with one simple kind of Draught represent the similitude of a tawny or white man. Nay, if we describe an <hi>Indian</hi> in this manner, with white Lineaments, yet will he be conceiv'd as swarthy: for the flatness of the Nose, erected Curles, flaggy Cheeks, and Stupor, (as it were) about the Eyes, do blacken the Picture, and to them that view it without judgment, demonstrate the person to be an <hi>Indian.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without any absurdity I may aver, that they who behold Pictures, have also need of the Imitative faculty; for none can rightly commend a painted Horse or Bull, but he that beholdeth those Creatures in his Mind, whose likeness is presented in Picture. Neither indeed can any man judiciously view the <hi>[1] Ajax</hi> of <hi>[2] Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momachus,</hi> represented in his mad Fits, unless a man conceive in his Mind some Idea of <hi>Ajax,</hi> and how having slain Sheep and Oxen at <hi>Troy</hi> in his rage, he sate down by himself very pensive, consulting how to make away with himself. But now these curious Works which were made at the Command of <hi>Porus,</hi> are not only the Work of Graving, for they are like to Pictures; nor on the contrary, the Work of Painting only, in that they be made of Brass: but they were wrought by the same man, who was skill'd both in Painting and Graving, such as <hi>[3] Vulcan</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in <hi>[4] Homer,</hi> where he describeth the making of <hi>Achille</hi>'s Arms; for there every place is full of such as kill and are killed, and you would say, that it were the very Earth colour'd with bloud, though it be made of Brass.</p>

                  <p>Now for the Writings of <hi>Homer,</hi> and those Censures that pass'd upon him, 'tis well known to all men, that he never wrote any thing (at least that is now extant) but Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: He wrote in 24 Books the Wars of <hi>Troy,</hi> which he calls his <hi>Iliads</hi>; and in as many more the Travels of <hi>Vlysses,</hi> which he names his <hi>Odysses.</hi> It was (saith <hi>Aelian</hi>) long after <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> first brought <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poetry into <hi>Greece</hi> from <hi>Ionia,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he travell'd; nevertheless <hi>Plutarch (Vitâ Lycurgi)</hi> affirms, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> himself first brought them to light amongst men. They were digested into that order we now have them, not by himself, but by other men, and (as <hi>Suidas</hi> and <hi>Aelian</hi> report) chiefly by <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistratus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Tyrant: for he wrote sundry Poems scatter'd here and there in the Countreys where he travell'd, which may be one reason why so many Countreys should challenge him to be theirs, they having the original Copies of some of his Works, which in succeeding Times were gather'd together to make up compleat Poesies, and were called from hence <hi>Rapsodia.</hi> Two of these Poems are observed to comprehend the two parts of man: the <hi>Iliads</hi> describing the strength and vigor of the Body; as doth the <hi>Odysses,</hi> the subtilty and policy of the Mind: by the one, he first represented Tragedy; by the other, Comedy. The particular Subjects of the several Books, as well of his <hi>Iliads</hi> as <hi>Odysses,</hi> I had design'd to have given you a Compendium of, but find Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> has anticipated me therein, by his <hi>English</hi> Translation of <hi>Homer,</hi> therefore shall only give you the Judgements that some of the best Authors, as well ancient as modern, have passed upon him, and so conclude.</p>
                  <p>That the Poems of <hi>Homer</hi> were highly esteem'd of by the Ancients, is evident from all their Writings: <hi>Aelian</hi> (lib. 13. ch. 14.) tells us, that the Ancients sung the Verses of <hi>Homer,</hi> divided into several parts, to which they attributed particular Names; as the Fight at the Ships, the <hi>Dolonia,</hi> the Victory of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and the Catalogue of the Ships. Moreover, the <hi>Patroclea,</hi> and the <hi>Lystra,</hi> (or redemption of <hi>Hector</hi>'s Body) the Games in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted for <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and the breach for Vows; comprehended in his <hi>Iliads.</hi> Now as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Odysses</hi>; the Actions at <hi>Pytus,</hi> the Actions at <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> the Cave of <hi>Calypso,</hi> the Boat, the Discourses of <hi>Alcinous,</hi> the <hi>Cyclopias,</hi> the <hi>Neucia,</hi> and the Washings of <hi>Circe,</hi> the Death of the Woers, the Actions in the Field, and concerning <hi>Laertes.</hi> The same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (<hi>lib.</hi> 12. <hi>ch.</hi> 48.) also writes, that the <hi>Indians</hi> sing the Verses of <hi>Homer</hi> translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Language, and not only they but likewise the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings. Morever, (<hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>ch.</hi> 15.) he says, that the <hi>Argives</hi> give the first Palm of all Poetry to <hi>Homer,</hi> making all other second to him; and at all their Sacrifices invoked <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> to be present with them. Nay, <hi>Pindar</hi> affirms, that when unable to give a Portion with their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they bestow'd on her some of his Poems. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> used to strike that Schoolmaster on the Ear, who wanted <hi>Homer</hi> in his School; as if a man should find a Fanatick's Study without any of <hi>Hildersham</hi>'s, <hi>Dodd</hi>'s, <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, <hi>Owen</hi>'s, or <hi>Vincent</hi>'s Books in it. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great having taken that vastly rich Cabinet from <hi>Darius,</hi> could find out no better use for it, than to make it a Repository for <hi>Homer</hi>'s Works, which he carried with him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went. <hi>Arcesilaus</hi> could never take his rest at night, till he had read some portion of <hi>Homer</hi>; and so soon as he was up in the morning, he used to say, <hi>Se ad Amasium ire,</hi> meaning, that he was going to his beloved <hi>Homer. Aelian</hi> writes, that <hi>Plato</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

studied Poetry, when having composed certain heroick Poems, he compared and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined them by <hi>Homer</hi>'s, but finding them far short of his, he tore them in pieces. <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Ione</hi> calleth him, <hi>Poetarum omnium praestantissimum &amp; divinissimum</hi>

Also <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, That <hi>Homer</hi> of all other Poets doth excel, using such discretion in his Speeches, that at one and the same time he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the evil, and recommends the good. <hi>Lucian (in Encom. Demosth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> affirmeth, all Poets celebrated <hi>Homer</hi>'s Birth-day, and sacrificed to him the first Fruits of their Verses. <hi>Cicero</hi> speaking of him saith, <hi>Homero nemo similis.</hi> And <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> (lib. 1 ch. 5.) calls him, that most bright and matchless Wit, who both for the greatness of his Work, and perspicuity of his Verses, did alone deserve the Name of Poet, in whom this is most glorious, <hi>Quod neque ante illum, quem ille imitaretur, neque post illum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> qui eum imitari possit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inventus est. Cleomenes</hi> (as both <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Aelian</hi> write) used to say, that <hi>Homer</hi> was the Poet, of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> declaring how men should fight; but <hi>Hesiod</hi> of the Slaves, instructing men how to till the Ground. <hi>Pliny</hi> (lib. 25.) calls <hi>Homer</hi> the Father and Prince of all Learning and learned men, as well as the best Author extant for Antiquity. Likewise <hi>Pliny</hi> (lib. 7. ch. 21.) tells us out of <hi>Cicero,</hi> that the whole <hi>Iliads</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> were written in a Parchment so small, that it might be contain'd in a Nut-shell.

In fine, <hi>Homer</hi> has been (if I may so say) the first Founder of all Arts and Sciences, as well as the Pattern of wise men in all Ages. And as he has been in some measure the Author of Paganism, the Religion whereof he establish'd by his Poems, one may say, that never Prophet had so many Followers as he: yet notwithstanding, this so universal Genius, this Wit so capable of all things, he applied himself only to Poetry, which he made his business. <hi>Homer</hi> is the most perfect Model of the heroick Poesie, and he only saith Aristotle, <hi>deserves the Name of Poet</hi>; 'tis certain, never man had a more happy Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us; he is the first Copy a Poet should propose to himself, that means to write well: for never person wrote more purely nor natural than he; 'tis he alone that ever found the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of joyning to the purity of Style, all the sublimity and greatness that heroick Poesy is capable of; for which reason, <hi>Longinus</hi> always proposes him as the most just and exact Rule for the sublime Style.

                        </gap>ertes</hi>'s Swineherd's Lodge, in his <hi>Odysses. Homer</hi> was never guilty either of Obscenity or Impiety, but sweet and vertuous as a Philosopher: he begets in his Readers a veneration for Piety, and an abhorrence for Vice, when he makes them esteem <hi>Achilles,</hi> and contemn <hi>Therfites. Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> are the only two Poets that ever knew how to leave a thing when 'twas well, without being hurried by their Poetical fury beyond the mark of Judgement. Now as each regular Poem must consist of Truth and Fiction; so is Truth the foundation, and Fiction the accomplishment of all <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poems: Thus the Fable of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s <hi>Iliad</hi> is the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> who by his presence or absence from the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army, (<hi>Almanxor</hi>-like) determines the good or ill success of his whole Party; the Anger of this Prince, which proceeds of the discontent he receiv'd from <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> is the Truth of the History, which is adorn'd with all the Episodes, and variety of Adventures, that enrich this Poem, and give delight; which he could never do, if he had nothing to say but Truth. Again, As the Painter draws Faces by their Features; so must the Poet represent the Minds of men by their Manners: And thus we see he makes <hi>Achilles</hi> retire from the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army, to shew his discontent; also the Silence of <hi>Ajax</hi> in Hell, (<hi>lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Odyss.</hi>) declares some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more noble and glorious, than all he could have said. <hi>Homer</hi> hath excell'd all others in the pleasant Numbers of his Verse; whether the nature of his Language was favourable to him; by the variety in the Numbers, and by the noble sound of the Words; or that the delicacy of his Ear made him perceive this Grace, whereof the other Poets were not sensible. <hi>Athenaeus</hi> pretends, that nothing is more proper to be sung than the Verses of <hi>Homer</hi>; so natural is the Harmony of them: <hi>Virgil</hi> himself could not imitate him herein, by reason of the harshness of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue. He above all others makes the deepest impression upon the Heart; <hi>Homer</hi> animates, and <hi>Virgil</hi> heats, in comparison of whom all the rest do (as it were) freeze their Auditors. Another Excellency of <hi>Homer</hi>'s is, that in the vast throng of Objects which he represents, he is never guilty of the least confusion; never was Poem more charged with Matter than his <hi>Iliad,</hi> yet never any thing appear'd more regular, easie, and natural. How artificial, unconstrain'd, and delightful, are all his Narrations? <hi>Homer,</hi> great Speaker as he is, amuses not himself (saith <hi>Lucian</hi>) to discourse of the unhappy in Hell, when <hi>Vlysses</hi> descended thither; though this was a fair occasion for him. How just and reasonable are all his Encomiums? He praises not <hi>Achilles,</hi> but by the simple and bare narration of his Actions. And lastly, With what wonderful Art and Cunning doth he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive his Fictions, taking from the most common and mean Subjects, a Character of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sublimity? Thus, from <hi>Thetis</hi>'s prostrating her self at <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Feet, the Gods assemble in Council, where great Debates arise, their Spirits grow warm, and all Heaven

Yet notwithstanding all this that hath been said, some Exceptions have been rais'd against him; <hi>ex. gr.</hi> that by the Fable of his <hi>Iliad,</hi> he has disgraced his Countrey, in taking for his <hi>Hero,</hi> a person who occasion'd the destruction of so many gallant Officers, whom he sacrificed to his grief and discontent. That <hi>Homer</hi>'s chief <hi>Hero, Achilles,</hi> is made subject to great weaknesses and imperfections below his Character, when (according to the Pourtraicture <hi>Horace</hi> hath left of him) <hi>Achilles</hi> is a <hi>Bravo,</hi> but withal hasty, impetuous, furious, passionate, violent, unjust, inexorable, a contemner of Laws, and one that places all his Reason in his Sword:

                     </gap> that War has not in the <hi>Iliad</hi> either beginning or end; according to that Verse of the Poets:

                     </q>
But if the principal Subject be the Anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> as is more likely, and as <hi>Homer</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self acknowledges by his Proposition; that Anger has indeed a beginning, but neither end nor middle: for it is thrust out of doors by another animosity of the same person against <hi>Hector,</hi> for the death of <hi>Patroclus</hi>; so as there are two Angers, one upon the loss of his Friend, the other upon the taking away of his Mistress. But the greatest defect is, that the rest of the Poem has no connection with that Anger; and <hi>Homer</hi> during the space of 18 Books, thinks no more of it, as if he had clearly forgot his Proposition and Design; but during that long Interval speaks only of Sieges, Battels, Surprizes, Consultations of the Gods, and all things that relate to the Siege of <hi>Troy</hi>; which made <hi>Horace</hi> (as I said before) think, that the Subject of the <hi>Iliad</hi> was the War of <hi>Troy,</hi> according to the Name it goes under: So that which way soever we look on that Poem, it will in that part appear defective: Neither is the <hi>Odyssey</hi> an Action more correct than that of the <hi>Iliad:</hi> it begins with the Voyages of <hi>Telemachus,</hi> and ends with those of <hi>Vlysses.</hi> All is made for <hi>Telemachus</hi> in the four first Books; <hi>Menelaus, Nestor,</hi> and the other <hi>Greci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Take them as they are, and one knows not what to make of them. In the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of those Games and Pastimes, which <hi>Achilles</hi> (in the 23d. Book of the <hi>Iliads</hi>) makes upon the death of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> there are abundance of things utterly incredible. Also <hi>Homer</hi> introduces Miracles and Machines without any just occasion: when <hi>Priamus</hi> hath lost <hi>Hector, Iupiter</hi> sends the Goddess <hi>Iris</hi> his Messenger, to caution him to take care of his Son's Body, and redeem it from <hi>Achilles</hi>; as if his Father (who had so great a tenderness for his Son) could not think of it himself, without a Machine to put him in mind that he was a Father? If <hi>Telemachus</hi> in the <hi>Odyssey</hi> go to find out <hi>Vlysses</hi> in the Courts of <hi>Greece,</hi> he cannot stir a foot (forsooth) without the assistance of his Governess <hi>Minerva</hi> to lead him up and down by the Sleeves? Nay, this Machine hath not so much as any appearance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98416:114"/>
in as much as <hi>Minerva</hi> conducts <hi>Telemachus</hi> to seek for <hi>Vlysses</hi> all over <hi>Greece,</hi> save only to the place where he is, which she ought not to have been ignorant of, upon the score of her Divinity, from which nothing should be conceal'd. And yet this is <hi>Homer</hi>'s way to imploy the Gods upon all trifling matters, as so many Porters, without any regard to their rank: thus <hi>Mercury</hi> becomes Coachman to <hi>Priamus,</hi> as well as his Scout. Again, <hi>Homer</hi>'s Episodes are forced. His Kings and Princes speak as scurrilously of one another, as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Plowmen could do: Thus <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in the <hi>Iliad</hi> treats <hi>Chryses</hi> the High-Priest as an extravagant impious person, when he only demands with much respect, nay, and with Presents, his own Daughter, which <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had taken away from him by force. In like manner, the Priest forgetting all Charity, did out of revenge implore <hi>Apollo</hi> to destroy the <hi>Greeks. Vlysses,</hi> whom <hi>Homer</hi> proposes as an exemplar of Wisdom, suffers himself to be made drunk by the <hi>Pheacians</hi>; for which <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Philostratus</hi> condemn the Poet. How extravagant was it in that accomplisht Sage, so soon to forget so vertuous a Wife and Son, for the dalliances of his Prostitute <hi>Calypso,</hi> to run after the famous Sorceress <hi>Circe,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a King as he was, so far to debase himself, as to go to Fifty-cuffs with a rascally Beggar, named <hi>Irus? Priamus,</hi> in the 24th. <hi>Iliad,</hi> does not speak like a Father, when he wishes all his Children dead, so <hi>Hector</hi> were alive again; his grief might have been express'd some other way. How barbarous was the Inhumanity of <hi>Achilles</hi> upon the dead Body of <hi>Hector?</hi> How immodest and undecent was the long though accidental interview between <hi>Vlysses,</hi> and the Daughter of <hi>Alcinous,</hi> in the 6th. of the <hi>Odysseys?</hi> In fine, There is but little obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Decorum in <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poems: Fathers cruel and harsh; Heroes weak and passionate; Gods subject to miseries, unquiet, quarrelsom and mutinous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What can be more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, than the Discourse which <hi>Antilochus</hi>'s Son, <hi>Iliad</hi> 23. makes to his Father's Horses, telling them, His Father <hi>Nestor</hi> will turn them out of his service, or cut their Throats, if they do not do as they should do? Truly a most pathetick Orator to bruit Beasts! The like does <hi>Hector</hi> in another place. How comical is the Entertainment which he gives the Gods at a Comedy, <hi>Odyssey</hi> 8. some of whom he makes Buffoons, by introducing <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> surprized in the Nets laid for them by <hi>Vulcan</hi>? The Battel between <hi>Irus</hi> and <hi>Vlysses,</hi> (<hi>Odyss.</hi> 18.) savours strongly of the <hi>Burlesque</hi> humour; as does also the Character of <hi>Therfitis,</hi> and the wounding of <hi>Venus</hi> in the <hi>Iliad.</hi> How undecent is that comparison of <hi>Homer</hi>'s, of an Ass feeding in a Wheat-field, which the Children would drive out with Poles and Staves, to be compared to <hi>Ajax</hi> in the midst of an Engagement, overwhelm'd with a shower of the Enemies blows, as it is in the <hi>Iliad?</hi> 'Tis but one degree above the filthy expression of a great man in these late Times, who sitting as Commissioner in the Star-chamber, had so mean a conception, that in open Court he was fain to fetch his comparison from a Tinker and his Trull. The Descriptions of <hi>Homer</hi> are too childish, too long, too affected, and too often used: as the description of <hi>Alcinous</hi>'s Garden, in the 7th. and that of the Port of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> in the 13th. of the <hi>Odysseys</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the description of the Port; and that of the <hi>Grotto</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by the Nymphs, which takes up 18 Verses. <hi>Homer</hi> is reprehended even by the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves, for his intemperance and tediousness in Discourse. Neither in his <hi>Iliad</hi> is the unity of Action so perfect as to be without blame, where after the death of <hi>Hector,</hi> which ought to have closed the Action, there are still two Books to come; the 23d. which comprehends the Exercises celebrated for the death of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and which contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the principal Action; and the 24th. which contains the Lamentation of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans,</hi> and the ransoming of <hi>Hector</hi>'s Body, which have no connexion to the principal Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that being compleat without it. Nay, it may further be objected, why a Poem that had no other design but to celebrate the Honour of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> should be closed with that Honour, which is done to <hi>Hector</hi>'s Funeral Solemnities, which was the chiefest of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Was it not a mistake in him, thus to forget the design he proposed?

it but flat and simple Surprizes, cold and heavy Astonishments, with very little of Delicacy. Last of all, Some would likewise make <hi>Homer</hi> seem a <hi>Plagiary; Aristotle</hi> makes mention of a small <hi>Iliad</hi> (attributed by <hi>Suidas</hi> to one <hi>Antimachus</hi>) which was the abridgement of a greater, upon which, some conceive it possible that <hi>Homer</hi> might frame his Work: Besides, we read in <hi>Athenaeus (lib.</hi> 3.) that one <hi>Hegesianax</hi> had wrote in Verse before <hi>Homer,</hi> what had passed at the Siege of <hi>Troy. Cicero</hi> also makes mention of one <hi>Callisthenes,</hi> living in the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that had written upon the same Subject of <hi>Troy</hi>; who, although 'twas some Ages after <hi>Homer,</hi> 'tis to be conceiv'd, had and made use of some other Collections different from those of <hi>Homer.

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Apollonius</hi> is brought to the King of the <hi>Indians:</hi> A Description of the Houses of the City, and of the Temple, whose very Pavement was adorned with Pearls: What Conference passed between <hi>Apollonius</hi> and King <hi>Phraotes:</hi> The King's Modesty, Temperance, and Skill in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue.</head>
               <p>WHilst he is thus busied in Discourse, certain Messengers come from the King, bringing an Interpreter with them, and tell them, that the King had invited <hi>Apollonius</hi> to be his Guest for the <hi>[1]</hi> space of three days, in as much as Strangers might not longer abide in that City: wherefore they conducted <hi>Apollonius</hi> to the Palace. With what Walls the City was encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd, we have before declared. They say, it was evenly and regularly divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Streets, after the <hi>Attick</hi> fashion. And that it was built of such Houses, as if a man look on the outside of them, seem to be of but one Story; whereas if you enter into them, you will find as many Rooms under ground as above. They likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that they saw the Temple of the Sun, wherein the Image of <hi>Ajax</hi> carv'd in Ivory was erected, the Statue of <hi>Alexander</hi> in Gold, and others of <hi>Porus</hi> in black Brass. The Walls of the <hi>[2]</hi> Temple are built of a red Stone, wherewith Gold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing artificially mingled, seemeth to dart out Rays. The Pavement was inlaid with Pearls, in a kind of Checquer-work, which was much used in the Temples of the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> But they say, that in the King's Palace they found no sumptuousness of Building, nor <hi>[3]</hi> Guards, nor Halbardiers; but as in the Houses of the best Citizens, a few Domesticks, and such as desired to discourse with the King, being in number but three or four at most. With which Shew they were far more delighted, than with that pompous one at the Court of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and much more when they were entred in: for the Lodgings, Galleries, and whole Court was under discipline, which was a sufficient argument to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that the <hi>Indian</hi> King was addicted to Philosophy. Wherefore speaking by the Interpreter he said, I am glad (Oh King) to see that you study Philosophy. But I (said the King) am much gladder that you have such an opinion of me. Then answer'd <hi>Apollonius,</hi> saying, Are these things appointed and enjoyn'd by your Laws, or have you your self reduced your Kingdom to this good order? The King replied, Though our Laws be modest, yet I use greater modesty than our Laws enjoyn, and possess more than other men, yet need very little, esteeming the greatest part of my Wealth to belong unto my <hi>[4]</hi> Friends. Happy are you, said <hi>Apollonius,</hi> who enjoy such a Treasure, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring your Friends, from whom so many Benefits ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rue to you, before Silver and Gold. Nay, said the King, I impart my Riches to my very Enemies: for I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage and subdue with <hi>[5]</hi> Money, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> that sometimes infested my Kingdom, making Incursions into my Confines, in so much that I now use them as Guards to defend my Kingdom, for they do not only abstain themselves from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading me, but also hinder other neighbouring <hi>Barbarians</hi> (who are very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) from molesting me. When <hi>Apollonius</hi> asked, Whether <hi>Porus</hi> was used to give Presents to them, the King answered, <hi>Porus</hi> was a lover of War, but I of Peace. With these Speeches he so ravish'd <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that when on a time he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked one <hi>Euphrates</hi> for not studying Philosophy, he said, Let us reverence the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98416:115"/>
                  <hi>Indian Phraotes;</hi> for that was the King's Name. A certain Nobleman, for the many and great Favours he had receiv'd from the King, desired to set a golden Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre adorn'd with several Iewels on his Head; the King made answer, Though I were one of those who are taken with such things, yet would I not admit them now, but in the presence of <hi>Apollonius</hi> throw them from my Head. Yet for as much as I have never heretofore used such Ornaments, how should I now assume them, as not knowing my Guest, and forgetting my self? When <hi>Apollonius</hi> also demanded of him, What kind of Diet he used, his answer was, I drink only so much Wine, as I sacrifice to the Sun; and for the Quarrey which I take in Hunting, others eat it, the exercise it self being enough for me; my Diet is Herbs, with the tops and fruit of Dates, and whatsoever things the River makes my Garden bring forth. I have also many Dishes from these Trees, which with my own hands I dress. As these words <hi>Apollonius</hi> was overjoy'd, often turning his Eyes towards <hi>Damis.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when they had discoursed sufficiently concerning his Iourney to the <hi>Brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> the King commanded the Guide that came from <hi>Babylon</hi> to be entertain'd as his Guest, in such a manner as he was used to receive those that came from thence; but the Guide who was sent by the Governour, was dismissed, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Provision for his Iourney. Then the King himself taking <hi>Apollonius</hi> by the hand, and commanding the Interpreter to depart, asked him, whether he would admit him into his company at Meals? <hi>Apollonius</hi> being amazed hereat, and asking the King, why he did not speak to him thus in the beginning, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, It was that I might not seem over-bold, as not knowing my self, nor that it had pleased Fortune to make me a <hi>Barbarian.</hi> But now being overcome by you, in as much as I perceive you to take delight in me, I could not any longer conceal my self; and how full I am of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, I will manifest to you in many things. But why (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) did not you invite me to a Feast, but had rather be invited by me? Because (said the King) I judge you to be the better man: for Wisdom is a more royal thing than all others. Thus having spoken, he led <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> and the rest of his company to the Bath, wherein he himself was used to wash. The place was an Orchard about the length of a Furlong, in the midst whereof was a Fountain digged, that received into it self certain Springs of cool and potable Water. On either side were places to run in, where the King was used to exercise himself with the Launce and Discus <hi>[6]</hi> after the <hi>Greek</hi> fashion, for his Body was strong, having used such Exercises, and being but <hi>27</hi> years of age. Now when he thought he had exercised himself enough on Land, he was used to leap into the Water, and there exercise himself in Swimming.</p>

Notwithstanding other Countreys have used the like Caution upon other Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as the <hi>Iaponeses,</hi> who denied any admission to the <hi>Christians</hi> for their Religions sake; and the <hi>Turks,</hi> who suffer not any but <hi>Mahometans</hi> to approach within such a distance of <hi>Mecca</hi>; also the <hi>Chineses,</hi> who permit not any Trade with the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> nor at this day with the <hi>English,</hi> by reason of our Alliance with <hi>Portugal.</hi> Nevertheless, be it upon what Motive it will, any such Custom is an infallible impediment to any City's Wealth or Power; as on the contrary, nothing can be more advantagious to a Kingdom, and would be so to this of ours, as to make it a <hi>free Port,</hi> rendring his Majesty a full compensation for the loss of his Customs some other way.

                  <p n="2">[2] <hi>The Walls of the Temple,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Templum</hi> anciently signified only that space or portion of the Heavens, which the <hi>Augur</hi> design'd or marked out with his <hi>Lituus</hi>; after which, it was used to signifie those Buildings we call Churches. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> is of opinion, that the first Original of their Temples was the erecting of an Edifice to the Honour of the deceas'd. Concerning the vastness of some of them, that place is very remarkable of <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Critias,</hi> who sets down <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Temple to be a Furlong in length, and three Acres broad, with the heighth proportionable. The outward parts towards the top of the Buildings were adorn'd with massie Silver, and the Studs or Spokes themselves with Gold. The Roofs within were made of Ivory, Gold, Silver, and (Aurichalcum, or mixt Mettal, like) Copper. As for the Walls, Columes, and Pavements, they were inlaid also with Copper, and in some parts engraved. Besides this there were many other Temples of great renown in the World: such as the most famous Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> whose Riches were inestimable, and whereof no man verst in History can be ignorant: <hi>Iosephus (lib.</hi> 5. <hi>ch.</hi> 14.) saith, that it had several golden Pinacles or Studs, which were therefore made so sharp in the point, that no Bird could rest his foot thereon to defile it. Whereupon a learned Author among the <hi>Papists</hi> makes this Objection, how our Saviour could stand upon them, or St. <hi>Iames</hi> be precipitated from them, unless there were some place behind the said Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles whereon they might stand, which is not yet mentioned by any Author. Another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Temple was that of <hi>Iupiter Capitolinus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Beauty and Riches whereof was so great, that one writing of it says, that the Sun never shined on the like: This did far exceed those Temples mention'd by <hi>Ovid,</hi> when he says,

The ascent of this Temple being an hundred steps. There was likewise another at <hi>Delphos</hi> whither all the Kings of the Earth sent gifts of the most precious things they had: witness <hi>Craesus</hi> King of <hi>Lydia.</hi> That also of <hi>Iupiter Ammon,</hi> whose situation in the Deserts, did not in the least impede the excellency of its composure in Marbles, and other precious Stuffs, with a contribution of all the Princes and People, which sent thither for the maintenance of it; and likewise that of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which all Authors have reckon'd among the seven Wonders of the World; together with many others very much renown'd for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: But never any Temple yet equalized that which <hi>Philostratus</hi> here represents, which makes me a little uncertain of the truth of this Discourse; for we do not find this Temple to be so highly reputed any where but in <hi>Philostratus:</hi> whereas if it were so excellent as 'tis here mention'd to be, methinks it merited some little place of Remark in the Writings of those ingenious men, whose ambition was only to take notice of and observe all the Rarities of the Universe: this being not less worthy of record, than the Sepulchre of <hi>Simandius</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> concerning which they have treated so at large.</p>
                  <p n="3">[3] <hi>In the King's Palace they found no Guards nor Halberdiers.</hi> This is almost as great an Error as a Prince can possibly commit: Not that these Guards are able to protect him against a Rebellion at home, or Invasion from abroad, but that such a splendid Equipage about him dazles the Peoples eyes, as if he were something more than man, and so preserves him from contempt; which certainly is one of the most dangerous Characters a Prince can lye under: for all other kind of Infamy may by way of terror, give an ill Prince not only obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

What havock did they make in the old <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, in so much that the Emperors themselves seem'd to have held their Diadems by no stronger Title, than their Armies good will and pleasure; being not half so arbitrary over their People, as their Militia is over them. In effect, the General of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is the only King, and the person that above all others I should most fear to offend, did I live in such a Government.</p>

A Table is erected in the middle like an Altar about the height of a man's Knees, which is able to contain about thirty men round it, as a Chorus. On the Table Laurels are strew'd, and other Boughs like to a Myrtle, which produce sweet Oyntments for the <hi>Indians</hi> use. Fish and Fowl are set upon the Table, as also whole Lions, Goats, and Boars, with Legs of Tigers; for the <hi>Indians</hi> refuse to feed on the other Ioynts of this living Creature, because it is reported that when he is first born, he lifteth up his fore-feet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He that is bidden riseth up out of his own Seat, and cometh to the Table, where having taken or cut off a piece of that which lyeth on it, returneth to his own Seat, eating ever now and then some Bread with it. When they are almost satisfied with eating, Bowls of Silver and Gold are brought in, each of which may seem sufficient for ten men to drink off, and out of these they stooping down drink as if they were watered at some River. As they are drinking, they introduce some Sports that are hazardous, though full of Skill and Exercise; for a certain Lad like one of those that use to dance on the Stage, suddenly skippeth out into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, whilst an Arrow is shot up on high over his Head; but he in the mean time tumbleth, and as the Arrow is ready to fall on the Earth, shifteth very nimbly out of the way, as knowing that if he mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>'d but a little in his tumbling, the Arrow would fall upon him and pierce him. The Archer before he discharge his Arrow, carrieth it up and down in his Hand, shewing the head thereof to all the Guests, permitting any one that is skill'd to try it. Moreover, they are so expert at Sling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they will hit to an hair. <note n="*" place="margin">In this place the <hi>Greek</hi> is either cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or defective.</note> They will likewise shoot so evenly, and stick their Arrow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These Exercises are practised by the <hi>Indians</hi> at their Feasts, and though they be sometimes drunk, yet will they perform them well enough. When <hi>Damis</hi> and his Companions saw these things, they were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, admiring at their great Dexterity in shooting evenly. But <hi>Apollonius</hi> sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the King, who used the same Diet that he did, gave little regard to these Feats, but said to the King, Tell me (O King) how 'tis you have the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue so ready, and the (<hi>2</hi>) Philosophy that you have about you, how it came here? for I suppose you are not beholden to Masters for it, in as much as 'tis not likely
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98416:118"/>
that there be any Masters of such things amongst the <hi>Indians.</hi> Whereat the King smiling, answer'd, Our Ancestors asked all them that came in Ships to these Parts whether they were Pirates, so common did they think this Vice, though so mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous: But you <hi>Greeks</hi> seem to me to ask them that come to you whether they be Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, as if you thought that this which is the divinest of all things among men, may without distinction be found equally in all men, and I know that this is with you the same thing as Piracy. For they say that there is no man to be met with like to you; but the most of you having spoyled others of their Philosophy, do as it were cloathe themselves with a garment that doth not fit them, and walk haughtily in others Robes: Also as Pirates who know themselves lyable to Iustice live very luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, so in like manner your <hi>[3]</hi> Philosophical Pirates are found to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to Gluttony, Venery, and fine Cloaths. Now I suppose your Laws to be the cause of this evil; for if any man coyns false money he is put to death; or if any man defraud an Orphan, or commit any the like crime; But there is no Law that I can hear of, to restrain the counterfeiters or corrupters of Philosophy, neither is any Ruler appointed over these. Whereas amongst us there are very few that addict themselves to Philosophy, and they are try'd in this manner: The young Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date being <hi>18</hi> years old, (for this I suppose is ripeness of age with you) must come unto those Men near the River <hi>Hyphasis,</hi> for whose sakes you undertook your Iourney into these parts; Before them he must openly profess that he will addict himself to the study of Philosophy, and they have power to prohibit him if he come not pure. And pure I call him; first, in reference to his Father and Mother, if no reproach appear concerning them; and then to their Ancestors to the third Generation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upwards; whether any one of them were an Injurious Person, or Incontinent, or an unjust exacter of Gain: When no blemish, or mark of Infamy is found upon them, then a diligent inspection is to be made into the Young Man himself; and he is to be tryed, first, whether he be of a good Memory, and naturally Modest, not faining himself so to be. Next, whether he be a Drunkard, Glutton, Boaster, lover of Laughter, Railer, or Head-strong; and whether he be Obedient to his Father, Mother, and Teachers; or whether he abuseth his good Feature. And of what Parents every one is born, and who were their Progenitors, is attested by sufficient Witnesses, and Writings, which are upon Publick Record. For when any one of the Indians dyeth, then cometh a certain Magistrate (hereunto by the Laws appointed) to the door of the Deceased, to set down in writing how he liv'd: If any one of which Magistrates is taken telling a Lie, or erring through the Lie of another, by the Laws his Punishment is, that he shall never after bear any Office, as having depraved the Life of a Man. They that are appointed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Youths, collect many things from their Aspect; For the Eyes discover much of Mens Disposition; and much lyeth in the Eye-brows and Visages, whereby Wise Men, and skilful Naturalists behold their Minds and Tempers as Images in a Glass. For in as much as Philosophy is in high Honour amongst the Indians, it is fit that they should be thorowly tryed, who addict Themselves to the study thereof: In what manner therefore Young Men are examined, before they are assign'd to their Masters, hath been sufficiently declared.</p>

And as for Philosophy, if it signifie any thing, (which the uncertainty and contradictions found therein make men doubt) it is fitter to be assign'd for a diversion to private persons, who having little to busie their heads about, might otherwise contrive mischievous devices, if they were not entertain'd in such harmless speculations; which are as necessary a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement for the Men, as Books of Devotion and Needles for the Women: for which reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the setting up Universities is not amiss; although amongst us, who are Islanders, the Art of Navigation were more worth than all the seven Liberal Sciences. Nevertheless, some of the wisest Politicians have thought it the Interest of Princes to discourage and stifle all kinds of Literature whatever, as desiring to keep their Subjects in a tame unthinking Ignorance; and perhaps upon this account it was, that <hi>Ninus</hi> burnt those 14 Pillars, whereon <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for the publick, those who get their Living by some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Art, that is for the most part useful to the publick: as he that knows how to make a Plow or a Cart, is forty times more useful to his Countrey, than he that only knows what is <hi>Latin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Greek,</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi> for a Plow or a Cart: or if in such an Employ he advantages not others, yet each man who thereby maintains himself, doth in so doing increase the number of people without wrong to any; but he who spends his days in Contemplations, which produce no useful or real effects, neither assists the publick nor himself; and if he have no paternal Inheritance to support him, must either starve, beg or steal: nor could any mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Estate suffice to maintain that idle Humour wherewith Philosophers are possess'd, who speculate into all things, but their own most necessary Concerns, and understand every thing better than their own Estates. The most prudent <hi>Scepticks</hi> have sufficiently invalidated those mens Opinions, who spend their time, <hi>Deliri veteris meditantes somnia vana</hi>; or who with <hi>Brutus,</hi> after they have all their Life-time studied the praises of Vertue, (till thereby with a bookish false Idea thereof they have destroy'd their Countrey and themselves) are forced at last when 'tis too late with him to cry out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Think therefore if such men had not better have been Shoomakers, Taylors, or the like; wherefore in this point the Institution of our Universities is exceedingly to be commended, where such as have but little means of their own to trust to, are maintain'd to learn some Profession beneficial to themselves and the publick, as Divinity, Physick, or Civil-Law. However, those whose Fortunes are able to subsist without a Vocation, need not enthral their Genius, but indulge it in any Philology, what they most affect: And for such, if they read History cursorily, it may make them discourse well; but if they study it considerately, it tends much to instruct them in the Humours and Interests of men, thereby teaching them the true Art of managing their Lives and Affairs: when although few Examples square in all particulars, yet (as a skilful Taylor) though he never made a Suit for one of your size, can after taking measure of you, fit you by his old skill.

Last of all, to shew how much disadvantage and danger a State receives by an over-great esteem of Learning, no Age ever gave such a remarkable Example as this wherein we now live, I mean that of <hi>China:</hi> That great and rich Empire was totally govern'd by learned persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> none being admitted to any considerable Office or Magistracy, but such as after a most strict examination of their Learning were made Graduates in their publick Schools of Philosophy; this learned Nation about some five and thirty years ago was invaded by the most illiterate rude <hi>Tartars,</hi> and by them over-run and subdued. Thus were the <hi>Greeks</hi> overcome by the less learned <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire when flourishing in all Arts and Sciences, was destroy'd by the ignorant <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi>: which shews, that to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Empire, a Sword is a better Instrument than a Pen.

Finally, In all Professions it is by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience found, that the Theory and Practice are two distinct Faculties, with little real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence one upon another: Thus many have proceeded Doctors of Musick, who could lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly discourse of Harmony, with the several Keys and Scales of Musick, but not play half so well as any common Countrey-Alehouse-Fidler: so in most contemplative Sciences, <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus Scholae, non Vitae.</hi> Nothing does more betray the Vanity of Philosophy, than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency of man's Reason, which as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, is foolishness before God: for he that thinks he knows any thing, that man knoweth nothing; which made the wise <hi>Socrates</hi> confess, <hi>Hoc scio me scire nihil.</hi> I shall conclude this Discourse with so many lines as are to my purpose, out of a late ingenious Copy of Verses written upon this Subject, by a Person of Honour; which are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For when I beheld their Lives, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they were clean contrary to their own precepts and doctrines; those who taught that Money and Riches were to be contemn'd, did gape after nothing more than Gain, lending to usury, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for hire, and doing all for money; those who in words seem'd most to contemn glory, referr'd all the whole course of their Lives thereto; and finally, those that openly spake most against voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and pleasure, secretly sought and embraced nothing else.</hi> Thus far <hi>Lucian</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. The Narration of King <hi>Phraotes</hi> touching his Parents and himself; namely, how his Father being in his youth cast out of his Kingdom, studied Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy amongst the wise men; and how he himself being instructed by his Father in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, was sent to the same wise men to be taught Philosophy; but after the death of his Father was recall'd by his Father's Friends to the Kingdom.</head>
               <p>AS for my self, this is the History of what hath befallen me. I am descended of a Grandfather who was a King, and of the same Name with me; but my Father was a private man: for being left very young, two of his near kindred were according to the Laws of <hi>India</hi> made his Guardians, and managed the Government for him very tyrannically. Whereupon they appear'd grievous to the Subjects, and the Government was evil spoken of; in so much that many of the Nobility conspiring together against them, did at the great Solemnity when they were sacrificing to the River <hi>Indus,</hi> set upon them, and kill them: when seizing on the Government, they shared it amongst themselves. Wherefore my Father's kinsmen being very solicitous of his safety, when he was not yet <hi>16</hi> years old, sent him to the King that reigneth near the River <hi>Hyphasis;</hi> which Kingdom is far greater than that which I possess, and the Countrey much more pleasant. When the King would have adopted him his Son, my Father refused it, saying, that he was unwilling to strive against Fortune, who had already deprived him of Rule. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he entreated the King to give leave that he might be brought up in Philosophy by the wise men of that Countrey, which would make him the better undergo his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick evils. Now when the King was willing to restore him to his own Kingdom, my Father answer'd, If you perceive me to be a true and genuine Philosopher, you shall restore me; if not, suffer me to continue as I am. When the King heard this, he himself went with him to the wise men, promising to bestow no small Benefits on them, if they used their utmost diligence in educating that Youth who was by nature
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98416:121"/>
so generous. They discerning something more than ordinary in him, very freely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to communicate their Wisdom to him, and readily instructed him, who was as fully intent upon Learning. After <hi>7</hi> years were expired, the King falling sick of a Disease which ended his Life, sendeth for my Father, and maketh him co-partner with his own Son in the Kingdom, giving him his Daughter (then mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riageable) to Wife. But he, when he perceived the King's Son to be overcome by Flatterers, Drinking, and such like Vanities, as also to have a suspicious eye over him, said to him, Take your Estate to your self, and order it how you please; for it is a ridiculous thing, that he who is not able to recover his own Kingdom, should boldly intrude into anothers: grant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> only your Sister, for this alone of all your Estate will satisfie me. Wherefore taking his Wife, he withdrew into those Places that are near to the wise men, wherein he had <hi>7</hi> very pleasant Towns which the King gave to his Sister for her privy Purse. Now I being sprung from this Marriage, and my Father having instructed me in the <hi>Greek</hi> Learning, he brought me to the wise men sooner perhaps than was fitting, (for I was but <hi>12</hi> years old) however, they took me and bred me up as their own Child, for they shew far greater kindness to such as are skill'd in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue before they receive them, in as much as they are more capable of their Instructions. My Parents afterwards dying soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one another, the wise men brought me to my Towns, that I might look to my own Affairs, as being now about <hi>19</hi> years of age. But my good Vncle had by this time taken away the <hi>7</hi> Towns, so that he did not so much as leave me the Fields which my Father had purchased, saying, that they all belong'd to his Kingdom, and that it was a favour he suffer'd me to live. Wherefore having gather'd up a small stock from my Mothers freed men, I lived poorly, having but four Attendants. In this condition as I was reading the Tragedy called <hi>Heraclidae,</hi> there came a Messenger to me from this Place, bringing a Letter from a certain Friend of my Father's, who bade me pass over the River <hi>Hydraotes,</hi> and consult with him about recovering this Kingdom, for there were great hopes for me that I might easily attain it, if I were not wanting to my self. I thinking that some of the Gods had brought that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy into my thoughts, follow'd the Presage. Now when I had cross'd the River, I heard that one of them who had usurped the Kingdom was dead, and that the other was besieg'd in his Palace. Wherefore complying with these things, I came with open mouth in all the Towns wheresoever I pass'd, crying out, that I was the Son of such a one, and that I came to possess my own Government. Whereupon they received me with very great joy, and thinking me to be very like my Grandfather, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me, and accompanied me with Swords and Bows in great numbers, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually increas'd. Wherefore coming to the Gate of the City, those that were here receiv'd me so chearfully, that they lighted Torches at the Altar of the Sun, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with came to the Gates, and conducted me hither, singing praises of my Father and Grandfather. As for that Drone within, they thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">[3] <hi>I would not be wanting to my self,</hi> &amp;c. The main Reason why there are so few gallant Exploits done among men, and how it comes to pass that they suffer such base Oppressions as they do, is for the most part because they are wanting to themselves; that is, they either see not the opportunities they have of helping themselves, or else they want the courage to undertake them: The Reason of the first is, not so much the daily diversion of their minds upon pleasures or other impertinencies, as a meer thoughtlessness and stupidity, wherein we pass most of our time in thinking seriously upon nothing. This perhaps is a great cause of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Quiet, in not observing those Emergencies which more vigilant and hot Heads would lay hold of for turbulent Attempts; and therefore in our Institutions is not censured: but <hi>Mahomet</hi> has by an express Edict prohibited it as a mortal sin; and I am of opinion, that his strict Injunction for such perpetual Meditation and Advertency, is one great cause of the daily growth and progress of his Church and Empire. Yet indeed were I a Prince, especially if I did not exactly govern as the Peoples good required, I should not much fancy my think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjects, lest observing things too narrowly, their thoughts might not be to my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The second way wherein men usually fall, is want of Courage, <hi>Magnis conatibus obstat impunitatis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Yet most certainly it was the great wisdom of God to plant this fear of Death in the heart of man; without which, the poor would rifle the rich, the People would disobey their Governors, and every superstitious Fool would to escape Purgatory, murder whomsoever his Confessor bid him. Now besides these two Deficiencies, men are wanting to themselves in many other Points, but above all in Industry; how many appear in the Streets half naked, and begging for a farthing, when others, as feeble as they, support themselves by Labour; and others who lye tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Diseases, have usually fail'd themselves in point of Temperance, when rather than restrain their Gluttony or Drunkenness, they choose as the easier, to fall a praying:

The Case in brief was thus: This King <hi>Phraotes</hi> his Father came young to the Crown, which being by some great men usurp'd from him, he not long after dying, they still deta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The People are so basely in love with their own ease and safety, as they many times suffer horrid Injuries to be done to their Prince, although he never offended them; but when any hope arises of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, then they are apt enough to assist: Thus when our <hi>Richard</hi> the III. murther'd with his own hand King <hi>Henry</hi> the VI. and caused the two young innocent Princes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd, all was quiet, until the next He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r landed, although with but a handful of men; then People flockt in to him in such numbers, as soon enabled him to overthrow the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; who although in his short Reign had very wisely enacted divers popular Laws, to win the Love of his People, yet all would not suffice; for he being observ'd to be bloudily revengeful and false, it was believ'd, if he was once settled, his good Laws would not have
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98416:122"/>
long prevail'd against his Tyranny: But if instead of those good Laws, he had begun with Violence and Oppression, then infallibly he had not been endured so long, nor found so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to assist him as he did. This plainly appear'd in the case of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who though he was the right lawful Heir, yet because he would not give any way to the Peoples <hi>Petition,</hi> ten parts of twelve fell from him, and God Almighty owned the thing to have been from him; not that God is the Author of Rebellion, but that by the Instinct of Nature which God has planted in all men, there is a desire to live comfortably; when if they perceive all hope of that to be taken from them, and no hopes in obedience, then what courses that despair will drive men into, may easily be foreseen by any who observe the proceedings of uncatechized Nature, which teaches more what men formerly have done, what they do, and what hereafter they will do, than what by the Rules of Duty they should do. When a People is oppress'd by a Prince, they should make use only of their <hi>Preces</hi> and <hi>Lachrymae</hi>; however some are so mutinous as to fly to their Sword, and others so treacherous, as by opposing all <hi>Petitions from the People,</hi> they take away their <hi>Preces,</hi> and leave them only their <hi>Lachrymae.</hi> Now this want of softning and easing the Government was the ruine of these Usurpers, and is the usual Rock upon which most Usurpers split; for their many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and want of Title makes them keep a standing Army, which sooner or later brings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Ruine to the Government: first by their Rapine they make the Prince odious; for all men hate the Master who sets his Dog upon them, more than they do the Dog himself; and then when he is odious to all men, he is totally at the Souldiers mercy: and if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, the usual Method of the old <hi>Pretorian</hi> Bands, was to knock their Emperor on the head, and set the Crown at sale to who will give most, the People all the while looking on with applause. And we who have seen the late Tragedy acted by our Usurpers on the Scene of <hi>England,</hi> do well know, that His Majesty's Restoration and the Usurper's Ruine was (next under God) brought to pass by their own Army under the Command of General <hi>Monck,</hi> who was since for his special Service created Duke of <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>APollonius</hi> hereunto replying, said, You have indeed acted the Return of the <hi>Heraclidae,</hi> and the Gods are to be prais'd for their good will, that they concurr'd to the Voyage of a good man returning to his own. But I entreat you to tell me whether these are the wise men which were with <hi>Alexander,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to him discours'd to him Philosophically concerning the Heavens? The King answer'd, They were the <hi>[1] Oxydracks,</hi> which Nation liveth free, and is trained up to War; moreover they pretend to <hi>[2]</hi> wisdom, but know nothing that is good. The true wise men inhabit in the midst between <hi>Hyphasis</hi> and <hi>Ganges,</hi> into which Parts <hi>Alexander</hi> never came, not that he stood in fear of them, but was (I suppose) prohibited by sacred Presages. For if he had cross'd <hi>Hyphasis,</hi> and been able to seize on the Territories of that People, yet the Tower which they inhabit he could never have taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he brought with him ten thousand <hi>Achilles</hi>'s, and thirty thousand <hi>Ajaxes;</hi> for neither do they fight with those that come against
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98416:123"/>
them, but with prodigious Tempests and Thunderbolts chase away the Enemies, as being themselves accounted sacred and beloved by the Gods. Howbeit they relate, that the <hi>Egyptian Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> who march'd with their Armies through <hi>India,</hi> did both come against that People, and frame all manner of Engines, and attempt the Place; notwithstanding the Citizens seem'd to make no resistance, but to remain unmoved, till the Enemy came close to the Tower, and then <hi>[3]</hi> fiery Tempests beat them back, with Thundrings descending and falling upon their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. At which time <hi>Hercules</hi> is reported to have flung away his golden Buckler, which those wise men did for a Monument hang up in the Temple, as well out of an opinion they had of <hi>Hercules,</hi> as for the Sculpture of the Buckler it self; for <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> was thereon pictured, setting Bounds to the Earth near <hi>Gades,</hi> and erecting Mountains as Pillars to exclude the Ocean: from whence it may manifestly be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, that it was the <hi>Egyptian Hercules,</hi> and not the <hi>Theban</hi> that came to <hi>[4] Gades,</hi> and there prescribed Limits to the Earth. As they were discoursing in this manner, the sound of singing with a Pipe began to be heard. And when <hi>Apollonius</hi> asked what this mirth meant, the King's Answer was, That the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do by such kind of Musick admonish the King when he goeth to Bed, that he have good Dreams, and that he arise kind to and careful of his Subjects. In what manner (said <hi>Apollonius</hi>) are you (O King) affected towards such things, for they play on the Pipe, and sing of you? The King answer'd, I deride not such things; for one must admit of them for the Law's sake, although I stand not in need of any such admonition; for in what a King shall do modestly and kindly, he shall more gratifie himself than his Subjects. Having thus discourst together, both betook themselves to sleep. After the day began to appear, the King came to the Chamber where <hi>Apollonius</hi> and his Companions lay, when having found out his Bed, he saluted the man, and ask'd him what he was musing upon; for I suppose (said he) that you are not now sleeping, in as much as you drink Water and deride Wine. Whereto <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, Do you not think they sleep who drink Water? Yes, said the King, but very gentle sleep, such as we say seizeth only on the Eyes and not on the Mind. Nay, said <hi>Apollonius,</hi> they sleep both with Eyes and Mind, but most perhaps with the Mind; for unless the Mind be quiet the Eyes can take no rest: wherefore mad-men cannot sleep by reason of the continual agitation of their Mind, which leaping from one thing to another, they look somewhat terrible and staring, as sleeping Dragons. Therefore O King, that we may manifestly declare what sleep worketh, and what it signifieth to men, let us enquire what it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the sleep of Water-drinkers to be lighter, than that of drunken persons? I pray you (said the King) do not play the Sophister; for I will grant you if you suppose a man to be drunk, that he sleepeth not, because his Mind being in a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fury causeth him to tumble to and fro, filling him with divers perturbations: for all that go to sleep in a drunken Fit, think that they are one while toss'd up to the roof of the house, another while thrust down to the ground, and whirl'd about in the same manner that <hi>[5] Ixion</hi> is said to be. Wherefore I spake not of such a drunken man, but of one who hath drunk some Wine, but continueth sober, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether such a one will not sleep much better, than he that drinketh no Wine at all. <hi>Apollonius</hi> having heard this, called out to <hi>Damis,</hi> saying, I am dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with an acute man, and one that is very well exercised in disputing. I see it, said <hi>Damis,</hi> and this perhaps is that which is hinted in the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>To fall into Hucksters hands.</hi> And indeed I am much moved with the Reason which he alledged; wherefore it will be time when you are got up to finish this Discourse about Sleep. Thereupon, <hi>Apollonius</hi> having erected his Head a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98416:123"/>
little, said, I will according to your advice now shew what sweeter sleep we take that drink Water, than those that drink Wine. That the Mind of Drunkards is tossed with many perturbations, and vex'd as it were with Furies, I confess was well declared by you; for we see them that are distemper'd with Wine think they behold a double Sun, and double Moon, whereas they that are sober have no such appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, but enjoy great tranquility of mind and delight, though many times they be of mean Fortunes. But on the contrary, drunken persons fall a making Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereas they never pleaded in the Court so much as once, and boast of their Riches, whereas they are not worth a Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>at. These, O King, are frantick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, for meer joy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> wont to transport the mind: as I have seen men, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lighted on good Fortune, are not able to sleep, but suddenly start up; which is a sufficient Argument that even good things afford care and anxiety. There have been also certain Medicines invented to procure Sleep, which if any man drink or anoint himself therewith, they sleep stretching themselves out at length, as if they were dead: afterwards they rise with a certain oblivion, and be rather somewhere else, than where they seem to be. Now that Potions procure to the Body neither proper nor natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l Sleep, but either so profound, that they seem half dead, or else so light, that any the least noise will break it, I suppose you will soon grant, (though they should be good) unless you had rather be obstinate, than a fair Disputant. But those that drink as I do, see all things as they are, nor do they <hi>[6]</hi> fancy or feign to themselves things which are not; nor are they light, or dull and sottish, or more jocund than is meet; but they are steady and rational, being still the same, whether in the morning, or at noon. For such men will never fall asleep, although they do business till it be late at night; neither doth Sleep violently force them as a Master bowing down their Neck enslaved by Wine, but they are always free and erect; and when they betake themselves to sleep with a pure and quiet Soul, they take a gentle Nap, being neither elated with prosperity, nor depress'd with adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for a sober Soul is moderate in both, and not overcome with either perturbation: besides he sleepeth most sweetly and undisturb'd, not startled out of his Sleep. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, a Soul that is not suffocated with Wine, doth more easily discern <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by Dreams,</hi> which is amongst men accounted a most divine thing, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it sincerely, and clearly perceiving it. Wherefore the Interpreters of Visions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom the Poets call <hi>Oneiropolists,</hi> are never wont to interpret any Vision, till they have first enquired the time wherein the man saw it: for if it were early, and of the morning Sleep, they then thought that they might make a good conjecture thereof, in that the Soul was then fitted for Divination, as being dis-encumbred from Wine. But if in the first Sleep, or at midnight, whilst the Soul was as yet suffocated and drown'd in Wine, they being wise, refused to give any Interpretation thereof. Moreover I will briefly demonstrate, that the Gods themselves are of this opinion, and send their Oracles rather unto sober minds. There was heretofore amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> a Prophet call'd <hi>Amphiaraus.</hi> I know it, said the King; for I suppose you mean the Son of <hi>Oecleus,</hi> who returning from <hi>Thebes</hi> was by the Earth swallow'd up alive. This very man (reply'd <hi>Apollonius</hi>) doth even at this time give Oracles in <hi>Attica,</hi> and send Dreams to those that consult his Oracle: but the Priests taking him who doth so consult, keep him one day from Meat, and three days from Wine, that he may in a clear Soul receive the Oracles deliver'd. Now were Wine a fit Medicine for the procuring of Sleep, certainly the wise <hi>[7] Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiaraus</hi> would have commanded those that frequent the doors of his Temple, that having prepared themselves in a contrary manner, they should go into the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary like Vessels fill'd with Wine. I could likewise relate sundry other Oracles very
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98416:124"/>
famous both amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> wherein the <hi>[8]</hi> Priest after he had drunk Water, and not Wine, gave his Answers from the <hi>Tripos:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O King, imagine me and other Water-drinkers to be fitted for reception of the divine Influence, possest by the Water-Nymph, and transported with Sobriety, as the Worshippers of <hi>Bacchus</hi> with their Furies. Whereto the King answer'd, But you shall initiate me into the same Society. So I will, said <hi>Apollonius,</hi> unless you shall seem too troublesome to your Subjects: for Philosophy being profess'd by a King in a moderate and looser way, produceth an admirable Temper, as appeareth in you: but being accurate and strain'd to the utmost, it becometh somewhat irkesome, and below the Character you bear; moreover, envious persons are used to debase it with the imputation of Pride and Arrogancy. Having discours'd in this manner, and it being now broad day, they went forth.</p>

This Character of the wise men among the <hi>Oxydracks,</hi> does not really belong to them alone, but perhaps to most of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn pretenders to Wisdom throughout the whole World. We have all an ambition to be highly esteem'd among men; but this we strain more or less, according as we are more or less vain. Many are so irrational, as to extend it beyond their Life, when they shall never so much as hear of it: one principal way to attain to this high Honour, is by setting up for wonderful skill in some notable Science: Thus some value themselves upon their Natural Philosophy; others upon their Astrology; others upon their Magick; others upon their having read History and Poets, and being thorow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But these contemplative Monsieurs spend their time in waking Dreams, and the imaginary Whimsies of other men, who were no more admitted to the inside of Heaven and Earth than we are. And it is more than probable, that neither they nor we ever understood the business of the heavenly Luminaries, more than the Sparrows do the Statutes and Designs of Parliaments, when they see the Members sitting in the House. Therefore considering the uncertainty of all humane Knowledge, the wisest way to value each kind, is by the profit it brings to Life; and so I reduce it to that Touchstone, which the wise <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> borrow'd from <hi>Ovid</hi> to make a Motto both for his Study and Life: <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derit Vtilitas.</hi> Last of all, to conclude this point, and as a further demonstration how much a submissive Ignorance is to be preferr'd before this pretended Wisdom, the learned <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his ingenious <hi>Moriae encomium,</hi> shews even out of divine Writ it self, that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the Mother of all true Devotion.
<q>It is not (saith he) without ground, that Fools are so acceptable with God: the Reason perhaps may be this, that as Princes carry a suspicious eye upon those that are over-wise, and consequently hate them; as <hi>Caesar</hi> did <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius; Nero, Seneca</hi>; and <hi>Dionysius, Plato</hi>; in like manner Christ ever ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors and condemns (<gap reason="foreign">

Add to this, that in Scripture there is frequent mention of Harts, Hinds, and Lambs; and such as are destined to eternal Life, are call'd Sheep, than which Creature, there is not any thing more foolish; and yet Christ professes to be the Shepherd of this Flock, and is himself delighted with the Name of Lamb; according to St. <hi>Iohn, Behold the Lamb of God!</hi> And what does all this drive at, but that all Mankind are Fools? And Christ himself that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter relieve this Folly, being the Wisdom of the Father, yet in some manner became a Fool, when taking upon him the Nature of Man, he was in shape as a Man; and thus was he made Man, that he might heal Sinners: Nor did he work this Cure any other way, than by the foolishness of the Cross, and a company of <hi>fat Apostles,</hi> not much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; to whom also he carefully recommended Folly, giving them Caution against Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and drawing them together by the Example of little Children; Lillies, Mustard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed, and Sparrows, things sensless and inconsiderable, living only by the Dictates of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and without any Craft or Care. Moreover to the same purpose it is, that that great Architect of the World, God, gave Man an Injunction against his eating of the Tree of Knowledge, as if Knowledge were the bane of Happiness; according to which, St. <hi>Paul</hi> disallows it as puffing up, and destructive. But to speak briefly, All Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (saith he) seems to have a kind of Alliance with Folly, and in no respect to have any accord with Wisdom; of which, if ye expect proofs, consider first, That Boys, old Men, Women and Fools, are more delighted with Religious and sacred things than others, and to that purpose, are ever next the Altars, which they do by meer Impulse of Nature. In the next place, You see that those first Founders of it were plain simple persons, and most bitter Enemies of Learning. Lastly, There are no sort of Fools seem more out of the way, than are these, whom the Zeal of Christian Religion has once swallow'd up; in so much that they waste their Estates, suffer themselves to be cheated, put no difference between Friends and Enemies, abhor Pleasure, are cramm'd with Poverty, Watchings, Tears, Labours, Reproaches, abhorrence of Life, and wish Death above all things: In short, They seem sensless to common Understanding, as if their Minds lived elsewhere, and not in their Bodies; what else is this but to be mad? For which Reason, you must not think it so strange, if the Apostles seem'd to be drunk with new Wine, and if <hi>Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to <hi>Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For holy men, their Minds being taken up with those things that are most repugnant to these grosser Senses, seem bruitish and stupid in the common use of them: whereas on the contrary, the ordinary sort of people are best at these, and can do least at t'other; from whence it is, that some of these Zealots have by mistake drunk Oyl instead of Wine.

In like manner (says <hi>Agrippa</hi>) we find in the Gospel how Christ was receiv'd of Idiots, of the vulgar people, and of the simpler sort, while he was rejected, despised and persecuted even to death, by the <hi>high-Priests, Lawyers, Scribes, Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Rabbies:</hi> for which cause, Christ chose his Apostles, not <hi>Scribes,</hi> not <hi>Doctors,</hi> not <hi>Priests,</hi> but unlearned persons of the vulgar people, void of knowledge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful, and Asses.</q>

Furthermore it may be observ'd, that by this Computation Guns were here with us invented within less than 100 years after the Seaman's Compass; so that within one Age after, our Navigation might reach to those Parts, and not before. Nevertheless it has been observ'd, that divers men in far distant Times and Countreys have happen'd to light upon the same Invention, where the latter never heard of the former; as for example, in that most ingenious Engine for raising of Water, call'd with us the <hi>Water-Screw,</hi> first found out by <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who was thereupon so ravisht with joy, that he ran up and down the Streets crying <gap reason="foreign">

The Accident is said to have been thus: He having set a Pipkin over the fire wherein was a mixture of Brimstone, Saltpeter, and powder of Coal for a Medicine, the bottom of the Pipkin grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too hot, and the Stuff taking sudden fire, blew up the Cover of the Pipkin with great vehemency; whereof he being a contemplative man consider'd, and made further Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, till by degrees he improved the Invention in long Barrels of Iron, and so devised Guns. Hereby we may observe, how prodigiously Chance does excel the Wit of man in producing of new and rare Effects! For if all Mankind had set their Wits on work to invent an Engine of greater force than any of the old ones, they would have confined their thoughts to the old Idea's, but with addition of more strength or weight; or else by transposition of some parts; but it would never have entred into their heads to have grounded it upon the Fundamentals of Nature: first to avoid <hi>vacuum</hi>; then to avoid pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration of Bodies without enlargement of room; and lastly to imploy Fire as the fountain of violent motion: for thus when the corns of Powder open'd and swell'd by Fire require more room, which being deny'd them by the narrow Iron or brass Barrel, there will be a most furious eruption, which finding the least resistance from the Bullet, drives that before it with such violence, as no other Engine could ever do the like: <hi>Facile est inventis addere.</hi> This prodigious Invention doth at this instant take universally, and to several Uses not thought upon, till daily Experience had improved it: As first to <hi>Mines,</hi> which experienc'd Artists will now spring so exactly both for time and distance, as if they wrought above ground without any disturbance: Their <hi>Bombs</hi> shoot with a perfect certainty where to fall, and at such an Elevation, as the highest Wall or Castle cannot intercept: And now of late the <hi>hand-Granadoes</hi> disorder in a moment all ranks and files of Horse and Foot, so that the exactest <hi>Roman</hi> Discipline if it were again upon Earth, would be at a loss: And then for Sea, it is dreadful to behold what execution it does both upon Men and Ships, when some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a great Bullet without touching any man, kills and maims several by the Splinters it makes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Apollonius</hi> sacrificeth to the <hi>Sun,</hi> whilst <hi>Phraotes</hi> tarryeth for him, that he might be present, and give his advice touching a Field that had been sold, and which was now in Controversie, by reason of Treasure found therein, which Field by the Sentence of <hi>Apollonius</hi> was adjudged to the Buyer, because he was a good and just man, and pious towards the Gods, whereas the Seller was evil and impious, and a contemner of the Gods; The Story of the white Camels, and the King's Letter in behalf of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> to <hi>Jarchas</hi> his Master, one of the wise men; A Description of the Gates whereon were the Statues of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Porus;</hi> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Altars inscribed with an Epigram; Also of the Pillars whereon was engraved this Sentence, Alexander <hi>here made a Stand.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHen <hi>Apollonius</hi> perceiv'd that the King was now to give Answers to Embassies, and such like Matters, he said to him, Do you, O King, those things that pertain to the government of your Kingdom, and leave me at this time to the <hi>Sun,</hi> for I must pray my accustomed Prayers unto him. And let him hear your Prayers, said the King, for he delighteth in all that love Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and I will in the mean time wait your Return, for I must determine certain Controversies, at which if you be present, you will be very assistant to me. The Morning being well spent, <hi>Apollonius</hi> returns, and asks the King, What those things were which he had determined? To whom the King made Answer, That he had determin'd nothing that day, in as much as the service of Religion did prohibit him. <hi>Apollonius</hi> reply'd, Do you then perform the service of Religion before you determine Causes, as well as before you undertake a Iourney, or an Expedition with an Army? Yes, said the King, because here also is danger, if he that determines Causes be turn'd aside from what is right. Wherefore <hi>Apollonius</hi> judged that the King spake well; and further ask'd him, What that Controversie was which he was that day to determine? For (saith he) I see you in suspence, and doubtful on which side you should pass sentence. Whereto the King answer'd, I confess I am in no small doubt, and therefore make you my Adviser: A certain Man sold a piece of Land to another, wherein Treasure had been hidden, but was known to no man; and not long after the Earth being opened, was discover'd a Pot of Gold: The Seller of the Land claim'd it, in that he would not have sold the Land, had he known that such Wealth had layn therein: The Purchaser on the contrary said, that all was his which he found in the Land that he had bought: The Plea of both seem'd to have some Right in them; neither should I avoid the imputation of Folly, should I command them to share the Gold between them; for such a decision any old Woman would give. Hereunto <hi>Apollonius</hi> answer'd, That these men are not Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers is apparent, in that they contend about Gold. But I suppose you will pass a right sentence, if you thus reckon with your self, that the Gods take an especial care of them who are both Philosophers and vertuous men; but they regard them in the second place who are not vicious, and not used to wrong any one: wherefore they grant to the Philosophers, that they may rightly know divine and humane things; but to other good-natured men they afford a sufficient Estate, lest at any
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98416:126"/>
time for want of Necessaries they should become unjust. Wherefore my opinion is, O King, that the Parties be as it were <hi>[1]</hi> weigh'd one against another in a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and the Life of both be accurately scann'd: for neither do I think that the Gods would have taken away the Land from the one, had he not been a vicious Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; nor on the other side have given to the other even the things hidden under the ground, were he not better than the Seller. Wherefore on the morrow both Parties came to plead their Cause, and the Seller was convicted to be a contumelious Fellow, and one that slighted the Sacrifices that were to be offer'd unto the Gods in the Earth; the other appear'd to be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ld just man, and one who worshipt the Gods most religiously: Wherefore the sentence of <hi>Apollonius</hi> prevail'd, and the good man went away, as having obtain'd those things of the Gods. When therefore the Controversie had been decided in this manner, <hi>Apollonius</hi> coming to the King, said, This is the third day that I have been your Guest, and therefore according to your Laws, I must depart from you to morrow. But the Law reacheth you not as yet, said the King, for you may also stay to morrow, because you came after Noon. I rejoyce (answer'd <hi>Apollonius</hi>) at your Hospitality, in that you seem more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlely to interpret the Law for my sake. Certainly, said the King, might I break the Law, I would do it for your sake. But tell me this, <hi>Apollonius,</hi> Have not the Camels whereon you rode brought you as far as from <hi>Babylon?</hi> Yes, said <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius,</hi> for we receiv'd them from <hi>Vardanes.</hi> Think you then, said the King, that they are able to carry you further, when they have already gone so far as from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon?</hi> Hereat <hi>Apollonius</hi> held his peace. Wherefore <hi>Damis</hi> interrupting him, said to the King, This Man, O King, doth not yet understand our Iourney, nor to what People we shall afterwards come, but as if he should find every where such men as you and <hi>Vardanes</hi> are, he thinks it a sport to travel through the <hi>Indies,</hi> and therefore doth not tell you in what case the Camels are; for they are so ill disposed, that we are forced rather to carry them, than they us, so that we have great need of others; for should they fail in the Desarts of <hi>India,</hi> we must of necessity abide there, driving away the Vultures and Wolves from the Camels, but there will be none to drive them away from us, and so we must perish. I (said the King) will remedy this, for I will give you others; four I suppose you want; and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour over the River <hi>Indus</hi> shall send back to <hi>Babylon</hi> the four Camels that you brought; now I have by <hi>Indus</hi> Camels that are all white. But will you not also give us a Guide, said <hi>Damis?</hi> Yes, answer'd the King, and I will give a Camel to the Guide, and Provision for your Iourney. I will also write to <hi>Iarchas</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the wise men, that he would courteously entertain <hi>Apollonius,</hi> being a man nothing inferior to himself, together with you also, as Philosophers and Companions of a divine man. Having said thus, he commanded Gold to be given them, with precious Stones, and linen Garments, and a thousand other such things. But <hi>Apollonius</hi> replyed, that he had Gold enough already, <hi>Vardanes</hi> having given it privately to our Guide. As for the linen <hi>[2]</hi> Garments I shall willingly receive them, in that they seem very like to the Garments of the old <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. Then taking up one of the Iewels in his hand, he said, O rare Stone, how opportunely have I lighted on thee, not without the Favour of the Gods? seeing, as I suppose, some secret and divine vertue in the Stone. But <hi>Damis</hi> and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions though they took no Gold, yet took plentifully of the precious Stones, as intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to offer them unto the Gods, when they return'd home into their own Countrey. Now when they had tarried there that other day, (for the King permitted them not to go thence) he giveth them a Letter to <hi>Iarchas</hi> in these words:</p>

               <p>Then departing from <hi>Taxilla,</hi> and being gone two days Iourney, they came to the Place where <hi>Porus</hi> is reported to have fought with <hi>Alexander.</hi> And they also say, that they there beheld certain Gates, not erected to shut any Place, but only as a Trophy, and that on them <hi>Alexander</hi> is set up riding on his Chariot with four Horses, so as he stood at <hi>Issus</hi> among the Nobles. They further relate, that there are two other Gates, not far distant from one another, whereof on the one standeth the Statue of <hi>Alexander,</hi> on the other that of <hi>Porus,</hi> as they met together after the Fight, as I conceive: for <hi>Alexander</hi> seemeth to embrace, and <hi>Porus</hi> to do obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance.

But here <hi>Apollonius</hi> not minding the absolute transferring of Right, which a Purchase makes, looks only at the Parties, and passes Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on his side who seem'd the most devout, as if mens Proprieties in their temporal Estates,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98416:127"/>
were grounded upon Godliness, rather than upon a legal Right. This Position that <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium fundatur in Gratia,</hi> is more or less own'd by all Religions at this day in the World, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only the <hi>Protestants: ex. gr.</hi> to begin with <hi>Mahometism,</hi> although it professes to force no Conscience, yet the pretences of all their Wars are only to enlarge the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Faith. And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> declares more openly in this Tenet, affirming all States and Princes that are not <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to be at the Pope's disposal. In like manner the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> pretending to be those <hi>meek ones who should inherit the Earth,</hi> took Arms, and had undoubtedly proved successful, but that <hi>Charles</hi> the V. and the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> prorogued the Prophesie to a further day. For as all particular men have each man his private Interest separate from the rest, in so much that most of the greatest Governments, Assemblies, and Conventions of Mankind, notwithstanding all their grave pretences of the publick Good, are nothing but a commerce of private Interests; so has each Religion (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only ours) a particular Interest of their own Hierarchy. This perhaps is that which the Apostle calls the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi>; and if mankind could be so clear-sighted as to discern this Mystery of Iniquity, and sever it from the pure Conceern of mens Souls, in the worship of God in spirit and truth, then perhaps all such as are neither very malicious nor barbarous, would be of one mind, serving God in simplicity and singleness of heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But while men are men and not Angels, they will have a main respect to their great <hi>Diana,</hi> and that Interest which the craftiest of them understand well enough, doth through educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and long practice so dazle ordinary Capacities, as they will verily imagine themselves to be in the right, and are by that means intentionally honest.</p>

He likewise himself and his Followers took plenty of the rare precious Stones, pretending at their return into their Countrey to offer them up to the Gods. Here is plain to be seen, that although Vain-glory and Hypocrisie may sometimes seem to refuse offer'd Riches, yet <hi>Quis nisi mentis inops oblatum respuit aurum</hi>; Do what we can, when the Booty is important, and the Opportunity fair, Nature will be nibbling: and as the Dog that dares not eat the Shoulder of Mutton before him, will now and then give a lick at it; so here to excuse the matter, they wanted not to alledge Curiosity for the Garments, and Devotion for the Jewels: Thus according to the old Proverb, <hi>It is ill Wool that will take no Dye.</hi>
