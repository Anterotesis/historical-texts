            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Touching the name of <hi>Britannie,</hi> with the Gouernors
and state thereof before the <hi>Romans</hi> arrivall, as they are
things not to have been neglected, if any certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them had been left vs, by approved testimonies
of former ages: so I thinke it not now requisite, either
to recite the different conjectures of other men, or of
my self, constantly to affirme any thing concerning the
same; aswell for that those matters have been alreadie
handled at large by our modern Writers, as also for that
I suppose, in ayming at such antique Originals (there
being but one truth amidst many errors) a man may
much more easily shoote wide, then hit the marke. I
purpose therefore (omitting <hi>Etymologies</hi> of words, and
varietie of opinions concerning the first inhabitants and
their doings) to take the name and affaires of this Ile, in
such sort, as they were first known to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the
time of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> when the <hi>Roman</hi> state, (which had
tried all kinds of government, as namely that of <hi>Kings,</hi>
then of <hi>Consuls, Tribunes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Decemvirs</hi>) began to be vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by a few, &amp; soone after submitted it self to one. For
about the foure and fiftieth yeare before the birth of
our Saviour Christ, <hi>Caesar</hi> being then governor of <hi>Gallia</hi>
for the Senat and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and having brought
some part of that Countrey vnder obedience, intended
a voyage with an armie into <hi>Britannie,</hi> partly, vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8449:8"/>
of revenge (for that the <hi>Britans</hi> had diuers times
ayded the <hi>Gauls</hi> in their warres against the <hi>Romans</hi>) and
partly, to satisfie himselfe with sight of the Iland, and
knowledge of the Inhabitants, and their customs; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
he might perhaps be the more readily induced, by
reason of his owne naturall inclination to vndertake
great and difficult attempts, and with the increase of his
owne glorie, to inlarge the limits of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
vnto which at that time the soveraigntie of the whole
world was, by divine providence, allotted. And to this
end he thought good to be first informed of the nature
of the people, and of such havens in the Ile, as were most
commodious to receive any shipping, that should come
thither; whch things were in a maner vnknowne to the
<hi>Gauls,</hi> by reason the Ilanders suffred none to haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
to them, but marchants onely; neither knew, even
they, any other places, then the sea coasts, &amp; those parts
of the Ile, that confronted the continent of <hi>Gallia.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
<hi>Caesar</hi> supposing it necessarie to make some disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie,
before he adventured himselfe in the action, sent
<hi>Caius Volusenus</hi> in a long Boat, with instructions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of the quantitie of the Iland, of the conditions of
the Inhabitants, of their maner of making war, of their
government in peace, &amp; what places were fittest for lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
After which dispatch made, himselfe with all his
forces (which were newly returned from making warre
beyond the <hi>Rhene</hi>) marched into the Countrey of the
<note n="a" place="margin">The ancient inhabitants of the Counties of Guines and Bolonois in Picardie.</note>
                     <hi>Morini,</hi> from whence was the shortest cut into <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie:</hi>
for there he had appointed his shipping to meete
him.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, his purpose being known to the
<hi>Britans,</hi> by report of the Merchants (that traded with
them,) divers States of the Ile, (either fearing the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the <hi>Roman</hi> power, or affecting innovation for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8449:9"/>
some private respects) sent over Ambassadors, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
in their names, to deliver hostages, for assurance
of their obedience to the people of <hi>Rome:</hi> But <hi>Caesar,</hi>
though he was fully resolved to enter the Iland, yet
curteously entertained their offer, exhorting them to
continue in that good mind, as a meane to draw on the
rest, in following the example of their submission. For
the better effecting whereof, he appointed <hi>Comius</hi> the
chiefe Governour of the<note n="b" place="margin">The people of Artois.</note> 
                     <hi>Atrebates</hi> (as a man, whose
wisdom and faith he had tryed, and whom he knew to
be respected of the <hi>Britans</hi>) to accompanie the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
in their returne, giving him in charge to go to as
many Cities, as would permit him accesse; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the Rulers to submit themselves, as some of their
Nation had alreadie done: and further, to let them
know, that himselfe with all convenient speed, would
come thither.</p>
                  <p>The Princes of the Ile, being as yet vnacquainted
with any civill kinds of government, maintained quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
and factions amongst themselves, whereby, while
one sought to offend another, and to enlarge his owne
part, by encroching vpon his neighbours (not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that what they gained in particular one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they lost all togither in the generall reckoning)
they made an open passage in the end, for the <hi>Romans</hi> to
conquer the whole, (a thing common to them with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations, who have found the like effects to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the like causes.) For, the most part of the
<hi>Britans,</hi> in those daies, delighted in warre, neglecting
husbandrie, or perhaps not then knowing the vse of it.
Their manner of living, and customes, were much like
to those of the inhabitants of <hi>Gallia.</hi> Their dyet was
such as Nature yeelded of her selfe, without the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie
of man: for though they had great store of cattell,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8449:9"/>
yet they lived (especially in the in-land Countries) with
milke. It was held among them, as a thing vnlawfull,
to eate of a hare, a hen, or a goose, and yet they nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
them all for recreations sake. Their apparrell was
made of the skinnes of beasts, though their bodies were
(for the most part) naked and stained with woad, which
gave them a blewish colour, and (as they supposed)
made their aspect terrible to their enemies in battaile.
Their houses were compact of stakes, reeds, and boughs
of trees, fastned together in a round circle. They had
ten or twelve wives apeece common among them,
though the issue were alwayes accounted his, that first
married the mother, being a mayden. They were, in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
taller than the <hi>Gauls,</hi> in wit, more simple, as being
lesse civill.</p>
                  <p>By this time, <hi>Volusenus,</hi> (who durst not set foot on
land to hazard himself amongst the barbarous Ilanders)
returned to <hi>Caesar,</hi> (namely, the fift day after his setting
forth) and made relation of such things as he had seen,
and heard, by report, in roving vp and downe the coast
in view of the Iland.</p>

of two <hi>Legions</hi>) besides his long boats, wherein the <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,</hi>
the <hi>Lievtenants,</hi> and other officers of the Camp
were to be imbarqued. There were also eighteen ships
of burden (that lay wind-bound about eight miles from
the Port) appoynted to waft over the horsemen. <hi>P. Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius
Rufus,</hi> a Lievtenant of a <hi>Legion,</hi> was commanded
to keep the haven it selfe with such power, as was
thought sufficient. These things being thus ordered,
and a good part of the summer now spent, <hi>Caesar</hi> put
out to sea about the third watch of the night, having
given direction, that the horsemen should embarke in
the vpper haven, and follow him; wherein, while they
weresomewhat slack, <hi>Caesar</hi> with his shipping, about the
fourth houre of the day, arrived vpon the coast of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie,</hi>
where he beheld the Cliffs possessed with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of barbarous people, rudely armed, and ready to
make resistance.</p>
                  <p>The nature of the place was such, as by reason of the
steepe hills (enclosing the sea on each side in a narrow
strait) it gave great advantage to the <hi>Britans,</hi> in casting
downe their darts vpon their enemies vnderneth them.
<hi>Caesar</hi> finding this place vnfit for landing his forces, put
off from the shore, and cast anchor, expecting the rest of
his Fleet; and in the meane time, calling a counsell of
the <hi>Lievtenants,</hi> and <hi>Tribuns</hi> of the souldiers, he declar'd
vnto them, what he had vnderstood by <hi>Volusenus,</hi> and
directed what he would have done; warning them, that
(as the state of the warre, and specially the sea-service re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired)
they would be ready to weigh anchor, and to
remove, to, and fro (vpon occasions) at a beck, and in an
instant.</p>
                  <p>This done, having advantage both of wind, and tide,
he set forward with his Navy, about foure Leagues from
that place, and then lay at anchor in view of the open,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8449:11"/>
and plain shore. But the Ilanders, vpon intelligence of
the <hi>Romans</hi> purpose, had sent thither (before <hi>Caesars</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming)
a company of horsemen and chariots called <hi>Esse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
(which they then vsed in their warres) and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterwards with the rest of their forces, empeached
their enemies from landing, whoseships, by reason of
their huge bulks, (drawing much water) could not
come neer to the shore: so as the <hi>Roman</hi> souldiers were
thereby enforcedin places vnknown (their bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
charged with their armour) to leap into the water,
and encounter the <hi>Britans,</hi> who assayled them nimbly
with their darts, and drave their horses and chariots,
with main force vpon them: The <hi>Romans</hi> being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
terrifyed, as men vnacquainted with that kind of
fight, fayled much of the wonted courage, which they
had shewed in their former land-services; and <hi>Caesar</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it, caused the long boats (which seemed more
strange to the barbarous people, and were more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,
by reason of their swiftnesse in motion) to put
off, by little and little, from the greater ships, and to
row towards the shore, from whence they might more
easily charge the <hi>Britans,</hi> with their arrowes, slings, and
other warlike engines, which (being then vnknowne to
the Ilanders, as also the fashion of the ships, and motion
of the oares in the long boats, having stricken them
with feare and amazement) caused them to make a
stand, and afterwards to draw backe a litle.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Roman</hi> souldiers making no haste to pursue
them, by reason of the water, which they suspected in
some places to be deep and dangerous: the Standard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer
of the Eagle of the <hi>Tenth Legion,</hi> praying, that
his attempt might prove successefull to the Legion, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

mine owne part, I meane to discharge the duetie I owe
to the Common wealth, and to my Generall.</hi> This
said, he cast himselfe into the water, and carryed the
Standard boldly against the <hi>Britans.</hi> Whereupon, the
souldiers exhorting one another to follow the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
what fortune soever might befall) with common
consent, leapt out of their long boats, one seconding
another; and so, wading through the water, at length
got to shore, where began a sharp and bloody fight on
both sides: The <hi>Romans</hi> were much incumbred, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that they could neither keepe their ranks, nor fight
vpon firm ground, nor follow their owne standards; for
every one as he came on land, ran confusedly to that
which was next him.</p>
                  <p>Some of the <hi>Britans</hi> (who knew the flats, and shallow
places, espying the <hi>Romans,</hi> as they came single out of
their ships) pricked forward their horses, and set vpon
them, overlaying them with number, and finding them
vnwealdy and vnready to make any great resistance, by
reason of the depth of the water, and weight of their
armour, while the greater part of the barbarous people
with their darts assailed them fiercely vpon the shore:
which <hi>Caesar</hi> perceiving, commanded the Cock-boates
and Skowts, to be manned with souldiers, whom hee
sent in all haste to rescue their fellowes.</p>
                  <p>There was a souldier of <hi>Caesars</hi> company, called <hi>Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Scaeva,</hi> who, with some other of the same band, was
carried in a small boat, vnto a rocke, which the ebbing
sea, in that place, had made accessible. The <hi>Britans</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spying
them, made thitherward: the rest of the <hi>Romans</hi>
escaping, <hi>Scaeva</hi> alone was left vpon the rocke, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the fury of the enraged multitude, that assailed
him with their darts, which he received vpon his shield,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8449:12"/>
and thrust at them with his speare, till it was broken,
and his helmet and shield lost: then being tired with
extreame toyle, and dangerously wounded, he betooke
himselfe to flight, and, (carrying two light harnesses on
his backe) with much difficulty recovered <hi>Caesars</hi> Tent,
where hee craved pardon for making so bold an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
without commandement of his Generall. <hi>Caesar</hi>
did both remit the offence, and reward the offender,
by bestowing vpon him the office of a <hi>Centurion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the <hi>Scaeva,</hi> who afterwards gave good cause

backe againe to the Port, from whence they came, and
some others vpon the lower part of the Iland westward,
where, after they had cast anchor, (their keeles being
almost overwhelmed with the waves,) they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed,
by violence of the storme in the night, into the
maine, and with very great perill, recovered a harbor in
the continent.</p>
                  <p>The same night, the Moone was at the full, at which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8449:13"/>
time commonly, the Sea in those parts, is much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and overfloweth the banks, by reason of the high
tides, (a matter vnknowne to the <hi>Romans</hi>) insomuch, as
the long boates, which transported the armie, then ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vpon the shore, were filled with the flood; and the
ships of burden; that lay at anchor, were beaten with the
storme, and split in peeces, the greater number of them
perishing in the water, and the rest being made altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnserviceable, (their anchors lost, and tacklings
broken:) Wherewith the <hi>Romans</hi> were much perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for that they neither had any other ships to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them backe againe, nor any meanes to repaire
what the tempest had ruined: and <hi>Caesar</hi> had formerly
resolved to winter in <hi>Gallia,</hi> by reason he was vnfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
of vittaile to maintaine his army during the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
season. Which being knowne to the cheefe States
of the <hi>Britans,</hi> (who had met together about the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of such things, as <hi>Caesar</hi> had commanded
them) they supposed a fit opportunity was offered
them to revolt, while the <hi>Romans</hi> wanted horsemen,
shipping, and all manner of provisions; the number of
their forces seeming also the lesse, in respect of the small
circuit of their Campe, (<hi>Caesar</hi> having transported his
<hi>Legions</hi> without any carriages, or such like warlike ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries.)
Whereupon they concluded to keepe them
from vittaile, and to prolong the warre till winter; assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
themselves, that if they could eyther vanquish the
<hi>Romans,</hi> or barre them from returning thence, there
would no forraigne Nation after them, adventure to
set foote againe in <hi>Britannie.</hi> And heereupon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
themselves by stealth, out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Campe,
and gathered companie to them privily from diverse
parts, to make head against their enemies.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>CAEsar,</hi> albeit he were ignorant of the <hi>Britans</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
yet supposing that the state of his armie, and
the losse of his ships were knowne to them, and
considering that they had broken day with him, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the pledges contrary to the contract, he suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that which afterwards proved true. And therfore to
provide remedies against all chances, he caused Corne
to be brought dayly out of the fields into his Campe,
and such ships as could not be made fit for service, were
vsed to repaire the rest, and such other things as were
wanting therto, he appointed to be brought out of the
continent; by which meanes, and the diligence of his
Souldiers, with the losse of twelve Ships, the rest of his
Navie was made able to beare saile, and brooke the
Seas againe.</p>
                  <p>While these things were in dooing, the <hi>Seventh Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
(according to custom) was sent forth a forraging;
till which time, the <hi>Britans</hi> revolt was not certainly
knowne, for that some of them remained abroad in the
fields, &amp; others came ordinarily into the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp.
The Warders in the Station before the Campe, gave
notice to <hi>Caesar,</hi> that the same way which the <hi>Legion</hi>
went, there appeared a greater dust, then was woont to
be seene. <hi>Caesar</hi> mistrusting some new practise of the
<hi>Britans,</hi> commanded the Companies (that kept ward)
to march thither, appointing two others to supply their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8449:14"/>
roomes, and the rest of his forces to arme themselves
with speed and follow him. When he approched neer
the place discried, he perceived his souldiers to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
with the <hi>Britans,</hi> who assailed them on all sides
with their darts. For the <hi>Britans</hi> having conveyed their
Corne from all other parts (this only excepted) and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
that the <hi>Romans</hi> would come thither, lay in the
woods all night, to intercept them: and finding them
dispersed, and vnreadie, they sodainly set vppon them,
(as they were reaping) killing a few of them, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the rest, with their horses and chariots.</p>
                  <p>The maner of their fighting in Chariots was thus;
First, they vsed to ride round about their enemies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
casting their darts where they saw advauntage, and
oftentimes with the fiercenesse of their horses, &amp; whir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of their Chariot wheeles, they broke their enemies
ranks: and being gotten in among the troopes of hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
they would leape out of their Chariots, and fight
on foot. The Chariot-drivers in the meane time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
themselves by litle and litle out of the battell, and
placed themselves in such sort, as their maisters (being
over-matched by their enemies) might readily recover
their Chariots, so that in their fighting they performed
the offices, both of horsmen in swiftnesse of motion, and
also of footmen in keeping their ground; and by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vse, and exercise, they were growne so expert in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
their horses, as, driving them forcibly downe a
steepe hill, they were able to stay or turne them in the
mid way, yea, to run along the beame, to stand firme
vpon the yoke, and to return thence speedily into their
Chariots again.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> being much troubled with this new
kind of fight, <hi>Caesar</hi> came in good time to the rescue.
For vpon his approach, the <hi>Britans</hi> gave over the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8449:15"/>
yet keeping still their ground as maisters of the
field, and the <hi>Romans</hi> for fear, retired themselves to their
Generall, who thought it no point of wisdome, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
his forces in a place vnknowne: but having staied
there awhile, conducted the <hi>Legions</hi> backe againe to his
Campe, and in the meane time, the <hi>Britans</hi> that were
in the field, dispersed themselves, and shrunke away.</p>
                  <p>After this there were for many dayes togither, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
tempests, which kept the <hi>Romans</hi> in their campe,
and hindred the <hi>Britans</hi> from making any open at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
though they sent messengers secretly into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
parts of the Ile, publishing abroad, what a small
number of their enemies was left, what great hope
there was of a rich bootie, &amp; what apparant likelihood
of recovering their libertie, if they could drive the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
from their Campe: And hereupon in short time
they assembled a great number of horse and foot-men,
to put their purpose in execution. Against which, <hi>Caesar</hi>
(vnderstanding thereof) made preparation for defence,
having gotten also about thirtie hors-men (which <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>
of <hi>Arras</hi> brought over with him) whose seruice he
supposed verie necessarie, if the <hi>Britans</hi> (according to
their woonted maner) should seeke to save themselves
by flight. The <hi>Legions</hi> were placed in battaile array be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Camp. Then the <hi>Britans</hi> began the fight, which
had not long continued, when they gave back, and fled,
the <hi>Romans</hi> pursuing them as farre as they durst, killing
many whom they overtooke, and burning houses and
townes as they returned to their Campe.</p>
                  <p>The same day the <hi>Britans</hi> sent Ambassadors to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
desiring peace, which after long sute, was granted,
vpon condition, that the number of the pledges (which
was before required) should be now doubled, and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
sent over into <hi>Gallia.</hi> For the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> drawing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8449:15"/>
neere, <hi>Caesar</hi> made haste thither, doubting his crazed
ships would not be well able to brooke the Seas in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
whereupon taking advauntage of the next faire
wind, he embarqued his forces about midnight, and
with the greatest part of his Fleete, arrived in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.

Fleet of new ships, well appointed, and commodiously
built for landing his forces (the want whereof he had
found before, to his great losse) and a sufficient armie
consisting of five <hi>Legions,</hi> and a proportionall number
of horse, which he embarqued at<note n="*" place="margin">Callice.</note> 
                     <hi>Portus Iccius</hi> about
the Sun-setting, having a faire Southern wind to set

tide diverted their course, so as in the morning he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the Iland on his left hand: and then following
the turning of the tide, he commanded his souldiers to
vse their Oares that they might reach that part of the
Ile, where they had found best landing the Summer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
wherein they tooke such paines, as their shipps of
burden kept way with their long boats and lighter ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.
About noone they landed on the shore, where
there appeared no man to make resistance: the cause
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8449:16"/>
wherof was (as <hi>Caesar</hi> afterwards learned by such priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
as he tooke) for that the <hi>Britans</hi> having assembled
themselves togither in armes at the Sea side, were so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
with the sight of the ships (which of all sorts were
esteemed above eight hundred saile) that they left the
shore, and ran to hide themselves in the vpland Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<hi>Caesar</hi> (vpon intelligence by fugitives, where the
<hi>Brittish</hi> forces lay) leaving at the Sea side, ten <hi>Cohorts,</hi>
and three hundred horse to grade the ships then lying
at Anchor, (whereof <hi>Quintus Atrius</hi> had the charge)
marched forward with the rest of his army in the night,
about twelve miles into the land, where he espi'd a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of <hi>Britans</hi> flocked togither neere a river, having
gotten the vpper ground, from whence they began to
charge the <hi>Romans</hi> with their horse and Chariots; but
being repulsed by <hi>Caesars</hi> hors-men, they fled, and hid
themselves in the woods, in a place which being nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
strengthned both by Nature and Art, they had vsed
as a fortresse in their civill warres among themselves.
For by reason there were many great trees cut downe,
and laid overthwart the passages round about, there
could hardly any entrance be found into the wood;
howbeit the <hi>Britans</hi> themselves would oft times sally
forth vpon advantage, and empeach the <hi>Romans,</hi> where
they attempted to enter. Hereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> commanded
the Souldiers of the <hi>Seventh Legion</hi> to make a<note n="*" place="margin">A warlike engin made of boords, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with raw hides, to serve for defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst fire, or stones in sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a wall.</note> 
                     <hi>Testudo,</hi>

after losse of men on both sides, the <hi>Romans</hi> in the end
got the Fort, &amp; chased the <hi>Britans</hi> out of the wood; but
<hi>Caesar</hi> would not suffer his Souldiers to pursue them far,
in regard the place was vnknown, and a great part of the
day being then spent, he thought it fit to bestow the
rest in fortifying his Campe.</p>
                  <p>The next day in the morning, he sent out hors-men
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8449:16"/>
and foot-men three severall wayes to pursue them
that fled; but, before they had gotten sight of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
certain hors-men sent from <hi>Quintus Atrius</hi> (who
had charge of the shipping) brought newes, that a great
tempest the night before had distressed his ships, and
beaten them vpon the shore, their Anchors and Cables
being not able to hold them, nor the mariners to guide
them, or to endure the force of the storme. Wherupon
<hi>Caesar</hi> caused the <hi>Legions,</hi> and hors-men to be sent for
backe againe, and marched with speede towards the sea
side, where he found his Navy in ill plight; fortie of his
ships being cleane cast away, and the rest with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie
seeming likely to be recovered. For effecting
wherof, he tooke some Shipwrights out of the <hi>Legions,</hi>

(who had the charge of certaine <hi>Legions</hi> there,
and the gard of <hi>Portus Iccius</hi>) that he should prepare as
many ships as he could, to be sent over vnto him with
expedition. And though it were a worke of great toile;
yet hee thought it necessarie to have all the ships haled
on shore, and to be brought into the campe, where his
land-forces lay, that one place might be a safegard to
them both. In the accomplishment hereof he spent ten

dislodged vpon <hi>Atrius</hi> his advertisement, where he
found the number of the <hi>Britans</hi> much increased by
confluence of people from sundry parts within the

by a forrain enemie) neglected private respects,
and joyned their forces togither, appointing him to be
their leader, as a man of whose valor, and sufficiencie in
militare affaires they had good experience.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> army being come in view of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Campe, the <hi>Britans</hi> pressed forward to begin the
fight with their hors-men and Chariots, and <hi>Caesar</hi> sent
out his hors-men to encounter them, so as the battaile
was maintained with great resolution on both parts,
and the event thereof seemed doubtfull, till in the end,
the <hi>Britans</hi> gave ground, and fled through the woods to
the hills, many of them being slaine in the chase, and
some of the <hi>Romans</hi> also, who adventerously pursued

                  <p>Not long after, while the <hi>Romans</hi> (suspecting no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)

sallyed sodainly out of the woods, and made an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
vpon the Warders, that kept station before the
Campe, to whose aide <hi>Caesar</hi> sent out two <hi>Cohorts</hi> (the

perill, though <hi>Quintus Laberius Durus,</hi> a <hi>Tribune</hi> of the
Souldiers was slain in that enterprise. But new <hi>Cohorts</hi>
comming to supply the former, the <hi>Britans</hi> were repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and sought to save themselves by flight. By the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of this skirmish, (which was fought in view of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Campe) the <hi>Romans</hi> perceived the advaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
which the <hi>Britans</hi> had of them, and how ill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were appointed for such a kind of fight, when by
reason of the weight of their armor, they could neither
pursue such as fled, nor durst leave their Ensignes, nor
were able (without great disadvantage) to encounter
the <hi>British</hi> hors-men, which oft times gave ground of
purpose; and having withdrawne themselves by litle
and litle from the <hi>Legions,</hi> would leap out of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
and fight on foot; the maner of their fighting with
horses and Chariots, being alike dangerous to those
that retired, and those that pursued. Besides, they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their forces into companies (when they fought)
and had severall stations, with great distances betweene
them, one troope seconding an other, and the sound
and fresh men yeelding supplies to the wounded and

                  <p>The day following the <hi>Britans</hi> were descried vpon
the hils a farre off, scattred here and there in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

hors-men, vnder the conduct of <hi>C. Trebonius</hi> the Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
to go a forraging, they flocked sodainly togither
from all parts, and set vpon the forragers, not sparing to
assaile the Ensigns and <hi>Legions</hi> themselves, who strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resisted them, and made them turn their backs, when
the <hi>Roman</hi> hors-men also eagerly pursued them, never
giving over the chase (as being confident in the ayde of
the <hi>Legions</hi> that followed them) vntill they had driven
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8449:18"/>
them headlong before them, killing all those they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke,
and giving the rest no time, either to gather
themselves togither, or to make a stand, or once to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
their Chariots. After this overthrow, many of the
barbarous people (who had come from diverse parts to
aide their Countri-men) shrunke away; and <hi>Caesar</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
what course the rest of the <hi>Britans</hi> meant
to hold in prosecuting the warre, led his armie to the
bounds of <hi>Cassibelins</hi> Countrey, vpon the River of
<hi>Thames,</hi> which was passable on foot, in one place onely
and that with some difficultie. When he came thither,

were fortified with sharpe pointed stakes, or piles, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the bignesse of a mans thigh, and bound about
with lead,) pitched neere the shore, to empeach their
passage; and some others of the same kind (the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants

covertly vnder water in the maine River. Whereof <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
having intelligence (by some Fugitives, and priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
that he had taken) commaunded the hors-men,
first, to enter the River, and the <hi>Legions</hi> to follow, so
as (the dangerous places being discovered) the <hi>Romans</hi>
waded through (their heads onely appearing above

there about, sent Ambassadors, and yeelded themselves

not farre from thence. This towne (as all others so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

The <hi>Britans</hi> having expected a while the event of the
enterprise, and perceiving themselves vnable to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the assault, issued out at a backe way, where many
of them being slaine, and some taken (as they fled,) the

                     <hi>Cantium,</hi> that lies vpon the sea. The inhabitants of
those parts were then more civill, and better furnished
to make warre than any other of the Ile. The country at

calleth them) either for that they had among them
a kind of absolute government in several, or else, for that
being the Register of his owne acts, he supposed it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8449:19"/>
would be more for his glorie to be reputed a conqueror
of Kings. Their names were <hi>Cingetorix, Carvilius, Taxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magulus,</hi>
and <hi>Segonax,</hi> whom <hi>Gassibelin</hi> then required to
raise all the power they could make, and on the sodaine
to assaile the <hi>Roman</hi> forces, that garded their ships at the
sea side. This was attempted accordingly, but with ill
successe, for that the <hi>Romans</hi> having timely advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their purpose, prevented the execution therof,
by setting vpon them as they drew neere the <hi>Roman</hi>
armie; and so, after a great slaughter made of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
(<hi>Cingetorix</hi> a noble captaine, and one of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being taken prisoner) the <hi>Romans</hi> returned in safetie
to their Campe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cassibelin,</hi> hearing of the vnhappie issue of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
after so many losses sustained on his part, (his
Country being wasted with warre) and himselfe in a
maner forsaken, by the revolt of the cities round about,
(which most of all discouraged him) sent Ambassadors
to <hi>Caesar</hi> by <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Arras,</hi> offering to submit himselfe
vpon reasonable conditions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> determining to winter in <hi>Gallia</hi> (the state of his
affaires there requiring it) and the summer being almost
spent, commanded that he should deliver certaine pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for assurance of his obedience, and that he should
offer no wrong, nor give cause of offence to <hi>Mandubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
or the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> whom he had taken into speciall
protection. And then having imposed a Tribute, to be
payed yearly by the <hi>Britans,</hi> to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> he
marched towards the seaside, where he embarqued his
forces, and arrived with them safely in the continent.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Caesar</hi> having rather shewed some part of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie</hi>
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> then made a conquest of the
whole: supposed he had done sufficiently for his owne
glorie, in vndertaking a matter so rare and difficult in

those times. At his comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> he presented
there certaine captives (which he had taken in the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
warres) whose strangenesse of shape and behaviour
filled the peoples eyes, both with wonder, and delight.
He offered also in the Temple of <hi>Venus genetrix</hi> a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote
embrodered with <hi>British</hi> Pearle, as a <hi>Trophy,</hi> and

Howbeit <hi>Narcissus</hi> giving way to their furie for the

by reason of a firie leame shooting from the <hi>East</hi>
towards the <hi>West</hi> (the self same way that they directed

againe, and with some difficultie (through the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
of wind and tide,) arrived in the Iland without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                     <p>The valor and fortune of Vespasian in the British warre.
He subdueth the Ile of Wight. The Expedition of
Claudius the Emperour into Britannie. He defeateth
the Britans, and planteth a Colonie of old souldiers
at Maldon in Essex. His sonne is surnamed Britanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.
At his returne to Rome, he is honoured with a

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the meane time, <hi>Vespasian</hi> was imploied in other
places of the Ile, where fortune seemed to lay the
foundation of that greatnesse, vnto which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
attained; For in a short space, he fought thirtie
times with the <hi>Britans,</hi> overcomming two warlike na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and taming the fierce<note n="a" place="margin">The ancient Inhabitants of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, Wilton, and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton.</note> 
                     <hi>Belgae,</hi> whose ancestors,
comming hither at the first out of <hi>Gallia Belgica,</hi> either
to take booties, or to make war, gave the name of their
owne Countrey to such places as they had subdued:
(a custom commonly vsed among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> when they
seated themselves in any part of this Iland.)</p>
                  <p>With like fortunate successe <hi>Vespasian</hi> proceeded in
attempting, and conquering the Ile<note n="b" place="margin">The Ile of Wight.</note> 
                     <hi>Vectis,</hi> that lieth on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8449:24"/>
the South side of <hi>Britannie,</hi> when <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperor
being now furnished of all things necessarie for the
<hi>British</hi> expedition, set forward with a mightie armie,
consisting of horsemen, footmen, and Elephants. He
marched first to <hi>Ostia:</hi> from thence to <hi>Massilia:</hi> the rest
of the voyage he made by land to<note n="a" place="margin">Bolein in Picardie.</note> 
                     <hi>Gessoriacum</hi> in <hi>Gallia,</hi>
where he embarqued. His forces being safely transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the Ile, were led towards the river <hi>Thamisis,</hi>
where <hi>Plautius</hi> and <hi>Vespasian</hi> with their power attended
his comming; so the two armies being ioyn'd togither,
crossed the river againe. The <hi>Britans</hi> that were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to encounter them, began the fight, which was
sharply maintained on both sides, till in the end, a great
number of the Ilanders being slaine, the rest fled into
the woods, through which the <hi>Romans</hi> pursued them,
even to the towne of<note n="b" place="margin">Maldon in Essex.</note> 
                     <hi>Camalodunum,</hi> which had bin the
royall seate of <hi>Cunobelm,</hi> and was then one of the most
defensible places in the dominions of the <hi>Trinobantes.</hi>
This towne they surprised, and afterwards fortified,
planting therin a <hi>Colonie</hi> of old souldiers, to strengthen
those parts and to keepe the inhabitants there in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Then were the <hi>Britans</hi> disarmed, howbeit <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
remitted the confiscation of their goods; for which
favour the barbarous people erected a Temple and an
Altar vnto him, honouring him as a god. Now the
States of the countrey round about, being so weakned
by the losse of their neighbours, and their owne civill
dissentions, as they were vnable to resist the <hi>Roman</hi>
power any longer, began to offer their submission, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to obey, and live peaceably vnder the <hi>Roman</hi>
government; and so, by little, and little, the hither part
of the Ile was reduced into the forme of a Province.</p>
                  <p>In honour of this victorie, <hi>Claudius</hi> was divers times
saluted by the name of <hi>Imperator,</hi> contrarie to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

custome, which permitted it but once for one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.
The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> also, vpon advertisement
of his successe, decreed, that he should be called <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi>
and that his sonne should have the same title, as a
surname proper and hereditarie to the <hi>Claudian</hi> familie.

to fight, choosing a place that was compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with a rude trench, which had a narrow entrance

the <hi>Roman</hi> Captaine, (although he wanted the strength

                     <p>Ostorious the Roman Generall maketh warre vpon the
Silures and Ordovices, the ancient Inhabitants of
South-wales, and North-wales. Caractacus their
captaine being overthrowne in battaile, flieth for succor
to Cartismandua the Princesse of the Brigantes, who
then inhabited that part of the Ile which now contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the counties of Yorke, Lancaster, Durham,
Westmerland, and Cumberland. He is betraied and
delivered to Ostorius.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THen the armie marched against the <hi>Silures,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
their naturall boldnes, relied much vpon the
strength of <hi>Caractacus</hi> their leader, a man that had
waded through great dangers, and had bin fortunate in
many adventures, having gotten thereby such reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as he was preferred before all the <hi>British</hi> captaines.
But as in policie and knowledge of the country, he had
an advantage of the <hi>Romans:</hi> so perceiving himselfe to
be vnequally matched in strength, he removed the
warre to the<note n="a" place="margin">The ancient Inhabitants of North-wales.</note> 
                     <hi>Ordovices,</hi> who entring into the action
with him, (as fearing alike the <hi>Roman</hi> power) resolved
ioyntly to hazard the chaunce of warre. And hereupon
they prepared for battell, having chosen a place verie
commodious for themselves, and disadvantageable for
their enemies. Then they went to the top of an hill,
and where they found any easy passage vp, they stopped
the way with heapes of stones, in maner of a rampire.
Not farre off, ran a River with an vncertaine foord,
where, vpon the banke, a company of the best souldiers
were placed, for a defence in the fore-ward. The leaders
went about, exhorting, and encouraging the common
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8449:27"/>
souldiers, vsing such perswasions as might best fit their
humors, and the present occasion; and <hi>Caractacus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
coursing vp and downe, protested, that that day,
and that battel, should be either the beginning of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie
of libertie, or of perpetuall servitude. Then he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vpon the names of his auncesters, that had chased
<hi>Caesar</hi> the <hi>Dictator</hi> out of the Ile, and had delivered
them from hatchets, and Tributes, and protected their
wives and children from shame and violence. While he
vttered these, or the like speeches, the people round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him made a noyse, and euerie man sware, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the religion of his Country, that neither their
enemies weapons, nor their owne wounds, should
make them to give over. That cheerfull crie, terrified
and astonied the <hi>Roman</hi> Generall, and the rather, when
he considered how he was couped in, having the river
beneath him, the fort before him, the high hils hanging
over it, and all things on euerie side threatning daunger
and destruction to the assailers. Howbeit his souldiers
demaunded the battell, crying, <hi>That there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which valour could not overcome.</hi> The <hi>Prefects</hi>
and <hi>Tribunes,</hi> vsing the like speeches, added courage to
the rest.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Ostorius</hi> having viewed the places of difficult
accesse, led his Souldiers (being hot and eagre of the
fight) vnto the further side of the river, and from thence
to the Rampire, where while they fought with their
Darts, they had the woorst, but having broken downe
the rude compacted heape of stones with a <hi>Testudo,</hi> and
both armies comming to handie strokes vpon equal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vauntage,
the <hi>Britans</hi> turned their backs, and ran to the
hill top, the <hi>Romans</hi> pursuing them, both with their
light and heauie armed souldiers, the one assailing with
darts, and the other (as they marched thicke togither)
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8449:28"/>
breaking the ranks, and beating downe the barbarous
people, who had neither head-peece, nor armor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves, so that being hedged in betweene the
<hi>Legionarie</hi> souldiers, and the <hi>Auxiliaries,</hi> the greatest part
of them were slaine in the place.</p>
                  <p>At this assault <hi>Caractacus</hi> his wife, and daughter
were taken prisoners, and his brethren yeelded to the
enemies; but himselfe driven to extremitie, escaped by
flight into the Countrie of the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> hoping to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
some aide of <hi>Cartismandua</hi> the soveraigne Lady
there. But, as it falleth out commonly with men in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie,
to be forsaken and left succorlesse: so insteed of
finding the reliefe which he expected, he fell into the
danger which he little doubted. For <hi>Cartismandua,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fearing her owne estate, or thinking to win favour
of the Conqueror (as Princes oft times make vse of one
anothers misfortunes to serve their own turnes) detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him in prison a while, and afterward delivered him
to <hi>Ostorius,</hi> who was exceeding glad that he had gotten
him, and forthwith sent him to <hi>Rome,</hi> as a prize of great

                  <p>THe report of <hi>Caractacus</hi> misfortune was soone
spred throughout the Iles and Provinces adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
for his name was renowmed in most parts of
<hi>Italie,</hi> and each man desired to see him, who had so long
time withstood, and contemned that power, which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8449:28"/>
held all the world in awe, and obedience. The Citty of
<hi>Rome</hi> for many dayes togither was filled only with talke
of him, and expectation of his comming; and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
himselfe as a Conqueror, by extolling his owne
worthinesse, covertly added more glory to the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
The people assembled togither, as it were to see
some notable and rare spectacle. The Emperors guard in
armes were orderly placed in the field before the camp.
After this preparation made, the prisoners, and <hi>Trophies</hi>
were presented in this maner; First the vassals of <hi>Caracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
going formost, bowed their bodies to the people,
as they passed, and seemed by their rufull countenances
to discover their feare. The caparisons, chaines, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
spoiles taken in the warre, were carried after them.
Then <hi>Caractacus</hi> his Brethren, his Wife, and Daughters
followed; and last of all came <hi>Caractacus</hi> himselfe. His
bodie was naked, for the most part, and painted with the
figures of diverse beasts. He ware a chain of yron about
his necke, and another about his middle. The haire of
his head hanging downe in long locks (curled by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
covered his backe and shoulders, and the haire of
his vpper lip being parted on both sides, lay vpon his
breast. The rest of his body was shaven all over. Neither
was his behaviour lesse noted, then the strangenes of
his habite: For he neither hung down his head, nor cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
mercie (as the rest did) but went on boldly with a
setled and sterne countenance, till he came before the
Emperors <hi>Tribunall</hi> seat, and there standing stil a while,
he after spake these, or the like wordes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If either my vertues in prosperitie, had beene an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable

might have come to this Citie, to have beene enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
rather as a Friend, than as a captive to be gazed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8449:29"/>
vpon; For it should have beene no disgrace for the
<hi>Romans,</hi> to have admitted into societie with them, a
man royally discended, and a commaunder of manie
warlike Nations. But what cloud soever <hi>Fortune</hi> hath
cast over my estate, she is not able to take from me
those things, which the heavens and Nature have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me: (that is,) the dignitie of my Birth, and the
courage of my Mind, which never failed me: I know
it is a custome among you, to make your <hi>Triumphs,</hi>
the spectacles of other mens miseries, and in this my
Calamitie, as in a Mirror, you do now behold your
owne glorie. Yet know, that I was sometimes a
Prince, furnished with strength of men, and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of warre; and what marvaile is it, that I have
now lost them, since your owne experience hath
taught you, that the events of warre are variable, and
vncertaine? I thought that the deepe Waters, which
like a Wall enclose vs, (whom the heavens seeme to
have placed farre off, in another world by it selfe,)
might have bin a sufficient defence for vs against for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
invasion: But I see now, that your Desire of
soveraigntie admits no limitation, since neither the
danger of an vnknown Sea, nor the distance of place,
can any longer warrant our safetie and libertie. If you

For mine owne part, so long as I was able,
I made resistance, being vnwilling to submit my neck
to a forraine Yoke. The law of naturall reason al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
everie man to defend himselfe, being assailed,
and to withstand force, by force. Had I yeelded at

                  <p>The Emperor hearing this speech, and wondering

                  <p>FOr many dayes togither, <hi>Caractacus</hi> his Fortune
ministred matter of discourse to the Lords of the
Senate, who affirmed the spectacle of his captivitie
to be no lesse honorable, then that of <hi>Syphax</hi> the <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
King, over whom <hi>P. Scipio</hi> triumphed, or that of
<hi>Perses,</hi> whom <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> vanquished, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kings, that had in former times beene taken in
warre, and shewed to the people. Then publike honors
of triumph were decreed for <hi>Ostorius,</hi> whose fortunes
being now at the highest, began afterwards to decline,
by reason, that either <hi>Caractacus</hi> (the obiect of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour)
being removed, he supposed he had made a full
conquest, and therfore followed the service more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly:
or else, for that the residue of the <hi>Britans,</hi> having
compassion of the misfortune of so mightie a Prince,
and being eagre of revenge, renued the warre; for they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8449:30"/>
assayled the <hi>Legionary Cohorts</hi> which were left behind to
build fortresses in the <hi>Silures</hi> Country, killed the camp-Maister,
and eight Centurions, besides some of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardest
souldiers, and they had put all the rest to the
sword, if speedy rescue had not come from the villages
and Forts adioining. Diuerse other sallies they made, as
time and place gave them advantage, prevailing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by strength, sometimes by pollicie, and somtimes
by chance. The Principal motive, that enduced the rest
to take armes, was the example of the <hi>Silures,</hi> who were
most resolutely bent, as being exasperated, by reason of
as peech that the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor had vsed, which was:
That he would root out the name of the <hi>Silures,</hi> as the
<hi>Sicambrians</hi> had beene in former time. This made them
bold and desperate to adventure, as men knowing their
destinie before hand. Many skirmishes they had, in sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising
the scattered troupes of the <hi>Roman</hi> souldiers, and
often times with good successe, in taking rich booties,
and prisoners, and distributing the spoiles among their
neighbours, by which meanes they drew them also to
revolt. In the meane time, <hi>Ostorius</hi> wearied with care
and travaile, ended his life.</p>

                     <hi>CLaudius</hi> the Emperour being advertised of the
death of <hi>Ostorius,</hi> sent <hi>Aulus Didius</hi> to take charge
of the armie in <hi>Britannie,</hi> where notwithstanding
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8449:30"/>
all the haste he made, he found all out of frame: <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Valens</hi> with his <hi>Legion</hi> having encountred the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
with ill successe, which by report of the Ilanders,
was made greater then indeed it was, to terrifie the new
Governour, who also made vse of the same policie to
serve his owne turne; for, by encreasing the fame of that
which he heard reported, he supposed, either to win
greater praise, if he prevailed, or to purchase a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
censure of his actions, if he miscarried. The
<hi>Silures</hi> had made many roades into the subdued Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
wasting, and spoyling round about, when <hi>Didius</hi>
the <hi>Lievtenant,</hi> vpon his first arrivall, entering into the
field, restrained their outrage, and for a while kept
them in some awe.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Caractacus</hi> was taken, <hi>Venutius,</hi> a Prince faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and protected by them (so long as
<hi>Cartismandua</hi> his wife and he agreed togither) vpon
private discontentment began a new rebellion. For
<hi>Cartismandua</hi> (whom the <hi>Romans</hi> specially favored for
the deliverie of <hi>Caractacus</hi>) abounding now in peace,
wealth, and plentie (which are commonly the nurses
of licencious living) fell in love with <hi>Velocatus</hi> one of
her husbands servants, and forgetting in the end her
owne honour, preferred him before <hi>Venutius,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deeply touched with such an open iniurie, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
raised a power, to expell her and her Paramour
out of the Kingdome. The warre seemed at the first, to
have beene maintained betweene themselves, and their
private followers onely, till <hi>Cartismandua,</hi> by pollicie,
had taken <hi>Venutius</hi> his brother, and certaine of his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
and then the Inhabitants round about, fearing
the event, and disdaining to be brought vnder the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
yoke of a woman, declared themselves for <hi>Venutius,</hi>
and with a choise number of youthfull and well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8449:31"/>
Souldiers, invaded the Country: whereof <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
having timely intelligence, sent certaine <hi>Cohorts</hi> to
encounter them. Hereupon insued a sharpe Conflict,
the successe whereof was much doubted in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but in the end the <hi>Romans</hi> prevailed. The like
fortune also had <hi>Caesius Nasica</hi> with his <hi>Legion;</hi> For <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
himselfe, as a man striken in yeares, and fitter to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,

of other men, keeping that which his Predecessors
had gotten, and building onely some few Castles, and
places of Defence within the land, to win thereby, a
fame of augmenting the office.</p>

died, leaving the <hi>Roman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie
to <hi>Nero</hi> his adopted sonne,
who (after his first five yeares
spent) being given over to all kinds
of vice, neglected the government
both at home and abroad, not daring to enter into any
militare action; and it was thought that he would have
revoked the armie out of <hi>Britannie,</hi> if verie shame in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8449:33"/>
from his fathers glorie, and loosing that which

                  <p>About that time <hi>Veranius</hi> was Governour in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie,</hi>
where the shortnesse of his continuance suffred
him not to effect any great matter; for he died in the
first yeare of his government, and then was the Province
assigned to <hi>Suetonius Paulinus,</hi> one of the most famous
men of that age for militare affaires. His good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
at his first entrance, in subduing nations, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
Garrisons (where need required) made him
bold to assaile the Ile of<note n="a" place="margin">Anglesey.</note> 
                     <hi>Mona,</hi> (lying in the West part
of <hi>Britannie</hi>) as having beene a common receptacle of
Fugitives during the warre. In his passage thither, he
left the Country behind him (as he marched) vnfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in diverse places, laying it therby open to all opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of annoyance. At his arrivall, the barbarous
people rudely armed, standing vpon the shore, made
shew of their purpose to resist: The women in mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
attire (their haire about their eares) shaking bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
fire-brands like Furies of hell, ran vp and downe,
and the <hi>Druydes</hi> lifting vp their hands toward heaven,
filled the ayre with cries and curses.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Druydes</hi> were certain Priests, had in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
among the <hi>Britans.</hi> They kept their residence,
for the most part, in shadie and darke groves (as fittest
places for devotion.) Among all trees, they most estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Oake, as halowed, and without the which,
they could not performe their superstitious rites. Their
sacrifices were both private &amp; publike. They instructed
the youth of <hi>Britannie,</hi> and decided controversies, civil,
and criminall. If any man refused to stand to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
he was forbidden to be present at their sacrifices,
which was accounted the greatest punishment that
might be; for thereby he was reputed a notorious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8449:33"/>
exempt from the ordinarie protection of the
lawes, vncapable of any preferment, and all men would
flie his companie. Amongst these Priests, there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
one that had the chiefe authoritie; and he being
dead, the worthiest of them that survived, succeeded in
his place. If there seemed to be an equalitie of worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
among more then one, then the choise was made
by pluralitie of voyces. At one certaine time in the
yeare, they vsed to hold a Sessions in <hi>Gallia,</hi> in some
consecrated place, where they heard and determined
causes; For the superstition was first carried thither out
of <hi>Britannie.</hi> They had immunitie from all maner of
Tributes, and from service in the warres; by reason of
which priviledges, they drew to them many followers,
whom they taught a great number of verses by heart,
supposing it vnlawfull to commit those sacred things
to writing; whereas in other matters, as well publike,
as private, they vsed the <hi>Greeke</hi> letters. And this it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they did, either for that they would not have the
knowledge of their superstitious rites laid open to the
common people, (in whom ignorance seemeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender
a kind of devotion) or else, for that they would
have their schollers to trust the more to their memorie,
while they wanted the helpe of writing. They preached
that the soule was immortall, and that after the death
of one man, it went into another. By this perswasion,
they stirred vp men to vertue, and tooke away the feare
of death (the maine obstacle of glorious adventures.)
Other things they taught also concerning the motion
of the Starres, the situation of the earth, and the power
of their prophane gods.</p>
                  <p>The strange behavior of these religious Priests, and
the out-cries of the people of <hi>Mona,</hi> so amazed the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
souldiers, that like men inchaunted, they stood still
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8449:34"/>
without motion, till the Captain spake vnto them, and
encouraged them to adventure, not fearing a flocke of
feelie women, or frantike people; and then boldly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the charge, he soone disordered &amp; dispersed them,
making himselfe maister of the field: which done, the
<hi>Roman</hi> souldiers entred the Townes, and placed garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
there, felling the woods, which the Inhabitants
superstitiously reputed holy, by reason of the Altars,
whereupon they sacrificed the blood of captives, and
prophecied of the successe of their owne affaires, by
viewing the entralls of men, whom they had killed.</p>

of bondage, to lay their injuries togither, aggravating
them by their owne Constructions, and complaining,
that their patience had profited them nothing, but to
draw heavier burdens vpon them, as men that would
gently beare: <q>That whereas in former times they had
onely one Commander, now there was two thrust
vpon them, the <hi>Lievtenant</hi> to sucke their blood, and
the <hi>Procurator</hi> their substance, whose disagreement
was the vexation of the subject, and agreement, their
vtter vndoing, while the one burdened them with
Souldiers and Captaines, the other with wrongs, and
indignities: that the lust and covetousnesse of these
their enemies, laid hold vpon all persons, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8449:35"/>
that though in the field, he that spoyleth,
be commonly the stronger, yet themselves were, by
Cowards and weaklings (for the most part) dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of their houses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bereft of their Children, enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to yeeld Souldiers for other mens behoofe, as
though they were such a kind of people, as knew
how to do any thing else, save onely to die for their
owne Countrey; For otherwise there was but a
handfull of Souldiers come over, if they did but rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
their owne number, considering withall, that
<hi>Germanie</hi> had alreadie shaken off the yoke, having no
<hi>Ocean</hi> Sea, but a river to defend it: that the causes
then moving them to take armes, were just, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable;
namely to recover their libertie, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Parents, Wives, Children, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
whereas the <hi>Romans</hi> had nothing to provoke
them to warre, but their owne covetousnesse, and
wanton lust, and were likely enough to depart (as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caesar</hi> had done) if themselves would imitate the
vertues of their progenitors; and not be dismaid with
the doubtfull event of one skirmish, or two, seeing
that men in miserie have commonly more courage
(then at other times) and more constancie to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue:
and now the heavens themselves seemed to
pittie their poore estate, by sending the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
out of the way, and confining the army (as it
were) into another Iland; by which meanes, opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
of revenge, and hope of libertie was offred:
and finally, that being assembled, to devise, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
togither, they had obtained the hardest point
in an action of that nature, wherein it were more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be taken consulting, then doing.</q> With these
and the like speeches they stirred vp one another, each
man laying open his owne particular greevances, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8449:35"/>
adding them to the common cause.</p>
                  <p>About this time, diverse prodigious signes were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to portend the subversion of the <hi>Roman Colonie,</hi> as
namely, an Image of <hi>Victorie</hi> falling downe reversed at
<hi>Camalodunum;</hi> Strange noyses sounding in the ayre:
Strange apparitions seene in the sea: The <hi>Ocean</hi> bloody
in shew: and the print of mens bodies vpon the sands.
Diverse constructions were made of these things as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous,
whether that they proceed of some naturall
causes (though not alwayes observed,) or else, that they
do necessarily forego the ruine and change of great
States. Howbeit commonly in such cases, mens minds
do mis-give them, while they frame the future event of
things answerable to their owne fearefull imaginations;
and great alterations falling out sometimes after like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
they superstitiously suppose them, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the certaine fore-runners of destruction. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of these things, at the first, strooke the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
with greater feare, by reason of the absence of
their General, and thereupon they required the ayde of
<hi>Catus Decianus</hi> the <hi>Procurator,</hi> who sent a small compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
badly armed, to renforce the garrison. The old soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
that had beene left within the Towne, (although
few in number) yet trusting to the franchize of the
Temple, and not doubting the secret conspiracie of
their confederates, were in a maner carelesse, as in times
of peace, following their pleasures, and making no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for defence. The <hi>Britans,</hi> having in the meane
time, taken armes vnder the conduct of <hi>Voadica,</hi> a Ladie
of the blood of their kings (for in matter of government
they made no difference of sex) and being informed of
the state of the <hi>Colonie,</hi> determined first to assaile the
townes and forts in their passage thither, which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
accordingly, &amp; with no great difficulty surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the greatest number of them.</p>

                  <p>THe good successe the <hi>Britans</hi> had in taking in some
places of defence, as they marched forward, made
them desirous and adventurous to invade the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie</hi>
it selfe: and <hi>Voadica</hi> as their leader, being a woman
of a great spirit, and comely personage, (apparelled in a
loose gowne of diverse colours, with a golden chaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
her necke, and a light speare in her hand) standing
vpon a heape of Turves, the better to be seene (her
daughters on each side of her) with a shrill voice vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
these, or the like words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is no new custome for the <hi>Britans</hi> to make warre
vnder the leading of women, ennobled by their
birth and discent; the examples of former times can
well witnesse the experience thereof. Howbeit at this
present, I wil disclaime all titles of dignitie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
of blood: and what difference soever there
is in our estates, yet shall our fortune, in this action, be
indifferent and common to vs both. I shall not need
to repeate that, which you all know but too well;
namely, what miseries we have endured vnder the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
of this prowd Nation. You have had the triall
both of libertie and bondage, and I doubt not, but
you find now, how much the one is to be preferred
before the other; and howsoever some of you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
for private respects, have inclined to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
governors, as favourers of their vsurped sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8449:36"/>
yet I suppose you will now confesse with
me, that freedome in a poore estate, is better then
golden fetters. For what abuse can there be named
so vile, or indignitie so disgracefull, that hath not bin
offered vs, without respect of degree, age, or sex? we
till our grounds, &amp; sweat for other men, that reap the
sweat of our travells; the wealth that we gather to
maintaine our selves, and our families, is by other
men wastfully and riotously mis-spent; we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
our owne, but what they leave vs, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left vs, but labour and vexation; our bodies
and estates being consumed, to satisfie their ambition
&amp; covetousnes; We have not so much as our heads
toll-free: so narrowly are we sifted, from the highest
to the lowest. Other subdued Nations are yet by
death freed from bondage; but we, even after death
seeme to live still in thraldome, while we are enforced
to pay tribute, as wel for the dead, as the living. What!
are we a nation so contemptible, that we can serve to
no other vse, then to be slaves? or so vnhappie, that
death it self can not acquite vs from being miserable?
How long shall we give way to our owne wrongs?
Shall we hope for reformation of these abuses? Nay,
we have hoped too long, and by patient bearing of
one injurie, we have drawn on another. Why should
we not rather seeke to redresse them? for if we enter
into due consideration of our selves, what are the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
more then we? our bodies are as strong as theirs:
our numbers greater. We have agilitie of body, (our
women no lesse then our men) to run, to leape, to
swim, and to performe all warlike exercises; for
which (indeed) we are naturally more fit, then for the
spade, plough, or handy-crafts. And how soever the
<hi>Romans</hi> may seeme fortunate by the folly, or weaknes
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8449:37"/>
of other Nations: yet are they not comparable vnto
vs, whom Nature hath framed to endure hunger,
cold, and labour, and to be content with things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
onely. For to vs everie herbe and roote is
meate, each river, and spring yeeldeth vs drinke,
while we seeke no further, then to appease hunger,
and quench thirst; each tree serves for shelter against
storms in winter, &amp; for shadow against the parching
heate of summer, we need no other beds then the
earth, nor covering then the heavens; whereas they
must have their joynts suppled with hot baths, sweet
oyntments, and soft couches, and their bodies pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
with wine, daintie fare, and all kind of effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
nicenesse and delicacie. These be the properties,
wherein they imitate their master <hi>Nero,</hi> who hath
onely the shape of a man, being indeed a woman, or
rather, neither man nor woman, but a monster of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a singer, a fidler, a stage-player, a murtherer, and
one that excelleth other men as farre in vice, as
he doth in preheminence of degree. Besides all
this, the cause of our warre is just, and the Divine
powers (that favour justice,) have made our first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
prosperous: and me thinketh, that the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of our case, were able to make, even Cowards, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant.
Your ancesters could make head against <hi>Iulius
Caesar,</hi> and the Emperours <hi>Caligula,</hi> and <hi>Claudius.</hi> The
<hi>Germans</hi> have lately freed themselves by that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
overthrow of the <hi>Roman Legions,</hi> vnder the
conduct of <hi>Quintilius Varus;</hi> and shall not we, (who
scorne to be reputed inferiour to the <hi>Germans</hi> in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour)
be confident in our owne strength, and boldly
adventure? considering that if we prevaile, we reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our lost libertie, if we be forced to retire, we have
woods, hills, and marishes for our refuge, and if we
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8449:37"/>
die, we doe but sell those lives with honour, which
we cannot possesse with safetie. For mine owne
part, you shall find me no lesse readie to execute,
(when time serves,) then I am now to advise and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
you: my selfe having determined, either to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish,
or die; If any of you be otherwise minded, then
live, and be slaves still.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>With these and the like speeches, she inflamed the
hearts that were alreadie kindled, and perswading the
<hi>Britans</hi> to pursue their enemies, as Dogs and Woolves
doe fearefull Hares and Foxes, she let slip out of her lap
a quick Hare, at whose running through the campe, the
<hi>Britans</hi> showted, apprehending it as a matter ominous,
and fore-signifying the <hi>Romans</hi> flight. And thereupon
they cried, that they might be speedily led to the <hi>Colonie</hi>
it selfe, (as the seat of their slaverie) which at their first
comming they surprised, killing, spoyling, &amp; consuming
all with sword and fire, except the Temple onely, into
which the Souldiers fled as a <hi>Sanctuarie,</hi> though it
could not long protect them from the violence of
the furious multitude. <hi>Petilius Cerealis</hi> the <hi>Lievtenant</hi> of

out of <hi>Mona,</hi> and led his armie with some difficultie
towards <hi>London,</hi> (a place not knowne at that time
by the name of a <hi>Colonie,</hi>) but famous onely for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Merchants and trafficke. There he staied a
while, as doubting what course to take: the small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his forces, and the ill successe of <hi>Cerealis</hi> making
him more warie; and he supposed it would be a worke
well worth his labor, if with the losse of one Towne, he
could preserve the rest, that were likely to revolt. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
furnishing his defective Companies with such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men as were then in the Towne, although the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi>
with teares implored his aide, and desired his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade
there for their defence: yet he marched forward,
leaving behind him all such, as either by reason of their
age, sex, or other infirmities could not folow, or else, for
love of the place, (as being bred and born there) would
not abandon it. The towne being thus weakly garded,
was taken by the <hi>Britans,</hi> and the people therein put all
to the sword. The like calamitie befell the free-towne
of<note n="a" place="margin">An ancient Citie, with whose ruines saint Albans was built.</note> 
                     <hi>Verulamium,</hi> by reason that diverse of the <hi>Britans</hi>
finding their owne strength, forsooke their forts, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailed
the most notable and wealthie places, enriching
themselves with the spoil of their enemies, whom they
hanged, burned, and crucifyed, exercising all kinds of
crueltie that a mind enraged with desire of revenge,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8449:38"/>
could devise. They tooke no prisoners, either to pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>serve
for ransome, or to exchange, according to the
lawes of warre, but slue both Citizens and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
to the number of about seuentie thousand. <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
with the <hi>Fourteenth Legion,</hi> seconded by the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-bearers
of the <hi>Twentieth,</hi> and some <hi>Auxiliaries,</hi>
made haste to encounter the <hi>Britans,</hi> and resolved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further delay, to trie the chance of a set battaile.
Then he pitched in a place that had a narrow entrance,
with a thicke wood for a defence behind him, and a
faire wide plaine before his Campe. The <hi>Legionarie</hi>
Souldiers were marshalled togither in thicke ranks, the

making wings on each side. <hi>Poenius Posthumus</hi>
the Campe-Master of the <hi>Second Legion,</hi> was appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                  <p>In the meane time the <hi>Britans</hi> ranged abroad in

and being encouraged by the example of <hi>Voadica</hi> their

                     <hi>SVetonius</hi> being now readie to joyne battaile, though
he perceived that his Souldiers, were not much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied
with the sight of so great numbers scattered
vpon the Plaine; yet he supposed it not vnnecessarie to
vse some speech to them, by way of exhortation, and
therefore began in this maner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I can not now vse many words to exhort you; the
time permits it not, and the present occasion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
rather deeds then words. Yet let not our small
number discourage you, considering that your ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
with a smaller number have vndertaken greater
matters; and that, where many <hi>Legions</hi> have beene in
the field, a few Souldiers have carried away the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie;
What a glorie shall it be for you then, if with
so small a power, you can purchase the praise of a
whole army? There is no feare of Ambush; the
Woods gard you behind, and on the Plaine before
you lieth your enemies Campe, wherein you may
behold more women then men, and the men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for the most part, vnarmed, and not likely to
endure the poynts and strokes of our weapons,
which they have so often felt to their smart. It stands
you now vpon, to approove your selves the same
men you are reputed to be. This is the time, either to
recover that you have lost, or, to loose that which
you shall never recover. You fight now, not for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8449:39"/>
onely, but for Honour and Life. Remember
that you are <hi>Romans,</hi> whose glorie it is to doe, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
great things. The fortune of this battell wil either
give vs peaceable possession of that our forefathers
have wonne, or for ever deprive vs of it; What shall
become of you, if you be taken, the woful experience
of your Countrimen, most miserably massacred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your eyes may sufficiently testifie. Revenge
therefore both their wrongs, and your owne, and no
doubt, but the gods themselves (who never leave
crueltie vnpunished) wil assist you. It is better for vs to
die in this Action, then by yeelding, or flying, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
the praise of our owne worthinesse. But whether
we live or die, <hi>Britannie</hi> shall be ours; for if we live
and recover it, our posteritie ever after shall be able to
defend it; and though they should not, yet shall our
bones keepe continuall possession of it. Take courage
therefore, and feare not the lowd and vaine showts of
a disordered multitude, but boldly give the assault,
and keeping your selves close togither, pursue the
fight, without thinking of the spoile, till you have
made a ful end. For the victorie once gotten, al things
else will of themselves fall to your share.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>With these, or the like words, the old Souldiers were
pricked forward, and <hi>Suetonius</hi> perceiving it, gave the
signall of battell. The <hi>Legions</hi> kept the strait, as a place
of defence, till the <hi>Britans</hi> had spent their Darts: and
then they sallyed out into the Plaine, (the <hi>Auxiliaries,</hi>
and the horsemen making way) and pressed into the
thickest troopes of the barbarous people, who being
vnable to endure the fiercenesse of the assault, turned
their backs, thinking to save themselves by flight; But by
reason their waggons, placed about the Plain, had hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the passages on all sides, few of them escaped.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8449:40"/>
The residue, as well women as men, were put to the
sword, and their dead bodies (mingled with the carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of their Horses and Chariots) were heaped one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another. The number of the <hi>Britans</hi> slaine in that
battaile, was reported to be about fourescore thousand,
and of the <hi>Romans</hi> about foure hundred onely, and not
many mo wounded in the conflict. This dayes service
was renowmed among the <hi>Romans,</hi> as comparable to
those of auncient times in the free Common-wealth.

                     <hi>TVrpilianus</hi> was a man of a soft spirit, and being a

                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:8449:41"/>
besides his insufficiencie, abused the authoritie of his
place, to enrich himself by polling the Common soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and <hi>Roscius Coelius</hi> Lievtenant of the <hi>Twentieth

that <hi>Trebellius</hi> being despised, as well by the Aydes, as
the <hi>Legions</hi> (both of them sorting themselves to <hi>Coelius</hi>

he sought to prevent, rather by flying away, then by
executing any exemplarie Iustice vpon offenders. In
the meane time, the Souldiers neglecting the ancient
discipline of warre, fell to mutinie, and all kind of riot,
as men that had rather be doing ill, then doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And afterwards, <hi>Trebellius</hi> taking againe his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

                  <p>IN this estate <hi>Iulius Agricola</hi> (having bin trained vp for
the most part in the <hi>British</hi> warre) did find the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
at his first comming thither. He crossed the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Seas about the midst of Summer; at which time, as
though the season of the yeare had bin past to begin a
new warre, the <hi>Roman</hi> soldiers attended an end of their
travel, &amp; the <hi>Britans</hi> a beginning of annoyance to their
enemies. The <hi>Ordovices</hi> a little before he landed, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
cut in peeces a troope of horsemen that lay vpon
their borders. Vpon which attempt, the country being
awaked, as desirous of warre, allowed the example, and
some staied to see how the new <hi>Lievtenant</hi> would take
it. <hi>Agricola</hi> in the mean time, although the summer was
spent, and the Bands lay dispersed in the Province (his
souldiers having fully presumed of rest for that yeare, &amp;
diverse officers of the armie being of opinion, that it
were better to keep, and assure the places suspected, then
to make any new attempt:) yet (all this notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding)
he resolved directly to encounter the danger; and
gathering togither the Ensignes of the <hi>Legions,</hi> &amp; some
few <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> (because the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> durst not discend
into indifferent ground) himselfe first of all, (to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

having in that conflict destroyed almost the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8449:43"/>
of the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> &amp; knowing right well, that Fame
must with Instance be followed, (for as the first should
fall out, so the rest would succeed:) he deliberated to
conquer the Iland of <hi>Mona;</hi> from the possession where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<hi>Paulinus</hi> had beene formerly revoked by the general
rebellion of <hi>Britannie:</hi> But ships being then wanting (as
in an enterprise not intended before) the policy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutenesse
of the Captaine, devised a speedie passage.
For he commaunded the most choise of the Aids (to
whom al the shallows were knowne, and who (after the
vse of their Country) were able to swim in their armor
if need were) to lay aside their carriage, and putting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
at once, suddainly to invade it. Which thing so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
the Inhabitants (who supposed that the <hi>Romans</hi>
would have stayed a certain time for ships, and such like
provision by Sea,) that now beleeving, nothing could
be hard or invincible to men, which came so minded
to make warre, they humbly intreated for peace, and
yeelded the Iland. Thus <hi>Agricola</hi> at his first entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
office (which time others vsed to consume in vaine
oftentation, or ambitious seeking of Ceremonies) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
withall into labors and dangers, became famous
indeed, and of great reputation. Howbeit he abused not
the prosperous proceeding of his affaires, to vanitie, or
braving in speeches; for he esteemed it an Action not
worthy the name of a Conquest, to keepe in order, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Laurel his letters of advertisement, but by stopping and
suppressing the fame of his doings, he greatly augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                  <p>AS touching the civill government, <hi>Agricola</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how the province stood affected, and being
taught also by experience of others, that armes
availe little to settle a new conquered state, (if violence
and wrongs be permitted) determined at the first to cut
off all causes of warre and rebellion. And beginning at
home, he first of all reformed his owne house, (a point
of more hardnesse to some men, then to governe a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.)
He committed no maner of publike affaires to
bondman or <hi>Libertine.</hi> He received no souldier neer his
person, vpon private affection of partiall suiters, nor vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
commendation, or intreatie of <hi>Centurions,</hi> but elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the best, and most serviceable. He would looke nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
into all things, yet not exact all things to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most:
light faults he would pardon, and the great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
correct, not alwayes punishing offenders, but oft
times satisfied with repentance, choosing rather, not to
preferre to office, such as were likely to offend, then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the offence, to condemne them. The augmentation
of Tribute and corne, he tempered, with equal dividing
of burdens, cutting away those petie extortions, which
grieved the <hi>Britans</hi> more then the tribute it selfe. For
the poore people, in former times were constrained, in a
mockerie, to wait at the Barne doores, which were lockt
against them, and first to buy corne, and after sell at a
low price. Severall wayes also, and farre distant places
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8449:44"/>
had beene assigned them by the Purveyors appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for carrying provisions from the nearest stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
campes, to those which were farre off, and out of
the way, (pettie officers in the meane time, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a gaine thereof, by sparing some, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
others at their pleasure) so as that which lay
open to all, and at hand, was turned onely to the private
profite of a few. By repressing these abuses in his first
yeare, a good opinion was conceived of the peace,
which either by the negligence, or partialitie of former
<hi>Lievtenants</hi> had beene no lesse feared, then warre. In
times of service he was verie painfull, and oft times
more adventurous in his owne person, then was fit for
a Generall; for himselfe would alwayes appoint his
ground for pitching the campe, and also be the first man
in prooving the Thickets, Bogges, or any other places
of danger, not suffring any corners or secret harbors vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searched,
but wasting and spoiling everie where with
suddaine incursions and assaults. Howbeit, when by
these meanes he had terrified the <hi>Britans,</hi> then would he
againe spare and forbeare, as hoping thereby to allure
them to peace; whereupon many Cities (which before
that time stood vpon termes of equality) gave hostages,
and meekly submitted themselves, receiving garrisons,
and permitting the <hi>Romans</hi> to fortifie a worke perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
with such foresight and judgement, as nothing
was ever attempted against them, while he continued
in office, whereas before that time, no new fortified
place in all <hi>Britannie</hi> escaped vnassailed. Thus farre had

the vse and profite one of the other, those strongest
members of the Empire. The Nature and fashions of
the <hi>Irish,</hi> did not then much differ from the <hi>British,</hi> but
the Ports and Haven Townes in <hi>Ireland</hi> were more
knowne and frequented, by reason of greater resort
thither of Merchants. <hi>Agricola</hi> having received a Prince
of that Countrey, (driven thence by civill dissention)
did vnder colour of curtesie and friendship retain him;
till occasion should serve to make vse of him. It was
afterwards reported, that with one <hi>Legion,</hi> and some
few Aydes, <hi>Ireland</hi> might then have beene wonne and
possessed, and that it would have beene also a meane to
have kept <hi>Britannie</hi> in obedience, if the <hi>Roman</hi> forces
had beene planted each where, and libertie (as it were)
cleane banished out of sight.</p>

Now in the Summer following, because a Generall
rising in armes of the further Nations beyond <hi>Bodotria,</hi>
was feared, (the passages being all beset with the power
of the barbarous people,) he manned a fleet to search
the Creekes and harbours of the ample region beyond
it, backing them first of all with a navy, &amp; with a goodly
shew bringing warre, both by land &amp; sea. And ofttimes
it chanced that the horsmen, and footmen, and the Sea-souldier
met, &amp; made merry in the same camp, ech man
extolling his owne prowesse and adventures, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their vaunts and comparisons souldier-like, some
of the woods and high mountaines that they had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
others of dangers of Rocks and Tempests that they
had endured: the one, of the land and the enemie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated:
the other, of the <hi>Ocean</hi> assayed, and subdued.
The <hi>Britans,</hi> (as by the Prisoners it was vnderstood)
were much amazed at the sight of the Navie, supposing
that (the secrets of their Sea, being now disclosed) there
remained no refuge for them, if they were overcome.
Whereupon the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> arming with great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and greater Fame, (as the maner is of matters vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne)
began to assaile their enemies Castles; and
some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Captains (which would seeme to
be wise, being (indeed) but Cowards) counselled the
Generall to retire on this side <hi>Bodotria,</hi> and rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
of his owne accord, then to be driven backe with
shame. In the meane season <hi>Agricola</hi> had knowledge,
that the <hi>Britans</hi> meant to divide themselves, and to give
the onset in severall companies: Whereupon lest he
should be enclosed about, and intrapped, either by their
multitude, or by their skill in the Passages, he marched
also with his army divided in three parts: which when
it was knowne to the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> they changed advise
on the sodaine, and vniting their forces togither, joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8449:47"/>
assaulted, by night, the <hi>Ninth Legion,</hi> as being of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
resistance: &amp; having slain the watch, (partly asleep,
&amp; partly amazed with feare) they broke into the camp,
&amp; were fighting within the trenches, when <hi>Agricola</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vnderstood by spies, what way the <hi>Britans</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and following their footsteps, commanded the
lightest horsemen, and footmen to play vpon their
backs, and to maintaine the skirmish. When the day
drew neere, the glittering of the Ensignes dazeled the
eyes of the <hi>Britans,</hi> who being daunted with feare of
danger on each side, began to draw backe: and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
like men that were now out of perill of their
lives, did fight more cheerfully for their honour, freshly
assailing the <hi>Britans,</hi> and driving them to their owne
gates, where in the verie straits the Conflict was sharpe
and cruell, til in the end the <hi>Britans</hi> were forced to flie,
whilest the <hi>Roman</hi> forces severally pursued them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
with a kind of emulation, the one to have hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the other, and the other to seeme to have needed
no helpe. Vpon the successe of this battell, the <hi>Roman</hi>
Souldiers presuming, that to their power al things were
easie, and open, cryed to the Generall to leade them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Caledonia,</hi> that with a course of continuall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,

                     <q>When I consider the cause of this warre, and out
present necessitie, I have reason (me seemes) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
that this day, and this our generall agreement,
will give a happie beginning to the freedome of the
whole Iland. For we have al hitherto lived in libertie,
and now no land remaineth beyond vs: no sea for
our safetie: the <hi>Roman</hi> Navy (as you see) surveying
and invironing our coasts; so that combat and armes
which men of vertue desire for honour, the dastard
must also vse for his securitie. The former battels
which have with diverse events bin fought with the
<hi>Romans,</hi> had their refuge &amp; hope resting in our hands.
For we the flower of the <hi>British</hi> Nobilitie, &amp; seated in
the furthest part of th'ile, did never yet see the borders
of those countries, which were brought vnder servile
subjection (our eies being still kept vnpolluted, &amp; free
from al contagion of tyranny.) Beyond vs is no land:
besides vs none are free: vs onlie hitherto, this corner
and secret harbor hath defended; You see the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
part of the land is laid open, and things the lesse
they have bin within knowledge, the greater is the
glorie to atchive them. But what nation is there now
beyond vs? what els but water and rocks? and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
Lords of all within the land, whose intollerable
pride in vaine shall you seeke to avoid by service and
humble behavior. They are the robbers of the world,
that having now left no land to be spoiled, search also
the sea. If the enemie be rich, they seek to win wealth:
if poor, they are content to gain glory to themselves,
whom neither the East nor West can satisfie, as being
the only men of al memory, that seek out al places, be
they wealthy, or poore, with like greedy affection. To
take away by main force, to kil and spoile, falsely they
terme Empire &amp; Government, when all is waste as a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8449:48"/>
wildernes, that they call peace. His children &amp; blood
each man holds by nature most deare, &amp; yet even they
are pressed for Souldiers, &amp; carried away to be slaves,
we know not where. Our sisters and wives, though
they be not violently forced, as in open hostilitie, yet
are they vnder the colour &amp; title of friends &amp; guests,
shamefully abused. Our goods &amp; substance they day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
draw from vs, rewarding vs onely with stripes and
indignities. Slaves which are borne to bondage, are
sold but once, &amp; after are fed at their owners expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
But <hi>Britannie</hi> dayly buieth, dayly feedeth, and is
at charges with her own bondage. And as in a private
retinue, the fresh man and last commer is scoffed at by
his fellow servants: so in this old servitude of the
whole world, they seeke onely the destruction of vs,
as being the latest attempted, and of al others, in their
opinion, the most vile. We have no fields to manure,
no mines to be digged, no ports to trad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> in; and to
what purpose then should they keepe vs alive, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the manhood, and fierce courage of the
subject doth not much please the jelous Soveraigne?
and this corner (being so secret &amp; out of the way) the
more securitie it yeeldeth to vs, the greater suspition
it worketh in them. Seeing therfore all hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
is past, it behooveth you at length to shew cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in defending and maintaining both your safetie
and honor. The <hi>Icenians</hi> led by a woman, fired the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Colonie,</hi> forced the castles, &amp; had the prosecution
of the war bin answerable to so luckie a beginning, the
Southern <hi>Britans</hi> might then with ease have shaken
off the yoke, and prevented our perill. We, as yet, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
touched, never subdued, but borne to be free, not
slaves to the <hi>Romans:</hi> we (I say) are now to make proof
of our valor, &amp; to shew in this encounter, what maner
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8449:49"/>
of men <hi>Caledonia</hi> hath reserved in store for her selfe.
Do you think that the <hi>Romans</hi> be as valiant in warre
as they are wanton in peace? No, you are deceived.
For they are growne famous, not by their owne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
but by our jarres and discord, while they make
vse of their enemies faults, to the glory of their owne
armie, composed of most diverse nations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as by present prosperitie it is holden togither: so
doubtlesse (if fortune frown on that side) it wil soone
be dissolved: vnlesse you suppose the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>

owne nation (which now lend their lives to establish
a forrein vsurper) to be led with any true harted and
faithfull affection. No, it is rather with terror and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust,
(weak workers of love:) which if you remove,
then those which have made an end to feare, wil soon
begin to hate. All things that may encourage, and
give hope of victory, are now for vs. The <hi>Romans</hi> have
no wives to harten them on, if they faint; no parents
to vpbraid them, if they flie. Most of them have no
Country at all, or, if they have, it is some other mens.
They stand like a sort of fearful persons trembling, &amp;
gazing at the strangenesse of the heaven it self, at the
sea, and the woods. And now the heavens (favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our cause) have delivered them, mewed vp (as it
were) and fettered into our hands. Be not terrified,
or dismaid with the vain shew and glittering of their
gold and silver, which of themselves do neither of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
nor defend. And thinke, that even amongst our
enemies, we shall find some on our side, when the
<hi>Britans</hi> shal acknowledge their owne cause, the <hi>Gauls</hi>
remember their old freedom, and the rest of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
forsake them, as of late the <hi>Vsipians</hi> did. What
then should we feare? The castles are empty, the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies</hi>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:8449:49"/>
peopled with aged &amp; impotent persons: the free
cities discontented, and distract with factions, whilest
they which are vnder, obey with ill will, and they
which do governe, rule against right. Here is the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Generall,</hi> and the armie: there Tributes &amp; Mines,
with other miseries, inseparably following such as
live vnder subjection of others; which, whether we
are to endure for ever, or speedily to revenge, it lieth
this day in this field to determine. Wherefore being
now to joyne battaile, beare in mind, I beseech you,

(albeit his souldiers were glad of that day) and could
scarce with words have bin with-holden; yet supposing
it fit to say somwhat, he encouraged them in this wise:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Fellow Souldiers, and Companions in Armes,
your faithfull diligence and service, these eight
yeares, so painfully performed, by the vertue and
fortune of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, hath at length conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Britannie.</hi> In so many journies, so many battailes
we were of necessity to shew our selves, either valiant
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8449:50"/>
against the enemie, or patient and laborious, above,
and against Nature it selfe. In all which exploits, we
have both of vs so carried our selves hitherto, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I desired better Souldiers, nor you other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
We have exceeded the limits, I, of my prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
and you likewise of yours. The end of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie</hi>
is now found, not by fame and report, but we
are with our armes and pavillions, really invested
thereof. <hi>Britannie</hi> is found, and subdued. In your
marching heeretofore, when the passage of Bogges,
Mountaines, or Rivers troubled and tyred you, how
often have I heard the valiant Souldier say; When
will the Enemie present himselfe? When shall wee
fight? Loe, now they are put out of their holes, and
heere they are come. Loe now your wish: Loe heere
the place for tryall of your vertue, and all things
likely to follow, in a good and easie course, if you
win: contrarywise all against you, if you loose. For,
as to have gone so much ground, escaped the woods
and Bogs, and passed over so many armes of the sea,
are honourable testimonies of your forwardnesse: so,
if we flie, the advantages we have had, will become
our greatest disadvantage. For wee are not so skilfull
in the Country: we have not the like store of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
we have onely hands and weapons, wherein
our hopes, our fortune, and all things else are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
For mine owne part, I have beene long since
resolved, that to shew our backes, is dishonourable,
both for Souldier and Generall, and therefore a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
death is better then life with reproach,
(Surety and Honor commonly dwelling together;)
Howbeit, if aught should mis-happen in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
yet this will be a glory for vs, to have dyed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the vttermost end of the world, and of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

If new Nations and Souldiers vnknowne, were
in the field, I would, by the example of other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
incourage you: But now I require you, onely
to recount your owne victorious exploits, and to aske
counsell of your owne eyes. These are the same men,
which the last yeare assailed one <hi>Legion</hi> by stealth in
the night, and were sodainely, and (in a manner) by
the blasts of your mouthes, overthrowne. These, of
all the other <hi>Britans,</hi> have beene the most nimble in
running away, and by that meanes, have escaped the
longest alive. For, as in forrests and woods, the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
beasts are chased away by maine force, and the
cowardly and fearefull scared onely by the noyse of
the Hunters: so, the most valiant of the <hi>Brittish</hi> nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we have already dispatched; the rascall heird of
dastardly cowards onely remaineth. And loe, wee
have now at length found them, not as intending to
stay and make head against vs, but as last overtaken,
and by extreame passion of feare, standing like stocks,
and presenting occasion to vs in this place, of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and memorable victory. Now therefore, make a
short worke of our long warfare, and to almost fiftie
yeares travaile, let this day impose a glorious end. Let
each of you shew his valour, and approove to your

                  <p>AS <hi>Agricola</hi> was yet speaking, the Souldiers gave
great tokens of their fervent desire to fight, and
when he had ended his speech, they joyfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
it, running straitwaies to their weapons, and
rushing furiously forward: which the <hi>Roman</hi> Generall
perceiving, forthwith ordered his army in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
With the <hi>Auxiliarie</hi> footemen, he fortifyed the
middle battell. The horsemen he placed in wings on
both sides. The <hi>Legions</hi> he commaunded to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
before the trench of the Camp, to the greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the victory, if it were obtained, without <hi>Roman</hi>
blood, or otherwise for assistance, if the foreward
should be distressed. The <hi>Britans</hi> were marshalled on
the higher ground fitly for shew, to terrifie their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
the first troope standing on the plain, the rest on
the ascent of the hill, rising vp as it were by degrees, one
over another: the middle of the field was filled with
Chariots and horsemen, clattering and running round
about. Then <hi>Agricola</hi> finding them to exceed him in
number, and fearing lest he should be assailed on the
front and flanks, both at one instant, thought it best to
display his army in length, and although by that means
the battaile would become disproportionably long,
and many advised him to take in the <hi>Legions:</hi> yet hee
confidently rejected the counsell, &amp; leaving his horse,
avanced himselfe before the Ensignes on foot. In the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8449:51"/>
first incounter before they joyned, both sides dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and threw their darts. The <hi>Britans</hi> imploying both

defended themselves, and wounded their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
till <hi>Agricola</hi> espying his vantage, appointed three
<note n="a" place="margin">Companies of Hollanders</note>
                     <hi>Batavian Cohorts,</hi> and two of the<note n="b" place="margin">The antient inhabitants of the Territorie of <hi>Liege,</hi> in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> 
                     <hi>Tungrians,</hi> to presse
forward, and to bring the matter to handy strokes, and
dint of sword; which they, by reason of their long ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
were able readily to performe, to the prejudice of
the other side, in regard of their little bucklers, and
huge swords. For, the swords of the <hi>Britans</hi> being
weighty, and blunt pointed, were no way fit, either for
the close, or open fight. Now, as the <hi>Batavians</hi> began
to strike them on the faces with the pikes of their buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and (having over-borne such as resisted) to march
vp to the mountaines: the rest of the <hi>Cohorts</hi> (gathering
courage vpon emulation) violently beat downe all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, and running forward, left some of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
halfe dead, some wholly vntouched, for haste, and
desire to have part of the glory in winning the field. In
the meane time, both the Chariots of the <hi>Britans,</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
themselves with their enemies battell of foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and also their troupes of horsemen, (albeit they

the ground, and the thicke ranks of their enemies, who
continued the fight, till the <hi>Britans,</hi> by maine weight of
their owne horses and Chariots, were borne downe
one vpon an other; the masterlesse horses affrighted,
running vp and downe with the Chariots, and many

                  <argument>
                     <p>The other part of the Brittish Army is overthrowne. The
Romans pursuing the Britans through the woods)
in danger to have beene intrapped. The lamentable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of the Britans.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOw the <hi>Britans</hi> (which stoode aloofe from the
battell, vpon the top of the hills, and did at the
first (in a manner) disdaine the small number of
their enemies) began to come downe by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and sought to fetch a compasse about the backs of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> which were then in traine of winning the
field. But <hi>Agricola</hi> suspecting as much, opposed them
with certaine wings of horsemen, purposely retained
about him for sodaine dispatches, vpon all chances, and
repulsed them as fiercely, as they ran to assaile. So the
counsell of the <hi>Britans</hi> turning to their owne hurt, the
<hi>Roman</hi> wings were commanded to forsake the battell,
and follow the flight. Then were there pittifull spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles
to be seene; pursuing: wounding: taking priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
and then killing such as were taken, as soone as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
came in the way. Then whole <hi>Regiments</hi> of the
<hi>Britans,</hi> (though armed, &amp; moe in number) turnd their
backs to the fewer: others vnarmed sought their owne
death, offering themselves voluntarily to the slaughter.
The fields every where were imbrued with blood: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where weapons lay scattered: wounded bodies:
mangled limbs: some slaine outright: some halfe dead:
some yeelding vp the ghost: and yet, even at the last
gaspe, seeming by their countenances to discover both
anger and valour. Such of the <hi>Britans,</hi> as in flying, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8449:52"/>
the woods, joyned themselves together againe,
and intrapped vnawares, some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers,
that vnadvisedly followed, not knowing the Country;
And if <hi>Agricola</hi> had not, by his presence and direction
assisted at neede, setting about them his most expert
footemen, (as it were in forme of a <hi>Toyle</hi>) and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
some of his horsemen to leave their horses,
(where the passage was narrow) and others to enter
single, on horseback, where the wood was thin, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the <hi>Romans</hi> had taken a blow, by their over much
boldnesse. But after that the <hi>Britans</hi> saw them againe
in good array, and orderly following the chase, they
fled, (not in troupes as before, when they attended
each other, but vtterly disbanded, shunning all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany)
toward the desart and farre distant places. The
darkenesse of the night, and satiety of blood, made an
end of the chase. Of the <hi>Britans</hi> were then slaine about
ten thousand: of the <hi>Romans,</hi> three hundred and fortie;
amongst whom, the chiefe man of note was <hi>Aulus At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi>
the Captaine of a <hi>Cohort,</hi> who vpon a youthfull
heate, and through the fiercenesse of his horse, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
into the midst of his enemies. That night the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
refreshed themselves, taking pleasure in talking of
the victorie, and dividing the spoyle. But the <hi>Britans</hi>
being vtterly discouraged, crying, and howling, (both
men and women together) tooke, and drew with them
their wounded persons: calling the not wounded: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
their owne houses, and in despite, setting them
on fire: then seeking holes abroad to lurke in, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found them, straitwaies againe forsaking them:
sometimes communicating Counsells together, and
conceiving some little hope: and then by and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
and desperate: sometimes mooved with pitty at
the sight of their kinsfolks and friends, and sometimes
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8449:53"/>
stirred with rage and envie, in thinking and speaking of
their enemies, and (which was most lamentable) some
of them, by way of compassion and mercy, killing their
owne children and wives.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Britans are dispersed, and vnable to renew the warre.
Agricola commandeth the Admirall of his Fleete to saile
about Britannie. He planteth Garrisons vpon the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
Borders, betweene the two armes of the Sea. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian
the Emperour, being advertised of his fortunate
successe in the British warre, is tormented with envie
and iealousie. Agricola yeeldeth vp the Province to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustius
Lucullus.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe day following did more plainely discover the
greatnesse of the victory, by the calamitie of the
vanquished. Desolation and silence every where:
the smoke of the houses fired, appeared a farre off: no
sallies out of the woods: no stirring in the mountaines:
no man to make resistance, or to meete with the <hi>Roman</hi>
spies, who being sent abroad into all quarters, found by
the print of the <hi>Britans</hi> footesteps, that their flight was
vncertaine, and that they were no where in companies
together, but scattered in divers places, and altogether
vnable to make any new attempt vpon the sodaine.
Wherefore <hi>Agricola,</hi> the summer being now spent in
this journey, and the time past for imployment else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
brought his army into the borders of the<note n="a" place="margin">The antient inhabitants of <hi>Eskdale</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured.)</note> 
                     <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restians</hi>
Country, where having received hostages of
the inhabitants, he commanded the <hi>Admirall</hi> of his
Navy, (being furnished with Souldiers, and sufficient
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8449:53"/>
strength for that purpose) to saile about <hi>Britannie,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the fame and terror of the <hi>Roman</hi> name, was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
gone before. Then he planted Garrisons vpon the
borders between <hi>Glota</hi> &amp; <hi>Bodotria,</hi> and disposed of his
footemen and horsemen in the wintering places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Province.</p>
                  <p>Thus, after many conflicts, about the space of one
hundred thirtie sixe yeares from <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
the vtmost limits of <hi>Britannie,</hi> and the Iles of
the <hi>Orchades</hi> lying on the North side of it, were by the
valour and industrie of <hi>Iulius Agricola,</hi> first discovered,
and made knowne to the <hi>Romans:</hi> and the South part
of the Ile, in the fourth yeare of the raigne of <hi>Domitian,</hi>
(being in the yeare of our Redemption 86.) reduced
into a full Province, the governement whereof, was
peculiar to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours themselves, and not
at the disposition of the Senate.</p>
                  <p>This state of affaires heere, <hi>Agricola</hi> signifyed by
letters (without any amplifying termes) to <hi>Domitian,</hi>
(the successor of <hi>Titus,</hi> his brother in the Empire) who
after his manner, with a cheerefull countenance, and
grieved heart, received the newes, being inwardly
pricked with anger and disdaine, to thinke, that his late
counterfeit <hi>Triumph</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> (wherein a shew was
made of slaves, boght for mony, attired like captives of
that Country,) was had in derision, and justly scorned
abroad; whereas now a true and great victory (so many
thousands of enemies being slaine) was currant in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans mouth; Besides, he esteemed it as a most peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
point in a State, that a private mans name should
be exalted above the name of a Prince; and he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that hee had in vaine suppressed the study of <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi>
and all other politike Arts, if he should in military
glory, be excelled by another; for matters of other
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8449:54"/>
kinds (as he supposed) might more easily be passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
but to be a good Commander of an Army, was to
be above a private estate, (that being a vertue peculiar
for a Prince.) <hi>Domitian</hi> beeing tormented with these
and the like conceits, and musing much in his closet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
(which was commonly noted, as a signe of some
mischiefe in working) thought it best for the present,
to cloake and dissemble his malice, till the heate of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricolaes</hi>
glory, and the love of his souldiers were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
abated (for as yet <hi>Agricola</hi> remained in office.)
Wherefore he commanded, that all the honours of
<hi>Triumphall</hi> ornaments, the image <hi>Triumphall,</hi> and what
else was vsually bestowed in lieu of <hi>Triumph,</hi> should in
most ample and honorable termes, be awarded him in
Senate: And then sending a successor, he caused a bruit
to be spread, that the Province of <hi>Syria,</hi> (which was
then void, and specially reserved for men of great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie)
should be assigned to <hi>Agricola.</hi> The common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was, that <hi>Domitian,</hi> sending one of his most secret
and trustrie servants vnto him, sent withall, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of <hi>Lievtenancie</hi> for <hi>Syria,</hi> with private instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that if <hi>Agricola,</hi> at the time of his comming should
be still in <hi>Britannie,</hi> then it should be delivered: if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
it should be kept backe; and that the same man
meeting <hi>Agricola</hi> as he crossed the seas, without spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to him, or delivering his message, returned againe
to <hi>Domitian.</hi> Whether this were true, or fained vpon a
probable surmise, as agreeable to the Princes dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it could not directly be affirmd; but in the mean sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>Agricola</hi> had yeelded vp the Province in good and
peaceable estate vnto <hi>Cneus Trebellius,</hi> or rather (as some
writers report) to <hi>Salustius Lucullus.</hi>

                     <p>Agricola returneth to Rome, and is admitted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AGricola,</hi> lest his comming to <hi>Rome</hi> should have bin
noted, by reason of the multitude, of people,
which would have gone out to see, and meete
him, did warily cut off the occasion of that curtesie,
entring the Citie by night; and by night, (as he was
commanded) came to the pallace, where being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Princes presence, and received with a short
salutation, and no further speech, he sorted himselfe
with other Gentlemen of his ranke, carrying himselfe
ever after very temperately and warily in al his actions,
as knowing the present state of those times, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
inclination of the Emperour himselfe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as all other Princes are commonly) more fearefull
and jealous of the good, then the bad, envied in him,
those vertues, and that honourable reputation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
himselfe was not capable; Yet, as good deserts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be hid, (true worthinesse shining even in darknesse
it selfe:) so the retired life which <hi>Agricola</hi> led, did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
diminish his glorie, but rather, like water sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vpon a burning fire, increased, and continued the
heate thereof. Diverse times was he accused in his
absence (which ministred to his ill willers oportunitie
of working his disgrace,) and as often in abse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce was
he acquited, the opinion onely of his good deserts, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8449:55"/>
no matter of crime giving the occasion, while such as
highly commended him to the Emperor, (seeming his
friends, but being (indeed) the most pestilent kind of
enemies) procured vnder-hand his perill and ruine in
the end. Howbeit, the ill successe of the <hi>Roman</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in diverse Provinces at that time, serving as a foile
to set out his honourable actions, drew him perforce
into glorie: and <hi>Domitian</hi> made pretences of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to employ him, thinking thereby to satisfie the
people, who then complained of the want of good
Leaders. But Vertue, that never continueth long time
in prosperous estate, (as being the common object of
envie,) hastened the death of <hi>Agricola,</hi> who (as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
fame went,) was made away by poyson, and that
not without the Emperours knowledge, and consent.
These things concerning <hi>Agricolaes</hi> government in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie,</hi>
I have set downe particularly, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> who writ the storie of
his life, which remaineth to the world, as a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
monument of the doings of the one, and the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salustius Lucullus</hi> succeeding <hi>Agricola,</hi> left little me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
of himselfe, by doing any thing here, either for
that no occasion was then offred to shew himselfe in
action, or else, for that the fame of so worthie a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor
blemished his reputation. For having held
the office but a short time, he was by commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Domitian</hi> put to death, for suffering certaine
Speares of new fashion, to be called by his owne
name.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Arviragus</hi> a <hi>Britan</hi> by birth, and
education, did governe (as King) part of the Ile of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie,</hi>
the <hi>Romans</hi> accounting it a poynt of policie to
permit the <hi>Britans</hi> sometimes to be ruled by Princes of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8449:55"/>
their owne Nation, whose ayde and counsaile, they
might vse (vpon occasions) to the pacifying of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the establishing of their owne greatnesse; For
the common people, (whose affection doth oft times
sway the fortunes of great Princes) are much
more easily brought vnder the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of their own Country-men,
then of strangers.</p>

(in whose time the <hi>Roman</hi> governement ceased)
they are imperfectly reported, or a great part of them
meerely omitted: so that I am forced, of many things
to make onely a bare and briefe relation, as vnwilling,
by adding or diminishing, to alter, in substance, what
Antiquitie hath left vs, or to fill vp blancks with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures

of the stile and composition, to be somewhat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from them: yet, the cause thereof ought to be
imputed to the very matters themselves, (being, for the
most part, fragments, and naked memorialls, (the loose
ends of Time) without observation of circumstances,
or congruitie in substance,) which will hardly admit
any method fitting a continuate History: And I owe
so much love and reverence to Truth, as I would rather
expose her in the meanest and worst habit that Time
hath left her, then by disguising her, to abuse the
world, and make her seeme a counterfet.</p>

(a Prince much honored for his vertues) suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in the Empire; But in what estate the affaires of
<hi>Britannie</hi> then stood, the histories of those times make
no mention, either for that the Emperour being a man
stricken in yeares, and disposed to ease and quietnesse,
employed himselfe, rather in reforming abuses at home,
then in maintaining warre abroad, or else, for that the
short continuance of his government, did not suffer
him to enter into any great actions in places so remote;
for having held the Empire little above a yeare, he left
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8449:60"/>
the same, by death, to <hi>Vlpius Traianus,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whom
he had adopted, for his valour and wisedome, (begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                  <p>In his time, some of the <hi>Britans,</hi> desirous to free
themselves from the <hi>Roman</hi> tyranny, entred into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
but wanting meanes to effect what they had
begun, they soone gave over the enterprise. Howbeit
<hi>Aelius Adrianus,</hi> (who succeeded <hi>Traian</hi> in the Empire)
having intelligence, that the Northern <hi>Britans</hi> made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions
into the Province, sent over <hi>Iulius Severus</hi> to
empeach their attempts; but before he could make an
end of the war, he was revoked &amp; sent into <hi>Syria,</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the <hi>Iewish</hi> rebellion; &amp; <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
came with an Army into <hi>Britannie,</hi> where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
those Northern riders, recovered such Forts
as they had taken, &amp; forced them to retire to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and woods, whither the <hi>Roman</hi> horsemen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger, could not pursue them. And then fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathia,</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Iury,</hi> specially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
of posterity, for his charitable act in burying
the body of our Saviour. This man was appointed by
<hi>Philip</hi> the Apostle, (then preaching the Christian faith
in <hi>Gallia</hi>) to instruct the antient <hi>Britans,</hi> among whom
he began first, (as some write) to institute an Eremiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
life, in a place then called <hi>Avalonia,</hi> and afterwards
<hi>Glastenbury,</hi> where himselfe, and his companions, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
the austerity and zeale of solitude, which they
had observed in <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> (with whom they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
out of <hi>Iury</hi> vnto <hi>Marsilia</hi> in <hi>France</hi>) sequestred
themselves from all worldly affaires, that they might
freely intend the exercise of pietie, which they profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Yea, some Writers of former ages have constantly
affirmed, that the Apostles, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
in their owne persons at severall times, came into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie:</hi>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:8449:62"/>
and that afterwards one <hi>Sueton,</hi> a Noblemans
sonne of that Country, being converted by such Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
as first planted the faith there, and called (after
his baptisme) <hi>Beatus,</hi> was sent by them to <hi>Rome,</hi> vnto
Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to be better instructed and confirmed in
Christianitie: and that in his returne homewards tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
<hi>Switzerland,</hi> he found in the inhabitants there,
such a desire and readinesse to receive the Christian
faith, as he resolved to continue in that place, where
he erected an <hi>Oratorie</hi> to exercise a Monasticall life, and
departed the world about the yeare of Grace, 110. But,
who were the very first teachers, and at what time the
Christian faith was first of all received there, it is not
certainely knowne; howbeit it is likely, (as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remembred) that in the expedition of <hi>Claudius</hi> the
Emperour, (which was about the third yeare of his
raigne, and twelve yeares after the assention of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour)
some Christians of <hi>Rome,</hi> and schollers of the
Apostles themselves, (by occasion of those warres, and
by reason of the entercourse of affaires betweene both
Nations) became first knowne to the <hi>Britans:</hi> who in
processe of time, were drawne by the exhortations and
examples of their teachers, to imbrace the truth: the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable
life of those religious men, mooving some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
even their Princes (though yet vnbeleeving) to
protect and regard them, as <hi>Lucius</hi> then began to doe.
Besides that, the <hi>Roman Lievtenants</hi> also, as well in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie</hi>
as other Provinces, did sometimes tolerate
the exercise of Christian Religion, as not altogether
disliking it, howsoever for worldly respects, they
forbare to shew themselves openly in favour of it.

of the Christians at <hi>Rome:</hi> Vpon these considerations,
<hi>Lucius</hi> determined to be instructed in the Religion
which they professed: and first of all, he commanded
<hi>Elvanus</hi> and <hi>Meduinus,</hi> (two learned men of the <hi>Brittish</hi>

by <hi>Elutherius,</hi> with all speede to repaire thither;
where they afterwards (not without some danger by

                  <p>THis was the state of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Britannie,</hi> when
new troubles began to the disturbance of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
For the Northern <hi>Britans</hi> making a breach
in the wall, which <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour had built, and
finding the borders but weakly garded, entred the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and surprising the <hi>Roman</hi> General, killed many of
his Souldiers, then ranging the countries: they wasted
and spoyled everie where without resistance, till <hi>Vlpius
Marcellus</hi> being sent over by <hi>Commodus</hi> the Emperour,
stayed their furie, and with great difficultie, forced them
to retire within the Wall. By which meanes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
being quieted, he applied himselfe to reforme
abuses in his Camp, reviving the ancient discipline of
warre, which had beene for a time discontinued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Roman</hi> souldiers, whom long service, and
many victories had made bold to say, and do oft times
more then became them. For <hi>Marcellus</hi> indeed was a
man somewhat austere, in reprooving and punishing:
otherwise verie temperate: diligent in time of warre:
not idle in peace: his diet was the same which the
common Souldier vsed: in quantitie more sparing:
for he would eate no bread, but such as was brought
from <hi>Rome:</hi> which he did, to the end he might avoid
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8449:65"/>
excesse, and take no more then sufficed Nature (the
stalenesse of the bread having taken away all taste, that
might either please the sense, or provoke the appetite.)
The day time, for the most part, he spent in viewing
his Camp, in training young Souldiers, and giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to Officers. In the night he wrote Letters, and
made his dispatches into diverse parts of the Province,
(as occasion required.) He slept verie little, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his thin diet, and much businesse (wherewith
he was continually occupied;) for he thought [that
he which slept a whole night togither, was no meete
man, to be either a Counseller to a Prince, or the
Commander of an Armie.] Everie Evening he vsed
to write instructions vpon twelve Tables made of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
tree, which Tables he delivered to one of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
appointing him to carrie them at sundrie houres
of the night, to certaine of his Souldiers, who thereby
supposing that their Generall was still waking, and not
gone to his bed) were the more carefull in keeping the
watch, and preventing sodaine attempts in the night
season. He was severe in execution of justice: not to
be led by fauour: nor to be corrupted by bribes. He
levied money, onely as necessarie for the warre, not to
enrich himself, or his friends, as other governors in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times had done; for he never preferred his owne
private, before the publike; nor a wealthie estate before
an honourable reputation. The fame of these vertues
as they made him much respected, both of his owne
Souldiers, and of the <hi>Britans:</hi> so they procured Envie,
which alwayes followeth Vertue inseparably, as a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

how <hi>Marcellus</hi> had carried himselfe in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie,</hi>
was much displeased therewith; and doubting
lest he should grow too great, he thought it best to cut
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8449:65"/>
him off. But some accidents happening in the meane
time, to make him change that purpose, he onely sent
Letters of discharge, and so dismissed him of the

                  <p>AFter departure of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the armie having
beene kept in by hard hand, and finding now the
reine let loose, vpon asuddaine began to be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous,
and refused openly to acknowledge <hi>Commodus</hi>
for their Emperour. These disorders, <hi>Perennius,</hi> one of
his favorites tooke vpon him to redresse, by displacing
such persons as he suspected, and committing their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to men of meaner qualitie: wherewith the <hi>Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
were much discontented, disdaining, that in steed
of <hi>Senators,</hi> and men of <hi>Consular degree,</hi> they should now
be governed by vpstarts, and base Companions. In the
heate of these broyles, about fifteene hundred Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
forsooke the armie, and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they
exhibited to the Emperour, a Bill of Complaint against
<hi>Perennius,</hi> whom they charged as the chiefe Authour
of the dissention in the Armie, by bringing in new cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
by exceeding his commission, &amp; doing things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to the maiestie of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. These, &amp;
other things, (as wel false as true) were objected against
him by the multitude, who for the most part, dislike
such as exercise authoritie over them, and keepe no
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8449:66"/>
measure in their affections, either of love, or hatred.
But, (that which touched to the quicke) was an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of treason put vp against him, for conspiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the life of the Emperour, and in seeking to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his sonne to the Empire. This point was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apprehended by <hi>Commodus,</hi> who thought that the
suspition of the fact, or the report onely to have inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it, was a sufficient cause of condemnation, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the partie accused was indeed, either guiltie, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.
Hereupon <hi>Perennius</hi> was declared Traitor, and
delivered to the Souldiers, who stripped him of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell,
whipped him with rods, and in the end, cruelly
murdered him.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Helvius Pertinax</hi> (a man of meane fortune by

them that <hi>Perennius</hi> had before discharged from bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
office, and sent into <hi>Liguria,</hi> where he was borne.
At his first entrance, he attempted by force to suppresse

and afterwards discovered his disposition more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

to take charge of the Army. In the meane time, <hi>Albinus</hi>
retired himselfe from affaires, till <hi>Commodus</hi> was dead,

afterwards murdered. Vpon report of <hi>Iulianus</hi> his

he feared <hi>Clodius Albinus,</hi> (who then had recovered

although the <hi>Britans,</hi> vpon intelligence of his purpose,
did send over Ambassadors, to offer their voluntarie
submission: yet the Emperour (in whom neither age
nor sicknesse had abated the heate of ambition) would
not directly accept thereof, but entertained them with
delaies, till all things were in readinesse for his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
[So earnest a desire he had to passe into the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest

His two sonnes <hi>Bassianus</hi> (commonly called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racalla</hi>)
and <hi>Geta,</hi> he tooke with him, as doubting their

out of the woods, and charged the <hi>Romans,</hi> who
were much encombred for want of firme ground, and
were oftentimes forced to trace the Country, and to
disperse themselves in severall companies, seeking pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of advantage: by which meanes, a great number of
them perished, while the barbarous people (lying in
ambush, and sometimes leaving their cattell abroad, as
a traine to draw them within danger) suddainly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
and killed them, before they could recover their
Campe. This was an vnfortunate journey to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
who, besides the losse which they sustained by
their enemies, were afflicted with diseases, by reason,
partly of the vnwholesome waters which they dranke,
and partly of the contagious ayre that infected their
spirits: yea, many times they killed one another; for
such as through feeblenesse could not keepe ranke in
marching, were slaine by their owne fellowes, that they
might not be left a prey to their savage enemies. There
died in this enterprise, about fiftie thousand <hi>Romans;</hi>
Yet would not <hi>Severus</hi> withdraw his forces thence, till
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8449:68"/>
the <hi>Caledonians</hi> made offer to treate of peace, whereto
he then hearkned the more willingly, for that he saw
the difficultie, and (in a manner) impossibilitie to bring
that Northerne part of the Ile, wholy vnder subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by reason of the rocks, mountaines, and marishes: as
also for that the Country, being (for the most part) bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
and vnfruitfull, the benefit thereof was not dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
likely to countervaile the charge, in getting, and
keeping it. <q>The conditions were, That the <hi>Caledonians</hi>
should first dis-arme themselves, and deliver part of the
Country, (lying next the Province,) into the <hi>Romans</hi>
possession, and that from that time forward, they
should attempt nothing against the publike peace:</q>
Which Articles agreed vpon, and assurance taken for
the performance, <hi>Severus</hi> retired himselfe into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
leaving his sonne <hi>Bassianus</hi> to take charge of the
Army, which after the Emperors departure, grew care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and dissolute: wherewith the Generall seemed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
displeased, either for that he was by his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
inclined to the worst; or else, for that he hoped
thereby to win the Souldiers favour, as a meane for his
advancement to the Empire, after his fathers death,
which he had oftentimes attempted by indirect practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
most vnnaturally to procure.</p>

                     <p>The Caledonians invade the Roman Camp, and carrying
away the booties which they had taken, are pursued, and
put to the sword by the Romans. Severus the Emperor
repaireth Adrians wall, cutteth a Trench, and carrieth
it thwart the Iland from Sea to Sea. He falleth sicke at
Yorke. His counsell to his sonnes. His death.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the meane while, the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the late contract) vnderstanding what disorders
were in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, sodainely invaded it, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and taking booties, which they shared with their
neighbours (borderers of the Province) that had assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
them in the enterprize. <hi>Severus</hi> being greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
therewith, sent part of the Armie to pursue the
<hi>Caledonians,</hi> expresly commaunding, that they
should be all put to the sword, without respect of age, or
sex. This sharpe manner of proceeding, did somewhat
quaile the hope of the Northern <hi>Britans,</hi> who fled into
the remote parts of <hi>Caledonia:</hi> and <hi>Severus</hi> having rather
stayed, then ended the troubles, (as intending to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the war with more advantage) spent some time in
repairing and enlarging <hi>Adrians</hi> Wall, which hee
carryed th'wart the Iland, from Sea, to Sea, intrenching
and fortifying it with bulwarks and square towers, in
places most convenient (to give warning one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vpon any sodain assault) for defence of the borders.
Then being wearied with age, sicknesse, and travaile,
having his mind also much grieved with the disloyall
and vnnaturall practises of his sonne <hi>Bassianus,</hi> he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
himselfe to<note n="a" place="margin">Yorke.</note> 
                     <hi>Eboracum,</hi> a <hi>Colonie</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi>

being then the <hi>Station</hi> of the <hi>Sixt Legion,</hi> called <hi>Victrix,</hi>
and afterwards growing to be one of the chiefe places
of account among the <hi>Brigantes.</hi> For these <hi>Stations</hi> of
the <hi>Roman Legions,</hi> were commonly the seed-plots of
townes and cities, both in this Ile, and divers other parts
of the Empire.</p>
                  <p>It was reported, that in his passage thither, a <hi>Moore,</hi>
with a <hi>Cypresse</hi> garland on his head, did meet and salute
him by the name of a God: and that, at his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Citie, he was by error of the <hi>Soothsayer,</hi> (that
guided him) brought into the temple of <hi>Bellona:</hi> and
that black beasts, being appointed for sacrifice, did of
themselves follow him to his Pallace. These things,
howsoever they fell out accidentally: yet they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
as ominous, in respect of the event. And now
<hi>Severus</hi> perceiving his death to approach, called before
him some of his Counsellers and chiefe Captaines, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom he is said to have spoken in this manner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is now about eighteene yeares, since I was first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Emperour by the Army in <hi>Pannonia;</hi> during
which time, with what care, paine, and travaile, I have
weilded this vast body of the Empire, my continuall
employment in wars, both at home and abroad, may
witnesse sufficiently. For, at my first entrance, I found
the State incumbred every where, and now I shall leave
it peaceable, even to the <hi>Britans.</hi> The future prosperitie
whereof, must depend vpon the mutuall agreement of
my two sonnes. For neither multitude of men, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of treasure, are so availeable to defend and
maintaine Common-weales, as Amity and Vnity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Governors. For, by Concord, (we see,) that smal
things grow to greatnes, whereas by Discord the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
fall to ruine. I must now leave to them (as my suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,)
the <hi>Imperiall Diadem,</hi> that which <hi>Bassianus</hi> hath
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8449:70"/>
so long thirsted after, though he know not yet, whether
it be a thing to be wished, or feared, as having not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the difference betwixt a Prince, and a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
But ambitious mindes are carried blind-fold, they
wot not whither, in desiring that, which having once
obtained, they can neither keepe, without great care,
nor leave, without extreame perill; such a thing is So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verainty,
whose greatnesse is not contained in it selfe,
but consisteth, for the most part, in the opinion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
vpon the dispositions of other men. It is Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
onely, not glorious titles, which makes men truely
great. My selfe at this present may serve for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to shew, vpon what a weake foundation, humane
greatnesse is built. For, <hi>I have beene all things, though now
it availe me nothing:</hi> seeing I must pay my debt to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and after all my exploits in the East &amp; West parts
of the world, (I) must die (as I may say) out of the
world, in a strange Country, if any Country may be
termed strange to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who have now by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
made all Countries their owne. I exhort you
therefore, as you tender the welfare of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
of your owne selves, and your posteritie, be true
and faithfull to my sonnes, as you have beene to me,
assisting them with your counsel, and perswading them
to mutuall concord, as the maine pillar to support, both
their estates, and your owne.</q>

                     <hi>BAssianus</hi> being advertised of his fathers death, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
with the Souldiers, by bribes, and faire promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that he might be declared sole Emperor: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
when he could not perswade them, for the reverence
they bare to his father <hi>Severus,</hi> he made a league with
the Northern <hi>Britans</hi> that then assailed the borders, and
returned to <hi>Eboracum,</hi> to meet with <hi>Iulia</hi> the Empresse
his mother in law, and <hi>Geta</hi> his brother. There he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Physitians to be put to death, for not ridding
his father sooner out of the way, as he had commanded
them. Then he appointed secretly to the slaughter, all
those, that for their vertue and wisdom had beene estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and advanced by his father, and all such, as having
beene Tutors to him and his brother, advised them to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8449:71"/>
mutuall concord. This done, he entred into consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about his fathers funerals, which were solemnised
by the armie with all due rites, according to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
custome in times of warre. The ashes of the dead
bodie being put into a Golden <hi>Vrna,</hi> were afterwards
by <hi>Iulia</hi> the Empresse (accompanied with the two <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>)
carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Severus,</hi> after the vsuall ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
was consecrated a god.</p>
                  <p>Now the affaires of <hi>Britannie,</hi> for the space of about
fiftie yeares togither, were passed over in silence,
as being either omitted, through the negligence of
Writers in that age, or perishing, through the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of the times that ensued vnder the Emperors fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
namely, <hi>Popilius Macrinus,</hi> (the successor of <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus)
Varus Heliogabalus, Alexander Severus, Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,
Gordianus</hi> the first, second, and third, <hi>Philippus
Arabs, Decius, Valerianus.</hi> But when <hi>Gallienus</hi> (who
succeeded <hi>Vacerian</hi>) had obtained the Empire, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
state was much encumbred, and oppressed with
her owne forces, while certaine Captaines (commonly
called, The <hi>Thirtie Tyrants</hi>) disdained the government
of so cruell, and dissolute a Prince as <hi>Gallienus,</hi> and being
chosen Emperors by the armies which they comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
vsurped absolute authoritie in diverse Provinces.
Among these, <hi>Collianus, Victorinus, Posthumus, Tetricus,</hi>
and <hi>Marius,</hi> (as Histories report) ruled in <hi>Britannie.</hi> The
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>Flavius Claudius, Valerius Aurelianus, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi>

                  <p>In the time of the forenamed <hi>Aurclianus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
it is not to be forgotten, that <hi>Bonosus a Britan</hi> by
birth, and famous for excesse in drinking, invaded the
Empire with <hi>Proculus,</hi> vsurping <hi>Britannie, Spaine,</hi> and
<note n="a" place="margin">That part of France which at this day conteineth the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, and Dauphine.</note>
                     <hi>Gallia Braccata.</hi> But being afterwards vanquished by
<hi>Probus</hi> the Emperor, he hanged himselfe; whereof there
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8449:71"/>
went a common jest among the Souldiers, that [a
drinking vessell, not a man was hanged vp]</p>
                  <p>Then the Gouernor of the Province in <hi>Britannie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preferred to the office, by meanes of <hi>Victorinus</hi> a
<hi>Moore</hi> (a man in great favour with <hi>Probus</hi> the Emperor)
began to raise sedition among the Souldiers there; with
which practise <hi>Probus</hi> secretly acquainted <hi>Victorinus,</hi>
who supposing himselfe touched with the imputation
of his crime, whom he had recommended and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the government there, desired leave of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
to go into <hi>Britannie,</hi> where (giving it out, that he
fled thither for safegard of his life) he was curteously
entertained by the Governor, whom he afterwards
murdred privily in the night, &amp; then speedily returned
to <hi>Rome:</hi> having, by this devise, appeased the tumults in
the Province, &amp; approved his fidelitie to the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>About this time (as it is reported) certaine <hi>Vandals</hi>
and <hi>Burgundians</hi> (which had invaded <hi>Gallia</hi>) being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
by <hi>Probus,</hi> were sent into <hi>Britannie,</hi> where they
seated themselves, and did afterwards good service to
the <hi>Romans,</hi> in suppressing rebellious attempts there:
though the Emperour then sought to win the <hi>Britans</hi>
favour, rather by clemencie, then rigor: licencing them
to plant Vines, and make wine, and to do other things,
as well for their pleasure as profit.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Carus</hi> succeeding <hi>Probus</hi> in the Empire,
assigned <hi>Britannie, Gallia, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Illyricum,</hi> to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi>
one of his sonnes, who possessed the same,
till <hi>Dioclesian</hi> was declared Emperor: in whose time the
Province was peaceably governed, the borders being
strongly garded with forts, and bulwarks against forrein
invasion; but the sea coasts, both of <hi>Gallia</hi> and <hi>Britannie,</hi>
were much annoyed with Pirats of lower <hi>Germanie,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

                  <p>
                     <hi>CArausius</hi> was a man, by birth of low degree, thogh

him forward, to seeke it by vnlawfull courses, and
to boulster out wrong by that authoritie, which is the
ordinarie meane appointed to punish it; for in short
time he grew verie rich, by taking great store of ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and treasure, which he detained to his owne vse,
without restoring the same to the right owners, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
account therof to the Emperors officers. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Maximianus Herculeus</hi> (whom <hi>Dioclesian</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to be his Associate in the Empire) being then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
warre in <hi>Gallia,</hi> surprised the principall men of

that <hi>Carausius</hi> himselfe should be made away.
But <hi>Carausius</hi> being privily advertised thereof, and
knowing, that then there remained for him no meane
fortune betwixt the life of a Prince, and the death of a
Traitor, entred forthwith into actuall rebellion, making
his partie strong both by sea and land, in drawing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
persons into the action, and alluring the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8449:72"/>
Northern <hi>Britans</hi> to joyne with him, vpon hope of
spoiles to be gotten in the province, which he then ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with a kind of absolute authoritie, and soone after v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped
there the Imperiall ornaments.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> state being shaken in diverse places, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the negligent government, or ambitious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of Captaines, and Commanders of armies,
(which gave occasion to whole Nations and Provinces

and <hi>Constantius Chlorus,</hi> as their assistants by the
name of <hi>Caesars.</hi> Then was <hi>Maximinus</hi> sent into <hi>Persia,</hi>

<hi>Constantius</hi> arrived there, <hi>Carausius</hi> was slain by the

the Empire, as <hi>Carausius</hi> had done before. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
that <hi>Constantius</hi> was comming over with a

hopes failing him, by reason the <hi>Romans</hi> in a thicke mist
did recover the land, before he could discover them, he
prepared his forces to encounter them in a set battaile
neere the shore. <hi>Constantius</hi> (having determined to trie

all hope of returne, did first set his ships on fire,

that throughout the Dominions of the

a Christian, one of the Clergie named <hi>Amphibalus,</hi>
that fled from his persecutors: and observing his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in watching, fasting, and praying, became in the
end a follower of his faith and vertue. And to the end
that his guest might escape the hands of them that
pursued him, he put on his garments, offering himselfe
to the Souldiers that were sent to search his house,
and in that habite was presented to the Iudge, before
whom he made confession of his faith, reprooving the
prophane rites of heathenish superstition. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was committed to the Tormentors to be
whipped, and persisting in his constancie, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
beheaded on the top of an high hill neere the

                  <p>It is reported, that the Tormentor (who was first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to behead him) perceiving a miracle wrought
by him, as he went to the place of execution, refused
to do his office, casting the sword out of his hand, and
prostrating himselfe at Saint <hi>Albans</hi> feete, desired ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
that he might either die for him, or with him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

as a professor of that faith, whereof he had beene long

of <hi>Austen</hi> the Monke, albeit it had been condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by divers publike Decrees and generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells.
Neither is it to be forgotten, that in this third Age
after Christ, there were among the <hi>Britans,</hi> divers men
of speciall note for pietie and learning, as namely, in the
time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, and Pope <hi>Sylvester Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutus,</hi>
a Bishop of <hi>London</hi> was present, and subscribed to
the <hi>Synod,</hi> held at <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> about the yeare of

certain <hi>British</hi> Bishops appeared at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of <hi>Sardica,</hi> which was summoned in the behalfe of

yeare 350. and also at the Counsell of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> where
Saint <hi>Hillarie</hi> greatly commendeth the Bishops of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie,</hi>
for their zeale and constancie in maintaining the

monument of himselfe in the life of his sonne,
who (he hoped) should succeede him in the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Thus died <hi>Constantius Caesar,</hi> a wise and vertuous
Prince, as being not subject to those vices which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
accompany the highest fortunes. He was first
called from the degree of a <hi>Senator,</hi> to be a <hi>Caesar,</hi> not
affecting the title for ambition, nor refusing it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the danger. <hi>Helena</hi> his wife, the mother of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the Great, was (as some have written) the
daughter of <hi>Coil a British</hi> King, though by others it be
otherwise reported. But of what Country or kindred
soever she was, it appeareth by consent of all Writers,
that she was a wise and vertuous Lady, worthy to be
the Wife of such a Husband, and the Mother of such a
Sonne. She was an earnest professor of Christianitie,
and vpon religious zeale, travailed to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where
she found out the Manger wherein Christ was laid at
the time of his birth, and the Crosse whereon he was
nailed when he suffered. By this Crosse many diseases
were cured, and strange miracles wrought, (if credit
may be given to such as have written thereof.) Her
constant desire to advance the Christian faith, first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Constantius</hi> her husband to favour the Christians,
who having in times of danger hidden themselves (for
the most part) in desarts and dennes, did then come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
againe into the view of the world, reedified their
old Churches, founded new, instituted holy daies to
be celebrated in honour of their <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and exercised
religion freely and peaceably, as being licensed so to
doe by publike Edicts. In all vertues beseeming a
Prince, there were few of his degree, either before his
time, or since, that might worthily be compared with
<hi>Constantius,</hi> who in the administration of Iustice in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
causes, carryed so even a hand, as he never vsed to
make difference of persons, or to be mis-led by affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He was no wastefull spender of his subjects trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8449:76"/>
no greedie horder vp of his owne, for he esteemed
money onely, as a thing to be vsed, not kept: and hee
would oft times say, [That it was more behoovefull
for the Common-weale, that the wealth of the land
should be dispearsed in subjects hands, then barred
vp in Princes coffers.] For glorious apparrell and other
outward ornaments, (wherewith Princes vse to dazell
the eyes of the common people,) he was more meanly
furnished, then beseemed the greatnesse of his estate.
His diet was neither curious, nor costly: and when he
feasted his friends, he borrowed his silver vessell, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it a thing vnnecessarie, to have any of his owne;
and considering perhaps, that the mettall whereof they
were made, might be converted to a better vse. In
times of war, he was diligent and industrious: yet not
vsing force, where pollicie might prevaile; for he so
much esteemed the life of a man, as he would never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
it in desperate attempts for his owne glory: which
wan him great reputation among his Souldiers, who
for the love they bare him, did presently after his death,
elect <hi>Constantine</hi> his sonne to succeede him; (other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

subdued <hi>Maxentius, Maximians</hi> sonne that vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

made war vpon <hi>Licinius</hi> his Associate, who persecuted
the professors of Christianitie in the East parts of the
world. By which meanes, <hi>Constantine</hi> alone enjoyed
the Empire, and for his many and glorious conquests,
was worthily surnamed the Great. In his time the
forme of government in <hi>Britannie,</hi> both for Civill and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8449:77"/>
Martiall causes, was altered, and new lawes established.
The civill governement of the Province there, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to <hi>Pacatianus,</hi> who ordered the same as Deputy

of that power, which the antient <hi>Praefectus Praetorio</hi> had
vnder the first Emperors.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Constantine</hi> intending to make war in <hi>Persia,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to defend, or enlarge the limits of the East Empire,
removed the Imperiall seate from <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Citie
<hi>Bizantium,</hi> (which he reedified, and caused the same to
be called of his owne name <hi>Constantinopolis:</hi>) drawing
thither the <hi>Legions</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> that garded the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
of the Westerne Empire, which was thereby laid
open to the incursions of those barbarous people, that
afterwards assailed it, and in the end, possessed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part thereof. The borders also of the Province in
<hi>Britannie</hi> were weakened, by removing the Garrisons
there into other Cities and Townes, which being pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
with Souldiers, (for the most part vnruly guests)
were abandoned by the antient inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>After the death of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, <hi>Constantinus</hi>
his eldest sonne, enjoyed <hi>Britannie</hi> as a portion of his
dominion, till making some attempts vpon his brother
<hi>Constans,</hi> for the enlarging of it, he was by him slaine.
Then was the Empire divided betweene <hi>Constans</hi> and
<hi>Constantius,</hi> the two younger brethren. <hi>Constans</hi> seised
vpon the Provinces which <hi>Constantinus</hi> his brother
had held, and made a voyage into <hi>Britannie,</hi> where <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi>
an <hi>Hungarian</hi> by birth, had then charge of the
Armie. This <hi>Gratianus</hi> was surnamed <hi>Funarius,</hi> for that,
being a young man, he was able (as it is written of him)
to holde a rope in his hand against the force of five
Souldiers, assaying to pull it from him. But <hi>Constans</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwads
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8449:78"/>
following ill counsell, (the ready way to
Princes ruines) and giving himselfe over to all kinds of
vice, was slaine by <hi>Magnentius Taporus,</hi> (the sonne of a
<hi>Britan</hi>) who then invaded the Empire, vsurping the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
of <hi>Gallia</hi> and <hi>Britannie,</hi> till (after three years
warre with <hi>Constantius,</hi> the successour of <hi>Constans</hi> his
brother) finding himselfe vnable any longer to vphold
his greatnesse, he murdered himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Then was <hi>Martinus</hi> (an aged man) made Deputy of
<hi>Britannie,</hi> when <hi>Paulus a Spaniard,</hi> surnamed <hi>Catêna,</hi> (a

<hi>Magnentius;</hi> But vnder colour of his authoritie, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in question such as were not faulty, either vpon
false information, or private displeasure, &amp; sometimes,
to make a gaine of those that were accused: which
course <hi>Martinus</hi> the Deputy disliking, intreated him,
That such as had been no actors in rebellion, might be

<hi>Paulus,</hi> charging the Deputy himselfe as a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer

but failing in the execution, hee presently thrust the

                  <p>NOw was the government of <hi>Gallia</hi> and <hi>Britannie,</hi>
assigned to <hi>Iulianus</hi> (afterwards called the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata</hi>)
whom <hi>Constantius</hi> had made a <hi>Caesar.</hi> Then
<hi>Lupicinus</hi> Maister of the Armour to the Emperour, (a
good souldier, but notorious for his pride, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and crueltie) and after him <hi>Alipius,</hi> were sent into
<hi>Britannie,</hi> to represse the barbarous people that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
the Province there, while <hi>Iulianus</hi> himself remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in <hi>Gallia,</hi> not daring to passe into the Ile, both for
that he feared the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who were readie (vpon the
least occasion) to revolt, and also doubted the <hi>Almains,</hi>
who were then vp in Armes: But with what successe
<hi>Lupicinus,</hi> and <hi>Alipius</hi> prosecuted the warre in <hi>Britannie,</hi>
I find no certaine report.</p>
                  <p>After the death of <hi>Constantius, Iulianus</hi> possessing
the Empire (which he had vsurped in the life time of
<hi>Constantius</hi>) banished <hi>Palladius</hi> an honourable person
into <hi>Britannie,</hi> and sent <hi>Alipius</hi> to repaire the walles of
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in which attempt, God discovering his wrath,
by terrifying the builders with thunder and lightning,
and killing many thousand <hi>Iewes,</hi> gave an apparant testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8449:79"/>
how vaine a thing it is for the power of man to
oppose it selfe against his Imperiall decree.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iovinian</hi> succeeded <hi>Iulianus</hi> in the Empire, which he
held but few moneths. About this time the <hi>Picts, Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Scottishmen,</hi> and <hi>Attacots</hi> invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
in <hi>Britannie (Valentinianus</hi> the first of that name
then governing the Empire, togither with <hi>Valens</hi> his
brother.) These <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scottish-men</hi> (as some wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
report) came first out of <hi>Scythia,</hi> though it be not
improbable that the <hi>Picts</hi> were any other, then such
<hi>Britans,</hi> as being either borne in the Northern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montorie
of the Ile, or flying thither out of the South
parts, entred into confederacie with the <hi>Scottish men,</hi>
and retained for a time their ancient name of <hi>Picts,</hi> as
being so called by the <hi>Romans</hi> (in respect of the old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of painting their bodies) to distinguish them
from the <hi>Britans</hi> then dwelling within the Province.
Neither is there any mention made in Histories of
their name, before the time of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian.</hi>
These <hi>Picts,</hi> increasing in number, did afterwards
inhabite the Iles of the <hi>Orcades,</hi> and being, for the most
part, rude, and savage (as the <hi>Scottishmen</hi> also then were)
did oft-times harrow the borders, and grievously an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
their civill Country-men (there being commonly
no greater hatred, then that which is bred and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
among the people of one Nation,) when they are
severed each from other by difference of maners and
customes. The name of <hi>Picts</hi> in processe of time (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
changed into that of the <hi>Scottishmen,</hi> as of the more
populous nation) was in a maner clean forgotten, when
by societie and aliance they became both one people.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Scottish-men</hi> had their originall from the
<hi>Scythes,</hi> their verie name may seeme, in some sort, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover;
howbeit, diverse stories affirme, that they travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
first into <hi>Cantabria</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where (perhaps disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8449:79"/>
that barren soyle) they continued not long, but
sailed into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from thence a great number of
them came over into <hi>Britannie,</hi> landing in the North
part of the Ile, where afterward they seated themselves.
They were people of great courage, and boldnesse: of
stature, tall: strong of bodie: their complexions some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ruddie and high coloured: their apparell was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
verie slender, or none at all, save only to cover their
shame. They were, for the most part, addicted to warre,
vsing peace onely but as a means to repaire their losses.
Neither was their peace altogither idle: for even then
they accustomed their bodies to labours, no lesse pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
then warre it selfe, and oft-times no lesse dangerous.
To ride with swift pace vp a steepe hill, to swim over
lakes, and standing meeres; to passe over bogs, and fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
grounds, were things in ordinarie vse with them,
as being accounted exercises of recreation onely. But
above all others, the nobilitie &amp; better sort were deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with hunting &amp; that in such measure, as they could
more patiently endure the want of meate, drinke, and
sleepe, then restraint from that pastime, which they
esteemed manly and generous. In their consultations
they were verie secret; and sodaine in the execution of
whatsoever they had projected, by which meanes they
often-times, strooke terror and amazment into the harts
of their enemies, &amp; much annoyed the <hi>Roman</hi> Province
in <hi>Britanny.</hi> They were better contented with the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of nature, &amp; more able to endure all extremities of
fortune then the <hi>Britans</hi> in those times, as being lesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the vaine superfluities &amp; delicacie of the
<hi>Romans:</hi> In behaviour the <hi>Britans</hi> were noted to be more
civill, but the <hi>Scottishmen</hi> (as a people vnconquered, &amp;
admitting no customs but their own) refused to imitate
them, who were brought vnder the subjection of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8449:80"/>
or to be reputed like to any other then to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Wrongs and indignities offred as well to others
as themselves, they sharpely revenged: the slaughter,
wounding, or disgrace of any of their kinred, alies, or
companions, being commonly the occasion of rooting
out the whole familie of him that first gave the offence.
Violent pursuits: seasing by strong hand the goods and
possessions of their neighbors: burning of houses, and
killing (vpon cold blood) such as they had taken in
warre (which others termed crueltie) they accounted
manhood, and policie: supposing the assurance of their
estate to consist, rather in diminishing the number of
their enemies, by open acts of hostilitie, then by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
reconciliations, and leagues of amitie, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kept or broken at the will of him that hath the
greater power. Their name is first mentioned in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
about the reigne of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great: though
the <hi>Scottish</hi> writers affirme, that they were governed by
Kings of their owne Nation, many hundred yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his time. But of things so ancient to have the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
knowledge, it is no easie matter: neither is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
in it selfe verie much to be regarded, where true
Nobilitie and vertue is wanting. For all Nations at the
first were of barbarous, &amp; vncivill behaviour, till Time
taught them other customes, and emulation kindled the
hearts of the better sort to seeke fame by their owne va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
rather then the Genealogies of their Ancesters.
These <hi>Scottish-men</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> being now assisted with
forrein power, presumed more boldly to assaile the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
both by sea and land, killing <hi>Nectaridius</hi> the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of the <hi>British</hi> fleete, and surprising <hi>Bulchobaudes</hi> one
of their chiefe Captaines, (the mutinie at that time in
the <hi>Roman</hi> Campe giving them oportunitie, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to do, in a maner, what they listed.) For the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionarie</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:8449:80"/>
Souldiers refused to obey their Leaders, and
even the Deputies themselves, complaining of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie
of their Generals, who punished the least of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the common Souldier, and winked at the great
abuses of Commanders and Officers. Hereupon a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
troope of <hi>Almans</hi> was sent over vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Fraomarius</hi> their King, who exercised there the
authoritie of a <hi>Tribune, Severus,</hi> the Emperors steward
of houshold, and <hi>Iovinius</hi> were appointed to second
him, with certaine <hi>Auxiliarie</hi> forces out of <hi>Gallia.</hi> By
this meanes the furie of those warlike Nations was
somwhat restrained, til the comming of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> who
first appeased the mutinie among the Souldiers in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie,</hi>
and afterward prosecuted the service there
with such good successe, as he restored the decayed
Townes, strengthned the borders, appointing night-watches
to be kept there, and in the end, recovered the
Province, which was then contented to admit of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
(as in former times) and as a new conquered
state, had a new name given it; For in honour of the
Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> the Province was (for a time)
called <hi>Valentia.</hi> Not long after, one <hi>Valentinian a Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonian</hi>
entred into a new conspiracie there, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discovered before it was ripe, the perill like to have
ensued thereby, was easily avoyded.</p>

ruling the Armie in <hi>Britannie,</hi> (vpon emulation and

he fled to<note n="b" place="margin">Lions in France.</note> 
                     <hi>Lugdunum</hi> in <hi>Gallia,</hi> where he was entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by a treacherous devise; for, a rumor being spred
(by direction of <hi>Maximus</hi>) that the Empresse his wife
was comming to visite him, he lightly gave credite
thereto; and thereupon attended with a few persons,
went foorth in private maner to meete her; but in the
Chariot (where he supposed to have seene his wife) he
found <hi>Andragathius,</hi> one of <hi>Maximus</hi> Captaines, secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:8449:81"/>
hidden, who forthwith leaped out, and murdered
the innocent Emperour, while his attendants, being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,
and amazed with the sodainnesse of the fact,
made little or no preparation for defence. <hi>Maximus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his mind lifted vp with his fortune, created his
sonne <hi>Victor</hi> a <hi>Caesar,</hi> and vsed great crueltie against
those that had served vnder <hi>Gratianus.</hi> Whereupon
<hi>Valentinian</hi> doubting his owne estate, sent Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
the Bishop of <hi>Millain</hi> vnto him, as an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
to desire peace, which in the end was granted vpon
conditions. But <hi>Maximus</hi> ambitiously affecting the sole
government, did soone after breake the peace, invading
<hi>Italie,</hi> and attempting to have taken <hi>Valentinian</hi> himself,
who to prevent that danger, fled with his mother vnto
<hi>Theodosius</hi> his associate (then ruling the East Empire) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
his ayde against <hi>Maximus</hi> that vsurped <hi>Italie,</hi>
and other parts of his government. Hereupon <hi>Theodosius</hi>
prepared an armie to encounter <hi>Maximus,</hi> who in <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

being overthrown, fled to <hi>Aquileia,</hi> where by the
treason of his own souldiers (while he was paying them
their wages) he was delivered to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> dis-robed
of his Imperiall ornaments, and speedily put to an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
death. This end had <hi>Maximus,</hi> after he had v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped
the Empire five yeares.</p>
                  <p>The like calamities also befell his friends and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.
For <hi>Victor</hi> his sonne was afterwards slaine in

of <hi>Gratian</hi> drowned himselfe, and diverse of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
his Captaines being taken, were put to the

had raised himselfe to that greatnesse (as men desiring
rather to trie new fortunes abroad, then to returne
home) resolved to stay in <hi>Armorica</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where

some of their Country-men had remained (as diverse
writers affirme) since the conquest of <hi>Gallia</hi> by <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
the Great. By this meanes, in processe of time (part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by force, and partly by policie,) they grew so strong,
as they left the possession of a great part of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to their posteritie, which being rooted therein by
many discents, did afterwards enjoy it entirely as their
owne (the name of <hi>Britannie</hi> continuing there among
them even to this day.) This victorie of <hi>Theodosius</hi> was

sent <hi>Stilico</hi> into <hi>Britannie,</hi> to defend the <hi>Britans</hi> against

                  <p>Now the <hi>Romans,</hi> about foure hundred and seventie
years after their first entrance into the Ile, waxed weary
of the governement of <hi>Britannie,</hi> and the <hi>Britans,</hi> that

(consorted with strangers of divers Nations)
perceived themselves vnable to make resistance, as in

Turves, and not of Stone, as they were directed, (the

by which meanes it served to little purpose:
For the <hi>Scottishmen</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> vnderstanding that the
<hi>Romans</hi> were gone, passed over the water in boats at
both ends of the wall, invaded the borders of the
Province, and with maine force, bare downe all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

considering that the Empire it selfe was assailed,

that from thence forth, they should provide for their

stone from East to West, in the selfe same place where
<hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour had cast his Trench, (the labour
and charges of the worke being borne, partly by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and partly by the <hi>Britans</hi> themselves.) This wall
contained about eight foote in breadth, and twelve
in height, (some reliques thereof remaining to be
seene at this day.) Vpon the sea coasts towards the
South, they raised Bulwarkes (one somewhat distant
from another) to empeach the enemies landing in
those parts; and this done, they took their last farewell,
transporting their <hi>Legions</hi> into <hi>Gallia,</hi> as men resolved
to returne hither no more. Assoone as they were gone,
the barbarous people (having intelligence thereof)
presumed confidently, that without any great resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
they might now enter the Province. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
accounting as their owne, whatsoever was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the wall, they gave an assault to the wall it selfe, and
with grapples, and such like engines, pulled downe to
the ground a great part thereof, while the <hi>Britans</hi> inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
the borders, being awaked with the suddainnesse
of the enterprize, gave warning to the rest of their
countrymen within the land, to arme themselves
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:8449:84"/>
with speede, and to make resistance.</p>
                  <p>About this time also, (which was the yeare of our
redemption 430.) the state of the Church in <hi>Britannie,</hi>
was much incumbred with the heresie of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who
being by birth a <hi>Britan,</hi> by profession a Monke, and (as
some thinke) trained vp in the Monastery of <hi>Bangor,</hi>
travailed first into <hi>Italy,</hi> then into <hi>Sicilia, Aegypt,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
East parts of the world, to learne and studie, as he
professed; whereby he wownd himselfe into the good
opinion of many men of great fame in those daies, for
learning and pietie; as namely of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Nola,</hi> and (by his meanes) of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> till the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
assertions which himselfe and his disciple <hi>Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
a <hi>Scottishman</hi> secretly taught, being by Saint <hi>Hierom</hi>
discovered, were afterwards condemned by the Bishop
of <hi>Rome, Innocentius</hi> the first: Whereupon they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againe into <hi>Britannie,</hi> being obstinately bent to
maintaine their former heresie: which <hi>Agricola,</hi> the
sonne of <hi>Severianus,</hi> a Bishop of that sect, had (not
long before) brought thither, whereby the same, in
short time, was received and approoved among the
Chistians in divers parts of the Ile: so that betwixt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
among the <hi>Britans</hi> themselves, and paganisme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by their enemies, the light of Christian religion
seemed, for a time, to be eclipsed. Howbeit, some of the
<hi>Britans</hi> (disliking those hereticall opinions, which as
yet they were vnable by knowledge in the Scriptures
to confute:) and perceiving withall, what dangerous
inconveniences to the State arose oft times, by reason
of their disagreement one from another in matters of
religion; earnestly required the Bishops of <hi>France,</hi> to
send over some godly, wise, &amp; learned men, that might
defend the truth of Christianitie, which seemed to be
borne downe by the subtill allegations of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8449:84"/>
Heereupon the Bishoppes there called a <hi>Synod,</hi>
wherein <hi>Germanus,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> and <hi>Lupus,</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Troyes</hi> in <hi>Champaigne,</hi> were appointed to goe
into <hi>Britannie,</hi> and to vndertake the cause, which they
afterwards prosecuted with so good successe, as many
heretickes among the <hi>Britans,</hi> were openly convinced,
and Christians confirmed in the faith. About the same
time, <hi>Ninianus Bernitius</hi> (of the race of the <hi>British</hi>
Princes) was sent into <hi>Pict-land,</hi> to convert the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
there to Christianitie: <hi>Palladius</hi> a <hi>Graetian,</hi> was
likewise appointed by <hi>Coelestine,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to
preach the Gospel in <hi>Scotland,</hi> vnto such there, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
yet in infidelitie, and to suppresse the <hi>Pelagian</hi>
heresie, newly sprung vp in that Kingdome, to be the
first and chiefe Bishop of the Church there: for which
purpose also <hi>Patricius,</hi> surnamed <hi>Magonius,</hi> (borne in
<hi>Britannie</hi> of a <hi>Senators</hi> house) was by the same Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> sent to the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Scottishmen,</hi> that then dwelt
in the Iles of the <hi>Orcades</hi> and <hi>Hebrides.</hi> These three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Fathers were much honoured in those daies
for the reverent opinion which most men had of their
learning and integritie of life: and they are accounted
the Apostles and Patrons of the <hi>Scottish, Irish,</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctish</hi>
Nations, as being the severall instruments of the
generall conversion of each of them.</p>

                  <p>WIthin few yeares after, the <hi>Britans</hi> were againe
hotly pursued by the <hi>Scottishmen</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi>
who swarmed over a great part of the Land,
taking from the <hi>Britans</hi> for a time, all oportunities of
convening and assembling themselves together, as in
former dangers they had beene accustomed; whereby
no small number of the Inhabitants of the Province
(despairing of better successe) retired themselves, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
way to the present necessitie, while each man (as
in common calamities oft times it falleth out) laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the care of the publike, made provision for his own
safetie: leaving the enemie in the meane time to take
and kill such as resisted.</p>
                  <p>Some of the <hi>Britans</hi> being driven out of their owne
houses and possessions, fell to robbing one of another,
encreasing their outward troubles with inward tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
and civill dissention; by which meanes, a great
number of them had nothing left to sustaine them, but
what they got by hunting and killing of wilde beasts.
Others burying their treasure vnder ground, (whereof
great store hath beene found in this age) did flie (them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
either into the Countries of the<note n="a" place="margin">South-wales.</note>

on the other, sent to the Emperor for aide, which
they could not obtaine; for that the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Huns</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
<hi>Gallia</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> the greatest part of the forces
of the Empire was drawne thither for defence of
those places. By reason whereof, (the state of <hi>Britannie</hi>
now declining with the Empire, and shrinking vnder
the burden of barbarous oppression) the <hi>Britans</hi> sent
Ambassadours againe to <hi>Aetius</hi> the President in <hi>Gallia,</hi>
desiring him to releeve their necessities, declaring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that themselves were the small remnant which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
after the slaughter of so many thousands, whom
either the sword, or the sea had consumed; for the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
enemie drave them vpon the sea, the sea againe
vpon the enemie; betweene both which, they suffered
two kinds of death, as being either killed, or drowned:
that it imported the majestie of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to
protect them, who had so many hundred yeares, lived
vnder their obedience, and were now plunged into
the depth of intolerable miseries: for besides the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of war, both civill and forraigne at one instant,
they were afflicted with dearth and famine, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them sometimes to yeelde themselves to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse
enemie. But their complaints availed nothing:
for the <hi>Romans</hi> plainely denyed to send them any more
succour: whereof the <hi>Scottishmen</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
advertised, and knowing how small a number
of ablemen remained in the Province, to withstand
their attempts, assailed first such places of strength as
garded the borders, and afterwards entred the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
it selfe, where, by continuall course of conquests,
they found a passage into the heart of the Ile, spoiled
the people of their wealth, burnt their Cities, and
brought the inhabitants thereof vnder a miserable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude.</p>

Thus, about five hundred yeares after the <hi>Romans</hi>
first entrance, and foure hundred fortie and six after the
birth of our Saviour Christ, the Ile of <hi>Britannie,</hi> (which
had beene, not onely a principall member of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,

                  <p>After him, <hi>Caius</hi> the Emperor, vpon lightnesse and

his successor prosecuted with effect; for he entred the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:8449:94"/>
Iland in his owne person, and subdued a small part
thereof, which he brought into the forme of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
placing there <hi>Aulus Plautius</hi> the first <hi>Lievtenant,</hi>
vnder whom <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> his sonne (being then
but private men) bare office in the camp. Thence-forth
men of special note &amp; regard were commonly sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
namely <hi>Ostorius Scapula</hi> (that tamed the <hi>Silures,</hi>
and <hi>Ordovices,</hi> and tooke <hi>Caractacus</hi> their Captaine pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner:)
<hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> (that conquered the Ile of

                  <p>Within few yeares after, <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
having transported an armie thither, to expell the
<hi>Picts</hi> &amp; north-<hi>Britans,</hi> (that then invaded the Province)
began first of all to reare a Wall of Turfes to defend it:
and this example <hi>Lollius Vrbicus</hi> (the <hi>Lievtenant</hi> vnder
<hi>Antoninus Pius</hi>) advisedly following, raised another wall
also of like stuffe, to strengthen the borders with a
double rampire; which fortresses the Northern <hi>Britans</hi>
boldly assailed, greatly annoying the Province, till by
<hi>Vlpius Marcellus</hi> they were opposed, and repulsed. After
whose departure there chanced in the <hi>Roman</hi> Campe
diverse mutinies, which <hi>Pertinax</hi> (that soone after ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Empire) fortunately appeased. Then lived
the <hi>Britans</hi> in peace for a time, till <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> the
<hi>Lievtenant</hi> (affecting innovation in the state, and presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vpon the strength and valour of the armie in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie)</hi>
assumed there the title of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and carried over
with him into <hi>France,</hi> a great number of the most war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:8449:94"/>
                     <hi>Britans,</hi> to renforce his armie, for support of his v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped
Soveraigntie: by which meanes the Province
was much weakned, and the <hi>Picts</hi> encouraged againe to
assaile it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour also, for desire of glorie, made
a voiage thither with <hi>Caracalla,</hi> and <hi>Geta</hi> (his two sonns,
and successors in the Empire) intending the conquest
of the most remote and Northerne part of the Ile
beyond <hi>Adrians</hi> wall: but his ill successe in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and despaire of better, made him soone give over
the enterprise, and to retire himselfe vnto the borders
of the Province, where (having repaired the decayed
wall, and cut a trench thwart the Ile from sea to sea) he
ended his life at Yorke.</p>
                  <p>What was done there from the time of <hi>Caracalla</hi> to
<hi>Gallienus</hi> the Emperour (whose state as well in <hi>Britannie</hi>
as other places was disturbed, by the <hi>Thirtie Tyrants,</hi>
the hystories now extant make little mention, till <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rausius</hi>
the Admirall of the <hi>Brittish</hi> fleete, and after him
<hi>Alectus,</hi> vsurped the Empire in <hi>Britannie:</hi> at what time
<hi>Constantius Caesar</hi> ruled the Province, and afterwards
(dying there) left it, as a member of the Empire to his
sonne <hi>Constantine</hi> surnamed the Great, who was first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Emperor in <hi>Britannie,</hi> whence he transported no
small number of the Inhabitants that had beene trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vp vnder the <hi>Roman Legions</hi> there, to make warre in
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germanie,</hi> which were then in Armes for
<hi>Maxentius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the death of <hi>Constantine,</hi> the discord betweene
his three sonnes gave advantage also to <hi>Magnentius Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porus</hi>
(whose father was a <hi>Britan</hi>) to vsurpe the Empire
in <hi>Britannie:</hi> and even then was the Province in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to have beene over-run by the <hi>Scottish-men</hi> and
<hi>Picts,</hi> if <hi>Theodosius</hi> had not providently repressed their
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:8449:95"/>
furie. <hi>Clemens Maximus</hi> in like maner, vpon emulation
of <hi>Theodosius</hi> glory, attempted the Empire, and shipped
over the flower of all <hi>Britannie</hi> into <hi>Belgia,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
where such as escaped the sword of the enemie, did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
seat themselves, leaving to their posteritie, the
continuance of their name in that place, even to this
day.</p>
                  <p>Then ensued confusion of all things in <hi>Britannie,</hi>
the Souldiers there swaying them at their owne will:
now naming Emperours; then deposing them againe,
and declaring others in their stead: among whom they
proclaimed one <hi>Constantine</hi> (for the names sake onely)
a man fatally ordained to be the instrument of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the Province: For by transporting into
<hi>France</hi> the remnant of the <hi>Brittish</hi> Souldiers, he vtterly
dis-furnished it, and laid it open to all oportunities of
annoyance by the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scottish-men,</hi> who, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(waxing insolent with their prosperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
in subduing a great part of the Province, and now
and then falling at variance and open warre among
themselves, about the distribution of such spoyles, and
booties as they had taken) did thereby give intermission
and time of breathing to the distressed <hi>Britans,</hi> that
stood (for the most part) vpon doubtfull termes, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
betweene hope and despaire, and yet sometimes
(like men not vtterly dejected, or neglecting occasions
of advantage, when they were offered) resuming cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
againe, and resolving rather to die with their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
then to abandon it. Whereupon (as <hi>Beda</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
they assembled themselves togither from diverse
places, and assailed their enemies, forcing them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
within their borders, by which meanes the <hi>Britans</hi>
(for certaine yeares) lived in peace, and fell to tillage,
and other handy works. After that ensued great plentie
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:8449:95"/>
of graine, and other fruits of the earth, which the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
abused, mis-spending them riotously in gluttonie
and drunkennesse. Then pride and dissolute living,
(the common causes of the change &amp; ruine of estates)
raigned, aswell among the Clergie, as the Laitie, both
whom the hand of God severely punished, by afflicting
them with a grievous pestilence and mortalitie, which
in short time wasted so many of them, as the quicke
were scarse sufficient in number to bury the dead. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
(the infection once ceasing) the <hi>Britans</hi> fell to their
old disorders, drawing therby a greater plague vpon
them, even the vtter subversion, and (in a manner)
rooting out of their name and nation, as by that which
followeth may partly appeare.</p>

were already come with their power, as farre as <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
vpon the river <hi>Welland:</hi>) assembled themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in severall companies; and the most antient and
best respected among them, entred into consultation,
what meanes might then be vsed for defence, in a case
of such necessitie. But first of all, for that they had found
by their late experience, what dangerous effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8449:96"/>
from civill jarres: they resolved with common
consent, to run all joyntly one and the same course: and
for the better strengthning of this their purpose, they
elected a King, (whose name was <hi>Vortiger</hi>) a man much
esteemed, both for the nobilitie of his birth, (as being
extract from the line of the <hi>Brittish</hi> Princes) and also,
for the generall good opinion conceived of his suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie
to vndergoe so weightie a charge, though the
eminencie of his degree, did (soone after) lay open
those vices and infirmities, which his private life had
concealed. To him did all the pettie Princes in the Ile
submit themselves.</p>
                  <p>Then they entred into consultation together, and
called to minde, the conditions of such Nations as
were most knowne vnto them, considering well with
themselves, that from the <hi>Romans,</hi> there was no more
reliefe to be expected, (<hi>Italy</hi> it selfe, the seate of the
Empire, being invaded by strangers:) that <hi>France</hi> was
assailed as well as <hi>Britannie:</hi> that <hi>Germany</hi> (though a
mightie and ample region) was not altogether free
from incumbrance. For, this Country had formerly
beene the common receptacle of those Northern peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that (dwelling beyond the rivers of <hi>Rhene</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now,</hi>
and being very fruitfull in generation) came vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thither to disburden themselves, and to seeke new
habitations: by reason whereof, the <hi>Germans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were much distressed, and now and then forced
to abandon their native soyle; being sometimes also
(by consent among themselves) chosen out by lots for
that purpose; howbeit those strangers, (which had there
planted themselves) were for the most part, better able
to annoy other countries, then to maintaine in peace,
what by intrusion and violence they had gotten. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
al the <hi>Germans,</hi> there was at that time no one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:8449:96"/>
which for great adventures both by sea and land,
was more renowned then the <hi>Saxons.</hi> For, touching
the qualities of the minde, they were bold, hardie, and
vaine-glorious, patiently enduring labour, hunger, and
cold, whereto by the very constitution of their bodies,
and temperature of the climate, they seemed to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
as being verie strong, and yet not vnwealdy, tall
of stature, but not vncomely, or out of due proportion.
For the North Region, by reason of the coldnesse of
the ayre, (which driveth the naturall heate inward)
bringeth forth commonly, men of greater courage and
abilitie of bodie, then those Countries that lie neerer
the Sunne. Their diet was simple and home-bred; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knew they any other a long time, till by attaching
some of the <hi>Romans</hi> ships, stragling about the Coasts
of <hi>France</hi> and the Lower <hi>Germanie,</hi> they became first
acquainted with their manner of vittailing. Their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
was neither verie costly, nor cumbersome, but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
indeede, rather for decencie and ornament, then
for defence against the sharpnesse of ayre, or such like
annoyances. For their garments were commonly of
linnen or yarne, woven with divers colours, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
loose about them: the lockes of their haire (which
in former times they had beene accustomed to shave)
being then curled and spred abroad in compasse, so that
they covered their shoulders and vpper parts of their
cassocks. The weapons which they ordinarily vsed in
fight, were long speares, round targets, and battle-axes;
having also (trussed vp behind at their backs) certaine
short swords, which they did weare continually for
readinesse vpon all occasions. In the Art of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they were verie expert, and lived at the first by
pilfering, and afterwardes by open robberie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
trayned vp therein, even from their child-hoode,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:8449:97"/>
vnder a kinde of discipline. Stormes at sea, vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
weather, perills of rockes and sands, losse of
goodes and shipwrackes, (which terrifie other men)
they carelesly contemned, while they seemed to have,
not onely a certaine knowledge of them, but also a
kinde of familiaritie with them. The offices of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and Marriners, they executed with like skill, and
oftentimes with equall advantage. There was no kind
of crueltie in a manner new, or strange vnto them: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were they altogither voide of policy, in watching
oportunities of time and place, to further their des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seins,
albeit they were (for the most part) more sodaine
in attempting and procuring other mens harmes, then
warie, or well advised in avoyding their owne. Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
in degrees they hardly admitted, but each man
commanded and obeyed, as the case required, being as
readie to learne of his fellowes, what he knew not, as to
instruct others in those things wherein he happened to
be more skilfull then the rest. Of their owne blood
they were nothing at all sparing, but they exercised
crueltie, sometimes even vppon themselves, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
lesse account, to cast away their owne lives,
then to indure any publicke shame, scorne, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
                  <p>When they did set foorth to sea vppon anie voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
their custome was, to choose out of the number
of their captives, every tenth man to be murdered,
and offered vp as a purging sacrifice to their profane
gods, esteeming it a worke of religion, and much
more behoovefull for them, then to receive any ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
for redemption of such prisoners as they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                  <p>The Ancestors of these <hi>Saxons,</hi> (as approoved
Writers report) did fetch their originall from the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:8449:97"/>
                     <hi>Sacae,</hi> (a people of <hi>Asia</hi>) that came first out of <hi>Scythia</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Europe</hi> with the <hi>Gothes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Suevians,</hi> and <hi>Dacians,</hi> and
(being either by nature inclined to warre, or by neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
constrained thereto, for supplying their owne
wants) ranged oft times from place to place, as men
alwaies ready, vpon hope of spoile, to be drawne into
any action, or to encounter any perill whatsoever. In
processe of time they seated themselves in <hi>Cimbrica
Chessonesus,</hi> (now called <hi>Denmarke:</hi>) and in the raigne
of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> the Emperour, became famous for their
piracies committed vpon the coasts of <hi>Britannie,</hi> and
the Lower <hi>Germanie;</hi> when <hi>Carausius</hi> (being sent forth
with a Navie to represse them) vnder colour of that
service, attempted and (with some difficultie) attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Empire. Afterwards, (passing over the river
of <hi>Elbe</hi>) they intruded themselves by little and little,
into the antient seate of the <hi>Suevians,</hi> encroching
also vpon <hi>Friseland</hi> and <hi>Holland:</hi> (then called <hi>Batavia</hi>)
the greatest number of them planting themselves in
that part of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which is now called <hi>Saxonie.</hi>
These were the men, whom the <hi>Britans</hi> supposed
best able, and most likely to assist them: and thereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
messengers were sent to declare vnto them, that
the fame of their valour and experience in warrelike
actions, had moved the <hi>Britans</hi> to require their aide,
against a barbarous and bloodie people, which assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by force, to subdue the whole Iland: that (next
the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had now abandoned it) they knew
no Nation more worthie then theirs: that the verie
terror of the <hi>Saxons</hi> name, (if they should but once
set foote in the Ile) was able to daunt their enemies,
who were (for the most part) men vnarmed, vnskilfull
in militare affaires, and many times confounded by
their owne multitude: finally, that if they would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:8449:98"/>
this warre, they should want, neither provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of victuall nor any thing else for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
the Iland being verie large and fruitfull, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
aboundance of all things, that might serve, either
for profite, or delight.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Saxons</hi> being very glad of this occasion of
employment, (which themselves would have sought,
if it had not beene thus offered) promised to satisfie
the <hi>Britans</hi> request, by sending over (with speede)
such able men as they had then in readinesse, till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
provision could be made. And so the messengers
were dismissed.</p>

should vndertake the warre against the <hi>Picts</hi> and
<hi>Scottishmen,</hi> and that the <hi>Britans</hi> should provide for
them all things necessarie thereto, as vittailes, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and souldiers wages: the charge whereof
should be borne by the <hi>Britans</hi> onely, who were to
leavie the same by way of tax, to be imposed vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie
inhabitant within the Province, according to
his abilitie: which contract, with other articles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
thereupon, being ratified on both parts;
<hi>Hengist</hi> (considering wisely the nature of the people
with whom he was to encounter, and the likely advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of sodaine attempts) thought it best to take the
first opportunitie, by leading the <hi>Saxons</hi> (who were
verie desirous to fight) and such of the <hi>Britans</hi> also
as he supposed fit for service, into those parts where
the barbarous enemie was lodged: and to that end,
provision of vittaile and other necessaries was made,
in such measure, as the shortnesse of the time would
permit.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scottishmen</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> albeit they did not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feare the <hi>Britans,</hi> (whose courage was much aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the ill successe that accompanied their late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts:)
yet, (hearing that new supplies of strangers were
arrived to assist them) they waxed more wary, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
themselves, for the most part, in their strength:
and now, (vpon certaine intelligence of the approach
of a well ordered Armie) they resolved to trie with
them the fortune of a set battaile: wherein they found
themselves more hardly matched, then in former
times, by reason that the <hi>Saxons,</hi> (nimbly avoyding the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:8449:99"/>
darts and speares wherewith they were assailed) did
fircely rush vpon the <hi>Picts,</hi> and with their keene swords
and weightie axes, made way thorow their thickest
troopes: so that (having borne downe the most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
before them) they enforced the rest to forsake the
field, and save themselves by flight. After this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
they returned to the Ile of <hi>Tanet,</hi> (which at their
first arrivall, was assigned to them for a place of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
and <hi>Hengist</hi> their Captaine, fortified there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
places for defence: hoping by that meanes, both
to keepe his owne Territorie in surety, and also (as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
might serve) to inlarge it. For he apprehended
it as a matter of no great difficultie, to make a conquest
of the East part of the Ile; considering that the naturall
inhabitants were alreadie brought vpon their knees,
the King himelfe given over to ease and pleasure, and
in his owne conceit, the more secure, the lesse he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medled
with publike affaires:) that the state of the
warre now in hand, rested meerely in his owne directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the more freely he was trusted, the more safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he might deceive: that (though he was sent for to
helpe the <hi>Britans,</hi>) yet (this faire occasion being offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
which Fortune seemed to have cast into his lap)
he had no reason to neglect it, by seeking other mens
advantage rather then his owne. As for the contract
made with them, he was no further bound to it, then
the <hi>Britans</hi> themselves, who had alreadie failed in
performance of some covenants, that the breath of
one dissolveth all the rest: and finally, that in him, who
hath power, (to prevaile where he attempts) nothing
can be adjudged vnlawfull. With these, or the like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations,
he nourished his ambitious humor; howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,
knowing well, that the forces which were alreadie
brought into the Ile, would not be sufficient to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:8449:99"/>
the enterprize: hee perswaded <hi>Vortiger,</hi> it was
verie necessarie, that more aide should be sent for out
of <hi>Germanie:</hi> and to that end he named his brother
<hi>Octha,</hi> and his sonne <hi>Ebusa,</hi> (men of approved valour)
who might be directed to land with a power in the
<hi>Picts</hi> owne Country, and to assaile the inhabitants
there, while himselfe in the South parts pursued the
rest of them, (with whom he had alreadie encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred:)
whose forces being by that meanes diverted
from the heart of the Ile, to succour their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
at home, or wanting their wonted supplies, which
should then of force be employed else-where for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
there might be some hope of a speedie and full
end of the warre: the event whereof, otherwise was
now more to be feared then in former times, if the
<hi>North-Britans,</hi> (whetted with desire of revenge, and
having space of breathing given them) should make
head, and assaile them againe. This counsell seeming
profitable, (howsoever it prooved pernitious in the
end) was allowed by the King, eyther for that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
not the perill likely to ensue thereupon: or else,
for that such things as God himselfe hath determined,
are doubtlesse (though sometimes foreseene) yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prevented.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the meane while, the <hi>Germans</hi> (inflamed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
reports of the wealth and fruitfulnesse of the
Ile) and sollicited by <hi>Hengist</hi> (who discovered to them
the weake estate of the <hi>Britans,</hi> and the facillitie of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
them,) hired certaine small vessels; wherein
themselves, their wives, children, and families were
transported into diverse parts of the Land: at which
time, <hi>Rowen</hi> the daughter of <hi>Hengist</hi> (a woman of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
beautie, and not of the worst behavior) (having
beene specially sent for by her father) arrived in <hi>Kent,</hi>
and was forthwith conveyed to the pallace, where <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiger,</hi>
and <hi>Hengist</hi> made their abode.</p>
                  <p>Of those <hi>Germans</hi> that then came over, there
were three severall kinds of people: namely, <hi>Saxons,
Iutes,</hi> and <hi>Angles,</hi> though the <hi>Saxons</hi> seemed to beare
the most sway, by reason both of the generall respect of
that Nation, for their many and great exploits, and also
for the authoritie of their Captains, <hi>Hengist,</hi> and <hi>Horsa,</hi>
who were of the linage of <hi>Woden,</hi> from whom the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
Princes (that afterwards reigned in the Ile) vsed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
(for honours sake) to derive their discent. From
these <hi>Saxons,</hi> the East, West, and South <hi>Saxons</hi> had their
originall. The <hi>Iutes</hi> (as some writers report, and as the
affinitie of the names may seeme in some sort to inferre)
were discended from the <hi>Getes,</hi> and <hi>Gothes,</hi> and dwelt in
the vpper part of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> which is at this day called
<hi>Iuitland.</hi> From them the <hi>Kentishmen,</hi> with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8449:100"/>
of the Ile of <hi>Wight,</hi> and of that part of the firme
land (which lieth over against it) had their beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The name of the <hi>Iutes,</hi> was of no long continuance in
<hi>Britannie:</hi> notwithstanding, their posteritie was incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
into the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Angles,</hi> who were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but one Nation, the name of either of them being
indifferently vsed, as common to both; till in the end,
the <hi>Angles</hi> possessing the greatest part of the land, they
were all knowen, and called by that name alone.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Angles</hi> in those dayes were a people well estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
among the <hi>Germans,</hi> and in number exceeded
both the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Iutes.</hi> Touching their ancient seat,
the opinions of Writers are differing, though it be most
probable, that they did sometimes inhabit that part of
<hi>Denmarke</hi> (yet retaining the name of <hi>Angle</hi>) which lieth
betweene <hi>Iuitland,</hi> and <hi>Holsatia.</hi> From them came the
East <hi>Angles,</hi> the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and <hi>Northumbers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Hengist</hi> knowing well, that fraud, and cunning
practises ofttimes prevaile, where force it selfe cannot,
resolved (as occasion might serve) to make vse of both;
and to that end (observing well the Kings humor) he
applied himselfe in all things to follow it: specially, by
soothing and nourishiug him in those vices, to which
by Nature he was most addicted, supposing thereby to
strengthen his owne estate, and with more securitie, to
accomplish his desire: while the King intended nothing
more, then the satisfaction of his immoderate appetite
in sensuall pleasures, which had alreadie brought him
into contempt and hatred with his people, and would
by all likelihood open the way to his speedie destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Whereupon one day (inviting <hi>Vortiger</hi> to a feast)
he appointed <hi>Rowen</hi> his daughter, to attend vpon him
as his Cup-bearer: at which time (by her fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction)
she behaved herselfe in such maner, as the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8449:101"/>
King fell in love with her: and although he had a wife
then living, yet was he not ashamed to tell <hi>Hengist</hi> in
plaine termes, that he earnestly desired to become his
sonne in law, if he might attaine his consent for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of his danghter. <hi>Hengist</hi> (who had cast out his
bait of purpose to catch him) pretended respect of <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigers</hi>
owne reputation, which (as he said) should be too
much impaired by matching with a poore Maiden, a
stranger by birth, farre inferior to him in degree, and no
way worthy of so great fortune; howbeit, in the end he
seemed by intreatie to yeeld to that, which himselfe
would voluntarily have offred: and so (making vse of
the occasion) he was content to take the thanks, which
he of right should have given. Hereupon <hi>Vortiger</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cast behind him all regard, both of divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
lawes, did put away his lawfull wife (by whom
he had three children) and (contrarie to the advise of
his faithfull Counsellers) married <hi>Hengist</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi>
daughter. Vpon the conclusion of this marriage, a
great part of the Countrey of <hi>Kent</hi> (which had beene
many yeares togither governed by <hi>Guorongus,</hi> as the
Kings deputie there) was assigned to <hi>Hengist,</hi> who like
a wilie Serpent, having now gotten in his head, found
meanes in a short time to wind in his whole bodie.</p>
                  <p>It is reported by some Writers, that <hi>Vodin</hi> (then
Archbishop of <hi>London</hi>) reprooving the King for his
incontinencie, and other vices (which drew him down
with his Realme to ruine) was by the commandement
of <hi>Hengist</hi> put to death, with many other Priests, and
religious Votaries, as persons too well affected to their
Country, and odious to the <hi>Saxons</hi> for profession of
Christianitie.</p>
                  <p>This inconsiderate match, and immesurable boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the King, was much disliked by the <hi>Britans,</hi> for
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:8449:101"/>
that the <hi>Saxons,</hi> presuming of the Kings favour, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his new affinitie with them, came over dayly in
great numbers, pestering the East parts of the Ile, and
many times offering abuse to the naturall Inhabitants.
Whereupon the <hi>Brittish</hi> Nobilitie complained to the
King, that their estate was now much woorse then
before the <hi>Saxons</hi> arrivall: that Strangers (vnder the
colour of friendship) robbed them of their goods,
and bereaved them of their lands: that secret prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises
of such as they trusted, were no lesse to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
then open hostilitie: and that if speedie order
were not taken to expell them, they would in short
time roote out the ancient <hi>Britans,</hi> and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Lords of the whole Iland. But <hi>Vortiger</hi> (whose
affection to his wife, and her kindred weighed downe
all other respects whatsoever) neglected their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
till by his owne experience he was taught,
what daungerous inconveniences proceede from wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
rashnesse, and mis-government. For the <hi>Britans</hi>
(disdaining to be any longer commanded by such a
Prince, as had neither power to command his owne
affections, nor care to provide for the safetie of his
Subjects) declared him vncapable, and by generall
consent, deprived him of all regall authoritie.</p>

                  <p>THen <hi>Vortimer</hi> his sonne (a man in disposition of
his mind much vnlike his father) was declared
King, &amp; renued the warre with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> whom
he encountred in a pitched field neere <hi>Ailsford</hi> in
<hi>Kent.</hi> In that conflict <hi>Catigern</hi> his brother, and <hi>Horsa</hi> the
brother of <hi>Hengist,</hi> fighting hand to hand, were both
slaine, whereby though the <hi>Saxons</hi> perished in greater
number then the <hi>Britans:</hi> yet by the losse of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
on both sides, the fortune of the battaile seemed
in a maner to be equall. On the part of the <hi>Britans</hi>
there died no man of name, save onely <hi>Catigern,</hi> in
remembrance of whose death there was afterwards a
Sepulchre of stone erected, where the battaile was
fought. The like Monument was also built by the
<hi>Saxons</hi> for <hi>Horsa,</hi> their Captaine, though Time hath
now defaced it: howbeit the memorie of the place
it selfe (if credite may be given to the Inhabitants
there,) is continued among them even to this day, by
a small Village in East <hi>Kent,</hi> yet bearing his name.
After this, the <hi>Britans</hi> made diverse attempts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their enemies, sometimes winning, sometimes
loosing; and then recovering againe, that which they
had lost, when <hi>Vortimer</hi> the King ended his dayes,
either by a naturall death, or by the trecherie of
<hi>Rowen</hi> his Stepmother. He was a Prince of great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:8449:102"/>
adorned with many Morall vertues, and (as some
writers have reported) a favorer and professor of the
Christian religion.</p>
                  <p>Then was <hi>Vortiger</hi> the King (either vpon hope that
adversitie had wrought in him a reformation of mind,
or else, for feare lest any civill discord should arise by
the election of any other) revoked with common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the <hi>Britans,</hi> and restored to his former estate.
During his Sonnes raigne (as the <hi>Brittish</hi> Storie repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
he lived a private life neere <hi>Radnor</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi>
where he bestowed much cost in building a Castle for
defence (as himselfe vainly imagined against any sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
assault.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, the strength of the <hi>Saxons</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by new supplies, which came dayly out of
<hi>Germanie:</hi> and the <hi>Britans</hi> now doubted their owne
estates so much the more, by reason that the <hi>Picts</hi>
and <hi>Scottish-men</hi> (their ancient enemies) were disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in most parts of the Ile: the <hi>Saxons</hi> also, for their
owne aduantage, entring oftentimes into secret confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracie
and mutuall leagues with them.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Hengist</hi> (supposing that he could not with
safetie enjoy the possession of that territorie, which <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiger</hi>
had assigned vnto him, so long as the chiefe, and
most valiant of the <hi>Brittish</hi> Nation remained alive) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
by a cunning practise (vnder pretence of hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie
and friendship) to draw them togither into one
place, and on the suddaine to surprise them. To this
end he prepared a solemne Banquet, at which the
King, with diverse Noble personages (as bidden
guests) were present, suspecting nothing lesse, then
what was intended against them. For the <hi>Britans</hi>
being warme with good cheere, and wine (whereof
they had drunke immeasurably) were scoffed at by the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:8449:103"/>
                     <hi>Saxons,</hi> the one provoking the other so farre with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull
termes, that in the end they fell from words
to blowes, in such furious maner, as the <hi>Britans</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about three hundred in number, all vnarmed, and
surcharged with Wine,) were slaine in the place, and
<hi>Vortiger</hi> their King taken prisoner; who (soone after
delivering for his ransome, the whole Countrey of
<hi>Kent,</hi> with other Provinces thereto adjoyning, into
the <hi>Saxons</hi> hands) fled to his Castle in <hi>Wales:</hi> where
(supposing himselfe free from danger) he continued
his vitious and prophane maner of living, till in the
end, both himselfe, and his Castle (as some Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
affirme) was by lightning from heaven consumed
to ashes.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Vortiger</hi> the last King of the <hi>Brittish</hi> blood,
a Prince in manners dissolute, and weake in actions,
was by Strangers dispossessed of his Kingdome: li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to see the ruine of his Countrey, whereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was the principall cause, and dying in the ende a
strange and vnnaturall death, which is commonly
the issue of a disordered and infamous life.</p>

did cast vpon a white garment at a venture: then (if the

the Priest; if a private person onely, the maister of the

of all things necessarie for support of the

them from joyning their forces together any
more: to which end, they divided themselves into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
companies, with a full resolution, either vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to destroy, or to expell them out of the Ile: which
they had almost brought to passe, when <hi>Aurelianus Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosius,</hi>
comming out of <hi>Britannie</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> brought
hither some of the <hi>Britans,</hi> (that had feated themselves
there) who (pittying their distressed countrymen in the
Iland) determined, either to relieve them, or to perish
in the enterprize. This <hi>Ambrosius</hi> was a <hi>Roman</hi> by birth,

of the race of that <hi>Constantine</hi> who for the hope of
his name onely, (which was reputed ominous) had
beene elected Emperour by the <hi>Roman</hi> Armie in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannie.</hi>

he valiantly defeated. The most memorable was tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
which he fought on <hi>Bathon-hill,</hi> where he obtained a
notable and (if credit in that point may be given to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
reports) an admirable victorie: and surely, had not
the inevitable power of Fate otherwise determined;
doubtlesse the <hi>Britans</hi> should have needed no other
helpe to support and repaire their declining and torne
estate. For besides his good inclination to protect the
Christian faith, he was adorned with many heroicall
vertues, but chiefly renowned for the love of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valrie.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Brittish</hi> Story reporteth, that he instituted an
Order of Knights, who (as his companions) did sit
with him at a round Table, whereupon they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Knights of the Round Table:</hi> that forme of a Table,
seeming perhaps most fit to avoid contention, which
many times ariseth among great spirits about superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of place. These Knights were commonly chosen
for their valour and skill in feats of Armes, wherein
they strived (vpon emulation) one to excel another. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this societie were admitted strangers of divers Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who for desire of glory, came over into the Iland,
to make proofe of their sufficiency by exercise of armes
with the <hi>Brittish</hi> Knights. For <hi>Arthur</hi> himself (by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
great &amp; difficult enterprises in forraigne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
after he had subdued the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>Britannie</hi>)
made his name no lesse famous abroad then at home.</p>
                  <p>Touching his birth, some have doubted whether he
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:8449:107"/>
were a <hi>Roman,</hi> or a <hi>Britan:</hi> though the <hi>Britans</hi> challenge
him for their Countryman, confidently affirming, that
he was borne at <hi>Tyndagel</hi> in <hi>Cornewall;</hi> and surely, if the
acts of such worthy men (as at sundry times were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
out of the Ile to aide the <hi>Romans</hi> in the wane of
the Westerne Empire) had beene faithfully registred,
the glorie of the <hi>Brittish</hi> Nation might well have been
preserved from all suspition of vntruth, without the
support of forged and fabulous inventions. As for the
place where he died, or the manner of his death, I find
no certaine report concerning the same in any appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Writer: But his body was buried at <hi>Glastenbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
betweene two <hi>Pyramides,</hi> where the enscription
of his name (engraven vpon a leaden Crosse) was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
many hundred yeares after his death; namely,
in the raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the second; who (having
some intelligence of the place, by the songs of the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
Bards) commanded it to be digged, and the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be sought for.</p>
                  <p>Divers strange and incredible things to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of posteritie, have beene written of this Prince,
of Queene <hi>Guinever</hi> his wife, of <hi>Gawen</hi> his sisters sonne,

called, <hi>Wandring Knights:</hi> matters indeede more
fit for feined Legends, and poeticall fictions, then for a
Historie, which ought to be a Register of things, either
truely done, or at least, warrantable by probabilitie.
And albeit those ridiculous and absurd reports of idle
Writers, doe seeme to have repaired the reputation of
this Prince, and to have called in question the truth it
selfe, so farre forth, as some have doubted, whether
there were ever any such man or not: yet divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of good regard, (pittying his misfortune in that

severall Principalities.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter the death of the noble Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> the
hope of the <hi>Britans</hi> was cleane abated, and a great
number of them fled secretly into <hi>Wales</hi> and
<hi>Cornewall,</hi> as places furthest off from annoyance by the
enemie, and naturally defensible, by reason of the
bogges, woods, and high mountaines on the one side,
and the seas on the other. Then the <hi>Saxons</hi> finding
little or no resistance, began in processe of time, to erect
certaine Provinciall governments in the South parts of
the Ile, &amp; in the end, divided the whole Land (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that portion which the <hi>Scottishmen</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
Northward) into seven Principalities, which
were severed by certaine limits, and governed (for the
most part) by Princes, according to order of successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
till by making continuall warre one vpon another,
and the Provinces subdued, augmenting the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Conqueror, the whole land was in the end
brought into a Monarchy by the West <hi>Saxons.</hi> But in
what manner these things were done, the Writers of
former ages have much varied, and the actions and
events of those times, being set downe so darkely and
corruptly, that I purposed to have omitted the relation
of them, (as a hard and vnpleasant taske for me to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8449:108"/>
and likely to receive small approbation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:)
if I had not beene thereto induced, partly for
respect of order, which required a continuation, and
partly vpon desire to preserve the memory of some
men, whose names, (as marks of our Christianitie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
vpon vs in our baptisme, and registred in our
calenders &amp; Churches) are at this day in some vse with
vs: deserving well (considering the state and condition
of that age) not to be altogether forgotten, howsoever
their doings through the negligence or ignorance of
some Writers, have beene left to posteritie, as records
of Antiquitie, farced with absurdities, and composed
meerely of fragm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nts peeced together, sometimes
without method, and, for the most part, without due
coherence of circumstances and matters. For many of
those Writers, (being Monks and religious persons)
vnacquainted with matters of estate, applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for the most part, to register the charitable deeds
of their Bishops and benefactors, founders and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of Monasteries and Hospitalls, or such like ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
observations: and if aught were well written by
any secular man, the same hath perished by the many
calamities of the Country, (a thing common to vs
with other Nations) or Time it selfe hath worn out, in
a manner, the remembrance thereof.</p>
                  <p>I purpose therefore, to make onely a bare and simple
narration of the names of the Princes, and to point
out the most memorable things (as I finde them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported)
in their severall raignes: distinguishing the
Principalities themselves, and relating successively
one after another, such actions, as for the most part,
concurred in time: whereby, though I shall be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
forced to report the same matters, yet I shall
more easily avoide confusion and obscuritie, which
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:8449:108"/>
the handling of them all joyntly, would bring with it.
And so superficially passing over these imperfect af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
of the seven-fold regiment of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
I will hasten to the occurrents of those times,
which afford more certaine and plentifull matter
of discourse, and may yeeld (perhaps) some

profite and delight to the

that part, which at this day is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

being the very entrance &amp; key of
the whole Iland. The west &amp; south
sides of it butte vpon the firme

navigable for ships of very great burden, and ebbing

This Principalitie (enlarged by addition of such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces

no great occasion was ministred to shew himselfe in
action, (the <hi>Britans</hi> being now seated in the remote
parts of the Ile, and his owne countrymen making
warre in other places of the same) or else, for that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wearied with the warre) he gave himselfe to ease
and quietnesse, supposing hee had done enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie,
in making the first attempt in an enterprize
so difficult, and in getting and leaving to his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
the possession of so faire and fruitfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>

                     <hi>Ethelbert</hi> (succeeding <hi>Ermeric</hi> his father) was in the

warres, which he made with very ill successe against
<hi>Ceaulin,</hi> Prince of the <hi>West-Saxons:</hi> but afterwards,
(his knowledge in militare affaires increasing with his

his Dominion, (by reducing the South Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to his obedience) even to the water of <hi>Humber.</hi>
And the better to strengthen his estate by forraigne

(that accompanied her into <hi>Britannie</hi>) to vse the Rites

eyther for observance of the contract which <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelbert</hi>
before the marriage had made with the King
her Father to that end, or else, for the heartie and
entire affection which hee bare vnto her, as his wife,
whom God had ordained to bee the meanes of his
conversion to the Christian faith.</p>
                  <p>For in the yeare of grace five hundred ninetie sixe,
and fourteenth of the raigne of <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<hi>Austen</hi> a Monke, was sent by <hi>Gregory</hi> the first,
(surnamed the Great, then Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) to preach
the faith to the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> then inhabiting
the Ile of <hi>Britannie,</hi> where (landing in the Ile of <hi>Tanet,</hi>
vpon the coast of <hi>Kent</hi>) hee was entertained in curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
manner by <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the Prince, whose heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
somewhat prepared by his wives perswasion,
and by the example of <hi>Luidhard,</hi> the devout Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
that lived with her) was more apt, in time, to
take impression of the Truth, whereto (though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
assented not at the first,) yet hee licensed it
to be taught privately, and assigned to <hi>Austen</hi> a
convenient seate at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (the cheefe Citie of
that Province) giving him an olde Church, which in
former times had beene erected by certaine <hi>Romans.</hi>
(exercising there the Christian religion) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated

to our Saviour Christ. This Church was
then reedified, and (not many yeares after) <hi>Austen</hi>
without the Citie Eastward, layd the foundation of
a Monasterie: for which <hi>Ethelbert</hi> erected a Church,
wherein both <hi>Austen</hi> himselfe with his successours,
and also the Christian Princes of <hi>Kent,</hi> were (for the
most part) interred after their death. This Monasterie
being finished, long time after <hi>Austens</hi> decease, was
dedicated to him by the name of Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> whose
memoriall the ruines of that place retaine even to this
day.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Austen converteth divers of the Saxons and English
from Paganisme to Christianitie. The cause that
first moved Gregorie the Great to intend their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.
Austen is consecrated chief Bishop of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Nation by the Bishop of Arles in France. He
advertiseth the Bishop of Rome, of the successe of his
voyage into Britannie, and requireth directions tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Ecclesiasticall governement to be there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the meane time, <hi>Austen</hi> (beeing now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as the Apostle of the <hi>English</hi> Nation) and
such Priests as were with him, exercised their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
functions, without empeachment; and
for that they were altogether ignorant of the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
language, they vsed the helpe of such Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
as they had brought with them out of
<hi>France,</hi> in preaching and instructing the people: with
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:8449:113"/>
whom, partly by their doctrine, and partly by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
they prevailed so much, as many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
and were baptized: for their teachers began
then to expresse in their lives the practise of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in the Primitive Church, by continuall watching,
fasting, and praying, contemning the world, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
themselves with things necessarie to sustaine
Life and Nature: so strongly were they possessed with
the spirit of zeale, in first planting the Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
among Idolatrous <hi>Saxons,</hi> and <hi>English.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is reported, that <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Great (when he was

presented in an open Market at <hi>Rome,</hi> to be there sold:
For, marking well their faire complexions, and comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of stature, he enquired whence they were: and
vnderstanding that they were <hi>Angles,</hi> of a Province cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

heathen (for so the Inhabitants of those parts then

inward grace: and thereupon alluding to the name of
their Prince and Country, (according to their signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
in the <hi>Latin,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue;) he vttered
these words, as it were by way of Prophecie: <hi>These men
are worthily called</hi> Angles, <hi>for they have the verie faces of</hi>
Angels: <hi>and they shall be one day fellow heires with</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

De-ira Divina, <hi>by their conversion to the Christian faith:
and</hi> Alla <hi>their King must be taught to sing</hi> Alleluia <hi>to the

Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) he was made the Instrument to effect,
by sending <hi>Austen</hi> at this time to preach the faith of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:8449:114"/>
Christ in <hi>Britannie,</hi> where (in a short space) the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion encreased, in such measure, that vpon one
day (wherein the memoriall of the birth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
was celebrated) there was above ten thousand men,
besides women and children, baptized in a river: the
water thereof being hallowed by <hi>Austen</hi> the Monke,
who commanded the people (by reason of the great
multitude, and the small number of Priests) to go in by
couples, and one to baptise another, In the name of the
blessed Trinitie.</p>
                  <p>When these things were done, <hi>Austen</hi> went into
<hi>France,</hi> where (according to order given by the Sea

Bishop of <hi>Arles</hi> consecrated chiefe Bishop of the

to <hi>Austen,</hi> and the rest of his Associates, how
acceptable a worke, to God and his Church, they
had performed: commending their great zeale, and
constant minds, which neither the travaile of a long
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8449:114"/>
and laborious journey, nor feare of danger by sea or
land, could dismay from persisting in their good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
giving thanks to God, that had assisted them with
his spirit, and exhorting them to hold on the course in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which they were alreadie entred.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Ecclesiasticall government, if there
were any thing, either in the Church of <hi>Rome, France,</hi>
or any other Church, which <hi>Austen</hi> thought meete to
be altered, for the better service of God: he willed him
therein to vse his pastorall authoritie, and to select out
of everie one of them, what himselfe thought most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for setling an vniformitie of government in the
Church of <hi>Britannie:</hi> affirming, that divine worship was
not to be esteemed in regard of the place, but the place
to be honoured, in regard of the divine worship. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he put him in mind of the ancient custome of the
Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> which had ordeined the profits and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of Bishoprikes to be divided into foure equall
parts: whereof the first was assigned to the Bishop him
self, and the family, for the maintenance of hospitalitie:
the second for the benefite of the Clergie in generall:
the third for reliefe of the poore, and the fourth for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of Churches.</p>
                  <p>Then he admonished him, to deale gently with the
new Converts, and to tollerate some of their erronious
Traditions for a time, lest by restraining them at first
to the precise observation of Christian discipline in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie
point, he might divert them from their good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and hinder the proceeding in the generall cause:
For he supposed it a matter of verie great difficultie, to
plucke vp at once those ranke weedes of Superstition,
which by long continuance of time had taken deepe

desireth to attaine the highest place, must ascend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8449:115"/>
by steps and degrees, and not by leapes (as it were)
in an instant.</p>
                  <p>He answered likewise many other objections, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by <hi>Austen.</hi> concerning degrees of consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and aliance, to be observed in cases of Marriage,
and also touching the admission of meete persons to be
partakers of the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>Touching the punishment of <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> he advised,
that offenders therein might first be charitably corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
&amp; admonished, to the end, that (knowing the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the crime) they might, by penance, and resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
make amends, and detest from thence-foorth to
commit the like.</p>
                  <p>With the Bishops of <hi>France,</hi> he willed him not to
intermeddle otherwise then by counsaile, and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
lest (by interposing himselfe in matters of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
government there) he should seeme to thrust
his Sickle into an other mans Harvest: but he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all the Bishops of <hi>Britannie</hi> to be vnder his juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
giving him power to nominate, and consecrate

by his conformitie to those things which they taught,
a happie entrance was alreadie made for reducing

                  <p>He founded a Church in the Citie of <hi>London,</hi>

                  <p>At that <hi>Synod,</hi> seven <hi>Brittish</hi> Bishops, certain Monks
of <hi>Bangor</hi> (the greatest Monasterie in the Ile, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Dinothus</hi> was then Abbot) and diverse others well
reputed for their learning and knowledge in divinitie
were present. It is reported, that the <hi>Brittish</hi> Bishops
(before their comming thither) asked counsaile of an
<hi>Anchorite</hi> (a wise and holie man) living there about,
what he thought meetest for them to do in that great
businesse which they had then in hand: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they should follow the advice and directions of
<hi>Austen,</hi> or retaine still their ancient Traditious: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it is said, that the <hi>Anchorite</hi> made this answer: <hi>If he be

humilitie: For Christ sayeth: Take vpon you my yoke,
and learne of me, for I am milde, and humble of heart:
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:8449:117"/>
If therefore you perceive by his behaviour, that hee is prowd
and high minded, then be ye well assured, that he is not of God.</hi>
Heereupon, when they came to the place where the
Synod was to be kept, and saw <hi>Austen</hi> sitting in a chaire,
but not saluting them at their first entrance, nor see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
by his outward gesture to respect them: they
supposed the Anchorists speech to have beene in part
then verified, and with much impatiency, heard the
Arch-bishops oration: wherein they were specially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to preserve the vnitie of the Christian faith, and
(though they did many things contrarie to the vsage
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,) yet to conforme themselves
thereto in three points, namely, in celebrating the feast
of <hi>Easter</hi> in due-time, in exercising the ministery of
Baptisme, according to the manner of the Church of
<hi>Rome:</hi> and in joyning with him, and the rest of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Bishops, in preaching the Gospel of Christ to the
heathen of that Nation; which if they would faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performe, he promised, for avoyding contention, (a
matter very dangerous, considering the present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the time) to tolerate the continuance of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
old rites and traditions, wherein they should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the <hi>Britans</hi> (imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that he, who at his first comming, vsed them in
that disdainefull manner, would afterwards, being set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in a superintendency over them, vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
them) discovered plainely their discontentment
by their countenances, and made a short answer; that
they would neither observe those things which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at their hands, nor acknowledge him for their
Bishop: Whereto <hi>Austen</hi> with bitter words replyed;
that sith they would not receive peace when it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
they should ere long, feele the heavy hand of war

of the wisest and best learned men of his Province, he
made certaine constitutions (after the manner of the
<hi>Romans</hi>) and published them in the English tongue,
to the end his people might vnderstand them, and (by
knowing the penalties imposed vpon offences) more
readily avoid the offences themselves. By these lawes
he provided first for the weale and safegard of religious
persons, ordaining restitution and severe punishment
for such as by theft or violence, tooke away anything
from Churches, Bishops, or Priests. For he thought it
very meete, that he should, by all meanes, protect and

after ensued the recoverie of his bodily health, which
by many grievous infirmities, had beene a long

he was rebaptized) he spent in devotion and deeds of
charity, to expiate and make satisfaction for his former
impietie and Apostacie.</p>

                  <p>THen <hi>Ercombert</hi> his son, (by <hi>Emma</hi> the daughter
of the King of <hi>France</hi>) a temperate and religious
Prince, prosecuted the worke which his father
had begun, in reestablishing the Christian faith within
his Dominions The idolatrous Priests he banished, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
their Temples to the ground, and erecting others
for the service of the true God. The subjects of his
Realme (being much inclined to excesse in eating and
drinking) he restrained, by commanding a publike fast,
during the space of fortie daies, to be yeerely kept, for
the better exercise of devotion; which custome conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
among the <hi>English</hi> even to this day. The Church
of <hi>Canterburie</hi> was governed in his time by <hi>Honorius,</hi>
who first (as it is reported) divided his Province into
Parishes, and left his Sea to <hi>Deus-dedit,</hi> the first <hi>Saxon</hi>
Arch Bishop, (the former being strangers of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;)
his owne name was <hi>Frithona,</hi> which for his zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
inclination towardes the advancement of the
Church and Common-weale, was changed into <hi>Deus-dedit,</hi>
as the man whom God himselfe had specially
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:8449:120"/>
given. After him, <hi>Wighard</hi> was elected, but died at <hi>Rome</hi>
before his consecration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ercombert</hi> the Prince, having peaceably ruled the
<hi>Kentish Saxons</hi> about foure and twenty yeares, ended
his life when the continuance thereof was most desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
He had by <hi>Sexourga,</hi> (one of the daughters of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
Prince of the <hi>East-Angles</hi>) a sonne named <hi>Egbert,</hi>
that succeeded him in the governement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Egbert</hi> ruled the <hi>Kentish-Saxons</hi> with great moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and had not his hands beene defiled with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood of <hi>Elbert</hi> and <hi>Egelbright,</hi> his cosin ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
he might worthily have beene registred in the
number of their best princes.</p>
                  <p>In his time there lived <hi>Adrianus</hi> the Abbot, and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus,</hi>
(a <hi>Graecian</hi> borne) then Arch-bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and the last of those that came out of <hi>Italie.</hi> They
were men of speciall regard for their learning and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
of life. This <hi>Theodorus</hi> began first of all others, to
exercise his Pontificall authoritie over all <hi>Britannie,</hi>
placing and displacing Bishops at his pleasure, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating
(contrary to ordinances of the church of <hi>Rome</hi>)
Bishops of other Seas in the Citie of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and either
by force or shew of right, removing first <hi>Cedda,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<hi>Wilfrid,</hi> (who had bin Bishops of that place)
pretending, that the wealth and possessions of that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke
alone, were sufficient to maintaine three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and that it was meete they should be divided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly:
but whether he did it for the selfe same end
that was pretended, or for envie at the glorie and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of that Sea, I will not take vpon me to censure.
Howbeit, <hi>Wilfrid</hi> (being thus expelled, and his Sea dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred)
exhibited his complaint to <hi>Agatho,</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome;</hi> notwithstanding he sought thereby, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to manifest his owne innocency, then to accuse
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8449:120"/>
                     <hi>Theodorus.</hi> Whereupon, being in the end acquited
by judgement of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was remanded
into his former seate, which yet he could not obtaine,
by reason that <hi>Egfrid,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
refused to receive him, while <hi>Theodorus</hi> either openly
opposed against his re-admission, or cunningly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
laboured to empeach it: the reputation of this
Arch-bishop, (as of a stowt Prelate, and very well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
both in Philosophie and Divinitie) being so great
with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in those daies, as she would
not alter or make frustrate, what he indirectly had esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished;
for further proofe whereof, also may serve the

which by right appertained to <hi>Edrick</hi>
his Nephew, and (seeking by force, to keepe and
maintaine what by wrongfull intrusion he had gotten)
was in the end (after many conflicts) wounded with a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:8449:121"/>
dart, whereof he died. Then <hi>Edrick,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
recovered the Principalitie, which hee possessed
with little quiet, partly by reason of civill dissention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
some of his owne subjects, that aspired to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement,
and partly, for that the <hi>Kentish</hi> Territorie
was then invaded by <hi>Moll,</hi> (the brother of <hi>Ceadwall,</hi>
Prince of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi>) and divers valiant Captaines
his associates, whom the <hi>Kentishmen,</hi> by casting fire vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
their Tents, destroyed and consumed to ashes.
Whereupon <hi>Ceadwall,</hi> to revenge his brothers death,
hotly pursued the war in <hi>Kent,</hi> and expulsed <hi>Edrick</hi> the
Prince, spoiling and burning Townes as he marched,
and chasing the inhabitants from place to place, with
little or no resistance. By reason of these troubles, the
Province remained certaine yeares without a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
till <hi>Withred</hi> (the sonne of <hi>Egbert</hi>) purchasing peace
with money, obtained the Regiment, although <hi>Sweb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi>
at that time held part of the Province, either by
vsurpation, or composition. About this time <hi>Berctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
governed the Sea of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> vnto which <hi>Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winus</hi>
succeeded: and after him <hi>Nothelmus,</hi> who was a
speciall helper of venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> in furnishing him
with notes and instructions for composing his storie
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> After the death of <hi>Withred,</hi>
his three sonnes, <hi>Edbert, Edelbert,</hi> &amp; <hi>Alrich,</hi> ruled succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively.
During the raigne of <hi>Edbert</hi> the Prince, <hi>Cuthbert</hi>
was translated from the Sea of <hi>Hereford,</hi> to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishopricke
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where he sate about eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeares. Hee was had in great reverence both of
religious and secular men, in regard of his holinesse of
life, and zealous care for reforming abuses in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie:
For to that end he summoned a counsell of the
Bishops and Prelates of the land, at which <hi>Ethelbert</hi>
the Prince of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> with the most part of his
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8449:121"/>
Nobilitie were present.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alrich</hi> raigned many yeares, and fortunately defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Dominions against the <hi>Mercians,</hi> till at the last,
he was overthrowne in battaile by <hi>Offa</hi> their Prince,
who in his owne person invaded the Province of <hi>Kent.</hi>
He died without issue, being the last Prince of the <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
line, which was cut in sunder with the threed of his
life.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Edelbert,</hi> (surnamed <hi>Pren</hi>) vsurping the State,
made warre vpon the <hi>Mercians,</hi> by whom he was taken

governement of the <hi>Kentish-Saxons,</hi> (which had
continued about 380. yeares) drawing on to his fatall
period: <hi>Egbert</hi> the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Prince, strongly assailed
the chiefe places of defence, driving the <hi>Mercians</hi> out
of the Province, and forcing <hi>Balbred</hi> also to abandon
it; by which meanes, in the end, making a conquest of
the whole Countrie, he vnited it to the Principalitie of

the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> from which he obtained a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
sentence, for his justification, touching those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
wherewith he was charged, and also for his restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and reestablishment in his Sea. But <hi>Egfrid</hi> the
Prince refused to receive him, protesting against the
sentence, as vnduly procured: whereupon <hi>Wilfrid</hi> the
Bishop fled secretly into <hi>Sussex,</hi> and preached the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
faith to the <hi>South-Saxons,</hi> whose Prince named
<hi>Edelwalch</hi> received him with great joy, assigning vnto
him for his Sea, the Ile of <hi>Selesey,</hi> where afterwards the
foundation of a Monasterie was laid. After the death
of <hi>Egfrid</hi> Prince of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> he was revoked,
and restored to his former dignitie, which yet he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
not long without interruption. He was a man of
great courage, as having beene continually exercised
with troubles, and worldly incumbrances, which do
commonly deject and oppresse such as yeeld thereunto,
but do engender constancie or obduracie in such as
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8449:125"/>
encounter and oppose them. The authoritie of the Sea
of <hi>Rome</hi> he was euer stiffely bent to maintaine. The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of celebrating the feast of Easter after the <hi>Roman</hi>
maner he diligently taught and defended in publike
disputation against the Bishops of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the vsage of the East Churches, according to the
tradition of the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of him, that while he remained in the
Province of the <hi>South-Saxons,</hi> he instructed the rude
poore people, (dwelling vpon the Sea coasts) in the art
of fishing with Nets, and Ginnes, by which meanes
they were relieved in the time of famine, wherewith
the Country was then much afflicted.</p>
                  <p>The province enjoyed a long time of prosperitie
vnder this Christian Prince, till in the end it was assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by <hi>Ceadwall,</hi> a man of great power and courage (des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
from the race of the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Princes) who
being banished from his owne Country, attempted by
force to have expulsed <hi>Edelwalch:</hi> and finally (after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conflicts) slue him in battaile. Howbeit (the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
number of his owne forces being spent in that
warre) he was afterwards constrained to abandon the
Province (which <hi>Aldin</hi> then governed) till afterwards
obteyning the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Principalitie, he assaied the
recoverie of it againe, and in the end, by conquest, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed

                     <hi>Wulfere</hi> in the beginning of his raigne, was a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter
of the Christian faith. His two sonnes (that went
to Bishop <hi>Chadde,</hi> to be instructed therein) he vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
slue with his owne hands: their dead bodies were
by <hi>Ermenheld</hi> the Queene their mother, buried in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
of stone, where afterwards a Church was erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
the place, by reason of the multitude of stones
that were brought thither vpon devotion by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, gave the name vnto the towne, which is
at this day called <hi>Stone</hi> (in the Countie of <hi>Stafford.</hi>) But
<hi>Wulfere</hi> after his conversion to the Christian faith, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured
(as he thought) to wipe away the guilt of
that bloodie offence, with the teares of repentance and
satisfactorie works of charitie, in erecting Churches,
and devoting the rest of his life to the service of God:
whose example therein, <hi>Ermenheld</hi> his wife did follow
after his death, sequestring her self from the world, and
taking vpon her the veile in the Nunrie at <hi>Ely,</hi> where
<hi>Sexburga</hi> her mother was Abbesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ethelred</hi> succeeding <hi>Wulfere</hi> his brother procured a
Bishops Sea to be established at <hi>Worcester:</hi> Of that place
<hi>Bosellus</hi> was the first Bishop. In his time diverse religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                     <hi>EThelbald,</hi> the successour of <hi>Celred,</hi> was a professour
of Christian religion, though much addicted to
wantonnesse and sensuall pleasures, for which he
was sharpely reprooved by <hi>Bonifacius</hi> an <hi>Englishman,</hi>
(then Bishop of <hi>Vtricht</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and afterwards
Arch-bishop of<note n="a" place="margin">Mentz.</note> 
                     <hi>Mogunce</hi> in <hi>Germanie</hi>) who wrote vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, how fowle and dishonourable a thing it was,
that he, which raigned over so many Nations, should
himselfe be the bondslave of fleshly lust: signifying
withall, that those offences of impuritie which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
were punished even among the heathen with
death and cruell torments: that by his ill example, he
corrupted his subjects: that God himselfe for those vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
had plagued many Princes, both in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and in their posteritie: and finally, that the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:8449:130"/>
of this life, are but short and vaine, and the paines
ordained for sinne, intolerable and eternall.</p>
                  <p>He likewise admonished <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> Arch-bishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> that hee should cause the light habites of
Priests and Nunnes, (who fashioned themselves too
much after the secular guise) to be reformed.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Ethelbald</hi> being stricken with compunction of
heart, for the lascivious follies of his youth, sought by
all good meanes to prevent those dangers; into which,
through securitie and continuance in sinne, he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that he might irrecoverably have fallen: and first,
by the advise of his Clergie and temporall Nobilitie,
he ordained; that all the Churches within his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
should be discharged of tribute, and freed from
all burthens and labours, excepting onely such as were
to be vndertaken for the necessary building of Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Castles, and Bridges, for the defence and generall
good of the Province; in which case, none were to be
exempted: and that persons professed in religion,
should enioy the profits of their lands entirely, and not
be constrained to make any other payments out of the
same vnto the Prince.</p>
                  <p>About that time also, <hi>Cuthbert</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
by the advice of <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> the Arch-bishop of
<hi>Mogunce,</hi> made certaine constitutions for the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Clergie, vnder his jurisdiction: by which
(amongst other things) it was ordered, that the holy
Scriptures should be vsually read in Monasteries: that
Priests should be no buiers nor sellers of worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities:
that they should receive no rewards for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring
the Sacraments: that there should be an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
among them in the observation of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ceremonies: that they should both learne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and teach others the Lords praier, &amp; the articles
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:8449:130"/>
of the Christian faith in the English tongue, and that
none should be admitted to holy Orders, but such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whose conversation and maner of living was first
examined and approoved.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, <hi>Ethelbald</hi> the Prince (partly of
his owne religious inclination, and being partly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the examples of his predecessors) caused a great
and goodly Monastery to be erected at <hi>Crowland</hi> in the
Countie of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> where, for that the ground was
fennie, and vnable to support the weight of a stone
building, many huge piles of Oke were driven into the
Marish, and hard earth (brought thither about nine
miles by water) was rammed in with the piles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
the foundation of the Church was laid: such was
the zeale of Princes in those dayes, as they could levell
Mountaines, convert fennie bogs into firme land, and
alter, in a maner, the verie course of nature: no cost see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
too much, no labour too great, nor any thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that they had a will to effect.</p>
                  <p>When he had reigned aboue fortie yeares, <hi>Cuthred</hi>
the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Prince, invaded the territorie of the
<hi>Mercians:</hi> during the continuance of which warres,
<hi>Ethelbald</hi> was slaine by <hi>Bartred</hi> (a person notorions for
his crueltie) and was afterwards buried in the famous
Monasterie of <hi>Rippon:</hi> howbeit <hi>Bartred</hi> soone lost that
which he had ill gotten: for he was also slaine by <hi>Offa</hi>
the Nephew of <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> who succeeded him in the
government.</p>

of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> he surprized vnder colour of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

ambition and desire of glorie, transported him
beyond the limits of his owne Principalitie: yet was
he a great benefactor to the Church: for he erected a
faire Monasterie in the honour of Saint <hi>Alban,</hi> neere
the Towne that now beareth the Martyrs name, and
richly endowed it by his Charter; He founded also the
Abbey of <hi>Bathe:</hi> the Archi-Episcopall Sea, he transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from <hi>Canterburie</hi> to <hi>Lichfield,</hi> (the chiefe seat of the
<hi>Mercian</hi> government,) where it continued but a short
time. Betweene <hi>Wales</hi> and the borders of his Province
he caused a ditch to be made for defence against the
incursions of the <hi>Britans,</hi> whom the <hi>Saxons</hi> then called
<hi>Walsh,</hi> which in their language signifieth (stranger.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elfrid</hi> his sonne succeeding him, reigned but one

                  <p>Then <hi>Kenulph</hi> (descended from <hi>Penda</hi> the Tyrant)
obtained the regiment. He assailed the territorie of the

whereof he was the founder: adding that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Act of clemencie to the other exercises of prayer
and fasting, then ordinarily vsed at such dedications.

which he consecrated to Saint <hi>Ethelbert.</hi>

aspired to the government, and dying innocently, was

                  <p>Then <hi>Ceolworth</hi> the brother of <hi>Kenulph,</hi> having raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

the province of the <hi>East-Saxons.</hi> They were all men of
disordered conversation, and open despisers of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
rites: for, being not yet baptised, they would have
receyved the Sacrament of Christs bodie: wherein,
for that <hi>Miletus</hi> the Bishop had opposed himself against
them, they expelled him from his Sea at <hi>London,</hi> and
themselves soone after were by <hi>Kinegles</hi> the <hi>West-Saxon</hi>
Prince, deprived both of government, and life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sigebert,</hi> surnamed the <hi>Little,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Seward,</hi>
succeeded in the principalitie, which in short time he
left to <hi>Sigbert,</hi> (the nephew of <hi>Sebert</hi> (the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

of <hi>Oswin</hi> chiefe governor of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from Paganisme to Christianitie, wherein he
was confirmed, by <hi>Cedda,</hi> a devout learned man, that
then preached to the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> and recovered many
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:8449:134"/>
of them, which (after the expulsion of <hi>Miletus</hi>) had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
from the faith. He was afterwards by <hi>Finan</hi> (the
Bishop of <hi>Holy-Iland</hi>) consecrated bishop of the <hi>East-Saxons:</hi>
amongst whom, he preached the Gospell of
Christ without interruption, till such time as <hi>Sigbert</hi> the
Prince, (procoring the dislike of his Subjects, for that
he shewed too much clemency to the <hi>Mercians</hi> his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies)
was trecherously murdered by one of his owne
kindred.</p>
                  <p>After his death, <hi>Swidhelin,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Sexbald,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the regement, and was baptised by <hi>Cedda</hi> the
Bishop.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Sigher</hi> &amp; <hi>Sebbi</hi> ruled togither, but not with abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
authoritie, for at that time they acknowledged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance
to <hi>Wulfere</hi> Prince of the <hi>Mercians.</hi> In those
dayes great plague and mortalitie fell vpon the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Province, and <hi>Sigher</hi> (renouncing the faith)
fell to Idolatry, which in a short time greatly encreased,
till <hi>Iarumanus</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> and certain priests
(being sent thither by <hi>VVulfere</hi> to that end) laboured
with all diligence to stop the course thereof, and in the
end suppressed it.</p>

(notwithstanding the relapse of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men)
persisted constantly in the faith of Christ:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:8449:134"/>
and <hi>Sebbi</hi> himselfe by praying, fasting, and Almes ceeds,<note place="margin">East-Saxons.</note>
manifested his owne earnest desire to maintaine the
same: being so strongly possessed with the spirit of
zeale, and love of Chastitie, as he perswaded his wife
to a separation, whereby they might serve God with
more puritie of heart: and his pietie and humilitie was
had in such estimation, even among the religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as they reputed him more meete to have beene a
Priest, then a Prince. After he had (with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
obtained his wives consent for a separation) he
bestowed the greatest part of his worldly wealth vpon
the poore: reserving nothing for himselfe (besides his
necessarie maintenance) but onely the expectation of a
future recompence. In his time lived <hi>Erkenwald</hi> a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Priest, who was afterward Bishop of <hi>London.</hi> He
founded two Monasteries, the one for himselfe, at
<hi>Chartsey</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and the other for <hi>Ethelburga</hi> his sister
at <hi>Barking</hi> in <hi>Essex. Sebbi</hi> having ruled about thirtie

by reason whereof, doubting lest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

flesh, he might burst out into any intemperate speeches,
or do any other thing vnseemely for his person &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
he desired <hi>Waldher</hi> the successor of <hi>Erkenwald,</hi>
(then Bishop of <hi>London</hi>) by prayers and ghostly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile
to assist him in his agonies, and that no more then
himselfe, and two of his Chaplains onely might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the time of his departure: so great a care had
this religious Prince in well finishing that race, which
he had prosperously continued the most part of his life:
and in preventing all occasions of scandall to the faith
which he professed. His bodie was buried in the church
of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and then <hi>Sigeherd,</hi> and <hi>Seofrid</hi>
his two sonnes, successively ruled the Province of the
<hi>East-Saxons.</hi> After them it was governed by <hi>Offa,</hi> the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:8449:135"/>
sonne of <hi>Sigeherd,</hi> who married <hi>Geneswede</hi> the daughter

went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he ended his life in a Religious
house. <hi>Celred</hi> succeeded <hi>Offa,</hi> maintaining the state of
the Province in peace, till in the end he was slaine: but
in what maner, or by whom, I find no mention. Then
<hi>Suthred</hi> (either by right of succession, or by election)
obtained the governement, which he enioyed but a

diligence and labor of <hi>Foelix,</hi> whom the inhabitants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced
as a man, that (being himselfe happie both in
name and condition) had power also to make others
happie. He was made Bishop of <hi>Dunwich</hi> in <hi>Suffolke,</hi>
which being then but a small town, became afterwards
very rich and populous, and was governed according
to the maner of the ancient and best Cities. Many reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
houses (the fruits of devotion in that age) were at
sundry times erected in the place. There was also a Mint
wherein a certaine coine (with the inscription of the
name of the Citie) was stamped. But time hath worne
out in a maner the remembrance of these things at this
day, and the sea hath devoured the greatest part of the
building. It continued an entire Bishops Sea, but a

to <hi>Egrick</hi> his kinsman) hee entred into a Monasterie,

                     <hi>Ethelbert</hi> by his wife <hi>Laonorine,</hi> had a sonne of his
owne name that succeeded him. <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the second,
was a Prince much renowmed for learning and piety.
He governed the Province with great wisedome and
prosperous successe, till by the perfidious dealing of
<hi>Offa,</hi> the <hi>Mercian</hi> Prince, he was shamefully murdered.
For being betrothed to <hi>Alfride,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Offa,</hi>
(who ambitiously affected the Principality of the <hi>East-Angles</hi>)
he was vnder colour of friendship, invited to a
feast, where <hi>Offa</hi> (by the perswasion of his wife) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his head to be cut off, and his body to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in the banke of a river. By this dishonourable act,
the <hi>Mercians</hi> obtained the Province. But <hi>Offa,</hi> being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
touched with sorrow and compunction of
heart for committing it, caused <hi>Ethelberts</hi> body to be
taken vp, and to be conveied to the Citie of <hi>Hereford,</hi>
(not farre from the place where he was slaine) and there
to be very solemnly enterred: supposing thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
in part, the guilt of his former offence: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a Church was there built, and dedicated to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelbert</hi>
by the name of a Saint. Then <hi>Offa</hi> vndertooke
a voyage to the <hi>Holy-land,</hi> and passing through <hi>Saxony,</hi>
was there received with great ioy by <hi>Alkemond</hi> the
King his kinsman, and <hi>Syware</hi> his wife: at that time he
adopted <hi>Edmund,</hi> the son of <hi>Alkemond,</hi> to be his heire,
and to succeede him in the Principalitie of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:8449:138"/>
which did soone after fall vnto him; for <hi>Offa</hi>
in his returne from the <hi>Holy-land,</hi> ended his life at <hi>Port</hi>
St. <hi>George:</hi> whereupon <hi>Edmund</hi> speedily repaired into
<hi>Britannie,</hi> where he was received by the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> as
their Prince. In his time <hi>Hinguar</hi> &amp; <hi>Hubba,</hi> the two <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Pirates, invaded <hi>Northumberland;</hi> and <hi>Hinguar</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
enriched himselfe with the spoyles of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
sailed towards the coast of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> where
(afterwards landing) hee surprized their chiefe Citie,
consuming it by fire. The Citizens also, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of age or sect, he cruelly murdered, and in the
end, tooke <hi>Edmund</hi> the Prince, whom first the <hi>Pagan
Danes</hi> perswaded to renounce the profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie.
But when they could neither by promises of
assurance of life and safetie, nor by threats and terror of
death, prevaile with him therein, they beate him with
staves, scourged him with whips, and vsed him with all
kindes of barbarous in civilitie and crueltie, which the
religious Prince with great meekenesse and patience,
endured cheerefully, calling vpon the name of Iesus, as
reioycing for his sake, to suffer those torments and
indignities. The <hi>Pagans</hi> seeing his great constancie and
courage, were transported with furie, and at the last,
wounded him with their shafts, which they shot at
him, till his body was covered over with them. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>6. <hi>Paulinus</hi> (the third Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> in
succession) was appointed by <hi>Iustus</hi> the Archbishop
of <hi>Canterburie</hi> to preach the Gospel vnto the <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
and to be their Bishop: to which end also, <hi>Edbald</hi>
the Prince of the <hi>Kentish-Saxons,</hi> had by letters recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
him to <hi>Edwin</hi> his brother in law.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Evichelm</hi> the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Prince,
(ambitiously affecting the soveraigntie of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumbers</hi>)
practised with <hi>Eumer</hi> (a man easily corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for desire of gaine) to murder <hi>Edwin</hi> the Prince:
for the execution of which detestable purpose, <hi>Eumer</hi>
with a poysoned weapon hidden vnder his garment,
assailed the Prince, and had slaine him in the place, if
<hi>Lilla</hi> had not thrust himselfe betweene his person, and
the danger; and, (by making himselfe the memorable
example of a faithfull servant) preserved his masters life
with the losse of his owne.</p>
                  <p>In revenge of this trecherous act, <hi>Edwin</hi> invaded
the territory of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> &amp; (after a great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Inhabitants of that Province) reduced the
most part of it vnder his obedience. Then, to shew the
fruits of his conversion to Christianitie, he gave vnto
<hi>Paulinus</hi> the Citie of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to be a Bishops Sea, for him
and his successors: laying the foundation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:8449:142"/>
Church of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> which was afterwards
finished by <hi>Oswald.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the same time also, <hi>Paulinus</hi> himselfe erected
the great Church at <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This prince in felicitie of government, excelled all
his predecessors: he was greatly beloved and honored
of his people, and no lesse feared of his neighbor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who (for the most part) held their Provinces of
him by homage. The <hi>Roman Banner Tufa</hi> was carried
before him in token of triumph, as well in times of
peace, as warre.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be forgotten, that he caused certain cups
of Iron, and Brasse, to be set by cleare Wels and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
running by high wayes, for the vse of Pilgrims,
and Travailers: which Cups remained long after in
those places, no man attempting to convey them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
either for the reverence they bare vnto the Prince,
(by whose appointment they were set there) or else
that they made a conscience to convert to their private
commoditie, such things as were ordained for a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
good.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Edwin</hi> having reigned about seventeene years,
was in the end assailed at one time, both by <hi>Penda</hi> the
Prince of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and <hi>Ceadwall</hi> the <hi>Brittish</hi> Prince,
till, with the losse of his life, he made an end of the
warre.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter his death, the Principalitie of the <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
was dismembred againe: For <hi>Osrick</hi> the sonne
of <hi>Elfrick.</hi> (Prince <hi>Edwins</hi> vncle) held onely the
government of <hi>Deira,</hi> and <hi>Eanfrid</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid,</hi>
commanded the <hi>Bernicians.</hi> Both these Princes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
the Christian faith, fell to Idolatrie, and were
slain in battell by <hi>Ceadwall</hi> the <hi>Brittish</hi> Prince, that spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
&amp; wasted the country of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> til <hi>Oswald</hi>
(the brother of <hi>Eanfrid</hi>) opposed himselfe against the
power of the <hi>Britans,</hi> whose Captaine <hi>Ceadwall,</hi> with
the greatest number of his forces, perished in the field.</p>
                  <p>After this victorie, <hi>Oswald</hi> possessed the Province
in peace, and then sent for <hi>Aidan</hi> a <hi>Scottish-man,</hi> to
preach the Christian faith vnto his people, assigning to
him <hi>Holy-Iland</hi> for his Sea. The Inhabitants of <hi>Deira</hi>
and <hi>Bernicia</hi> (who for the hatred which they bare one
to another, had submitted themselves to severall heads)
he wisely reconciled, and vniting them in affection,
brought them vnder the obedience of one governor.</p>

which he endevoured to establish throughout
all his Dominions.</p>
                  <p>When he had raigned about eight yeares, he was
killed in a conflict with <hi>Penda</hi> the <hi>Mercian</hi> Prince, a
cruell Pagan, who commanded his head and armes to
be cut from the rest of his bodie, and in reprochfull
maner, to be hanged vp vpon high polles: by reason
whereof, and for his holy conversation while he lived,
he was after his death honoured with the title of a
Martyr.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Oswin</hi> the brother of <hi>Oswald</hi> succeeding him,
was much incumbred, partly by the invasion of the
<hi>Mercians,</hi> and partly by the rebellion of his own sonne
<hi>Elfrid. Adilwald</hi> (the sonne of <hi>Oswald</hi> the Martyr) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by force to have recovered the Province: and
<hi>Oswy</hi> the sonne of <hi>Osrick</hi> (sometime governor of <hi>Deira</hi>)
being trecherously delivered into his hands, he caused
to be murdered.</p>
                  <p>He fought oft times with fortunate successe against
the <hi>Mercians,</hi> whom (after he had vanquished <hi>Penda</hi>) he
procured to be instructed in the christian faith: and the
better to strengthen his purpose therin, he erected the
Church at <hi>Lichfield</hi> to be the Bishops Sea for that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
After he had raigned about thirtie two yeares,
he ended his life in peace.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Egfrid</hi> his son ruled the <hi>Northumbers.</hi> He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<hi>Mildred,</hi> one of the daughters of <hi>Ana Prince</hi> of the
<hi>East-Angles.</hi> It is reported of her, that (living with her
husband about twelve yeares) she continued all that
time, both a wife, and a virgin; and in the end tooke
vpon her the vaile of a Nun at <hi>Ely,</hi> where she erected a
Monasterie, and was her selfe the first Abbesse.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while <hi>Egfrid</hi> removed <hi>Wilfrid</hi> from
his Bishopricke at Yorke, appointing two other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:8449:145"/>
over the <hi>Northumbers</hi> for their better instruction
in the knowledge of Religion. In his time diverse Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
were called by <hi>Theodorus,</hi> then Archbishop of
<hi>Canterburie,</hi> for reformation of abuses in the Church,
for approbation of the five first general Councels, and
for the condemnation of the heresie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> who
denied the humanitie of Christ. Not long before his
death, he made warre vpon <hi>Edelfrid</hi> Prince of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
with whom he was afterwards reconciled, by
mediation of <hi>Theodorus</hi> the Archbishop: and then he
converted his forces against the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Scottish-men,</hi>
(inhabiting the Northern Iles) of whom he made a
great slaughter: and the yeare following (making warre
vpon the <hi>Picts,</hi> contrarie to the advice of <hi>Cuthbert</hi> the
Bishop) he was slaine by some of his enemies that lay
in ambush to surprise him.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Alfrid</hi> (the Bastard sonne of <hi>Oswin</hi>) succeeded
him, repairing the decaied state of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi>
though he could not recover all that the <hi>Picts, Scottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and <hi>Britans,</hi> had gotten from them in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Osred</hi> his sonne (of the age of eight yeares) posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the government, till he was murthered by his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<hi>Kenred</hi> and <hi>Osrick,</hi> who divided the Principalitie
between them; till falling at civil discord among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the one supplanted the other: by which means,
<hi>Kenred</hi> alone ruled the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> about two yeares.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Osrick</hi> (obtaining the government) elected
<hi>Ceolnulph</hi> the brother of <hi>Kenred</hi> to be his successor: <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olnulph</hi>
after he had ruled the Province eight yeares,
and obtained many victories against his enemies, gave
over the regiment, and became a Monke in <hi>Holy-Iland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time lived <hi>Benedict</hi> the Priest, who first
taught the <hi>Saxons</hi> the art of painting, glasing, &amp; Mason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:8449:146"/>
In the raigne of <hi>Ceolnulph,</hi> Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> (the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of that age for learning and pietie) flourished
in <hi>Britannie.</hi> He writ the historie of the <hi>English</hi> church,
and dedicated it vnto <hi>Ceolnulph</hi> the Prince.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Egbert</hi> the cosin-german of <hi>Ceolnulph</hi> (imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
the example of his predecessor) forsooke the
world, and entred into Religion. His brother (bearing
the same name) was then Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> where
he founded a famous Librarie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oswolf, Moll, Alered, Etheldred, Aelfwold,</hi> and <hi>Osred,</hi>
raigned successively with like fortune, for the most part;
for they were all either slaine, or deposed by their own
subjects, except <hi>Etheldred,</hi> who was afterwards restored
to the government, which yet he enjoyed not long: For
(within four yeares after) he was miserably slaine.</p>
                  <p>After his death the Province was wasted, either
by cruell dissention, or forreine invasion by the space
of thirtie yeares; during which time, <hi>Eardulph, Alfwold,
Eandred, Ethelred, Readulph, Osbert,</hi> and <hi>Elle,</hi> vsurped
the title of Princes. <hi>Readulph, Osbert, and Elle,</hi> were slaine
at <hi>Yorke</hi> by the <hi>Danish</hi> Pyrates, <hi>Hinguar</hi> and <hi>Hubba,</hi>
whom <hi>Benbokard</hi> (in revenge of the indignitie offred to
him by <hi>Osbert,</hi> that had ravished his wife) had stirred vp
to vndertake that enterprise. But about the yeare of
grace 800. the <hi>Danes</hi> were expelled, &amp; the <hi>Northumbers</hi>

In the beginning of his raigne, the Province of the

the <hi>Scottishmen</hi> and <hi>Picts.</hi> The <hi>East-Angles</hi> likewise at

                  <p>After them, <hi>Kennewalch</hi> (the yonger sonne of <hi>Kine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi>)
obtained the governement. He married the sister

                  <p>He founded the Cathedrall Church at <hi>Winchester,</hi> to

out of <hi>France,</hi> where (during the
time of his abode) he had served
with good commendation in the
warres, vnder <hi>Charles</hi> the Great,
by meanes whereof (his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
encreasing among his

his predecessor, seemed to adde more sufficiencie to
his owne merit.</p>
            <p>At his first entrance he assayled the <hi>Cornish</hi> and
<hi>Walsh-men,</hi> who commonly vpon the change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
vsed to make incursions into the Provinces
next adioyning to them, continuing their claime
(as it were) to those countries, from which the <hi>Britans</hi>
(their ancestors) had beene expelled; and though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they had thereby sustained many, and great
losses: yet it well appeared, that they had not altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lost their wonted courage, hereditarie to that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Nation. The <hi>Cornish-men</hi> being first subdued, he
employed his whole forces against the <hi>Walsh,</hi> whom
he earnestly pursued, never desisting, vntill he had pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into the verie vtmost limits of <hi>Wales,</hi> vpon the
Westerne Sea. This fortunate proceeding, bred both
enuy and iealousie in diverse Princes of the land, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in <hi>Bernulph</hi> the governour of the <hi>English-Mercians,</hi>
who thought it a necessarie point of policie to make
opposition betimes, lest the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> growing too
great, the Principality of <hi>Mercia</hi> might be endangered:
considering withall, that it would be more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to make an offensive warre, then to rest meerely
vpon defence, wherein the perill and hazard was likely
to be as great, as in the other: the gaine and glory much
lesse. Herevpon he entred the Province of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi>
with a huge armie, consisting of men (for the
most part,) vnmeete for militarie service, as being by
long ease and idlenesse corrupted, and become faint
hearted, and vnwealdie, so that at the first assault (made
by their enemies) they turned their backs, and being
confounded by their owne numbers, were over whel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
one vpon an other in their flight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:8449:158"/>
The fortune of this battaile did cut in sunder the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
sinewes of the <hi>Mercian</hi> government, which soone
after (as vnable to support it self any longer) fell to the
principalitie of the <hi>West-Saxons.</hi> And now <hi>Egbert</hi>
conceaving hope of like successe, in attempting the
Conquest of the other provinces, and knowing well,
that the <hi>Kentish</hi> Prince was then scarce setled in his
government, and hated of his subjects, he supposed,
a fit oportunitie was offered, to bring that part of the
Ile also vnder subjection; and thereupon, sent his sonne
with an armie to invade it, appointing <hi>Alstan</hi> the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Bishop of <hi>Shirburne,</hi> and <hi>VValhard</hi> (a man of good
reputation for armes in those times) to assist him, with
direction and advice in the prosecution of the warre,
which was begun and ended prosperously both in one
yeare.</p>
            <p>In the meane while, the <hi>East-Saxons</hi> being taught
by their neighbors example, how much better &amp; more
safe it is to prevent the calamities of an invasion by
yeelding obedience, then by standing vpon termes of
defiance (where there is no hope to preuail) voluntarily
submitted themselves. But the <hi>Northumbers</hi> held out yet
longer: making open resistance against the <hi>VVest Saxons,</hi>
till partly by their owne civil discord, and partly by the
irruption of the <hi>Danes</hi> (that annoyed their coasts) they
were glad to seek the ayd and protection of the <hi>VVest-Saxons,</hi>
as holding it a better course in that case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,
to become subiect to a nation that they knew,
then to be made slaves to strangers.</p>
            <p>Thus were the Principalities of the <hi>Kentish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and
<hi>East-Saxons</hi> (with the <hi>English-Mercians</hi> and <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>)

part of the Ile made, in a maner, one Monarchie,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:8449:159"/>
which forme of government it seemed in some sort to
retaine, even during the continuance of the seven-fold
regiment of the <hi>English-Saxons,</hi> amongst whom some
one Prince was alwaies of greater power then other, &amp;
had a right of superioritie above the rest. Neither was
there any thing now wanting, for the establishment of
an absolute governmnt; for the <hi>VValsh-men</hi> (the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the antient <hi>Britans</hi>) were for the most part slaine
in battell, &amp; those that survived were vtterly disarmed,
and thrust into a corner of the Ile. The citie of <hi>Chester</hi>
(their strongest hold) was possessed by the <hi>English,</hi> with
out al hope to be recovered. As for the <hi>South-Saxons,</hi> &amp;
<hi>East-English,</hi> (whose Provinces remained as yet vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered)
they were but a handfull in comparison of the
rest, &amp; more likely to seeke the assurance of their estates
by a reasonable composition, then by standing any long
time vpon defence, if they should be assailed.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Egbert</hi> (knowing well that there was as much
wisdome requisite in the keeping and well ordering, as
there had beene valor shewed in the getting of those
Provinces) held a generall assembly at <hi>VVinchester,</hi> (the
chiefe Citie of the <hi>VVest-Saxon</hi> Princes) where he was
with great and vnusuall ceremonies of state, declared
King.</p>
            <p>Then for the vniting and setling of the Soveraigntie
in himselfe &amp; his successors, he ordained that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
(who had been a long time distinguished by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
names,) should now be made an entire nation,
and being governed by one Prince, should bear iointly
one name: &amp; to that end he commanded by publike E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
that the several Provinces (so vnited) shuld for ever
after he called <hi>Angles-land,</hi> which by a contraction of
the word, or corruption of the time was afterwards (as
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:8449:159"/>
at this day it is) called <hi>England.</hi> For, the memorie of the
<hi>Iutes</hi> being long since worn out, &amp; the name of the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
now suppressed by edict, the <hi>Angles</hi> only remained,
who in respect of their number might seem to chalenge
by right the denomination: and it is certaine,
that the Inhabitants of the greatest part
of the Ile, were (many yeares
before) commonly called
<hi>Angles,</hi> or <hi>English.</hi>
