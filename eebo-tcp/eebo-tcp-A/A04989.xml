         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of warre and peace, bare great sway
with <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
and after him lykewise with <hi>Duke
Charles,</hi> his sonne, whom in all his warres he neuer
abandoned, and was lastly with him at the vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
battayle of <hi>Nancy</hi> in the yeere. 1476. where, by
the Duke of <hi>Lorayne</hi> and the <hi>Swyssers,</hi> he was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen
and slayne. After this, he had great charge and
authoritie vnder his daughter, the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> sole
inheritrix of all the Dukes great estates and Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who maryed <hi>Maximilian</hi> Archduke of <hi>Austria,</hi>
afterwardes elected Emperour: to whom, leauing two
chyldren, a sonne and a daughter, she dyed shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
some say of the fall from a Horse: But this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
who bestought to know the trueth, sayth, that
it was through the inwarde conceyte of an excessiue
sorow: But once, such was the greefe that he concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of her death, and of the two other before named
Princes, vnder whom he had been brought vp, that
he retyred himselfe from administration of great
matters, to a quiet lyfe: and in his solitarinesse compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
this Treatise. It hath been since translated into
sundry Languages, and among the rest, by <hi>Don Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando
de Acunia</hi> into Spanysh verse, and dedicated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth: whose translation
I do here folow, because I coulde neuer yet lyght on
any of the French originals.</p>
            <p>It seemeth that the <hi>Spanyarde</hi> in some places much
<pb facs="tcp:8635:5"/>
altered the Authors meaning, adding &amp; taking away,
according to his owne fancy, and fitnes of the tyme in
which he translated it, as both by the sequele of this
discourse appeareth, as also by his Epistle to the
Emperour, which I haue here prefixed.</p>
            <p>Some perchaunce may blame me, of hauing done
the Author whom I folow wrong, by translating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an vneloquent barren Prose, his excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyte,
expressed in such heroicall Verse, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with so many fayre Tables &amp; purtraictes, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylously
delighting with the varietie of the one, and
the sweetnesse of the other, both the eare and the eye
of the reader. To this I answere, with the confession
of my fault, that it is true, and withall, that this matter
being for the most part allegoricall, had in deede been
farre better to haue been handled in verse. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
I doubt not, but those that do more esteeme
substance then shadowes, wyll lyke neuer the worse
of the matter, for being delyuered in a playne speach:
Neyther had mine Authour, yf he were alyue, any
great cause to be angry with me, seeing I haue besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
an Englysh habite vpon him, such as it is, though
it be no way comparable to the beautie of that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was in his owne countrey language attyred.</p>
            <p>As for new fangled &amp; fickle conceyted heads, that
whensoeuer they reade any thing, neuer go farther
then the rynde, my sliking of euery thing, how vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
matter soeuer it conteyne, that thundreth not
into their eares with a lofty tempest of words, I would
earnestly request them, and that more in regarde of
their owne reputation, then in defence of this poore
Treatise (whose harmlesse innocencie shalbe a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
shielde agaynst whatsoeuer calumniation) to
<pb facs="tcp:8635:5"/>
forbeare to censure amysse thereof: for though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
the basenesse of the style, &amp; the shallownesse
of the inuention, yeelde no harmonie to delight their
delicate eares, yet it woulde be moderately iudged of,
in regarde that it conteyneth nothing but most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
and moouing examples of great pietie, laying
open to our eyes the vaine and deceitfull instabilitie
of this most wretched and miserable worlde: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
teacheth nothyng more, then how to lyue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously,
and dye blessedly. Besides, it maketh hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
mention of sundy excellent Princes: some of
which, though long agon deceassed, yet such was their
noblenesse, and pietie, that their names are styll en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned
of the worlde in all honor and reuerence.
Others yet lyuing, who through the inestimable bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
wherewith God and nature hath adorned them,
are of all the worlde most worthyly honored with
admirable applause. As for me (lyke a well mounted
Cowarde in a skyrmish, that relyeth more vpon the
goodnes of his Horse, then his owne valour: So) I
hope the worthynesse of my Author, and the zelous

dedicating it vnto your Maiestie, for

            <p>But two thinges did chiefly encourage mee to publish it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the glorious name of your Maiestie: The one, in respect
of the conformitie of the discourse vnto your Maiesties ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
in whom aboue all the Princes of your tyme, the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and practise of true Christian and militar discipline
chiefly florisheth: The other, of communicating vnto those
of my nation these my poore paynes, in translation of this
Treatise, which though it be lytle, yet yf they do attentiuely
reade and marke it, they shall therein finde an excellent hyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

perfection of all vertue tendeth.</p>
            <p>It was first written in French by a Gentleman of great
worthynesse, noble aswell in letters, as in armes: His intention
was, to discourse of the dangerous warres made vnto vs by
our Senses, touchyng diuers passages of age, thorow which we
runne, or rather to speake more properly, are by disorders vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
caried. And so vnder the figure of bodily combates,
he layeth the spirituall so lyuely before our eyes, as cannot but
<pb facs="tcp:8635:6"/>
draw the well-iudging Reader, to great consideration of our
frayle estate. The translation hath not been altogeather with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some hardnesse, for that as the tongues are dyuers, so is
their style and maner of phrase exceedingly different. I haue
left out some thynges expressed by the Authour, as being hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
peculiarly concernyng himselfe and his Countrey, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
vnknowen, and vnnecessary to vs: and in their place,
haue inserted others of more moment, and more famously
knowen, not onely to our owne nation, but to all the worlde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
which I haue not done onely by myne owne aucthoritie,
but ioyntly by aduise of men of good iudgement, and great
skilfulnesse in eyther tongue. But my intention being rather
to prayse the Booke, then to endeere the translation: I say, that
it is such, that both in myne, and other mens iudgementes,
it deserueth your Maiestes protection. And so with all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the declining
season both of the
yeere and of my
age, trauailing farre
from my natiue
home &amp; countrie,
solitarie &amp; sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
all alone, my
thoughtfulnes did
of a sodayne waken
&amp; reuiue my slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
memorie, by renewing vnto her the time
and historie of my passed youth, and, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
my senses with a fresh and vnusuall vigor,
forcibly recalling my mynde to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my presente state, by suggesting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
infinite and confused discourses of my
many variable and dangerous forepassed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
did begin at length to argue with mee in
this sort,</p>
            <p>First, quoth she, Whosoeuer is forgetfull, or
carelesse of himselfe and his estate,<note place="margin">Nothing so miserable as the man that lyueth careles of his estate.</note> flyeth not
the pitch of true honor, neyther shall at any
tyme see hymselfe beautified with the glorious
bryghtnesse of her perfection: in which mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
lethargie yf he perseuere, then is his case
most lamentable, and vtterly desperate, as not
<pb facs="tcp:8635:8"/>
onely depriued of this worldes honor, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of that euerlasting glorie and eternall health,
to which, blessed myndes with the winges of a
vertuous industrie do aspire. Seest thou not,
quoth she, how miserable a face of thinges, the
now passed and gon sweete Sommer season
hath left vnto vs? The earth is now dispoyled of
all her beautifull raymentes, and glyttering or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes,
her greene and fruitefull florishing
hearbes, her so fayrely colored flowers, and
sweete odoriferous smelles are gone: Both
playnes and mountaynes are now depriued of
all their passed pleasures, hauing nothyng left
them to delyght the beholders eyes, but a bare
and naked barrennesse. The high stately Trees,
that lately so aloft florished (all vigor and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
greennesse being lost) haue now neyther
fruite nor shadow, hauing yeelded all their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the nipping rigor of the colde, that hath
bereaued them of their fragrant humour: Such
as this of theirs, is thy estate, who hauing now
ouergon the sundry degrees and seasons, as the
Spring, Sommer, and Autumne of thy age, rest
assured, that thy Winter is at hande: onely this
is the difference, that thou canst not be agayne
renewed in this worlde, as are these vegetatiue
creatures: for so is it by the eternall wisedome
enacted, that there is no going backe from that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8635:8"/>
degree of age, whereunto a man is once ariued.</p>
            <p>It behoueth thee therefore well and wysely
to ponderate with thy selfe, that thou now dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west
on towarde the exceeding dangerous
horror of an ineuitable passage, kept by an
euer victorious enemie, called DEATH,<note place="margin">The passage of death kept by two Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</note> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayneth
in his dayly wages, two myghtie and
puissant Champions, the one called <hi>Accident,</hi>
the other <hi>Debilitie:</hi> the cumbate with one of
which, thou canst not by any meanes auoyde.
These two vnuanquished Champions do keepe
the great forrest of <hi>Atropos,</hi> agaynst all aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers:
the passage of which, as it is most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
so is it full of horror and amazement.
For such is the nature of their chalenges, that
they neuer desist fyght, tyll they see him whom
they haue vndertaken conquered and dead,
them selues being free from death, and carelesse
of repose. The elder of them, and most ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
is <hi>Accident,</hi> who with variable and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
kindes of fight, bereaueth, for the most
part, the liues of braue and lustie youthes, in the
prime &amp; strength of their vnmellowed yeeres:
yea, and sometimes he sporteth himselfe in the
death of olde men, women, and chyldren. But
hydeous <hi>Debilitie,</hi> with inuisible blowes, killeth
onely those that are weake, and languishyng.
They are so nusled in blood, that their dayly
<pb facs="tcp:8635:9"/>
exercise and practise, is nothing but to murder
and destroy mankinde, neyther is their puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance
by any pollicie to be deluded, nor by any
agilitie, or stratageme to be auoyded.</p>
            <p>This being so, iudge then with thy selfe, in
how great degree, these myghtie foes are to be
feared. Thou hast been long agone summoned
to this battayle, by <hi>Excesse,</hi> their heralde at
Armes, and therefore the fyght being so full of
perill, and the matter of such importaunce, I
cannot but much maruell at this thy carelesse
vnreadinesse, especially seeing at thy very birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
thou wert waged therunto. Thou doest not
exceede <hi>Sampson</hi> in inuincible strength, <hi>Hercules</hi>
in valorous courage, <hi>Salomon</hi> in profound wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<hi>Tullie</hi> in powerful perswading eloquence,
<hi>Diomedes</hi> in vigorous vnderstanding, nor <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solon</hi>
in delicious beautie: yet no one of these
was able to resist these death-bringing Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,
that euen now attende thee in the lystes.
The farther that the vncertayne race of thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
lyfe lyngreth on, the nearer approcheth
the houre of thy ineuitable conflict, to which
attende no other trumpet, then the dolefull
knowlling of a deadly Bell. Therefore with all
instance I aduise thee, to looke well about, and
to call well all thy wittes tegeather, that thou
mayst be the better prepared, agaynst the hard
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8635:9"/>
brunt of so terrible a reckoning.</p>
            <p>Herewith my thoughtfulnesse ending,<note place="margin">Author.</note> I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked,
as it were out of a drowsie traunce or
dreame, thanking her in the highest degree for
these her carefull admonitions, and withal tolde
her, that for mine owne part, I was redy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
as much as to a true resolued Gentleman
did appertaine: and therewithall, presently
without delay put on my armour, and lyke a
Knight aduenturous, passed foorth onward on
my way. My horses name was <hi>Desire,</hi> my har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
tempred in the water of Puissance, my
shielde, of Hope, my launce, of Aduenture, and
my sworde, of Courage.</p>
            <p>In this equipage, I entred into the quest of
my so much renowned aduersaries; at the ende
of two dayes trauaile, in which I had not found
any aduenture worthy the wryting, I came into
a very greene and florishing Medowe, the
name whereof was Worldly pleasure:<note place="margin">The fayre feeldes of worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</note> The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
shew whereof presented vnto my senses
such pleasure and delyght, that rauished with
contentment, forgetfull of my iourney and
vndertaken enterprise, I euen determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
there: But sodainely I myght espie a
galant Ruffler, that came fiercely coursing along
the Medow, bidding me defende my selfe, for
without farther delay, he meant to iust with me.
<pb facs="tcp:8635:10"/>
I was much moued with the roughnesse of his
speach and iesture, as also that he had interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me in the sweetenesse of those delyghtes
wherein my senses were lulled a sleepe. I askt
hym yf he were a Gentleman? and withall, of
what name and Countrey? My name, quoth
he (in an ill tuned harsh and queasy voyce) is
<hi>Ill Diet:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Yll Diet, his propertie and parentage.</note> My office is to put all out of order
where I come. My linage is noble: for Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
is my mother, and I am her eldest sonne: I
am maynteyned with ryches, norished in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices,
and hyghly esteemed in the court of
Princes.</p>
            <p>Are you then, quoth I, eyther of these war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
that do with such vnuanquished puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,
keepe the forest of vnmercifull <hi>Atropos?</hi>
Neyther of them, quoth he, but yet their great

which they do: which is, by persecutyng of lyfe.
And therewithall,<note place="margin">Yll diet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countreth the author in the playne of w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

his launce of lytle witte, vpon the bosse of my
guylded target, that I do yet full well feele the
weight of his encounter: neuerthelesse, pullyng
my spirites vnto me, with an eagre desire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
with a full carrere, I brake my Lance on
his bosome: and foorthwith we both layde
handes on our swordes,<note place="margin">The maner of their fight.</note> with which, being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
in folly, we gaue one an other migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8635:10"/>
blowes of banquettes, bathings, quaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings,
watchings, wantonnesse, and such lyke:
wherein Time, the treasure of life is consumed,
and nothing hoorded vp, but griefe and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
When he had almost weeried me with
these kindes of blowes, then he let driue at me
a freshe with many disorderly strokes, of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyng,
running, leaping, playing at tennis, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
exercise, sweatyng, sodayne colde ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng,
and other such lyke, so deadly and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
greetings, that without all doubt he had
then made an ende of my daies, had not a Lady,<note place="margin">The author is foyled by Yll diet, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquia Iuuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis.</note>
called <hi>Reliquia iuuentutis,</hi> commen to my suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
who though in a maner tyred with often
helpyng me in such lyke combates, yet did in
defence of my health, put foorth the vttermost
of her force and vertue, requestyng my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
to leaue the fyght, and to geue me respit,
to see yet somewhat farther on in the worlde.
I am contented, quoth he, for the farther he
runneth on in the worlde, and the more trust
he putteth in his owne forces, the more certaine
is his destruction: yet before he depart, because
he hath behaued himselfe so stoutely with me,
I wyll bestow a Cappe vpon him,<note place="margin">Yll diet presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him with a cappe.</note> dyed in my
colours, of such operation and vertue, that it
shall distyll a fountayne of rhewmes and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
into his eyes, legges, thyghes, armes, and
<pb facs="tcp:8635:11"/>
ioynts, so that in one part or other of his bodie,
while he liues, go where he will, he shall haue
cause to remember my acquantance. In geuing
me which present, he departed with exceeding
haste, leauing me extreamely turmoyled, and
sore in my bones with the weerinesse of this
combate. But my greatest griefe was, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in this last conflict, I had beene relieued
through the helpe of that litle youth that was
remaining in me,<note place="margin">Reliquia iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentutis doth abandon him.</note> the same also being my chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
comfort, did now of a sodaine abandon
me, bidding me hereafter gouerne my selfe
well, for of her I neyther coulde nor shoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
any farther assistance.</p>
            <p>Being thus forsaken, I folowed on my way,
desolate and comfortlesse, not knowyng whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Onely my thoughtfulnesse still suggested
vertue and valour vnto my minde, animating
me to perseuere on in this important voyage.</p>
            <p>But as my mynde doubtfully wauered in
sundry and diuers thoughts amidde this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
way, the night drawing on, I might
espie an aged fatherly Hermite,<note place="margin">The author amidds his wandring, lighteth vpon the mantion of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> not farre off,
standing before the doore of his Cell, whose
graue and courteous aspect, encouraged me to
acquaint him with my wandering vncertaine
voyage, and in frendly sort to entreate him of
harbour for that nyght. The good Hermite
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8635:11"/>
bade me from his hart welcome, and by his
countenance &amp; worde assured me, that I should
finde him a most freendlie and comfortable
Hoste. He himselfe disarmed me, and bringing
me into the inwarde part of his lodging, did
cast a warme mantle about my shoulders.</p>
            <p>Me thought I did neuer beholde a man of
more pleasing behauiour, nor one whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
did more delight me. After that he
had called for water to refresh me, he led me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a litle Chappel, exceedinglie full of beautie,
and euen with the very sight moouing to deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
in which, kneeling downe at my prayers,
I saw sundry workes of pietie and repentance,
curiously wrought and garnished round about
with sundry examples of Reformed life, all set
foorth in so comelie a sort, and in so liuely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
that I was euen in a maner rauished with
the sight thereof, if the good Hermite, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
my passed trauaile, and the latenesse of
the nyght, had not by calling me to supper,
withdrawen my minde from the infinitenesse
of contemplation, whereunto the rare vertue of
these glorious sightes had mooued it.</p>
            <p>As we sate at the table, I coulde not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
mine eyes from beholding his face. His
age was not lothsome, but florishyng in vertue,
and himselfe wise, though not according to our
<pb facs="tcp:8635:12"/>
common worldly conceyte, yet in the deapth
of that wisedome, that leadeth the soule to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
I coulde not refrayne from asking his
name, and withall the cause that did mooue
him, being so notable a man, to liue retired in so
solitarie a place.</p>
            <p>To satisfie your demaunde, quoth he, You
shall vnderstande, that I do well know both you
and your estate, which did the more moue me
to geue you entertainement. As for me, I am
called, <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> a name in the worlde well
worthie of honour, though it be of the most
part wrested, turned, and misdeemed. I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
my selfe vnto this place, to the ende, that
by Gods grace and goodnesse, I might leaue the
wyde way of the worlde, that leadeth to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
perdition. The bread I feede vpon is
seasoned with sobrietie, and the wine I drinke
is watred with the pure liquor of sincere liuing:
That which suffiseth;<note place="margin">Reason, the seate or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</note> susteyneth me. No pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
enuie, or dissention, hath entrance into this
house of mine, which is called <hi>Reason.</hi> Here I
hope to leade the rest of my life, and to ende
my dayes,<note place="margin">The ende of true wisedome and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing whereto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</note> in flying the allurementes of the
fleshe and the worlde, and seeking with my
soule, him that did with his blood redeeme it.</p>
            <p>Onely the thought of sinne, is bitter and
greeuous vnto me, from occasion of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8635:12"/>
which, as I do now liue sequestred, so I beseech
the guyder of the heauens to encrease in me
perseuerance in this life, which I haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.
As for your estate, linage, name, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
I am thereof well informed: likewise of
the aduenturous enquest, which in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
voyage of yours, you haue vndertaken.
Neither am I ignorant of your natiue countrie,
the marches of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> in the miserable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of which, with warre, desolation, and
bloodshed, vnweeried fortune seemeth to take
such pleasure. As for your selfe, seeing, like a
valiant Martire, you haue determined to bestow
your life vpon these two tyrannizing Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,
whose cruell handes neuer any of your
foregoers that contended with them (how fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
or warlike soeuer) coulde escape, without
bodily death and dissolution, I will geue you
the best and most expedient aduice I can.</p>
            <p>First you must know, that <hi>Accident</hi> is alwayes,<note place="margin">Accident, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready to entrappe and bereaue life.</note>
and at all houres redy mounted and armed,
attended vpon with all sortes of mischiefe, and
pernitious engines, to bereaue mortall men of
their liues. <hi>Debilitie</hi> helpeth him, as neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth:
so that betweene them, they suffer none
to escape. But notwithstanding all this, the
greatnesse of your enimies puissance, and your
danger, yet such is the condition of mankinde,
<pb facs="tcp:8635:13"/>
and such the course and poynt whereunto you
are now arriued, that flie backe or retire, by any
meanes you may not. Therefore proceede on
a Gods name with a resolued courage: for as
the danger is great, so great wilbe your glorie,
if you do but withstande <hi>Accident</hi> alone: yea
so much, that you may aduance your armes,
and set foorth your trophees equally with the
most famous conquerour that euer was.</p>
            <p>And insomuch therefore that heedefulnesse,
and warie circumspection, is the chiefest meane
to the accomplishment of great thinges, I will
bestow vpon you a Lance, so surely steeled
with a head of good gouernement,<note place="margin">Good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a sure defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualties.</note> that if you
vse it rightly, and make therewith resistance at
any time when <hi>Accident</hi> shall distresse you, he
shalbe able to do you but litle greeuance. But
the surest preseruatiue I can geue you, is, euery
day in the morning when you rise, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende
your selfe deuoutely and zelously vnto
almighty God,<note place="margin">The surest preseruatiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</note> desiring him to be a stedfast

course of this your wandring mortalitie:
and forget not to be thankefull vnto him, for
the many benefites, which for his part so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously,
without any desart of yours, he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
vpon you.</p>
            <p>With these, &amp; such like speache, we brought
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8635:13"/>
supper to an ende, where, after hauing giuen
thankes vnto God, he brought mee to my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
the bed he appointed me was of <hi>Quiet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie,</hi>
euen such, as I my selfe would haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
wherin I was no soner laied, but that I fell
into a sound sweetnesse of sleepe,<note place="margin">The sleepes of true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing are secure.</note> and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
till the next morning, being awaked with
the sound of a litle bell, that roung vnto diuine
seruice: hearing of which I arose quicklie, and
comming downe, did finde the Alter called <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
couered with the Ornamentes of <hi>Trueth,</hi>
and a chapleine whose name was <hi>Humilitie,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uested
in a Pure surples of perfect charitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
the holie seruice, which after he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and my Hoast finished his orizons, he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
me, and demaunded what rest I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?
to which I answered, as I had cause, that I
neuer in my life had receiued the like content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; quiet repose. With that, he seeming wel
appaide that I had so well liked of my lodging,

            <p>We had not visited the fourth part of this

place, so many, so strange, and so diuerse, were
the instrumentes that <hi>Accident</hi> vsed to surprise
mens liues withall, when the good Hermite
withdrew me from thence, willing me not to
forget, but mindfully to consider of those his
reliques which I had seene.</p>
            <p>Being thence departed, when I began with
perfect iudgement to consider of the thinges
which I had viewed, though the strangenesse
and varietie of them were somewhat delightful:
yet coulde I not but feele a great tendernesse
and perplexitie in my minde, to consider that so
many great and excellent men, had been by
<hi>Accident</hi> so cruelly murthered and made away;
some, euen at such instantes, as the vayne frailtie
of this deceauing worlde did promise vnto
them a stable and firme estate in all glorie, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
and contentment: withall it was a griefe
vnto me, that I had not seene the rest which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned,
the which in apparance was ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande
millions of times more, then that which I
had seene.</p>
            <p>But withall I wondred much, that among so
many remarkable trophees of <hi>Accidents</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
I had not seene any of his companion <hi>Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie:</hi>
which my freendly Hoast perceiuing,
tolde me, that if I did at my returne repaire vnto
him, he woulde likewise satisfie mee therein,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8635:16"/>
and make me acquainted with the wonderous
puissance of <hi>Debilitie:</hi> As for now, he chieflie
desired to prepare me against the violence of
<hi>Accident,</hi> as being of the two the more cruel and
sodaine; and then he discoursed vnto me of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great and mighty Princes, that he had at
vnawares surprised and murthered, some tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of delicious meates, some riding and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of proude horses, some geuing audience
to sutors,<note place="margin">Sundrie prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces bereaued of their liues, euen in the middest of their sweetest pleasures.</note> some riding in triumph to the capitoll,
some by sea, some by lande, some by fire, some
by fall of houses, some by thunder, some by
earthquakes, some in dauncing, some in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yea and some fast embraced in the armes of
their beloued mystres, euen in the pleasingest
action of their Loue.</p>
            <p>Herewith the aged Father, being loth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
me any longer from my intended voyage,
with tearefull eyes embracing me, recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me vnto God, willing me not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull
of his counsails, and withall requested
me at my returne, if I did escape with life, to
come visite him: which promising him to do,
I presently put on my armour, and taking the
Lance of <hi>Good gouernment</hi> which he had geuen
me, I leapt a horsebacke, and went foorth on my
iorney.</p>
            <p>I had not long trauailed, when I entred into
<pb facs="tcp:8635:17"/>
a vallie, that did directly leade me to a plaine,
which in appearance seemed to be aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
great and spatious.</p>
            <p>This plaine I speake of,<note place="margin">The playne of tyme.</note> is called <hi>Time,</hi> which
though it be large &amp; farre extended, yet scarcely
doth the passenger come vnto it, when he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redie
beyonde it; and the nature thereof is such,<note place="margin">The nature thereof.</note>
that pleasure &amp; contentment do passe through
it so vnconstantly, and with such swiftnesse, that
they leaue in celeritie the winds behinde them.</p>
            <p>I was no sooner come thither, but my Horse,<note place="margin">Desire hardly restrayned.</note>
whose name (as before I tolde you) was <hi>Desire,</hi>
tooke so strongly the head, that do what I could,
I was not able to stay him, till he had brought
me farre beyonde the middle of the playne:
where, striuing to restraine his course, I might
espie before me a fierce Champion, that seemed
in guyse of skilfull warriour to bid me battaill.</p>
            <p>His armour was of <hi>Trauaile,</hi> the courser that
he bestradde was called <hi>Payne,</hi> his shielde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
the Sunne, in which were figured
<hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>slouth, drousie slumber,</hi> and <hi>watchfull
diligence.</hi> His coatarmour was of <hi>Constant suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring;</hi>
and by his outwarde shew, it seemed that
he had been in many broyles, and newly esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out of a great battaill. He thought I could
haue stayed a great while to beholde him and
his demeanoure; but that the sharpenesse of his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8635:17"/>
salutation gaue me no such leysure:<note place="margin">Heere the Author en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countreth age, and striueth mightyly to keepe him off, but neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in the end he is constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to yeelde quietly vnto him.</note> for without
delay, putting spurres to his enraged Courser,
he furiously made towardes me with his Lance
enrested: on the other side, I was not behinde
hand to requite his kindenesse, but putting my
Horse to the vtmost of his carrere, met him with
so rude an encounter, that though he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
me to the grounde, yet I made him tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in his saddle: at which, growing impatient,
he laide hande on his sworde, and let driue at
me with all his force, wherewith he had then
without doubt geuen me a mortall wounde,
had not I kept him off,<note place="margin">Age striketh him with his sworde of many yeeres.</note> and defended my
selfe with my Lance of <hi>Good gouernment.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
he ceassed not to encroch still nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
and nearer in vpon me, lending me so manie
sturdie strokes, with his sworde of <hi>Many yeeres,</hi>
that I waxed (in a maner) vnable to helpe my
selfe any farther, against the heauie neuer-ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
blowes of his vnresistable arme; and at
length, to make my miserie the greater, my lance
of <hi>Good gouernment</hi> flew in peeces: wherewith,
and thorow the thumps which he had geuen
me, my head began to be giddie, my legges to
faint, and my eyes to dazle; wherewith, vpon
my entreatie (he likewise, being in a maner
breathlesse) we agreed to take a litle pause.</p>
            <p>After I had a while refreshed my selfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
<pb facs="tcp:8635:18"/>
breath, casting mine eye vpon my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie,
and in my secrete iudgement, much
commending the grauitie of his looke, and the
brauenesse of his behauiour, I requested him in
kindnesse, to tell me his name and condition.
To which answering me in very courteous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
like a man of good iudgement and setled
sense: My discent and linage, quoth he, is of
great antiquitie; my proper name is, <hi>Age,</hi> true
register of euery mans time, in which I do neuer
deceiue any, neither do I geue my consent to
falsenesse. None can passe through the plaine
of <hi>Time,</hi> without comming vnder my handes;
and whosoeuer otherwise doth thinke, is farre
deceiued, and in errour. For vnder this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were borne all those that euer enioyed the
faire light of this worlde, or euer at any time shal:
of which, if any escape my handes, then can he
not wander farre in this feelde of <hi>Time,</hi> but
must of necessitie die in the vnfortunate vnripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his youth: and to this necessitie are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
as wel Princes, as priuate men, the faire, rich,
noble, and fortunate, as those of contrarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Therefore, seeing you are now so farre
trauailed in this plaine, that you are come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compas of my power, either without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
resistance, yeelde your selfe quietly vnto
me, or you shall too late repent, with manie a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8635:18"/>
groning sigh, that euer you striued with me.</p>
            <p>But I, not being yet so throughly quayled as
to yeeld vnto his perswasion, setled my selfe to
resistance: so that defying me a fresh, he let
driue at me a new with as great fiercenesse as
euer he had done before, laying with his sword,
which as I tolde you was of <hi>Many yeeres,</hi> so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
lode vppon me, that all my limmes began
to shake with a feint and trembling numnesse:
My trustie Lance of <hi>Gouernment</hi> was broken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
&amp; now also comming to the cloze, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
pulled from me my shield of <hi>Hope:</hi> finding
my selfe in which miserable estate, my weapons
taken a way, my forces declining, and my bodie
weake and decaied, like a man forelorne, I began
to feint in my resistance, which my aduersarie
perceyuing, with a noble magnanimitie also slac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
his fight: so that at length,<note place="margin">He yeeldeth vnwillingly to Age.</note> finding no other
remedie, though much against my will, I was
content to render my selfe vnto him, giuing him
my faith and promise to remaine his true priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and to pay him any reasonable raunsome
that he should demaund: who, as a great Lord
doth his humbled seruant, so receyued he me
with signes of loue, taking from me my right
gauntlet, in token of his conquest, telling me
how behouefull and honorable a thing it was
for a prisoner to manteine inuiolably his worde
<pb facs="tcp:8635:19"/>
and faith, especially being a gentleman: as for
his parte, he would vse me well, and graunt me
my libertie: but it behoued me, on peine of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie
and dotage,<note place="margin">Age enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some thinges vppon peine of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</note> to promise him the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of some such things, as for mine own
honor and good he would enioyne me to. To
which, when I had with all willingnesse agreed,
First, quoth he, you shall flie from the territorie
of <hi>Loue,</hi> whose Lorde is an abusing flatterer,
whose pleasure is a secret baite, conteining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it nothing but gall and bitternesse, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
whose sequell is nothing but sorow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,<note place="margin">Loue.</note>
hauing nothing in it that is true, but
deceipt onely: so that it becommeth not a man
of honor, beeing once receyued into my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queintance,
to applie himself to any such follies,
of which he cannot expect any other fruict, then
griefe of time misspent, burden of conscience,
vaine expence, and derision of the worlde; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
a thousande other inconueniences.</p>
            <p>Besides,<note place="margin">Mariage.</note> there is a vallie called <hi>Mariage,</hi> which
take heede by any meanes you enter not into,
for there are perilles and troubles without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
with which I woulde not haue him, whom
I haue taken in protection, not so much as in
thought incumbred.</p>
            <p>I woulde haue you also leaue on the left hand,<note place="margin">Amorous dssportes.</note>
seeing they are thinges to vs impertinent and yll
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8635:19"/>
beseeming, al wanton conuersations, dauncings,
singings, and such like other amorous disportes,
as the schoole of idlenesse bringeth foorth.</p>
            <p>But aboue all I admonish you, that you keepe
your selfe sequestred and free from the courtes
of great Princes,<note place="margin">Courtly life.</note> where the vncertaine good and
honor ambitiously pursued, though obteined
(which vnlesse you haue a better spokesman
then <hi>Vertue,</hi> seldome happeneth) yet neuer
lightly counteruaileth the certaine losses and
assured dangers, that folowe the ficklenesse of
that subiected life.</p>
            <p>Thither repaire many gallant floorishing
youths, pursuing <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Honor,</hi> with sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
attire, high lookes, proude wordes, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainefull
thoughts: but in the ende, foyled and
ouerthrowen with <hi>Ouer-riotous expence,</hi> reape
nothing in their fall and pouertie, but laughter,
mockerie, and contempt, vnlesse it be, that
perchaunce against their will, they learne to be
humble.</p>
            <p>But many there are of my acquaintance, who
hauing ouergon, and spent the poasting yeeres
of vnmistrustfull youth, either in the vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
at home, or in trauayles, or the warres
abrode, and by long and paynefull diligence
obteined such vertues and qualities as to the
seruice of their Prince &amp; Countrey are fitting,
<pb facs="tcp:8635:20"/>
do come at length to make shew of themselues,
in this most fayre and magnificent market of
the worlde, the Court, flattering themselues
with great hope of rewarde, honor, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement:
and that the rather, because they see
there ietting vp and downe, a number of vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
peacockes, that haue no worthy thing
els in the worlde to vaunt on, then onely the
colour of their plumes. But great is herein their
error, and as rare their preferment, as the sight
of a blacke Swanne. I do not denie, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
such a miracle may happen: yet for the
most part, Princes are not caried away with a
sodaine shew of vertue, neither is it requisite
they shoulde: neither do they alwayes dispense
their fauours and disgraces, according to the
worth and worthlesnesse of each one, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
as they are by great personages that
possesse neere places about them enformed,
who either through foretaken conceite, or by
enuious Sycophants wrongly perswaded, or
some other occasion, do often speake the worst,
or els being by many experiences warned and
taught, in such cases to be warie &amp; circumspect,
least the following behauiour of the partie
commended, may be such, as shall geue no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
to his commender, wilbe altogeather silent,
so that the chiefest labour must be, to winne the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8635:20"/>
stedfast fauour of one of these great men: which
who so vndertaketh, good God, with what a sea
of miseries shall he finde him selfe inuironed.
For though he misse the almost ineuitable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of factions and partialities, wherin many
haue made shipwracke of their estate, in being
by the one sharpely persecuted, &amp; by the other
but weakely defended: yet such is the number of
malitious parasites, that waite vpon the fortune
of great Lords; such the multitude of flatterers,
deceiuers, supplanters, vnderminers, espialles,
and such like vermine, that attende vpon their
court and table, all couering their villanous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
vnder the maske of vertue, fidelitie, and
officious duetie: that being often betrayed, and
abused, howsoeuer their outwarde shew be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
and courteous, they will, and can not in
wisedome otherwise choose, but beware whom
they admit into such degree of fauour; as, that
they will for his preferment aduenture their
credit: So that the new-come Courtier, yea,
though he encline to such humors, as a minde
well framed can hardly endure to embrace,

            <p>And thus much assure your selfe, if my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
(which what it is, my name declareth)
be any whit to be eredited, that I haue not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

which happeneth not alwaies thorow

others mis-led, but rather by a malignitie of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
which still striueth to depresse Vertue, or
rather of a direct antipathie betweene them.</p>
            <p>Sundry excellent Princes haue, by diuers
their ingenious conceyts, made manifest, that
the complaynt of olde decayed Courtiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their ingratitude, is often times vniust,
and not they, but the vnthriuing Courtiers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to be blamed.</p>
            <p>Besides we see, that the great and all-ruling
King of the vniuersal pallace of this faire world,
doth not, in the distribution of his temporall
rewardes and punishments, alwayes respect
the good or yll desertes of him, whom he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreth
with the one, or afflicteth with the other.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore the fauour and firme affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of great men so hard to be obteined, and
hopes of courtly aduancement so vncertaine,
and depending vppon such long merits, that
the small remainder of your life shall be tired
out and ended, before you shall by long pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
seruice be able to procure in your princes
minde a full perswasion of your vertue, loialtie,
and faith: If you will follow my counsell, leaue
off the Court to men of great happinesse, and
<pb facs="tcp:8635:22"/>
bende your minde wholly to the obteining of
that celestial honor and preferment, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
faileth them that doe vnfeinedly secke it.</p>
            <p>Let this then suffize as touching the Courtly
life, whose philosophie being a point beyonde
either morall or naturall: as the ioyes thereof are
exceeding cheerefull &amp; gladsome,<note place="margin">The vertuous man desireth aduancement, onely thereby to be able to do his prince and countrie seruice.</note> to those that

of due fauour and encouragement, made vnable
to do their Prince and Country seruice; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
hauing wholly dedicated thereunto them

            <p>But hauing herein been somewhat long, I
will briefly conclude with the rest of such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
as in respect of your honor and welfare
I charge you to obserue.</p>
            <p>Seeke not to finde Feast or Pleasure in the
wildernes of lost <hi>Time,</hi> for neuer did any yet in
the highest degree possesse it, that did not in
th'ende, with many losses, and greeuous paines,
repent it. Apart your selfe therfore from thence,
and while you haue leysure, vse vertuously the
precious, but not long to be enioyed, iewell of

            <p>Iustes, turneis, triumphes, wearing of Ladies
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8635:22"/>
liueries, and other the like, enterteined by
greene and flourishing yeeres, take heede that
by any meanes you imbrace not.</p>
            <p>Take the better way, reseruing your bodyly
strength, to the combat of those valorous
Champions that attende you and your soule to
your God and maker.</p>
            <p>These my counsailes, I do aduise you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,
not so much in respect of my commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
as of the hurt and damage that may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
vnto you in transgressing them. To which
I constantly made answere, that I woulde assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
performe as much as I had promised, and

of them woulde turne to the greatest

            <p>Well, sayd he, I leaue it to your owne choyce

present, because it waxeth late, I woulde haue
you directly to take your iorney towardes the
barren desert of <hi>Olde Age,</hi> so playne and discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a way by the course of Nature, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
misse it; and there you shall assuredly finde,
and perchance sooner then you expect, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
you seeke: As for your Horse and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
I do frankly returne them vnto you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
with free libertie to depart; and withall,
in token of my acquaintance, I will bestow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb facs="tcp:8635:23"/>
you this present (deliuering me therewith
a fayre siluer Gorget of Mayle) the propertie
of which is such,<note place="margin">Age presents the author with a siluer Gorget of maile.</note> that the longer you liue, the
more shall it conforme the colour of your
heare and beard in sutablenesse to the same.
Which guift of his, when I had receiued, he
tooke his leaue, putting his Courser to so swift
a pace, that I did scarcely heare or see the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his feete. And as for me, I departed on
my way, straight as a line, towardes the desart of
<hi>Olde Age:</hi> in which sort, trauayling vpon the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
confines of <hi>Time,</hi> I came to a high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
whose discent was a steepe and speedie
<hi>Downefall,</hi> so that I was in much shorter space
at the foote, then I had been in clyming to the
height thereof. From thence, I galloped apace
towardes the desart to which I was directed.
But I had not long trauailed, when of a sodaine
I was in a crosse way wanderingly lost, my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
distracted, and my minde vtterly forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of al those good aduices lately deliuered me
by <hi>Age,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He entrethin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pathe of deceite.</note> in so much, that I entred into a wrong
path, called, <hi>Deceit,</hi> whose issue is neuer other
then losse and repentance, though the going in,
being a litle glazed ouer with a fayre dissembled
shew of <hi>True pleasure,</hi> do beguile the eye of our
iudgement.</p>
            <p>Within it, was great verdure and freshnesse,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8635:23"/>
and though the season of the yeere were faded
and past, yet was the ground diuersified and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amelled
with an infinite varietie of sweete smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
flowers, so that it represented vnto my
soone-yeelding senses, an extremitie of pleasure
and delight: For <hi>Deceit,</hi> who in exterior shew
suggesteth a worlde of pleasures, did now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
vnto me all the delices, comfortes,
and well sauouring ioyes, that euer in my youth
I had tasted.</p>
            <p>Then againe began I to acquaint my selfe
with <hi>Carelesse vanitie,</hi> obliuious altogether of
my former yeelding, and of my vowed promise
and acquaintance with <hi>Age:</hi> I respected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the present pleasure of my senses, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
my selfe, by a strange metamorphosis,
freshly inueygled with that error, which I
thought I had long agoe lost and left behinde
me.</p>
            <p>My passed pleasures of hauking, hunting,
armes, loue, and Ladies, al returned with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
selfe same sweetenesse, and pleasing delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
as when they first possessed my gay,
youthfull, and flourishyng yeeres. Withall, in
came <hi>Vayne Conceit,</hi> buylding towers in the
ayre, suggesting vnto me <hi>False courage,</hi> to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
things vnpossible, and <hi>Credulous lightnesse,</hi>
to beleeue things vtterly improbable, without
<pb facs="tcp:8635:24"/>
reason or foundation.</p>
            <p>My Horse went on amaine with a full carrere,
fearing neither bridle nor bit, Plaines &amp; Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
were to him alike: as for me, he saw me
such a stranger to my selfe, that he neither knew
me, nor obeyed me.</p>
            <p>And all this confused perturbation of my
senses, was so cunningly contriued by <hi>Well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
Deceit,</hi> that quite forgetfull of my way,
without finding any error at all in my steppes,
I was led to the most sense-pleasing and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
place, that I coulde possibly haue imagined.</p>
            <p>Within the same stoode a gorgious &amp; stately
royal pallace, whose exterior pompous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable
shewe, made me verily perswade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that neuer death, or any of his champions,
could be able to approach vnto a place so beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and delitious. The walles seemed to be of
cleere refined siluer, the windowes of bright
transparent christal, the pinacles of pure wel bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
golde, that glistered like the Sun-beames,
and the couerings and roofes of radiant Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
whose goodly fayrenesse and splendor was
such, that with amazement it dazeled the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
eyes. Many beautifull Ladyes were at the
windowes, richly adorned with pompous ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,
strange attires, rare deuices, and most allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
sweete behauiours. Many braue youthfull
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8635:24"/>
Gallants were among them, enterteining them
with courtly gestures, and amorous well vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
speaches. There was besides, a most delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
musique of many well consorted Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
to which, some were listening, some
daunsing, some discoursing: in fine, all was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous,
and moouing vnto loue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deceipt</hi> was now become so quiet, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
a lorde and ruler of my fancie, that I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged
my selfe most fortunate and happie, in
being arriued at such a Paradice, so voyde of
griefe, and so repleate with all sortes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
as this seemed to be: Whereupon, going
to the Porter, whose name was <hi>Abusion,</hi> I freend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
intreated him,<note place="margin">Abusion the porter of loues pallace.</note> to tell me what myght be the
name of this sumptuous edifice, wherein was
assembled such a noble company of Gentlemen
and Ladyes, with such magnificent varietie of
pleasures and delightes: who briefly answered
me,<note place="margin">The pallace of Loue.</note> that he was called the <hi>Pallace of Louc.</hi> At
which very name of Loue, I started backe, as
at a thing altogeather disproportionable to my
yeeres and profession. When <hi>Desire,</hi> suggesting
againe vnto my senses a worlde of delightes
and pleasures, the more I withdrew my mynde,
the more did enflame it forwarde. But straight,
<hi>Remembrance</hi> stept in, recording vnto me the
historie of things passed, and crying out aloude,
<pb facs="tcp:8635:25"/>
that I committed periurie, and withall did for
euer purchase mine owne ruine and perdition,
shewing me therewith a cleere christall glasse,
wherein, besides many of my passed matters, I
saw <hi>Auncient Age</hi> noting vp all my steppes, as
one that ment to call me in question for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing
his counsells. And likewise I might
therein perceiue my beard to be all mingled
with siluer hayres, and my head to be ouercast
with snow: The sight of which, did worke in
me a marueilous amazement. <hi>Desire</hi> neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
with many sweete allurementes, employed
his greatest force to bring me vnder <hi>Loues</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.
But <hi>Remembrance</hi> did so liuely shew
vnto me the yll agreeing deformitie thereof;
perswading me, to let that passe, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redie
passed, rather then of new to harbour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such troublesome tirannicall guest, within
the weakned mansion of my aged senses: That
howsoeuer vehemently swaied by <hi>Desiers</hi> temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
yet when I had recalled my minde to ful
consideration thereof, I thought good to apart
me from his counsel, as beeing both dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and dishonorable, fully resoluing, not to
be at any time so ouertaken againe: so that
all <hi>Desires</hi> endeuours prouing vaine, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi>
taking me by the hand, guided me from
that counterfeit path of <hi>Deceit,</hi> into the true
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8635:25"/>
way of <hi>Goodaduice,</hi> with right direction where
my iourney lay: And there I tooke my farewell
of <hi>Loue,</hi> and withall of her, for whose sake (while
I was <hi>Loues</hi> enthralled subiect) the paynes and
tormentes I endured, seemed to be but pleasures
and comfortes. Who so is desirous to know
her, let him content him selfe with this much,
that she is one, whom Nature hath more richly
beautified with grace, comlinesse, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then my worthlesse and vneloquent penne
can any way expresse. But the <hi>Euer-liuing righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi>
whose wisedome is infinite, and whose
iudgement impenetrable, knowing the ende of
my pretences, was pleased to assist me with his
gracious goodnesse, so that I went on the right
way, to accomplish my faith and promise, which
I had geuen vnto <hi>Age:</hi> and such was the haste I
made to be at my iourneys end, that I found my
selfe arriued in the Countrey of <hi>Feeble olde Age,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The desert of olde Age.</note>
before I my selfe knew how. There the earth
trembled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and euery thing seemed to be a quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.
The ayre was darke and mistie, the smelles
noysome, the grounde barren, yeelding mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in steede of fruite, and the rentes that there
were gathered, was griefe and anguish.</p>
            <p>There groweth not any tree, that beareth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fruite or flower; all is full of barren briers,
and withered thornes. There is not any meate
<pb facs="tcp:8635:26"/>
of good taste, nor herbe yeelding iuise: in fine,
it is a destroyed parte, dry, fruitlesse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed:
in the which, there is not any nouriture,
or verie litle, and that, mingled with care and
sorow. The fountaines there are of sufferance,
&amp; the brokes of bitternesse. The Moones bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and the Sunnes glistering, is there obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with darkenesse and fogs. The sweetest
songs accustomably vsed in this barren desert,
are sorowfull complaintes of time misspent, and
for good things passed, that can not be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.
The longer a man lingreth there, the lesse
repose he findeth: euerie thing yeeldeth griefe,
and <hi>Infirmitie</hi> is there enthronized as princesse,
and regent of the whole territorie. Health
hath no entrie, but is thence perpetually bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
comfortable mirth appeareth not, being
suppressed by fretting Melancholy, one of the
cheefest Lordes of this desert.</p>
            <p>A small iourney from thence,<note place="margin">The Ilande of Decrepitude.</note> lieth an Iland of
diseased infirmitie, whose proper name is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepitude,</hi>
where health died, making griefe and
sorow his executors, bequeathing vnto them
all his rightes and possessions. I haue not as yet
bin there, but I am comen so neere, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ayre thereof maketh al the ioyntes and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of my body to shake and tremble: Iudge
then what effect it will worke in him, that shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8635:26"/>
therein landed and ariued?</p>
            <p>Thence, being once entred, there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting,
till the soule doe free it selfe from out
the encombred bodies prison, aspiring to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
habitation.</p>
            <p>But which of all is strangest, such is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
working and vigor thereof, that from
the extremitie of <hi>Olde Age,</hi> it constreineth men
againe to returne vnto the verie extremities of
<hi>Childehood;</hi> then the which, what wonder can
be greater. <hi>Feeblenesse</hi> is there so strong, that it
taketh from <hi>Strength,</hi> absolutely his beeing.</p>
            <p>The eyes brightnesse, being of mans life the
chiefest comfort, is there in such sort turned
to obscuritie and dimnesse, that it scarcely seeth
any thing at al: and yet that litle is in such imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
dazeling maner, that all the things discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
seeme to be but images of death.</p>
            <p>No benefit is so great that it can yeeld sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of health or comfort, and euerie litle euill
is so efficient, that it easily becommeth mortall:
each litle griefe offendeth deadly without resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
as in a rendred ouerthrowen Countrey,
where life hath nothing, but onely the name
and apparance.</p>
            <p>I know this <hi>Decrepite</hi> estate to be a thing feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vnto fleshe: yet surely it is a great benefite of
God, by whose goodnesse the vertuous and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb facs="tcp:8635:27"/>
bearing thereof, may be a great meane to
our saluation, which of his endlesse mercie, I
beseech him, that we may all obteine.</p>
            <p>But to come backe to my discourse, being
once in this vnpleasant desert of <hi>Olde Age,</hi> I
coulde not finde any path, gate, way, or issue, to
get out, vnlesse I woulde enter into that of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepitude,</hi>
and therefore I enterteined my selfe,
the best that I could, in that health lesse prouince:
in which, after I had a litle romed vp and downe,
I espied sundry people both men and women,<note place="margin">Sundry abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of Age, &amp; deceyuers of them selues.</note>
that did busie them selues in the practise of
strange and cosening sleightes: some to hide and
dissemble their yeeres, filled vp the wrinkled
furrowes of their face with payntinges, some
died their heades and beards with waters of
their owne mingling, some pulled quite out the
gray heares that appeared in them, thinking so
to rid them selues of those hatefull messengers
of decaying life. But <hi>Olde Age,</hi> would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
vnto such falsenesse, protesting against
them, that they laboured in vayne, for there is
no possibilitie of turning backe one iot from
that degree of his acquaintance, and subiection
whereto they are once arriued. Being once wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
and decayed with <hi>Age,</hi> to florishe and
waxe greene againe, is not graunted to any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
creature. The ende of such deuices and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8635:27"/>
tendeth in fine to nothing, but to filling
of the Churchyardes.</p>
            <p>But leauing this discourse, because it breedeth
melancholie. <hi>Olde Age,</hi> as I tell you, had so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
me, that though I woulde feine haue
gotten out of his iurisdiction, yet coulde I not
by any meanes finde any way or passage, which
at the first mooued me to be very heauie and
sorowfull, and that the rather, because I saw my
youth vnrecouerable, and my griefe remedilesse.
But euen as the poore seely birde, newly inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
within the prison of his Cage, doth for a
time at the first, sullenly lament the losse of his
abridged libertie, till at last, seeing the booteles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his sorow, he beginneth to comfort
him selfe, with thinking of his sweete for passed
pleasures, as of the delightfull trees, and sweetely
smelling bryers, wherein he had harboured the
pleasant chirping of his litle louely companions
with whom he had conuersed, and such his
other recreations and pastimes, whilest he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed
the freedome of the fieldes, and euen with
those thoughts of comfort, forgetteth his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
and falleth sweetely a singing: so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
it with me, who, though my present estate
mooued me to heauinesse and sorow, yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the necessitie thereof, and with all my
many passed youthfull pleasures, I framed my
<pb facs="tcp:8635:28"/>
minde to a contentment, and so began to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
and searche each part and coast of the
countrie through, to see yf I coulde finde any
part or corner therof, exempted from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
barrennesse of the rest, to th'ende, I myght
there passe away my time with lesse griefe.</p>
            <p>Hauing trauayled awhile, I happened of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne
to espie therein a place, so full of goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and riches, that I could not refraine from
wonder in beholding it. Within the same was a
lodging of inestimable worth called <hi>Good aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Then first began I to perceyue the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the worldes common opinion, which is,
that there is not in <hi>Olde age</hi> any pleasure: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
surely there is a thing called <hi>Studie,</hi> in whose
vertuous exercise a vicelesse <hi>Youth</hi> passed ouer,
doth manifest the contrary.</p>
            <p>But you must vnderstand,<note place="margin">I take it, that by this studie he meaneth Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that I meane not
the fond studie of vaine worldly trifles, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that which teacheth vs to scorne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
the brickle (and howsoeuer faire guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
yet soone defaced alurementes of this
world, and so to liue and die, that our soule

This I speake of, consisteth in fruitfully rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the sacred volume of the holy Scriptures,
&amp; the precious workes of those godly Doctors
&amp; Fathers, whose blessed pennes haue diuinely
prescribed vnto vs, the way of perfect repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and vertuous perfection, teaching vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but that, which still we ought to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
with the eyes of our mynde; that is, to
lyue and die well. For there is not any thing
vnder heauen so happelesse, heauie, and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as for a soule sleeping carelesly in sinne, to
approch the dolorous passage of <hi>Death.</hi> Of this
desirable place I speake off, the walles were all
round about trimmed with <hi>Delight.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pallace of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The Portal
at which you entred, figured foorth nothing
but <hi>Pleasure.</hi> The Dytches were secure, deepe,
and well trenched, curiously wrought in great
conformitie by <hi>Good exercise.</hi> The Chappel was
of <hi>Zeale,</hi> the Windowes of <hi>Charitable Loue,</hi> the
Gate, wherein was the entrance and going
foorth, of <hi>Heedefulnesse,</hi> and the Bridge of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
Trauaile.</hi> The Vanes and Streamers of
the house were of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> which glystering
aloft, shewed all the passers by, that there was
the schoole and practise of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Learning.</hi>
No <hi>Idlenesse</hi> dared to approch this blessed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
for <hi>Diligence</hi> was the Porter. Onely <hi>Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
is suffered to enter, who there serueth as a

            </p>
            <p>In fine, the time there bestowed, is in the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learning and exercise of that heauenly philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie,
whereto whosoeuer arriueth, may well
be accounted happie and blessed.</p>
            <p>That I was desirous to enter into this blis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
place, no man needeth to doubt: but in the
end, seeing the gates did not of themselues open
vnto me, I was bould to goe vnto the porter,
with earnest entreatie, that I might, by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
&amp; meanes, be suffered to enter. To which
he answered: this house, said he, which is the
very <hi>Perfection of studie</hi> and <hi>enemy of ignorance,</hi> is
not to be dallied withall, or to be entred with
sportfulnesse and scorne. For within it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
the <hi>Treasure of life,</hi> and the <hi>Riches</hi> of the
<hi>Worldes wisedome:</hi> it is kept and gouerned by a
beautifull Princesse, whom it hath pleased the
highest to blesse with a <hi>Happy euer-during youth:</hi>
shee neuer changeth estate, liuing free from
deaths subiection: her proper name is <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Memorie Ladie of the pallace, of Contemplation</note>
of all the worlde highly honored and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
From her are deriued all the chiefe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

whom shee pleaseth to harbour. Some there
are, whom shee flieth, though they labour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so earnestly to be acquainted with her: for
in her operations, is so great &amp; strange a secret of
nature, that neither <hi>Socrates,</hi> nor <hi>Plato,</hi> noral the
deepe pearcing wits of the passed Philosophers,
haue bin able to define whence, or how this
corruptible body of ours, is beautified with so
pure and excellent an ornament, as this of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</hi>
But for my part, I do verily beleeue,
without any doubt or question, that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so singular a good, procedeth onely from
the miraculous working of God, and not from
any setled habite or ingrafted guift of nature: for
as the soule hath by God her habitation &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micile
appointed her in the body, so hath <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie</hi>

vsing her qualities and operations. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the soule is an inuisible peculiar frame and
workmanship of God, as a sparke of his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:
It foloweth then also, that my Ladie and

alone, without hauing any relation to Nature.

beauties and ornaments of lyfe.</p>
            <p>Since I first came acquainted with her ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
I haue bin in stead of her seruant, as it were

loue I beare vnto vertuous studie, whose
true perfection without her helpe is not to be
obteyned. The onely way to see her perfectly,
is through <hi>Vertuous industrie,</hi> first by exercising
our mindes to learne and know, and then fastly
to reteine that which we haue once learned and
knowen.</p>
            <p>But because I see you are arriued to this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
soyle of <hi>Olde Age,</hi> taking compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of your weakened forces, I will accomplish
your desire, hoping somewhat therewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
and comfort the languishing of your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</p>
            <p>Whereupon being by this industrious Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
brought to the presence of <hi>Memorie,</hi> I was
of her saluted with a most pleasing and gentle
behauiour.</p>
            <p>Her attire was sumptuous and rich,<note place="margin">The attyre of Memorie.</note> embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in meruailous art by <hi>Cogitation</hi> rounde
about, strangely presenting vnto my view, a
large course and historie of <hi>Time,</hi> both past and
present. And withall, the more to subtilize my
remembrance, she made me smell to a Garlande
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8635:30"/>
of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which she ware, whose excellent
and delicious odour, did so refresh the vigour
of my senses, that me thought I was not halfe so
earthly as before.</p>
            <p>After some few conferences, I requested her to
fauour me with the sight of her librarie, which I
imagined could not be but rare &amp; magnificent.
But she briefly answered me, that whosoeuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to studie there, may not vse any other
bookes or lessons, then such as <hi>Remembrance</hi>
yeeldeth him: for it were labour lost, and meere
vanitie, for old men to begin first then to studie.
Their exercise ought rather to be in well kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and reteyning that, which before time they
had seene and learned, and therewith in she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
the fruites of their wysedome to recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
them selues, and to counsell others.</p>
            <p>But now tell me, sayd she, what is the thing
that you do demaunde of me, &amp; you shall finde
me redy to yeelde you satisfaction?</p>
            <p>Being comforted with her courteous and
gentle language, I did without delay acquaint
her with the circumstances of my aduenturous
enquest, telling her, how that my thought-ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
had instantly mooued me to visite the
forest of <hi>Atropos:</hi> which voyage I had now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued,
and withall, to enter in single combat
with eyther of the two famous Champions,
<pb facs="tcp:8635:31"/>
               <hi>Debilitie</hi> or <hi>Accident,</hi> to whose garde the place is
committed, beseeching her earnestly to tell me,
if she had heard, read, or founde, in any ancient
bookes, writinges, or recordes, hidden figures,
or long remembrance of times, that any of these
Champions had bin put to the foyle, by any
of those worthy men that at sundry ages haue
liued so puissant and conquering in their times:
For yf any one had at any time, or in any age
vanquished them, I woulde not doubt, but by
Gods assistance, to goe as farre, as he that had
gon farthest. But in fine, howsoeuer the matter
shoulde goe, I tolde her, that I was resolued to
winne eyther glorie with my sworde, or with
my body death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Memorie,</hi> hauing with attention heard my
speaches: I will not, sayd she smilingly, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
you with long discourses, but geuing you
the best aduise I may, let you with your eyes
beholde the certaine euent of this most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
enterprise, in which you are engaged.
And opening therewith a Posterne gate, she
placed me in a great immense and spatious
playne, called the <hi>Vniuersal Sepulcher of mankind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The vniuersal sepulchre of mankinde,</note>
open and discouered on euery side, without
eyther Rocke or Mountaine, so that there was
no limit nor restraint to the eye, but that it might
boldly and frankly throw his view so farre, as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8635:31"/>
the sharpenesse thereof coulde pearce or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne:
and as the playne was infinite, so was the
number of Graues &amp; Monumentes: vpon most
of the which of those of the right side, were
Epitaphes, and famous Figures of the name and
being of humane creatures, whom <hi>Death</hi> had
swallowed and deuoured.</p>
            <p>Marke now there, sayd she, yf you can, and
note vp the number of those enterred bodies,
who sometimes florished with such applause of
the worlde in great pompe &amp; honorable estate.
But yf your wittes be not able to comprehende
them, nor no wysedome, learning, or retentiue,
able to register them, then rest assured, that the
force of your aduersaries are mightie, and to be
feared: for they are all the spoyles of <hi>Debilitie</hi>

those, whose names <hi>Homers</hi> heroicall verse, or
<hi>Liuies</hi> maiesticall prose, hath made glorious to

spake off, lie here all in a reckoning. Olde, young,
rich, poore, fayre and foule, lie heere altogeather
encoffined. The great warriours of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:8635:32"/>
learned Philosophers of <hi>Athens,</hi> the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
<hi>Graecians,</hi> and the ouercome <hi>Troyans,</hi> the

being summoned by DEATH, haue all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
her commandement, &amp; heere their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kases
do rest.</p>
            <p>I saw there, of Queenes and Princesses, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
and Gentlewomen, of high degree, such a
number, that it passed imagination: of which,
though some had bin glorified with regall dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demes,
some shined with admirable beautie,
some adorned with infinite wysedome and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable

bin able to defende her selfe against the <hi>Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missing
Dart of Liues enemie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were Popes and parish Clarkes, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
and Carters,<note place="margin">All degrees alike to death.</note> Bishops and Beggers, Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes
and Pedlers, though before time in degree
vnequall,<note place="margin">Mors sceptra ligonibus aequat.</note> yet now to the woormes alike, who
found no difference in their flesh. Their bones,
being confusedly put togeather, of such likenes,
that one was not to be knowen from another.
Emperours and slaues, Kinges and Ploughmen,
Lordes and vacabondes, Law-giuers &amp; Louts,
were there all vnder <hi>Deaths</hi> clapnet. None of
them escaped, nor euer shall thence bring newes
to the worlde, of the good or euyll entertein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he there receiued. Retyred Virgins, new
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8635:32"/>
professed Nunnes, and aged Abbesses, vertuous
Matrones, and wanton Curtizanes, all had there
yeelded vp their lyues to <hi>Deaths</hi> commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In fine, such was the infinitnesse of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that my eyes were weeried with viewing,
and my spirits dulled with meditating vpon
them.</p>
            <p>Of all those whose carkases I there behelde,
I woulde gladliest, yf I knew which way, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
of those of this present age of ours. But
though it shoulde please God to graunt vnto
me the lyfe of <hi>Mathusalaem,</hi> and I shoulde in all
that time do nothing els but write, yet should I
want space to reckon vp the number of the dead
inhabitantes, that this playne possessed. Cruell
<hi>Accident</hi> woundeth, <hi>Debilitie</hi> ouerthroweth,
and <hi>Atropos</hi> in her forest geueth them free
campe, and there all humane creatures do ende
their lyues. For so victorious is the violent
hand of <hi>Consuming Death,</hi> that whatsoeuer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
buyldeth and maketh, he breaketh and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solueth;
and from this lot, no mortall creature
is free.</p>
            <p>Herewith <hi>Memorie</hi> seeing me at these tragical
sightes oppressed with exceeding sadnesse, with
a chearefull countenance bad me not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed:
For, <hi>Feare,</hi> quoth she, befitteth not a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:8635:33"/>
minde: but yf you will folow my aduise,<note place="margin">Feare befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minde.</note>
take with you a magnanimious resolution, to
die constantly, and with patience, and so to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your soule, that it may not be subiect to a
seconde death, but rather be receyued into that
euerlasting ioy, where it shall liue eternally in
glorious rest. And therewith leading me into
an inner mansion, and enterteining me still
with good and vertuous counsell, I tolde her,
that though my cause of <hi>Feare</hi> were greater
then any hope of <hi>Comfort,</hi> yet in fine, come
what woulde, I was resolued to proue the vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoydable
aduenture, let lyfe or death ensue, as
vnto the diuine Almightinesse should be most
pleasing. Of which my so resolued courage, she
did conceiue such liking, that she offered her
selfe to be my guyde; which I thankfully accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and without delay, she tooke her Palfrie,
and bad me follow her.</p>
            <p>Such was the speede we made, that of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
before I was well aware, we were arriued
neere the fatall place, where the cruell dreadfull
combat, to which I hasted, was to be ended and
determined.</p>
            <p>At our verie arriuall, I heard a great noyse and
clattering of men and armour, as though it had
bin of some well fought Turney, or warlike
iusting: but the sounde thereof seemed rather
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8635:33"/>
plaintfull and discomfortable, then signifiyng
any pleasant triumph.</p>
            <p>Approching neerer, I might see certaine
great letters of Golde,<note place="margin">Letters of gold engrauen in afaire table at the entry of the forest of Atropos.</note> ingraued in a fayre regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
or table of Stone, conteyning these follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
wordes. <hi>Heere all vayne worldly deuises, and
the life of all humane Creatures maketh an ende.</hi>
This is the dolorous passage, where the strength,
beautie, wysedome, puissance, and valour of
mankinde is vanquished and ouerthrowen.
<hi>Atropos</hi> is Ladie of this place, who maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
heere in garrizons two mightie Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whose incomparable valour hath bereaued
of lyfe all those that euer liued in the worlde
heretofore, and shall do the like with those that
liue at this present. <hi>Accident</hi> commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
the fight, against whose sundry strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems,
and strange kindes of fight, no worldly
strength preuayleth: but yf at any time he
chaunce to misse, then commeth the Prince of
sorow, called <hi>Debilitie,</hi> whose heauie comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
blow, no Armour of proofe withstandeth:
So that heere in fine all humane flesh endeth,
leauing to the worlde their possessions, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
pursuites, and fonde desires, wherein while
they lyued they did set such pleasure, flattering
them selues with a foolish conceipt of longer
enioying them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8635:34"/>
But hearing a great rumor &amp; noyse within the
Steccada, I stayed no longer heere, but got me
to the listes, where I found a great number of
people assembled to beholde a strange &amp; dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

there was a great whispering and confused

            <p>

               <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Burgundie,</hi>
of all our Westerne worlde the greatest Duke:
his right hande was armed with a Lance of
<hi>Stayed aduice.</hi> The fayre enameled bosse of his
guylded Target, represented the <hi>Great prayse,
the many Freendes,</hi> and <hi>powerfull dominions,</hi> that

<pb facs="tcp:8635:35"/>
               <hi>Trueth, Bounty, Constancie,</hi> and <hi>Courage:</hi>
And finally, his Mace was of <hi>Firmenesse</hi> against
all aduersities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Debilitie</hi> was neuer at any time fuller of feare,
then now, at the constant behauiour of this gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
enemie, and therefore threw at him a farre
off a dart, headed with so <hi>Manie troubles,</hi> that it
had bin able to haue daunted and ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
the greatest courage liuing. But the gentle
Duke opposed him selfe with so <hi>Quiet</hi> &amp; <hi>Vnble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished

an encounter, that he made him to stagger.</p>
            <p>Each of them shewed the vttermost of his

whether of them should be superior.</p>
            <p>

So that as the fight was fierce and vehement,
so was it in a maner doubtfull betweene them.
<hi>Memorie</hi> seemed to hope, that the Duke should
escape victorious: But the <hi>Destinies</hi> were against
it, and the <hi>Eternall ordinance of the Almightie:</hi>
For in the ende, <hi>Debilitie</hi> thrust the noble Duke
into the Lungs with a deadly <hi>Consumption,</hi>
assayling him besides with many a fierce blow
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8635:35"/>
of other infirmities, so that though he were him

all his force, he strake with so violent a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarre,</hi>
that downe fell the magnanimous Duke
breathlesse, and with him the glorie of our age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Atropos</hi> in so heauie a case (all the hartes of
the beholders els throbbing, and their eyes wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping)
made no other reckoning, then as it were
a Maygame, ful of laughter and scorne, no whit
at all respecting his great honor, estate, and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
nor the worldes generall sorow for the
losse of so excellent a Prince.</p>
            <p>The Heralds at armes laide ouer the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
a rich embrodered Herse, garnished rounde

the same vnto the noble Mansion of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie:</hi>
where, with sacred Obits, and sumptuous
Funeralls, it was most solemnly enterred: as for
his blessed soule, I trust in Gods mercie, that it
is now glorified with celestiall ioyes, free from
hauing hence foorth any more to do eyther
with <hi>Debilitie,</hi> or <hi>Accident.</hi>
            </p>

when we might heare a new rumor and

first was <hi>Accident,</hi> who in terrible gesture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb facs="tcp:8635:36"/>
himselfe armed and fierce on horsebacke
in the fielde. His Horse was caparasoned with
<hi>Arrogance neuer tempered,</hi> his Lance of <hi>Vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
his Harnesse of <hi>Ire,</hi> his Sword, with which
he hath ouerthrowen millions of men, of <hi>Ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening
boldnesse,</hi> and his Mace, with which he
vsually ouerturns those that are in best liking
with themselues, of <hi>Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out comes against him, like <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Hercules</hi>
enraged,<note place="margin">Charles Duke of Burgundie surnamed the hardie.</note> great <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> the most fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
&amp; aduenturous Prince that liued in his age,
who alwayes made <hi>Reason</hi> attende vpon his <hi>Wil,</hi>
(which yet neuer was vnuertuous, though to
him selfe some times domageable.) His Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
was <hi>Fiersenesse,</hi> euerie peece of his Armour
tempered in <hi>True courage,</hi> his Lance of <hi>High
endeuour,</hi> his Sworde of <hi>Mindes greatnesse,</hi> and
his Dagger of <hi>Incredible munificense;</hi> And surely,
yf we will rightly iudge of this worthy Prince,
there was not any vertue that he had not in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
neither was there any vice, with which
the nobilitie of his minde was spotted, vnlesse
selfewill, and ouer-greatnesse of courage, be to
be called vice.</p>
            <p>Where this feelde was fought, was neither
tent nor pauilion, but only shrubbes &amp; brushes.
The encounter began with great clashing and
noyse of armour. Great was the furie of either
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8635:36"/>
Champion, and great the fiersenesse of their first
onset, either of them deadly and despitefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
the destruction of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accident</hi> like a tempest or whirlewinde,<note place="margin">The Duke three times ouerthrowen by the D. of Lorayne and Swyssers, and lastly slaine at the battaile of Naneie in the yeere. 1476.</note> with
such vnresistable puissance so encountred the
Duke three times, that he ouerthrew him to the
ground, and yet vndid him not; for still in his
greatest disgrace, vndismayed, he made head
againe, with greater and more reuengefull reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
then before. Yet such was the hurt of
these vnfortunate encounters, that not only the
Duke, but his whole house, estate, &amp; countrey,
was thereby greatly weakoned.</p>
            <p>But now was the fight growen to that heate
of furie betweene them,<note place="margin">Campobache an Italian Counte, chiefe leader of the D. horse, and of especial cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite about him, had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the D. of Loraine to betray his maister, which most Iudas-lyke he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at this battell before Nancie.</note> that it amazed the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.
The Duke being full of magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
wrath, &amp; resolued to die, or to be victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
spared no meanes or wayes he might to
greeue his aduersarie, who strake him a mightie
blow with his Pollax of <hi>Conspiracie,</hi> geuen
him by <hi>Fortune,</hi> therewith to ende the lyfe of
him, whom manly and equall vertue neuer
coulde haue vanquished: Yet still the fearelesse
Duke mainteined valiantly the place, though
<hi>Fortune,</hi> and all the worlde els, had forsaken
him, till at last, <hi>Accident</hi> with vnworthy handes,
doubling a downright blow vpon him, bare
him, for whom the earth while he liued was too
<pb facs="tcp:8635:37"/>
litle, slaine and sencelesse to the earth: who as all
his life time he had bin great and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
so was his valorous ending, euen to his hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
enemies, admirable. God I hope of his
infinite goodnesse, will there graunt rest and
quietnesse to his soule, which heere his body so
much abhorred.</p>
            <p>If warre be to be praised as an honorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
then great ought your sorow to be, ò
souldiors, for the losse of such a prince, whose
like in that profession neuer liued any: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
al this incomparable losse, it doth
not a little comfort me, in that it is to the whole
worlde notorious, that he was not ouercome by
any that were worthy of such a conquest, but
onely through the diuine power &amp; permission,
by which fortune holdeth in her handes, and
handleth at her pleasure, all humane woorkes.</p>
            <p>For the sentence, permission, decree, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
iudgment of the heauens, farre exceedeth
our science, deceyueth our knowledge, and
maketh vaine our wisedome.</p>
            <p>If a man liue in this world fortunately,<note place="margin">The vayne instabilitie of the worldes iudgemne.</note> and
possesse what so his hart desireth, then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
opinion is, that he is an happy man, &amp; was
borne in a good houre: but if by aduerse fortune
he afterwardes chaunce to become poore, and
afflicted with aduersities, miseries, or losse of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8635:37"/>
honor, then euery one crieth out, that he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
&amp; that it is pitie that euer he was borne.</p>
            <p>To auoyde therefore these inconueniences,
and vncertainties of the worlde,<note place="margin">The surest anker is to trust onely in God.</note> let euery mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
creature turne him selfe with a pure and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
minde vnto the eternall creatour of all
things, to whom both heauen and earth are
obedient, and then shall he be assured, that
there shalbe no errour in his course; neither,
being ankered vppon so sure a rocke, shall he
neede to depende on the vaine fleeting blastes
of worldly so soone deceyued opinions.</p>
            <p>In fine, though <hi>Accident</hi> victoriously trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
ouer this famous Prince, yet neuer in any
age shall the glorie and valorous endeuours of
great <hi>Charles</hi> be forgotten, whose vncompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
valour and magnanimitie, all nations and
histories haue beautified with the surname of
<hi>Hardie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, though with tearefull eyes, yet shal
my penne proceede and leaue the wofull storie
of this worthy Duke vnto some happier writer,
whose muse may be glorified with so great a
subiect. <hi>Accident</hi> presently thirsting after a new
pray, put on his armour of deepe-pirceing <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,</hi>
and with a sharp grounded Iauelin of
<hi>Misfortune,</hi> leapt out into the high way, putting
to his side a Sword of <hi>Sodaine griefe,</hi> which only
<pb facs="tcp:8635:38"/>
hath shortened the life of many worldly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
but to make the matter more speedy, his
Dagger was of <hi>Secret melancholy,</hi> which being
ioyned to <hi>Sickenesse,</hi> were able to consume a
marble.</p>
            <p>With this there began a musique so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
so variable, sweete, and delicious, that
it rauished with delight the hearers. To-wardes
the which, as the people ioyfully flocked, to
know whence, or from what cause the same did
proceede, they might beholde a Litter that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched,
supported by two milke-white Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes,
of which the one was <hi>Perfect bountie,</hi> and
the other <hi>Sweete demeanour.</hi> The riches, orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and sumptuousnesse of this Litter, was
such, that it exceeded all estimation. The Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes
were guyded by foure Princes: the first,
good <hi>Fame,</hi> the seconde, <hi>Flower of Youth,</hi> the
thirde, <hi>Noblenesse of Hart,</hi> and the fourth,
<hi>Disdayne against villanie,</hi> and all foure linked
togeather by <hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Straight folowed a great troupe of Caual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie,
and withal a companie of so choyce, fayre,
and beautifull Ladies, as though each one had
bin selected and chosen out of the greatest
Courtes of the worlde.</p>
            <p>But now it is time to say somewhat of that
royall personage that came within this sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8635:38"/>
Litter, though to touch rightly her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
be farre beyond the compasse of mine,
or any mortall penne.</p>
            <p>It was a glorious young Princesse, armed at
all peeces, and resolued there in that passage, to
shew her power where she had receyued her
griefe. In her seeming one woulde haue dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
her to be a very <hi>Penthesilea,</hi> that came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
the death of <hi>Troyan Hector.</hi> But cruell
and vnhappie <hi>Destinie,</hi> had conspired her ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>
            <p>Her Harnesse was of <hi>Contentment,</hi> her head
was armed with <hi>Vertuous Thought,</hi> therwith the
better to defende her selfe in this dangerous
conflict. Her Sworde was <hi>Desire to do well,</hi> sharpe
and well poynted, wherewith she came deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to reuenge the wronges that had bin of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
her: Her Dart was of <hi>Debonairnesse,</hi> and
her Shielde of <hi>Faythfull vnspotted Loue,</hi> neuer to
be altered.<note place="margin">Mary, onely daughter and heire to Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les D. of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, and wise to the Archduke Maximilian who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes Emperour.</note> Her vpper garment was wrought,
and rounde about adorned with thousandes of
vertues, who finding her pure soule free from all
euilles, had therein made their quiet and blessed
mansion.</p>
            <p>This excellent Ladie, as <hi>Loyaltie</hi> her Heralde
at armes in loude speeches proclaymed, was
<hi>Marie,</hi> the great and puissant Archduchesse of
<hi>Austria,</hi> worthie of the worldes gouernment.
<pb facs="tcp:8635:39"/>
               <hi>Accident</hi> stoode all this while trembling, to see
so imcomparable a beautie, ioyned with so ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
a courage, woondring that those many
excellent rare partes and vertues, shoulde be all
so viuely vnited in a young Princesse of three
and twentie yeeres, whereas they are rare and
scarce to be founde in the many setled yeeres of
longer ages. But <hi>Furie,</hi> his trustie Counsayler,
seeing his amazement, bade him be of good
courage, for the victorie shoulde assuredly be
his, if so be he would folow his counsell: which
was, that he shoulde not assay her with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
weapon or stroke, then onely of a deepe
<hi>Hart-Sorow,</hi> which the gentle temper of her wel
framed minde not enduring, he was assured,
would soone ouerthrow her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accident</hi> folowed his aduise, and ashamed
of his former fayntnesse, with a cruell <hi>Vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
gaue her so deepe a <hi>Sorowes-wounde,</hi> and
thereupon a feruent <hi>Ague,</hi> that the gentle Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
loosing by degrees the perfection of her
beauties, though she apposed her vertues in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
was finally vanquished and taken out
of this vnworthy worlde, in prime of her yeeres
and beautie; leauing behinde to vs, nothing but
griefe, heauinesse, and compassion, though
God wot, bootelesse sorow, and weeping teares,
be of small effect and moment, to equall so
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8635:39"/>
great an occasion.</p>
            <p>Thus now hath cruell <hi>Accident</hi> taken from vs
our rarest iewell, that precious <hi>Palladium,</hi> which
while <hi>Burgundie</hi> enioyed, it reigned in all pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie
and happinesse: But now alas, the name
of that noble house is finished, and <hi>Death</hi> hath
taken away this excellent Lady, whose glorie
shall yet liue heere eternally, and her soule there
I hope in endelesse blisse.</p>
            <p>This was shee that refreshed our langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
spirites, and comforted our former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresfull
calamities, as <hi>Troilus</hi> did, who with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and courage bare vppon his shoulders the
burden of besieged <hi>Troy,</hi> when <hi>Hector</hi> fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
And if heauen would haue graunted vs so
much happinesse, as to haue left vs onely her
aliue, we should haue bin able to haue suffered
and endured whatsoeuer els could haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But what I might thinke, and what griefe
might be mine, let the compasionate Reader
iudge, seeing in so short a space, three Princes
dead, whom I serued, and had such cause to loue
and honour. I was brought vp young, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
in their court. They were alwayes my
shelters against all tempestes, stormes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities:
But alas, there is none now lefte to
shelter me from sorow.</p>
            <p>But returning to my discourse, at the ende
<pb facs="tcp:8635:40"/>
of the combat, when I had seene the death of
these three my so dearly honored soueraignes,
my eyes being drowned with teares, and my
soule with sorow, vnwilling to ouer-liue so
great a desastre, I pulled downe my beuer, and
dreadlesse and carelesse what might happen,
nor looking nor fearing who came against me, I
rushed into the listes, defying my aduersaries,
to come both, or one, or how they listed, or
dared. <hi>Memorie</hi> seeing me thus altred, feared
least I had bin troubled with some passion of
<hi>Despaire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Author offereth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat to the champion of Atropos.</note> and therefore willed me to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende
my selfe vnto God; which I did, and
constantly attended the comming of my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.
But by and by came vnto me a felow like
a Heralde, of litle stature, with a blazon of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation,
his name was, <hi>Sommons.</hi> Great <hi>Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi>
saith he,<note place="margin">The messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or poursui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropos called Sommons.</note> that heere gouerneth, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
me to tell thee, that thy houre is not
yet come, and therefore willeth thee to stay, till
thou be called; which shall not be long first.
In the meane time rest contented, for there are
now many other combats to be determined
of greater worth, and among the rest, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of fiue famous aduenturers:<note place="margin">The combats of fiue famous aduenturers.</note> whose names

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8635:40"/>
are not to be reuealed, yet for this once I
will satisfie thy request.</p>
            <p>Know then, that these fiue dismall conflictes
I speake off heere to be tryed, are such, that the
onely thinking of them breedeth an astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
terrour both to <hi>Atropos</hi> and her Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
who hearing of the victorious conquestes
that are, and shalbe, by these excellent aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
atchiued, are fore-possessed with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
feare and amazement. I will therefore tell
thee first, what each of the aduenturers is, and
then how prepared and armed they will come
to this the last combat that euer they shall
make. And do not thinke that I do fable with
thee, in telling thee of things to come:
for I doe certeinly assure thee, that the euent
shalbe as I doe tell thee: for <hi>Atropos</hi> is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the <hi>Destinies,</hi> who haue discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the whole vnto her. But because it greeueth
me exceedingly to see thee so sorowful and sad,
I would yeeld willingly some comfort to thy
perplexed minde. And this assure thy selfe, the
heauens doe neuer denie consolation to the
comfortlesse and distressed. As for the three
ended princes, whose vntimely deaths haue
brought thee to such excessiue and immoderate
sorow, and these other, with the particularitie of
whose combats I haue promised to acquaint
<pb facs="tcp:8635:41"/>
thee, they shall leaue behind them such and so
noble a succession, that their losse shalbe to the

               <note place="margin">Sommons doth reueale vnto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Destinies, wonderfully among the rest foretelling the greatnesse of Queene Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths glorie</note> who among the rest of his
royal issue, shal leaue one so excellent a daughter,
&amp; so highly of the heauens blessed, that besides
the glorifying of the frozen poles, and the fiery
equinoctials with the trophes of her inuincible
armes, such shalbe the worldes wonder, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of her vertue, that the greatest kings,
princes, and estates of the worlde, shall thinke it
the greatest happinesse that may befall them, to
be shrowded vnder the faire spreading wings
of her Imperious gouernment, some of them
falling downe at her sacred feete, and flying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>
               <hi>Accident</hi> vnderstanding the arriuall of this

of cruell <hi>Chaunce,</hi> of a hard and vnpenetrable

against which no bountie or valour is able to

though I must needes accomplish the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement

in citing and summoning vnto this feared pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
all humane creatures, yet can I not dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
my thoughts of an infinitenesse of sorowe,
in that I must be constrained to be a meane of so
soone shortening the life of this exellent Prince,
depriuing his people and subiectes of such a
treasure, as they shall neuer be able to recouer.</p>
            <p>He shall enter the listes armed onely with his

make him so renowmed and glorious. But dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainefull
<hi>Fortune,</hi> enuiyng the worldes happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
shall take him away in the sweetest time of
his life, shewing vs thereby a faire example of
the vnsecure estate, ficklenesse, and instabiltie, of

            <p>His horse shalbe <hi>Frankenesse,</hi>

His heralde at armes, cald <hi>Beloued of all,</hi>
shall with loud proclamation bidde giue place
vnto this notable prince, whose like for loueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
was neuer in the worlde, no not <hi>Titus Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian,</hi>

Fierce shalbe the first encountre of these
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8635:43"/>
two puissant warriors. But <hi>Accident</hi> fearing the
daunger of <hi>Delay,</hi> considering the vndaunted
valour of his aduersarie, shall employ euen at
one instant the very vttermost of his force, and
therewith shal so mortally wound him, with the
feruent blow of a <hi>Continuall burning feuer,</hi> that
not able to resist so great a violence, this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
prince, shall yeeld the spoile of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
youth, to the crueltie of victorious <hi>Death,</hi>
whose dayes did worthyly deserue to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

of his rare vertues be adorned. But merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<hi>Atropos,</hi> therby to encrease the terror of her
name, shall cut a sunder his threed, when it was
not a quarter wouen, filling the world with such
a sorow, as it neuer before had tasted.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Accident,</hi> toiled with the greatnesse
of these his former conquestes, shal quit for this
time the place, and ordeine <hi>Debilitie</hi> in his steed
to manteine the field, telling him of a mightie
arriuing King, with whom he must encounter,
willing him by any meanes to looke wel to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and to the surenesse of his armour, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that the enemie, with whom he shall haue
to do, shalbe second to none of the worlde in

his actions prosperous: his sword <hi>Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

dimme the worldes lyght, by taking away this

them both with this assurance, that though this
were the greatest and most redoubted enemie
that euer they encountred, yet they shoulde not

decree of Heauen, had ordeyned him to death:
neuerthelesse she shall aduise them to arme them

            <p>Heerewith being somwhat encouraged,

Prince that shal encounter them.</p>
            <p>And now, euen like the roring Ocean against

his warrlike instruments approch with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable

ensheathed in a faire scabbard of <hi>Mercie,</hi> out
of which he shall neuer draw it, but when he

him. The eyes and hartes of al the worlde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fixed, and attentiuely bent, vpon the sequel
of this admirable combat.</p>
            <p>In fine, the Heraldes hauing commaunded si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
&amp; the Trumpets sounded the cruel notes

shal with a thundring carrere, so represse the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
therof, that the blow in steede of harming
him, shal erect new Trophees to his honour.
Then shal he throw at the fearelesse Prince his
dartes of <hi>Treason</hi> and secret <hi>Conspiracies:</hi> but he
vnsheathing his excellent Sworde, shall turne
the danger thereof aside, and make frustrate the
force thereof, so that the smart and peryll shall
returne to his enemies.</p>
            <p>But then twise wounded <hi>Accident</hi> enraged,
and betweene feare and furie desperate, shall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8635:48"/>
strike the triumphant King so cruel a blow with
his Sworde of <hi>Distemperature,</hi> that though styll
remayning in courage inuicible, yet shall he
in his health and strength, finde him selfe greatly
impayred: Neuerthelesse, drawing the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his body vp to the worthynesse of his
mynde, he shall enforce him selfe styll to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne

magnanimous resolution, couering him selfe
with his Target) enrich the earth with the noble
burden of his fallyng body, and the heauens
with his freed soule, empouerishing onely the
worlde; whose griefe for his losse shalbe such, as
though, the greatest pyller thereof being gone,
it coulde not but attende a speedie ensuing
downefal and ruine.</p>
            <p>But herewith as <hi>Sommons</hi> woulde haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in his wofull hystorie, I feeling my very
soule ouerburdened with an insupportable
greatnesse of sorow, entreated him to spare my
alredie enough miserable eares, and not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
them with hearing of further tragedies, but
<pb facs="tcp:8635:49"/>
yf euer he would do me pleasure, then to shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the time of my prolonged combat.</p>
            <p>For alas, what shoulde I, miserable wretch
that I am, desire to lyue, or wherein should life
be sweete vnto me, seeing the glorious lights of
the worlde so soone extinguished: no vertue, no
wysedome, no loue, no honour, no beautie, no
conquest, no nobilitie, no goodlinesse, no scepter,
no force, no prayer, being able to stay the
stryking hand of vnmercifull DEATH.</p>
            <p>Whereunto <hi>Sommons</hi> replying, I had thought
fayd he, to haue reuealed vnto you two future
Combats more, of two great and Princely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers:
The one, of the most valourous and
towardly young Prince of the worlde,<note place="margin">King Edward the. 6.</note> eldest
sonne and successor to this great <hi>Englysh King:</hi>
The beames of whose sayre rising Sunne, shall
no sooner begin to glimmer in our Orizon, but
they shall warme the whole worlde with his
loue.<note place="margin">Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> The other of his eldest daughter, lykewise
succeding him in the royall Diademe, who
wereby <hi>Accident</hi> both soone depriued of their
lyues, and dispossessed of their thrones. But
seeing thee alredie of apprehensiue of forow,
and afflicted with such extremitie of passion, I
will forbeare to perplex thy eares with any
farther griefe: yet woulde not I haue thee to
repine at the diuine ordinance. For though the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8635:49"/>
Almightie in his secrete iudgement shall thinke
good to depriue the worlde of these most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Princes: yet shal he not leaue it altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
desconsolate and abandoned: For he shal
blesse the perished Princes with successors of
such worthinesse, that lyke true heyres, as wel of
the Vertues, as Crownes of their predecessours,
they shal afresh brighten the worldes obscured
face, and with the goodly shyning of their wel
deserued glorie, returne the estate thereof into
the former blisfulnesse. But aboue all the rest,
so shall he ennoble the memorie of the late
Englysh Monarch, with so excellent and glorious
a DAVGHTER, that in her alone shalbe seene
vnited all the seuerally dispersed Vertues that
made so glorious the forenamed Princes, in so
much that all the worlde with one agreeing
consent, shal proclayme her to be the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Princesse that euer lyued. And,<note place="margin">The prophesie of the Deste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Elizabeth the Queene of England.</note> which
is a thing not of the lightest consideration, but

Fortune contende with Vertue, but, contrarie to
her nature, lyke a submisse and willing Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayde,
attende vpon her noble desires, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
effecting them, yea, sometimes in things
most rare and marueylous. Likewise, there shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
so sweete a consent, &amp; so fit a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb facs="tcp:8635:50"/>
the great richesse of her minde, and the
fayre ornaments of her body; that as the one
shal atteine to the height and perfection of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
wisedome, temperance, iustice, and all
other diuine vertues wherewith a royall minde
should be garnished, so shall the other in goodly

            <p>And to make vp the full poynt of her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as she shal both in rules of gouernment,
and vertue of gouerning, serue to all Christian
Princes as an excellent Paterne and example,
preseruing her Subiectes in a quiet estate, full of
reposefull blessednesse, when round about her,
some through the tyranous exactions of their
Prince, and some through the vnskilful gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Prince, and some through his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent

say, shall by her princely care, and prudent fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
maynteine her Subiectes in this calme se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie

            <p>But which is strangest, comming to the royal
Diademe, in the fayre youthful spring of her
virgins yeeres, she shall finde the estate of her
Realme diuided in faction, differing in religion,
and through the troubles of the late preceeding
gouernement, exceedingly discontented: All
which inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences, being by the vnfortunate
successe of the former gouernment (wherein
the Sworde was more employed then the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
styrred vp, and in apparance tending to
some feareful and dangerous issue, she shal with
the sweete breathing gale of her well tempered
<hi>Mildnesse,</hi> so pacifie, alay, and vtterly extinguish,
that she shal reduce her Subiectes from the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
degree of constreyned feare, to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

            <p>Neither shall her inuincible armes in iustly

            <p>To recount vnto you the seuerall egregious
victories that shee shall giue, both by sea and
land, to the most fierce and warlike nations that
then shall possesse the world, were fitter for the
large relation of a Chronicle, then this my short
discourse: But this I assure you, they shalbe
such, as I know not whether any antiquitie can
bring forth the like.</p>
            <p>In fine, her Kingdome shalbe the secure Haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of <hi>Afflicted Princes,</hi> her Purse the royall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of <hi>Distressed Kings,</hi> and her powerfull
Armes, the yoking bridle of <hi>Ambitious Tirants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Princely magnificence of her
Court, her well expressed iudgement in the
election of graue and honorable <hi>Counseylors,</hi> her
well employed rewardes on those that shalbe
<hi>Vertuous</hi> and of merite, her bountifull liberalitie,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8635:51"/>
and gratious enterteinment of <hi>Strangers,</hi> her
learning, languages, and skilfulnesse in royall
knowledge of such artes and secrets as to her
estate are fitting, so vnable is my feeble speeche
to aspire vnto the heigth of their worthynesse,
that forbearing to speake of things so farre aboue
my reach, I know no better way then to couer
them vnder the vaile of silence, leauing the
large campe of her prayses, to the excellent wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of that age wherein shee shall floorish, her
rarenesse being such, that she shall with the
highnesse of her vertue, drawevp (as the heate
of the Sunne doth vapours from the earth) the
excellent wittes of her time to so high a pitch,
that the following ages among millions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
noble workes penned in her praise, shall as
much admire the writer, but farre more the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of the fairie Queene, as euer former ages
did <hi>Homer</hi> and his <hi>Achilles,</hi> or <hi>Virgill</hi> and his
<hi>Aeneas,</hi> such worthy, rare, and excellent matter,
shall her matchlesse and incomparable vertue
yeelde them to ennoble their pennes, &amp; to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalize
their fames.</p>
            <p>As for me, hauing now made you acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the former Combats, of which I made
you promise, though I haue in their recital per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
seemed somewhat prolixe, yet yf you
wil consider the perticularitie of the mentioned
<pb facs="tcp:8635:52"/>
Princes, I feare you shall rather haue occasion
to blame my breuitie. Hauing now, as I say, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
your desire, and that truely without abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or deceipt, I wil now take my leaue of you,
because <hi>Atropos</hi> standeth in neede of my seruice.
As for your Combat, neuer trouble your selfe
with vrging it farther, for I wil, doubt you not,
sommon you thereunto in time, and therefore
I would wish you euen now to make yourselfe
redie, seeing the houre thereof cannot be but at
hande. At the ende of these speeches, he tooke
his leaue of mee, and departed, leauing mee in a
strange confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, betweene sorow of that which
was past, &amp; wonder of that which was to come,
my onely comfort being to thinke of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
and golden age, wherein the branches of
these deceassed Princes shal liue, especially that
excellent &amp; matchlesse Empresse of the Ocean.</p>
            <p>Herewith <hi>Memorie,</hi> that had all this while at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely
listened vnto these passed tragicall
discourses, seeing me still perseuer in my pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuenesse,
vsed her best endeuours to comfort
me, and requested me, seeing I had such prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and respite of time graunted me, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
and to take my lodging with her, whyther
she would cause the olde hermite <hi>Vnderstanding</hi>
to be sent for, of whom I might take good and
firme counsayle against the doubtfull issue of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8635:52"/>
this dangerous Combat, which now of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was shortly to betide me. I willingly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her gentle offered enterteinement, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
my Horse, was contented to folow her.</p>
            <p>By the way, she perceiuing my minde to
be ouer-pressed with heauie and melancholy
thoughtes, endeuoured to remooue me from
those sorowfull apprehensions, by recording
vnto me many passed pleasing Histories and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories,<note place="margin">He returneth to the mansio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Memorie.</note>
moralizing them all vnto my good and
comfort: So that passing on the way without
tediousnesse, we were soone arriued at her
mansion: whither <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> the good Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite
was sent for;<note place="margin">He is there visited by Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</note> who redie, and duetifull at
her commandement, was in my Chamber at
my bedside so soone as the dawning of the next
morning appeared.</p>
            <p>I exceedingly reioyced at his comming, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I knew him to be a counsayler voyde of
al fraude, and ful of vertuous consolation, graue
in his iudgement, and sounde in his aduise:
God be thanked for his goodnesse, that gaue me
happinesse to haue his acquaintance, and grace
to bende my minde to folow the direction of
his counsayles. After many mutuall congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
betweene vs, he began to instruct me
with many lessons, all teaching the way how to
liue and die well: in which two onely poynts
<pb facs="tcp:8635:53"/>
consisteth all the height and excellence of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.<note place="margin">Wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the height of wisedome.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First quoth he, who so euer he be that is to
combat either within List, Barrier, or Steccada,
he ought well to consider as well the qualitie of
his owne forces, as of those of his enemie, and
according thereunto to make his prouision of
furniture and defence.</p>
            <p>For rashly to enter vnprouided vnto so great
an enterprise, as it coulde not be but to the body
dangerous, so it woulde be to the soule doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
of which, whosoeuer maketh a carelesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
may well be tearmed miserable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie.</p>
            <p>And although that whosoeuer is honorably
chalenged to single combat, may make choyce
of his weapons, besides certaine other priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that he hath both of time and place: yet
such is the necessitie and streight limitted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of this your fight,<note place="margin">Death often striketh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warning.</note> and <hi>Atropos</hi> your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie
so full of dishonorable aduantages, that
he will not geue you so much as warning when,
or where he meaneth to assayle you, whether
by water or by land, whether in desart or in
playnes,<note place="margin">Nothing so vncertaine as the houre of a mans death.</note> whether in your bed or vppon your
horse, but perchaunce euen surprise you of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
when you shalbe prouided neither of
weapon, nor defence able to auaile you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:8635:53"/>
Considering therfore the neere approching
time of your combat,<note place="margin">And therfore nothing so behouefull as to be alwayes in a redinesse.</note> and withall the entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
stratagems and cautelous wily aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of your aduersarie, I would wishe you in
time to make prouision accordingly, and that
with such warie and heedefull circumspection,
that no sodainnesse be able to ouertake you;
which if you will follow these my instructions,
I doubt not, but you shall easily performe with
your endlesse honor and welfare.</p>
            <p>First let al your Harnesse be tempered in true
<hi>Repentance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What Armes are fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter death withall.</note> so fastly forged, and beaten with the
hammer, that no deadly sinne be able to teint
them, nor ougly vice haue power to pierce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Let your Vamplate be firmely steeled with a
firme resolued purpose to perseuer in <hi>Well-doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
seeking in all your actions, with a true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
zeale the seruice and glorie of God. Let
your Vambraces be of <hi>Vertuous Magnanimitie,</hi>
in not yeelding to fraile worldly pleasures: and
your Gantelets of perfect <hi>Charitie,</hi> shewing the
liuelinesse of your faith, in the operation of your
workes. Aboue all, let your Headpeece be of
<hi>Temperance;</hi> which though it be in the worlde a
vertue rarely founde, and litle set by, yet it is a
iewell most pretious, and will in this enterprise
highly stande you in steede. Let your Cuisses
be of patient <hi>Suffering,</hi> your Poldrones of
<pb facs="tcp:8635:54"/>
               <hi>Diligence,</hi> and your Greues of labour to do
<hi>Well.</hi> In this maner armed, and all the peeces of
your Armour combined togeather in <hi>Fayth,</hi>
such and so sure wilbe your foundation, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the blessed signe of the sacrament of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi>
in your forhead, that your speede cannot
be but good and glorious. But now seeing you
wel prouided of armes defensiue, I thinke it not
amisse to prouide you likewise of such as may
hurt, offende, and terrifie your enemie.</p>
            <p>Ordinarily whosoeuer is chalenged, may
choose to fight a foote or a horsebacke, as he
shal for his aduantage finde fittest. But so diffrent
is this your fight, from the nature of other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats,
that it is to be fought by your selfe alone,
and that on foote: neither, if it were otherwise,
would I haue you trust to your Horse, or to any
other helpe: But euen that you do, do it of your
selfe: I meane, in doing workes of <hi>Charitie,</hi> and
bestowing <hi>Almes</hi> for your soules health,<note place="margin">Good workes done by others after a mans death, nothing at al auailable</note> while
your selfe is liuing: for when you are dead,
small auaile will the good workes done by your
heires yeelde you; neither, as the worlde goeth,
will they be greatly carefull of any such perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
            <p>Alwayes prouided, that for the securer pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to the place appoynted, you take <hi>Baptisme,</hi>
whom at your birth you vowed neuer to denie,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8635:54"/>
for your Padrine.<note place="margin">Padrino in Spanish signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth him that goeth with his freende into the feelde, or doth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a iust or torney, with meaning to defende him from wrong. It signifieth also a Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> He will yeelde you valoure,
courage, and contentment, and to your enemie
terrour, sadnesse, and amazement, such and so
preheminent is the force of this excellent Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Let your Casting-dart be surely steeled
with a head of feruent <hi>Deuotion:</hi> your Speare
<hi>Remembrance</hi> of his <hi>Death,</hi> that with his <hi>Blood</hi>
redeemed you: your Dagger with a sharpe and
wel pearcing point, of a pure, vigorous, and true
catholique <hi>Faith:</hi> and your Targuet of vertuous
<hi>Example,</hi> witnessed by good <hi>Workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And seeing you want now nothing but a
Sworde, let the same be of <hi>Iustice,</hi> keene and wel
edged, doing vnto others, as you woulde be
done vnto your selfe. But especially, and aboue
all, looke as I said, that these your Harnesse and
Weapons, be without delay, yea, without the
losse of one moment, tempered by true and wel
grounded <hi>Repentance,</hi> who for such a conflict,
is of all others an armourer most excellent.</p>
            <p>Stande not vpon <hi>Inconueniences,</hi> nor be not
pulled backe with <hi>Worldly lets,</hi> nor terrified with
<hi>Charges,</hi> but be diligent, and looke well about
you: it is no matter of mine, it concerneth
yourselfe; neither is there any freende or kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the worlde, how deere soeuer vnto
you, that will, or may, fight this Combat for
you.</p>

            <p>Good father, quoth I, I hartely thanke you,
for these your so louing and zelous aduertis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which haue alredy taken so deepe an
impression in my minde, that I hope, through
Gods goodnesse, I shalbe able in some part to
execute and performe them.</p>
            <p>Yet because there must be a preparation; and
meane while, betweene this &amp; the time of my
Combat, I pray you tell me how I shoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
and exercise my selfe, to be the better able
to withstande the dreadfull approche of my
Death-bringing enemie. Nay quoth he, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there shalbe any meane while, or time of

Diuine prouidence: For, you may chaunce to
be sommoned, euen while you are now spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
Therefore, I wish you not to be vnreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
or long in preparing, but to put your selfe
presently in redinesse, seeing the thing, that by
delay you do put in hazarde, is no lesse then
the eternall weale, or woe of your soule: which
is, either to be glorified with blisfull and
euer-during ioyes, or els to be condemned to
the ragefull neuer-ceasing tormentes of hell
fire. Woebe vnto them, that making hereof but
a skoffe and iest, do hazarde so great a treasure as
their soule, vpon so hard a iumpe, as to delay
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8635:55"/>
preparation in so important a matter, especially
the time and sodainnesse thereof being so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine.</p>
            <p>Yet if it so fall out, that there be any space of
preparation or amendement (which the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the heauens graunt you) I would haue
you to spende the same in vertuous exercise and
practise of your fore-described weapons.</p>

               <note place="margin">How a man should exercise himselfe afore he commeth to the combat.</note> not onely with an outward wagging of

            <p>Good Father, quoth I, I finde great consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in your speeches: but now you haue tolde
me what maner of Armes I must vse, and what

            <p>You haue not made this demaunde,<note place="margin">The miserable estate of a man dying.</note> quoth

such shalbe in that perilous conflict the trouble

that it wilbe hard for you to retayne a

            <p>Therefore, reposing no trust or confidence

            <p>Thus did the reuerend Hermite, with zealous

perceyuing, willed me not to be dismayed, but

            <p>Whereuppon, I earnestly entreated him to
tell me, if there were not any certaine signes or

but being wounded &amp; ouerthrowen, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streined
to yeelde, and to leaue the young
Ladie as a rewarde to the victorie of <hi>Hercules:</hi>
who, rauished with extreamnesse of ioy, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with his beloued pray to his fathers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
was retarded by the ouerflowing of the
Riuer <hi>Euenus:</hi> about the shoares of which, as he
walked to see if he coulde finde any Foorde or
passage, he met with <hi>Nessus,</hi> a <hi>Centaure,</hi> who
bearing from the girdle vpwarde the shape of a
Man, and thence downwarde of an Horse, was
exceedingly enflamed with the loue of <hi>Deiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
and with an humble dissembled looke, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
so <hi>Hercules</hi> coulde make shift to swimme,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8635:61"/>
or passe the riuer himselfe, that he would vppon
his backe safely transport his Lady. <hi>Hercules</hi>
thankfully accepted his offer, committing vnto
him his fearfully trembling Lady, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off his quiuer and bowe to the farther side of
the riuer, betooke himselfe vnto the streame;
which hauing past, and taken vp againe his bow
and arrowes, he heard his Lady in lamentable
accent cry for helpe, with whom the trayterous
<hi>Centaure</hi> ran away with all possible speede: but
<hi>Hercules</hi> taking heedfully his leuell, pursued him
in such sort with an Arrow, that he strake him in
the chine of the backe a mortall wound, which
<hi>Nessus</hi> feeling, &amp; in the instant of death medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, gaue vnto <hi>Deianeira</hi> the shirt which
he ware, bestained and infected with his owne
blood, which issued out of his body mingled
with poyson, because the arrow with which he
was wounded, had bin by <hi>Hercules</hi> dipped in
the contagious blood of the serpent <hi>Hydra,</hi>
which shirte, he tould her, that if she should at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time send vnto her husband, when he should
be in loue with any other Lady, would reclame
his loue from the other to her alone. The Lady
receiued it, and with secrecie many yeeres did
keepe it as a iewell of rare and singular price. It
happened after, that <hi>Hercules</hi> amid his great vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
with fame of which he filled the world,
<pb facs="tcp:8635:62"/>
chaunced to beholde the admirable <hi>Iole,</hi> the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and most goodly virgin that the world in
that age affoorded: Her he honored and loued,
and at length obteined. The greefe of which, so
deeply wounded the gentle hart of <hi>Deianeira,</hi>
that neuer poore Lady liued more abandoned
ouer to sorow. One day it chaunced, that her
husbande, being to doe sacrifice to <hi>Iupiter</hi> vpon
the mountaine <hi>Ceneus,</hi> sent vnto her his faithfull
and trusty seruant <hi>Licas</hi> for certaine rich and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
garments, that of purpose he kept to were
at such times as he did sacrifice vnto the gods.
The innocent Lady sent him those superstitious
ornaments which he required, and withall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
herselfe of the dying <hi>Centaurs</hi> gift,
sent him by <hi>Licas</hi> the enuenomed shirt, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him for her sake to weare it: which he had no
sooner put on, but the venom so ragingly pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
euen to his very intrals, that thinking to teare
it of, he pulled therewith away great gobbets of
his owne flesh: and so furiously laying handes
vpon guiltlesse <hi>Licas,</hi> and tearing him to peeces,
bequeathing to his deare freend <hi>Philoctetes</hi> his
bowe and fatall arrowes, he threw himselfe into
a fire, which he had made vpon the mountaine
<hi>Oeta,</hi> and there sacrificed him selfe, which <hi>Deia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neira</hi>
hearing, after many detestations, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictions
of her selfe, concluded with a violent

of his renowne, demaunded by letters the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship,
suborning and brybing with money in
that behalfe sundry great personages in <hi>Rome:</hi>
but so formidable grew the report of his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
greatnes to the <hi>Romaine</hi> senate, that they sent
him worde, that if he would leaue his forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
and come vnarmed and peaceable to the

do, to holde him as an enemie to his countrie:

of theirs, and exceedingly enuying the
greatnesse of <hi>Pompeis</hi> glory, who bare the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
sway and gouernment at <hi>Rome,</hi> passed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
with his armie, and came still conquering

wrought such astonishment in <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,</hi>
with the greatest part of the Senatours and

<pb facs="tcp:8635:63"/>

him: he placed faire <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in the royall
seate; with whom he liued a while in amorous
delights, and had by her a sonne called <hi>Casario,</hi>
who was afterwardes murdered by <hi>Octauian:</hi>
thence, hauing taken order with matters of the
Orient, he returned in triumph to <hi>Rome,</hi> where
he vsed incredible liberalities to the people, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
his greatest enemies, and those that had
been sharpest in warre against him, yea, and
some of them he honored with great dignities:
as among others, <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> who were
both made Pretors. But so vnsure is the seat of
honor, especially being wrongfully vsurped,
that no folowing vertue can promise securitie to
him that therein sitteth: for, <hi>Caesar</hi> in the heigth
of his glory, when he knew no enemie to feare,
was of a sodaine ouertaken by a secret conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie
of his freendes, among which were also
<hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius;</hi> the first of which he loued so
well, that he had in his testament ordeined him
to be one of his heires; in fine, he was by them
inhumanely murdered in the senate house, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
vnder a piller whereuppon stoode the
statue of <hi>Pompie:</hi> he had receyued many aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements
of this conspiracie, but would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8635:63"/>
any, nor yet regarde the pitifull teares of
his wife <hi>Calphurnia;</hi> who the night before the
murder, dreamed that he was slaine and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in her armes: and therfore with al hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
on her knees besought him to stay at
home that day: which if he had done, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie
had been discouered, and hee deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of danger. To those that had warned him
hereof, he made answere, that he had rather once
aduenture all, then still to stande in feare, vsing
this Latine sentence, <hi>Satius est subire semel, quam
semper cauere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When his bodie was, according to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
rites, to be burned, <hi>M. Antonius</hi> made
his funerall oration, which he mingled with so
many passionate and pitifull speeches, and at
the conclusion therof, with weeping eyes shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his bloody shirt vnto the people, did so
stirre their mindes to so high a degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration,
that filling the ayre with lamentable

ranne about the towne, setting fire on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators

with the <hi>Persian</hi> ceremonie in honoring their
kinges: at which <hi>Alexander</hi> (who now accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his country maner vnciuill and barbarous,
and delighted exceedingly in the honors done
him by the <hi>Persians</hi>) was kindled with so great a
fury, that taking <hi>Cassander</hi> in his armes, he did
beate his head against the walles, rebuking him
with many bitter &amp; taunting checkes, &amp; did not
admit the excuses which he alleaged in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
behalfe; and withall grew into a great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and dislike both of <hi>Antipater</hi> and his two
sonnes <hi>Yolas</hi> and this <hi>Cassander:</hi> which <hi>Antipater</hi>
hearing, and therefore mortally fearing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> prepared a poyson of such
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8635:64"/>
deadly violence, that it could not in any thing
els be conteined then in the hoofe of an Asse.
At length <hi>Alexander</hi> after his innumerable
victories in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> hauing vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen
the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, vpon his returne,
allured with the delicacies of <hi>Babylon,</hi> betooke
himselfe there to quaffing and banqueting, and
to al maner of voluptuousnesse, geuing thereby
oportunitie to <hi>Yolas,</hi> to present him with the
deadly potion which his father had prepared:
which he had no sooner receiued, but that he
felt him-selfe seazed ouer his whole body with
an intollerable torment: yet such was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
greatnes &amp; vertuous courage of his minde,
that he neuer so much as once complained or
groned, but with an incredible courage, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
the rage of his inward horrible panges,

with her loue, that forgetting the lawes of

the Townes of <hi>Tenedos, Lesbos, Chryse,</hi> and
<hi>Lyrnessus,</hi> taking therein, among other Captiues,
two young Maidens of excellent and singular
beautie; the one called <hi>Briseis,</hi> and the other
<hi>Chriseida,</hi> daughter to <hi>Chriseis</hi> the Priest of
<hi>Apollo:</hi> Her he deliuered to <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<hi>Briseis</hi> to him selfe. But presently there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
a great and miserable mortalitie in the
Armie, which, as <hi>Calcas</hi> the Prophet assured
them, should neuer ceasse, till the daughter of
<hi>Apollos</hi> Priest should be restored. To which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie
of so faire and so beloued a pray, <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi>
would not by any meanes consent, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les

brooke that vnprincely and discourteous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde,
that with his sworde he woulde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8635:65"/>
haue slaine <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> had not he bin
by the other <hi>Greekish</hi> Peeres restrained: who,
what with sweete perswasions, and other practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
at length so much with him preuayled, that,
though extreamely against his will, they made
him deliuer his faire and dearely beloued <hi>Briseis</hi>
to the pleasure of the <hi>Greekish</hi> Emperour. But
when she was once gon, then began her absence
to strike and wounde his hart with so excessiue
a sorow, and deadly a discontentment, that full
of irefull melancholy, he retired him-selfe into
his Tent, refusing to come abrode to weare
Armes as he was accustomed, though euery day
he saw fierce <hi>Hector</hi> come murdering and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the <hi>Grecians,</hi> euen to their Tentes. Manie
meanes were made by the <hi>Greekish</hi> Lordes, to
remoue him from this setled and obstinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.
<hi>Agamemnon</hi> offered to returne
<hi>Briseis</hi> vntouched, with the interest of many
other rich presentes, but nothing preuailed: till
one day, as <hi>Hector</hi> came victoriously beating
downe the <hi>Greekish</hi> Quadrons, his deare freende
<hi>Patroclus</hi> thinking with the dissembled presence
of <hi>Achilles,</hi> to terrifie the <hi>Troian</hi> troupes, armed
him-selfe in the rich and gorgious Armour of
<hi>Achilles:</hi> but so cruell were his destinies, that at
his first entrie into the battayle, he was by <hi>Hector</hi>
encountred and slaine. Which cruell tidinges
<pb facs="tcp:8635:66"/>
had no sooner touched the eares of sorowfull
<hi>Achilles,</hi> but awaked with reuenge, forgetting all
other passions, he called for his Armour, and
like an enraged Lion, rushed into the thickest
of the <hi>Troians</hi> presse: in which verie instant, the
valiant <hi>Hector,</hi> disteyned in blood, and bathing
in swet, was with his immoderate toyle welnigh
sweltred in his Armour, so that he withdrew
him selfe out of the battayle, and by the Riuers
side disarmed him selfe, to refresh his spirites,
and to take a litle ayre: which <hi>Achilles</hi> percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
folowed him, and at vnawares, cruelly and
dishonorably ran him thorow with his Lance;
and not yet therewith satisfied, caused his body
with thonges to be tied to a Horse tayle, and so
in derision to be thrise trayned about the walles
of <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after it fell out, that either side being
weerie with the dayly turmoyles of Warres,
agreed vpon certaine dayes of truice, in which
meane time,<note place="margin">Achilles.</note> it might be lawfull for the <hi>Troians</hi>
to come into the <hi>Greekish</hi> Tents, and the <hi>Greekes</hi>
likewise to enter into <hi>Troy.</hi> Among the rest,
<hi>Achilles</hi> entring the Towne, chaunced one day
to espie young <hi>Polixene,</hi> daughter to K. <hi>Priam:</hi>
the sight of whose admirable beautie, did so
astonish him, that laying all hostilitie apart, from
thence forwarde meditated on nothing but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8635:66"/>
loue: which <hi>Priamus</hi> and <hi>Hecuba</hi> the Parentes
of the Virgin perceyuing, enterteined him with
hope, to the end that they might with the more
securitie entrap him, to which his often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre
thither, drawen with the violence of loue,
yeelded easie occasion: So that one day among
the rest, <hi>Paris</hi> still watching his steppes, slue
him with an Arrow in the Temple of <hi>Apollo.</hi>
In reuenge of which trecherous and vnnoble
acte, afterwardes when <hi>Troy</hi> was taken and rased,
his sonne young <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> slue <hi>Priamus</hi> with his

and disguysed with garments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenable
to his fortune, went first to the Isle of
<hi>Lesbos,</hi> to see his faire and deare <hi>Cornelia:</hi> who,

Sayle, arriuing in a poore Barke, and that not

coulde not bridle the extremitie of her pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but fallyng downe at his feete, with most
pittifull and passionate lamentations, imputing
this great aduersitie of her noble Husbande, to
<pb facs="tcp:8635:67"/>
his vnhappie mariage with her, did so intenerat
the manly hart of <hi>Pompey,</hi> that requesting her
not to increase his miseries with her sorow; he
coulde not refrayne his eyes from bursting out
into a riuer of vnused teares. But seeing the
speedie pursuite of his preuayling enemie gaue
him no leysure long to determine, he presently
departed thence, with his constant and most
vertuous <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and bended his course to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<hi>Egipt,</hi> no whit doubting but that young
<hi>Ptolome</hi> the K. woulde receyue him, with all
courteous enterteynment and gentlenesse, in
regarde of the infinite fauours which he had
done vnto his father. Comming neare the shore,
he aduertised the King of his approch, who was
then in <hi>Pelusium</hi> with his Armie, making warres
against his sister <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> The king was young,
and wholly gouerned by one <hi>Pothinus,</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odotus</hi>
a Rhetorician, who tolde him, that the
receipt of <hi>Pompey</hi> coulde not but be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and that there was not any way more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to winne the good grace of <hi>Caesar,</hi> then
by bereauing <hi>Pompey</hi> of life. To which vila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and dishonorable counsell, the youthfull
abused King yeelded his consent, and <hi>Achillas</hi>
and one <hi>Septimius</hi> that had sometime serued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Pompey</hi> in the warres, were sent to put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
this dishonorable and bloodie decree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:8635:67"/>
They came vnto the galley wherein <hi>Pompey</hi>
lay at ancher, and pretending the coast to be full
of flats and sandes, and not to haue water inough
for his galley, they prayed him to come into
their litle boat; to which <hi>Pompey</hi> agreed, though
much in his minde amazed at this slender and
honorles enterteinment. Discending out of the
galley, he tooke leaue of his louing <hi>Cornelia,</hi>
with speech and gesture as it were presaging his
ensuing desaster, who with eyes full of teares,
and handes vp to heauen, pursued him with
her lookes, till at length they were encountred
with so dismall and horrible an obiect, that if she
had not been by the Mariners restreined, she
had throwen her selfe into the sea: for when the
boat euen now touched the brinke of the shore,
as <hi>Pompey</hi> reached out his hande to his seruant
<hi>Philippus</hi> to helpe him to rise, <hi>Septimius</hi> thrust
him through the backe with a sword, and then
<hi>Achillas</hi> strake of his head (which nowe whyte
heares had made venerable) throwing his body
into the sea. Soone after, <hi>Caesar</hi> arriuing in <hi>Egipt,</hi>
was presented with this pitiful spectacle of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peys</hi>
head: But merciful &amp; magnanimous <hi>Caesar,</hi>
not enduring to beholde a sight of so great cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and horror, turned with a wofull gesture his
face, watring his eyes with an infinite aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of teares, shewing that he did abhorre
<pb facs="tcp:8635:68"/>
both the vnnoblenesse of the deede, and the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barousnesse
of the doers: <hi>Achillas</hi> and <hi>Pothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

he instituted the noble order of knighthood

which was about the latter end of the raigne of

he had the Lady <hi>Marie</hi> that inherited his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions:
and lastly <hi>Margaret,</hi> sister to <hi>Edward</hi>
the fourth, king of <hi>England.</hi> He was a Prince
that hated rest, and was altogether enclined to
vnquietnesse and warres. His father yet liuing,
he ouerthrew in a bloody &amp; cruel fought feelde
<hi>Lewes</hi> the. 11. king of <hi>France,</hi> at the battaile of
Montelhery in the yeere. 1465. with whom
making afterwards peace, he warred vpon those
of <hi>Lyege</hi> that had chased out of the towne their
Prince and Bishoppe being his kinseman, spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their countrie, and taking their townes, and
bringing them to such extremitie, that they
were constreined to receiue their Bishoppe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
&amp; withal to appease the Duke with great
summes of Money. Comming thence, there
fell out new occasion of warres betweene him
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8635:74"/>
and the <hi>French</hi> king; for pacification of which
differentes; it was agreed, that the king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, and he
should meete at <hi>Peronne,</hi> there to expostulat their
greefes in freendly sort one with another. And
that he should geue vnto the king a letter of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
vnder his hand and seale: which he did.
But the conclusion hereof was, that the Duke,
being aduertised how the King had by his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
secretly practised with those of <hi>Lyege</hi>
to rebell, tooke him prisoner, and led him with
him to the Citie of <hi>Lyege:</hi> which being by
streight confederation allyed to the King, he
caused, after all maner of rigorous crueltie exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
vpon the inhabitantes, to be saccaged and
burnt, and then vpon new agreementes, to his
owne aduantage, he dismissed the King.</p>
               <p>In the yeere. 1474. the olde Duke of <hi>Guilders,</hi>
being vilanously and vnnaturally taken by his
Sonne <hi>Adolph,</hi> and imprisoned in a dungion,
mooued sundry Christian Princes to compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
among the rest, <hi>D. Charles,</hi> who earnestly
laboured to make an attonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t betweene them:
but his sonne arrogantly refusing to heare of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification,
was by the D. of <hi>Burgundie</hi> retayned
in prison: whose father shortly after dying, gaue
his Dukedome by Testament to <hi>Duke Charles,</hi>
who tooke thereof vnder this title forcible pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
and those which are discended of him
<pb facs="tcp:8635:75"/>
do yet enioy it.</p>
               <p>Sweetned with this Dutchie, and aspiring to
greater matters in <hi>Germanie,</hi> he went &amp; besieged
the citie of <hi>Nuz,</hi> which was succoured by the
<hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Swissers</hi> vnder the conduct of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derike</hi>
the Emperour, so that he was constrained
to raise his siege: In despite of which assistance
geuen by the <hi>Swissers,</hi> he entred their Countrey
with his Armie, but was by them ouerthrowen
and vanquished at a place called <hi>Granson.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This day was the first of the Dukes misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
with which euen vntill his dying day he
was perpetually pursued. Encouraged with
which victorie, on euerie side new forces came
out of <hi>Germanie</hi> to the Armie of the <hi>Swissers,</hi> &amp;
the D. of <hi>Lorayne</hi> him selfe in person. Yet all this
dismayed not the D. of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> who hauing
refreshed his Armie, set vpon them the seconde
time at a place called <hi>Morat,</hi> but was as before
vanquished againe, and was constreyned to flie,
with the losse of. 8000. of his men slayne in the
Feelde. Presently the Duke of <hi>Lorayne</hi> marched

to the other side: the amazement of which, did
so terrifie the Duke of <hi>Burgundies</hi> Armie, being
twise alredie beaten and discouraged, that they
presently fledde, and the Duke him selfe was
found in the feeld slaine, &amp; mangled with many
