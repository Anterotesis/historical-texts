            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A MEMORIAL Delivered to the States General, BY THE Marqueſs of <hi>CASTELL MONCAYO,</hi> Envoy Extraordinary of <hi>Spain,</hi> at the <hi>HAGUE,</hi> 
               <date>
                  <hi>May</hi> 9th. 1684.</date>
            </head>
            <p>THE Marqueſs of <hi>Caſtell Moncayo,</hi> Envoy Extraordinary of <hi>Spain,</hi> doubts not but that your Lordſhips Deputies (which were preſent at the Conference held this Day by the Miniſters of the High Allies) have made a ſincere and true Report of that which was there debated: nevertheleſs, he hath thought fit to put in Writing that which was there repreſented by Diſcourſe; <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſaid Envoy Extraordinary of <hi>Spain</hi> was extreamly troubled and perplext, by reaſon he knew not whether or no he ought to concur in the ſame Sentiments with the Miniſters of the High Allies, or with thoſe of this State; without due Reflection on his Majeſties Pleaſure and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Affairs being tranſacted without regard to the Intereſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> or that which reſpects its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; without Concern for its Honour, or that which is due to the King thereof; Propoſals of a Peace or a Truce, and the partaging of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> being made in ſuch a manner, as if they belonged to the <hi>States-General,</hi> and not to his <hi>Catholick Majeſty.</hi> But having alſo conſidered that there were preſent at the aforeſaid Conferences, beſides your Lordſhips Deputies, the Miniſters of many other Princes and States, who ſeem cordially to embrace the Intereſts of his Catholick Majeſty, and who have the ſame Eſteem for the King his Maſter's Friendſhip, as the King his Maſter has for theirs: the ſaid ſubſcribed Envoy Extraordinary therefore is fully reſolved to underſtand the Opinion and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſaid Miniſters, though perhaps he may meet with a Mortification in deſiring the ſame thing from your Lordſhips Deputies; which Mortification will be the more intollerable to the ſaid ſubſcribed Envoy, by reaſon of the Lecture your Lordſhips Deputies have made of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors laſt Memorial: in which the Miniſters of the High Allies have taken notice that he ſays, <hi>Knowing that this State is more inclined to accept of a Truce than a Peace; which if your Lordſhips think conſiſts more with your Intereſt, His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty gives your Lordſhips the Choice, to conclude either a Peace or Truce, according to the Conditions ſpecified in his Ambaſſadors Memorial,</hi> the 29th. of <hi>April.</hi> As if it belonged to this State, and not to <hi>Spain,</hi> whom <hi>France</hi> makes War upon; or as if this State had received a full and ample Power from <hi>Spain</hi> to treat of an Accommodation with <hi>France.</hi> The ſaid Envoy Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary of <hi>Spain</hi> deſires to know, That if <hi>France</hi> gives to your Lordſhips the Choice of a Peace or a Truce, whither your Lordſhips be Maſters of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> and of all the other Places and Towns which <hi>France</hi> demands, and pretends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or if they belong not to the King his Maſter, or if by this Choice <hi>France</hi> may think that your Lordſhips will induce his Catholick Majeſty to agree to the unjuſt and impracticable Conditions of <hi>France.</hi> The ſaid ſubſcribed Envoy Extraordinary hath ſeveral times declared, and now doth declare unto your Lordſhips, That if your Lordſhips ſhall continue to promote ſuch a Deſign, it will be wholly in vain, and of no Effect, and the Reaſons which he hath already alledged, which concern this State, and the Allies of his Moſt Catholick Majeſty, as may appear by their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter diſapproving the late Meaſures your Lordſhips have taken. If then the Perſwaſions of your Lordſhips will be wholly ineffectual to cauſe his Catholick Majeſty to conſent to the Propoſals of <hi>France,</hi> as the ſaid Envoy Extraordinary hath already declared, and now doth declare unto your Lordſhips, How can your Lordſhips then undertake to diſpoſe of that which is not your own, the ſo doing belonging to him to whom it appertains, and who hath declared he will never agree to ſuch Conditions. If <hi>France</hi> think that your Lordſhips may conſtrain his Catholick Majeſty to comply with Terms wholly inconſiſtent with his Intereſt, which if it be done directly, it will leave this glorious Example to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. That thoſe Arms which were firſt rais'd for the Defence of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> were afterwards inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in its Oppreſſion; and if indirectly by withdrawing your Troops, then this State will be the firſt that will feel the Effects of ſuch a Reſolution. And the ſaid Envoy moſt inſtantly prays your Lordſhip to conſider, that his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty is their Friend, their Allie, and their Confederate, but not their Pupil; And, That if your Lordſhips continue to treat your Allies as they do, perhaps they wo'nt have one left, when they ſtand in need of many. His Majeſty could not worſe reſent the Meaſures your Lordſhips have taken, than by your granting <hi>France</hi> all that he pretends to; for undoubtedly, if ſuch a Grant ſhould take place, this State would be utterly loſt without the future Hope of a Recovery. However, his Catholick Majeſty taking to Heart the Liberty and Welfare of this State, is content to hazard the reſt of his Dominions, (he having loſt the beſt part thereof) and by his Conſtancy and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will do what in him lies to hinder this State from ſinking, which turbulent Spirits endeavour to compaſs. The Miniſters of the High Allies have ſufficiently expoſed to your Lordſhips, of what Importance <hi>Luxemburg</hi> is to this State, and to the Empire, and what Conſequences may follow to both if it be loſt, with the Diſpoſition and Readineſs that there is to ſuccour it: therefore, ſince that we are morally aſſured of its making a vigorous Defence, as <hi>Vienna</hi> has done, and that thoſe Troops which beſiege it are not equal in Number to thoſe which beſieged <hi>Vienna,</hi> and thoſe which may raiſe the Siege are not at ſuch a Diſtance as thoſe which relieved <hi>Vienna;</hi> I'm ſure the Cauſe is as juſt, and we have the ſame God to confide in. In the Name of God then, let us not delay to ſuccour a Place whoſe Conſervation imports <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> as much as <hi>Vienna.</hi>
