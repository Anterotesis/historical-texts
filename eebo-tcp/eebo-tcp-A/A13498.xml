            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>SVch and so great, all mans Corruption is</l>
               <l>In shunning Good, and running to Amisse:</l>
               <l>That the Almighty, did long since ordaine</l>
               <l>Lawes, that should our rebellious wils restraine.</l>
               <l>And from that Parlament, of highest Heauen</l>
               <l>A Statute, and an Ordinance was giuen,</l>
               <l>That from those Lawes of the Eternall King,</l>
               <l>All other Lawes (that gouerne men) should spring.</l>
               <l>And as the Sea in Riuers, Creekes and Bayes,</l>
               <l>Flowes, and disperses many seuerall wayes:</l>
               <l>So doth Gods Acts in many Branches run,</l>
               <l>To shew vs what should be vndone, or done.</l>
               <l>For this cause did the power of Heauen ordaine,</l>
               <l>That Kings (like Gods) on Earth should Rule and Raigne:</l>
               <l>To Iudge, to be a Refuge, and Defence</l>
               <l>With Right, of too much wronged Innocence.</l>
               <l>And for this cause, God doth a King command,</l>
               <l>That he his Lawes should Read<note n="*" place="margin">Deu. 17. 15</note> and vnderstand.</l>
               <l>And sure, of All the Kingdomes that there are</l>
               <l>Beneath the Heauens, none may with vs compare:</l>
               <l>To vs th' Almighty, graciously did grant</l>
               <l>Freely his Sacred Gospell heere to plant,</l>
               <l>Making Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> an Admired mirror,</l>
               <l>(When other Nations blindly liue in Error.)</l>
               <l>For vs a matchles King, he out did picke,</l>
               <l>Defendor of the Faith Apostolicke,</l>
               <l>Who all his Lawes and Statutes doth encline,</l>
               <l>Conformable vnto the Lawes Diuine.</l>
               <l>Gods Law in euery faithfull heart<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 8. 10.</note> is writ,</l>
               <l>And our Kings Gouernment doth witnes it.</l>
               <l>And now these Eighteene yeares a blessed Peace,</l>
               <l>Hath made our sinnes (more then our thankes) increase,</l>
               <l>That breach of Lawes, hath sowen neglected seedes,</l>
               <l>Being almost growne vnprofitable weedes:</l>
               <l>Our Gracious King, these euils to preuent,</l>
               <l>Assembled hath a Royall Parlament.</l>
               <l>The high Creator, made this Kingly Creature</l>
               <l>His <hi>Steward,</hi> by his Office, Name, and Nature,</l>
               <l>And he doth guide and Rule this happy Land,</l>
               <l>As he is guided by th' Almighties hand.</l>
               <l>And though a King hath Honour and Renowne,</l>
               <l>Yet many Cares attend vpon a Crowne:</l>
               <l>And though a King a Royall port doth keepe,</l>
               <l>Yet doth he wake, when Subject; often sleepe.</l>
               <l>And had not our dread Soueraigne, bin protected</l>
               <l>By the Almighty, who hath him directed,</l>
               <l>Wee could not haue enioyed such Peace and Rest,</l>
               <l>Wherewith so many yeares wee haue bin blest.</l>
               <l>And as hee now hath caus'd a Parlament,</l>

               <l>Let the Kings heart as it hath done perseuer,</l>
