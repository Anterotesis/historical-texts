            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <q>THis first vnderstand, that there shall come in the last daies, mockers, which will walke after their lustes, and say: where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse of his commyng? for since the fathers dyed, all thynges continue a like from the begynning of the creation. For this they willingly know not, that the heauens were of olde, and the earth that was of the water and by the water, through the word of God. Wherfore the world that then was, perished, ouerflowed with the water: But the heauens and earth, which are now, are kept by the same word in store, and reserued vnto fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the day of iudgement, and of the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vngodly men. Dearely beloued, be not ignorant of this one thyng, that one day is with the Lord, as a thousand yeares, and a thousand yeare, as one day.

theyr harts to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue such swete and comfortable cogitations as thereby occasion is offered.</p>
            <p>Now to come to my matter, there are two thyngs chiefly to be noted in this Gospell: The one is, that our Sauiour reckoneth the signes in order which go before the last day, which being fulfilled,<note place="margin">Math. 14.</note> we may know for a certainty that the day is euen hard at hand. The other note is, that he sayth those signes shalbe a consolation and a comfort to hys Christian children, so that therby they may be moued to looke for hys commyng with a mery and cherefull countenance. The first signe (sayth he) shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare from heauen in the sunne, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> moone, and the starres: that is to say (as Mathew doth expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it:) <hi>The sunne shalbe darkened, and the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 24. 29.</note> 
               <hi>moone shall not geue her light, and the starres shall fall from heauen. &amp;c.</hi> Moreouer vpon the earth the


<pb facs="tcp:27854:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people shalbe at theyr wittes end thorow dispayre, &amp; shalbe in such perplexitye, that they shall not know whether to go, or where to abyde, their hartes shall fayle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for feare of those thynges, which are like to come vpon them.</p>
            <p>Agayne, signes shalbe seene in the Sea, &amp; in the Waters, so that all creatures, and the powers of heauen shall moue: there shalbe such an alteration, that the world shall seeme by and by to haue an end, and the last day shall seeme hard at hand. Here I will not greatly contend with any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but will leaue it to the consideration of my Christian brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether the signes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sunne, the moone, and the starres be already fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or not. But this is my belefe &amp; most certaine hope, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of them haue bene alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy sene, and that many other are not here after to bee looked for.


<pb facs="tcp:27854:9"/>
For if we will beleue, there hath bene sene euen in our time aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly both many and great Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipses or darkenyngs of the sunne and mone within few yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, one after an other, besides diuers in one yeare: the lyke we haue not read to haue appeared at any time before since the begyn nyng of the world. But he that will not beleue the word of God, will not beleue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> signes, nor take them for signes, but will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne them, and tread them vnder hys foote, yea although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sunne should be dayly darkned before his eyes, &amp; the starres should fall by heapes from heauen. Although Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers say that such darkenynges of the sunne and moone happen by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> course of nature (which some of them can tel of before hand) yet they deny not, but they signifie some terrible thyng to happen on the earth, especially seyng there be


<pb facs="tcp:27854:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so many, &amp; all most euery yeare.</p>
            <p>Besides this, contrary to the course of nature, many signes haue bene sene in the Heauens, many Sunnes at one time, many Raynebowes, many terrible bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng Starres, fyres in the ayre like dartes and swordes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other prodigious sygnes, which if they should be written, would fill a whole volume: but all are forgotten, if they be not dayly before our eyes, and assone as they are past, we liue securely as though no such thyng had euer happened at any tyme: yea rather the oftener they happen, so much the lesse we regard them. For we take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for customable thynges, thinkyng with our selues that of necessitye they must so come to passe, makyng no more accountes of them afterwardes. And true it is, that of necessity they must so come to passe, otherwise they


<pb facs="tcp:27854:10"/>
should be tokens in vayne, and the world should not bee so soone destroyed, if it beyng moued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, should beleue the Gospell. For it might (turnyng to God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce) auoyde, or turne away his wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or at the least prolong it for a tyme. But alas, this is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the chief care of the world, by continuyng in wickednes, &amp; most obstinatly heapyng sinne, to haste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods wrath, and spedely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hys owne destruction. Thus much as concernyng the signes in the Sunne, the Moone, and the Starres.</p>
            <p>Now as touchyng the signes in the Sea, and the Waters, I commit them in like maner to the Iudgement of my Christian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Whether they be fulfilled al ready or no. Old men testify, that no man aliue is able to remember so great tempestes, windes, and floudes as haue happened within


<pb facs="tcp:27854:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
these few yeares. Some floudes haue drowned whole countreys, such haue happened of late about Rome, and in the lower <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi> besides the earth quakes which we haue heard of, but I let them passe. By these thynges it semeth that such is now the condition of the world, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall continue any longer in hys old estate, but all things shall quickly be turned vpsidedowne, and fall to decay. And also this we see come to passe by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, that many are so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and vexed, that for very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishe of mynde they dispayre. Which thyng may be vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both bodely and spiritually, but especially spiritually. For we haue heard of many before tyme, and yet dayly heare of mo, whom the deuill so troubleth and vexeth by temptations and desperation, that for the greatnes of the grief


<pb facs="tcp:27854:11"/>
and anguish, they lay hand vpon them selues, &amp; procure their owne death: so that we see all the signes forespoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by our Sauiour Christ, haue happened in all the world. And although all thynges be not fully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished and ended, yet we can not deny, but that the greater part of them is already fulfilled, especially so many happenyng to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether one after an other. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore litle or nothyng hereafter is to be looked for besides the end of all thyngs, which signes are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forespoken, to put vs out of doubt, and that we should not thinke they happen without a cause by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or fortune, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to signifie some notable thyng to come. But they are in dede all of them terrible signes, threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the world cruell eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, although it do not feele them, nor care for them. But true Christians do both see them, and marke them


<pb facs="tcp:27854:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
well, &amp; are therby terrified much more then nedes, seyng they are not sent to their destruction, but rather to their consolation: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought with ioy &amp; glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to behold &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider them, and not be discouraged, although the firmament appeare lamentable vnto the beholders, the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres and all the heauen beyng darkened.</p>
            <p>The Sunne, although he be couered with a thicke and blacke cloude, although he leese his light, neuerthelesse he goeth forwardes in hys course, he is no worse then he was before, he remaineth the same Sunne still, and shineth as he dyd before, sauyng that he low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for a time in token of destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to wicked men: in lyke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> residue, as the Moone and the Starres, in that they seeme terrible to behold, it is no harme vnto them selues: For they are no


<pb facs="tcp:27854:12"/>
tokens vnto them selues, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wicked world, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned. After the same sort, whereas me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are troubled and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed, hauyng a timerous &amp; feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, it is in dede a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble signe, but not vnto thee or the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which suffer this, if they be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: onely it signifieth destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the wicked, and despisers therof, which do not suffer it, but neglect it: For the sufferers are preserued neuerthelesse, and take no harme therby, although they go vp and downe with a pensiue mynde; in token of destruction to the wicked, and vngodly persons. Euen as Esay went naked, and without shooes, and Ieremy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed a chayne about hys necke for a signe of misery and calamity to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Philistines,</hi> and yet no harme happened vnto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. For Ieremy remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of bondage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; thraldome,


<pb facs="tcp:27854:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and in as much liberty, as he was before, and Esay notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng hys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nakednes, kept still hys gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: So they which kepyng vnto them a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, do ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about them these tokens, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be without harme, and voyde of of all daunger, onely they declare vnto other, what shortly after shalbe their estate and condicion.</p>
            <p>For although they bee euill signes, yet they bryng no euill to them that cary them. Otherwise, he that hath the execution of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned persons, would not cary the sword, or the axe, neither durst any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cary a weapon: But thou which art a mansleaer and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer take thou hede to thy selfe, for thou art lyke to go to the pot when the officer draweth foorth his sword.

<pb facs="tcp:27854:13"/>
which haue committed haynous offences: So before the last day there must be many men, whom the deuill troubleth and vexeth with greuous temptations, and so oppresseth them with anguish, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not tel which way to turne them, or where to abide. Of which sort of men <hi>Gerson</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> and certain confessors haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten many thynges, especially in Monasteries. We haue had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of them in whom hath ben tender and fearefull consciences. But let hym so vexe and terrify men, he shal not hurt them, if they be not such as God hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to terrify and condemne, as the wicked and the vngodly: but rather such as are fearefull, &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of mynde, and would gladly receiue comfort, and turne vnto God, and can finde no comfort or relief, vntil God himselfe haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered them out of the misery of

These men


<pb facs="tcp:27854:14"/>
must feele these signes, not as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens vnto them selues, but vnto them which are more worthy to feele them. But bicause thou doest contemne them, at length thou shalt feele more greuously, not signes, but those thynges which therby are signified, that is to say, euerlastyng terrour, feare, sorow, and hell fire. For if iust men suffer and feele these things in the earth for a tyme: What shall we say will become of them for whose sakes they are sent, and whose destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion God thereby doth threaten?

whiles we hope (but in vayne) for amendement.</p>
            <p>Wherfore then, in such mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and calamities should we be greatly desirous of our lyfe? And if I for myne owne part had no great cause to desire the end of all things, yet the perill and daunger of my brethren, scattered here and there in the world, ought to moue me: for whose sake we haue good cause hartly to pray for it, whose state is such (as we both heare &amp; see) that they are constrained to suffer all maner of ignominy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, slaunderous wordes, both priuely and openly, violent iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and finally most greuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution what soeuer, with diuers kinds of tormentes, cruelly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and put to death.</p>
