            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AMong the Errours and Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there are such which have neither any foundation nor shew of Antiquity, but are the meer Inventions of latter ignorant and barbarous Ages: Others, which obtained not indeed in the Ancient Church, but arose from the degeneracy of some Belief, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptiin of some Practice received and used by the Ancient Christians. Of the first sort are Transubstantiation, Half-Communion, Supremacy of the Pope, Worship of Images, and the like groundless Opinions and Practices, which the Antient Church never thought of, much less admitted. Of the latter kind are Invocation of Saints, which arose from an extraordinary Veneration paid to the Memory and Reliques of blessed Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, degenerating in latter Ages into downright Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and Impiety. Purgatory, advanced from a Belief generally received in the Ancient Church, that the Souls of the departed are not admitted to the beatisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Vision before the Day of Judgment, into a foolish Opinion of a Fictitious Place of Torment, which might receive them in that interval of time: And Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Councils, raised from an external Submission of ancient Christians to their Decrees, into an Obligation of yielding an internal Assent to their Definitions. The Beginnings and Rise of the Errours of the sirst sort,
<pb facs="tcp:102659:3"/>
are unknown and uncertain, as being founded in dark and ignorant Ages; whose Actions are now no less ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, than were then their Notions. But the latter sort admit a more clear and more certain Knowledge: Their several Steps, Progresses and Gradations, may without much difficulty be traced out, and exposed to the view of all Mankind; as hath been often done by the Divines of the Reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>But the most eminent Instance of the latter kind, is the Imposition of Celibacy in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which arose from an immoderate affection and reverence of Virginity in the Ancient Universal Church, and Example of many particular Churches. Upon which account, I may boldly affirm, that the Imposition of Celibacy hath greater advantages to recommend and justifie it to the World, than any other erroneous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice or Opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> whatsoever. Many others indeed proceeded from the Imitation and Advancement of some Ancient Doctrine or Practice: But then that Practice degenerated into Abuse, and that Doctrine was advanced into Errour. Whereas the Imposition of Celibacy can plead not only the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Resemblance of Antient Times, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Examples and Authorities of Popes, Councils and Doctors, who anciently imposed Celibacy upon the Clergy, and urged the Imposition of it with no less fervour, than it is at this day continued in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However Celibacy be confirmed by these Great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, and recommended by this peculiar advantage of Undoubted Antiquity, few Divines of our Church have handled this Controversie, or endeavoured to shew the inclusiveness of those Authorities, and weakness of
<pb facs="tcp:102659:3"/>
this Antiquity. Some few have produced Authorities of the Antient Writers in Favour of the contrary Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; or in treating of other Arguments have briefly touched of it; and all have passed it over in a few Words, as a Matter of less Moment. At least none, that I know of, have handled this Controversie in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Treatise; nor shewn the Beginnings, Occasions, Advances and Success of the Imposition of Celibacy, in the several Ages of the Church. This Enquiry hath been omitted, not because Truth is wanting to our Side, or the whole Stream of Antiquity runs contrary to us: but because this is one of the less Momentous Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies; and our Clergy, whose peculiar Glory it is to be less solicitous of their Interest even in things lawful and indifferent, declined the Controversie; least in pleading for the lawfulness of Marriage, and they should be thought by a Censorious World to plead for their own Passions and Inclinations, and perhaps Practice too.</p>
            <p>To supply this. Defect is the Design of this Treatise, to vindicate the injured Cause of Marriage, and shew that the Antient Esteem of Celibacy was neither Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal nor Universal, that both Antient and Modern Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of it is unlawful, and that the Antient use of it, is no reasonable nor necessary President of the Modern Practice of it, to shew the Occasions of that Esteem and Beginnings of this Imposition; and carry the History of the Celibacy, and Marriage of the Clergy through the several Ages of the Church. This I have here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, and as I hope, in some measure performed; perhaps with so much the better Success, because induced by no Prejudices, nor pleading for any peculiar Interests. For the Reader may be assured, that the Author of this Treatise hath neither experienced the Pleasures of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb facs="tcp:102659:4"/>
nor hath the Honour to be a Priest of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may not be amiss, because our Adversaries common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly object to us falsifying of Citations, and borrowing them from one another; (a Crime which the Romish Priests of <hi>England</hi> are truly guilty of, perhaps therein to be excused, because the badness of their Cause requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the former, and their own Ignorance necessitates the latter) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> farther, to advertise the Reader, that of all the Citations which he shall find in this Treatise, no one is taken up at the second hand for the first 1300. years, and after that time no more than three Writers cited upon the Faith of others, <hi>viz. Alvarus Pelagius, Panormitan,</hi> and <hi>Polydor Virgil,</hi> whose Writings I had not then by me, nor had any opportunity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult.</p>

            <head>A TREATISE OF THE CELIBACY OF THE CLERGY. WHEREIN <hi>Its Rise and Progress are Historically Considered.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>VIrginity is a thing so plausible, and if true so venerable; so countenanced by Antiquity, and admir'd by the Unthinking Multitude; so highly subservient to the Secular Interest, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Grandeur of the Clergy: That among all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices wherewith the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upholds a sinking and decaying Cause, it is no wonder, if She more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially make use of this. It might justly deserve our reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and excite our Emulation, if her Clergy made good their glorious Pretences of Virginity by a real and unspotted Chastity: But since when we departed from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102659:5"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we resumed that ancient priviledge of Mankind, of believing our Senses; since Reason and Revelation assures us, that so great a part of Mankind cannot, and Experience demonstrates that it doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a Perfection so extraordinary; since an enforced Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and servile Piety, is neither acceptable to God, nor venerable to Men: We slight their Virginity, because im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd; and do not believe it, because we do not see it. The Plea indeed of Antiquity is not only specious, but in some measure true. In the Ancient Church, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an infinite esteem and veneration for Virginity: Many extolled it as the glory, and some made it even the business of Christianity; it was an unusual abstinence from lawful and permitted Pleasures, that procured them Admiration from the Heathen, and Honour from their Fellow-Christians. But then they really performed, what they generously undertook: Their Celibacy was no less chast than voluntary; their Piety was fully adequate to their Zeal, and both perhaps in some things greater than their Knowledge. Yet should we even do violence to our Reason, and force our Nature to imitate the Examples, and receive the Doctrine of those great and holy Persons, if either their Consent or their Practice had been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal. But on the contrary, the Imposition of it hath been condemned by the most Famous Councils, and Greatest Writers, never used in the Eastern Church, not introduced in the Western till almost two hundred years after Christ, enjoyned but in some few Provinces of that, and even in those not universally practis'd; and all this without doing injury to the sacred Bond of Marriage, and ever leaving open a refuge for incontinent Persons. Not so the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which not only adviseth, but imposeth Celibacy; in many of the Clergy have dissolved Marriage, in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrieth it as Heresie, defineth it to be worse than Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to none allows a remedy for Incontinency. To demonstate the Injustice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> herein, and her departure from the Doctrine and Practice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, shall be the Subject of this present Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102659:5"/>It is no small presumption of Errour, when the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of any Opinion agree not in the merits of the Cause they undertake. In the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there are Four Opinions about the Celibacy of the Clergy: The first, that it is of Divine Right, Instituted and Commanded by God. So<note n="(a)" place="margin">In 4.

               <hi>Turrian</hi> teach, that God hath forbidden Bishops, Priests, Deacons, and Sub-deacons (whom we shall hereafter comprehend under the general Name of the Clergy, unless when we manifestly distinguish them) to Marry, or use their Wives already married. The second is that of <hi>Bellarmine, Valentia, Vasquez, Becanus, Aquinas,</hi> and the far greater part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Divines, that it is not properly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, but of Apostolick Right, as being instituted by the Apostles, and ever since constantly and invariably pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by the Church; that a Vow of Continence should be annexed to Holy Orders; and consequently, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage thereby becomes unlawful to the Clergy, without a Dispensation. The third, without any respect to Divine or Apostolical Institution and Practice of the Ancient Church, whether they be here had or not, thinks it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that the Church hath Power to impose a Vow of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence upon the Clergy, and that such a Vow being once taken, all use of Marriage is become unlawful, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Contracts invalid. This seems to be the Opinion of many of the Canonists, and the Council of<note n="(d)" place="margin">Sess. 24. Can. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Trent;</hi> which ventured to define no more than this, that Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Regulars, after a solemn profession of Continence, cannot Marry, or if they do, that their Marriage is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. Lastly, the more moderate Divines maintain, that it is neither of Divine nor Apostolical Right, but deriveth all its Obligation from Ecclesiastical Institution; which as well as the Vow annexed to it, will cease to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige, as soon as the Church shall please; although in the mean while she hath sufficient reason to continue her Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Against these Opinions, I shall prove these Four Propositions.

                  <item>III. The Imposition of it upon any Order of Men, is unjust, and contrary to the Law of God.</item>

               </gap> his Apostles. By Celibacy, we mean a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual abstinence from the use of the Nuptial Bed in those already Married, and not Contracting of Marriage in single Persons, after taking of Holy Orders, or making a Vow of Chastity. That such Celibacy was not at all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by Christ, nor by the Apostles, as of Divine Right, is sufficiently proved from the dissent of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries herein. For it is the received Opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that nothing can be a matter of Faith, such as this would be, if it had been commanded by Christ; which is doubted and disputed of among the Doctors of the Church. Now this is denied by the Maintainers of the Second and Fourth Opinions: As for the Third, that according to the usual artifice of the latter Popish Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, is so obscurely proposed, that it neither directly favours nor opposeth it. Besides, neither Scripture or Tradition can be offered for this claim of Divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The former is not so much as pretended to, or if it be, we shall examine it afterwards: The latter cannot justly be, since none but an universal Tradition of all past and present Ages is sufficient to convey down a matter of Faith; whereas here the greatest part even of the present Church deny it. But I will not insist upon disproving this, as well because it is disowned by the greatest part of our Adversaries, as because all the Arguments to be produced against the other Opinions, will with much more force be valid against this. I will only observe, that if this Opinion be either false or uncertain, the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is wholly overthrown; since many

Popes and Councils in the Eleventh Age, determined the Celibacy of the Clergy to be of Divine Institution, and the lawfulness of their Marriage to be downright Heresie.</p>

               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore, and with him the more Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> decline this Plea, and assign to this Celibacy a bare Institution of the Apostles, acting herein without any particular or express Commission from our Lord, but by them prescribed and advised as merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious itself, and convenient to the Church; punctually herein followed and obeyed by the Church in all Ages. Whether the Church, and more especially the Ancient, did conform its discipline to this pretended Institution of the Apostles, we shall enquire hereafter; and by proving that it did not, prove also that the Apostles made no such Institution: Since the Primitive Church cannot be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have immediately degenerated from the Instructions and Admonitions of her Founders and great Doctors. But to pass by that, I observe, that whether the Apostles instituted Celibacy, and ordained a Vow of Continency to be annexed to Holy Orders, is a Question of Fact, and consequently cannot be infallibly determined by the Church; but must be by them clearly proved, either from express Texts of Scripture, or an universal and invariable Tradition. That there is no such Tradition, we shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For Scripture, we desire to know, where those plain Admonitions of Celibacy to the Clergy are to be found. For we are in no ways obliged to prove the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; Marriage being not forbidden to the Clergy by the Moral Law, and therefore to be esteemed Lawful to them, till a manifest Prohibition shall be produced. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeed urgeth that Precept of the Apostie, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 8. that a Bishop be <hi>sober and temperate,</hi>

               <hi>Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed.</hi> Thirdly, That of those who are already Unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, he adviseth Virginity to them only who have the Gift of Continence.<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ver. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Nevertheless he that standeth sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast in his own heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart, that he will keep his virgin, he doth well.</hi>

            <p>But our Adversaries are not only destitute of Reason and Revelation in favour of this Opinion, but we have also many strong Arguments against it. For to pass by the greatest of all, the Silence of Scripture, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Practice of Antiquity; the first manifested already, the latter to be proved hereafter: Many of the Greatest Divines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do expresly confess, that the Celibacy of the Clergy is neither of Divine nor Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Institution. This all those Popes, Councils and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, hereafter to be produced, who allow the Marriage of Priests in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church to be lawful, must have held, unless they be supposed to have betrayed the Doctrine and Tradition of the Church. All those Divines likewise who have admitted or allowed a total abrogation of the Laws
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102659:8"/>
of Celibacy, could not believe it to have a Divine or Apostolical Original. However I shall produce some few, who expreslly denied it. As first, the Canon Law, which may be looked upon as the sence of the whole Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for some Ages. So then <hi>Gratian,</hi>

               <hi>Joannes,</hi> a <hi>Ludegna,</hi> in a Speech made in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and Printed among the Acts of that Council, determineth and largely proveth, that the Celibacy of the Clergy is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Divine Right, nor in any sence commanded by the Apostles, but only advised by them: And that, <hi>if there was no Laws of the Church, or Monastick Vows, Priests or Monks might lawfully Marry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, if the Opinion of those Divines be true, who maintain that Christ superadded no Evangelical Counsels to the Moral Law; Celibacy can be neither of Divine nor Apostolical Institution, unless we suppose that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles immediately adulterated that most pure and simple Religion, which they had received from their Master. And indeed, this seemeth highly rational, most consonant to the Honour of God, and adapted to the Nature of Man. That Religion was most be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>itting the Wisdom of the Deity to prescribe for the last and most perfect Rule of Mankind, which was most pure and simple: And this seems to have been the great End of Christ's coming into the World, to free us from the bondage of the Ceremonial Law, and estate us in that perfect liberty, if not of Will, yet at least as to the objects of Choice, in which we were at first Created: whereas had he prescribed a perpetual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence to all those who aim an Perfection, as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102659:8"/>
without altering their Natures at the same time, and by an extraordinary Miracle, enduing all, who desire it, with the Gift of Continence: This alone would have debased the excellency of his Religion; and have been an Imposition more grievous and burthensom, more difficult and intolerable, than all the Rites and Ceremonies of the Mosaick Law. And then in respect of us, it became the Wisdom and Goodness of our Supreme Law-giver, to give us a Religion, not as to Angels or Spiritual Beings, but in a way most consentaneous to our Natures, and and agreeing to our Imperfections. That can neither refine, nor perfect our Nature, which is Preternatural; and if in this Mortal State, while enchained in a Body, surrounded with frailties, and endued with passions, we affect the impassibility of Angels, and the perfection of Spirits, we may be called Ambitious, but I know not whether Pious.</p>
            <p>But this is not all. The Apostle not only forbids not, but even expresly permitteth Marriage to the Clergy. For laying down the necessary Qualification of a Bishop, the highest and most perfect Degree of the Clergy, he proposeth this as as one, that<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 2, 4.</note> 
               <hi>he be blameless, the husband of one wife. One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection, with all gravity.</hi> Of a Priest, that<note n="(b)" place="margin">Tit. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>he be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children.</hi> Of a Deacon, that<note n="(c)" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>he be the husband of one wife, ruling his children, and his own house well:</hi> And further, looketh upon it as no small mark and testimony of the ability and worthiness of the Candidates of any of these Sacred Offices, if they have ruled their own Houses well, and by their precepts and examples taught their Wives and Children the practices of all Vertues. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place,<note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2.</note> to avoid Fornication, allows to every Man his own Wife, maketh no exceptions. That is a lamentable refuge of some, who seek to elude the force of the former places, by pretending that the Apostle means here by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he who hath been the Husband of one Wife, but is not now, being become a Widdower, or at least unable for the exercises of the Bed.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102659:9"/>
For besides that, the<note n="(a)" place="margin">Tim. 3. 2.</note> Apostle giveth Rules for the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Carriage of Deacons Wives; besides that, this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is uncertain, which is sufficient to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that it is contrary to the sence of all Mankind, and the Vulgar acceptation of the word Husband, that it seemeth repugnant to the following Precept, of ruling their Houses well, and is certainly repugnant to the Explication of the Fathers: The Practice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church do manifestly evince the falseness of it, wherein it cannot be denied many Persons were admitted to Sacred Orders, who had Wives then alive and dwelling with them. And in the Apostolical Constitutions, the Apostles are introduced thus spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>We have ordered, that a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, Priest and Deacon, be the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of one Wife, whether their Wives be alive, or whether they be dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To pass by therefore this unreasonable Interpretation, there are three other Explications of this word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all of them back'd with great Reasons and Authorities. First, That the Apostle means no more thereby, than that the Persons admitted into Holy Orders, should not have two wives at the same time. Secondly, That he should not have successively two Wives, much less three or four, one after the death of another. Thirdly, That he should not have two Wives living at the same time, one Married after the Divorce of another. The first Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation was generally followed by the <hi>Greek,</hi> the second by the <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers; although<note n="(c)" place="margin">Hom. X. in 1 Ep. ad Tim. &amp; Hom. II. in Ep. ad Tit.</note> St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> espouseth both, and<note n="(d)" place="margin">Ep. 83. ad Oceanum, comm. in Ioc. l. 1. adv. Jovin.</note> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in so many several places admits all three. Which of them be the truest, is of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the present business, since each of them destroy the Opinion of our Adversaries, and leave to the Clergy a liberty of Marriage. However, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the second Interpretation, if admitted, may in some measure prejudice that Principle which we shall hereafter lay down, that all cannot contain, and that God and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102659:9"/>
Nature hath provided no other remedy for incontinent Persons, than Marriage, which consequently must be reiterated as often as necessity shall require: I shall say somewhat to it, and oppose first, the contrary Opinion of all the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers. Secondly, the Authority of the whole Catholick Church, who admitted Bigamist Bishops and Priests, or those who had married one Wife after the death of another, and that in great numbers, as we shall hereafter occasionally demonstrate; so that if the Apostle had forbidden all such to be admitted into these Sacred Offices, the Universal Church had erred in a matter of the greatest moment. Thirdly, the third Interpretation seems far more consonant to Reason, the Analogy of the Scripture, and the Circumstances of those Times. For that ought not to exclude any Man from this Sacred Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which is so far from being a Crime, that in many cases it becomes Necessary; and if Marriage be allowed to all Men, to avoid Fornication, if any Man's Wife dieth, before either his years, or the peculiar favour of God hath reprieved him from the temptations of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence; that Man, although a Priest or Bishop, may, withouthe least injury to the strictest Rules of Piety or Religion, contract a second Marriage. Bigamy in him, as<note n="(a)" place="margin">Comm. in 1 Ep. ad Tim. cap. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Theodoret</hi> invincibly argues, will become involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and conseqnently not derogate from his character either of Priest or Christian. Besides, it was an abuse very frequent in that Age, both among the Jews and Gentiles, to Divorce their Wives upon the slightest occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or the least discontent; an abuse which argued in all an inconstant and unjust, and in many a lustful Mind; and therefore although com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before their Conversion, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred such Persons unworthy of this Sacred Character. This Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore is embraced by <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi> who, after he had affirmed the same Opinion to be maintained by many Others, and asserted it by many Reasons, concludeth thus,<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Loc. c. 14.</note> 
               <hi>They seem to me to be in the right, who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102659:10"/>
hold, that the Apostle here teacheth him to be worthy of Episcopal Ordination, who liveth chastly with one only Wife. For he hath not herein rejected second Marriages, which he hath in many cases even commanded to be contracted. Considering then these and such like Arguments, I receive the Interpretation of these Writers.</hi> St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> also in<note n="(a)" place="margin">Hom. 2. in Ep. ad Tit.</note> one place explains it the same way. And St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> when freed from the passion of Disputing against <hi>Jovinian,</hi> enclined to the same Opinion. For pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing<note n="(b)" place="margin">Comm. in Ep. ad Tit. c. 1. Tom. IX p. 245</note> the Examples of two Bishops, whereof the one shall have lost his Wife in his youth, and overcome by the necessity of the flesh shall marry another, bury her after some time, and ever after contain; the other shall enjoy the company of but one Wife, even till his death: He determineth the former to be the better, more chaste, and more continent. And in another place,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ep. 83. ad Oceanum. in init.</note> resolving <hi>Oceanus</hi> his Question, Whether <hi>Carterius,</hi> a Spanish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, who had married one Wife before, and a second after Baptism, had not thereby violated the Apostle's Injunction, of a Bishop's being the Husband of one Wife? He pronounceth, That he had not. Lastly, The contrary Opinion is built upon a false Foundation. For, not to say that it was first set on foot by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> after he was become a Montanist, and from him received by the <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers; it relyeth wholly upon these Two false Suppositions. First, That according to any other sence, the Precept of the Apostle would have been unnecessary, the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws never allowing Polygamy. Secondly, That the Apostle maketh use of the same Phrase, when he commands<note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 9.</note> a Widdow to be chosen, <hi>the wife of one husband,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, although no Laws or civilized Nations ever permitted Women to have two Husbands at the same time. But both these Reasons vanish, when opposed to our Third Interpretation. For Divorce was permitted by the <hi>Roman</hi> as well as <hi>Jewish</hi> Laws, for many other causes besides that of Adultery, which alone was allowed by Christ: So that whosoever had put away his Wife for any other cause, and married another, might truly be said to have two Wives: and any Woman, who had married again after such an unlawful Divorce, had truly two Husbands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102659:10"/>Having thus refuted the pretence of Divine or Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Institution, I proceed to the Second Proposition, That the Celibacy of the Clergy hath nothing excellent in itself, and produceth no real Advantage either to the Church or the Christian Religion, beyond Marriage. And here I am not ignorant, what Panegyricks and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums of Virginity have been composed by many of the Antients, and almost all the Writers of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ages. This was a large field for them, wherein to display their Rhetorick, a subject so specious in itself, and glorious in its Title, that 'tis no wonder it hath been the Theme of so many luxuriant Wits; many of which have little less than Deify'd it, and equall'd its Merits to the collection of all other Christian Vertues. I shall not here undertake, nor is it necessary to make an harangue upon the Praises of Marriage, much less to depress the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the Virgin state; it will suffice to shew the weakness and invalidity of the contrary Arguments, and thereby reduce both Marriage and Virginity to that Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium, wherein Nature first placed them, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour left them.</p>
            <p>First then, I observe, That this extraordinary affection and reverence of Virginity, was first started and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a Heretick, <hi>Tertullian;</hi> who deceived by the Enthusiasms of <hi>Montanus,</hi> endeavoured to resine the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and advance it into a System of Angelick Perfection. He led the way to the Writers of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church; who receiving this prejudice from him, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated it in some measure among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> although it never was by them embraced with that zeal, and pursued with that fervour, which always accompanied it in the Western Church. Secondly, it may be observed, That this extravagant veneration of Virginity prevailed proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to the decay of Learning, and encrease of Ignorance in all Ages. The Reputation of Celibacy was ever then highest, when Knowledge was at its lowest ebb. Particularly in the Tenth and Eleventh Ages, the most scandalous and barbarous periods of Time, that ever the Church waded through; when Learning seemed banished
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102659:11"/>
out of the whole World, then Celibacy triumphed every where, and was look'd upon as the Consummation of all Vertues; Marriage of the Clergy decried and abolished, and more Monasteries founded, than in all the Ages either before or since. Thirdly, This Opinion was first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and ever after advanced and maintained by a gross Mistake; that there is somewhat of impurity or sinfulness in the use of Marriage, and that Chastity cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a Married state.</p>
            <p>That the Admirers of Celibacy among the Antients were guilty of this Mistake, we shall have hereafter occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to observe; and although the more Learned Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are ashamed of such a Proposition, yet do they constantly fall back and recurr to it, when they assign the Reasons of imposing Celibacy upon the Clergy. So <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> after he had before disowned it, when his purpose requires it, doubts not to say,<note n="(a)" place="margin">In actu vero conjugii negari non potest, quin admixta sit quaedam impuritas &amp; pollutio, non quae peccatum sit: sed quae ex peccato tamen nata sit. Controv. Tom. II. lib. 1. cap. 19.</note> 
               <hi>It cannot be denied, that some impurity and pollution inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes in the act of Marriage; not what is a sin, but what ariseth from sin.</hi> If by this Pollution and Impurity, he means a Natural one, we grant it; but then that affects not the Soul, nor depreciates the worth of Marriage: if a Moral one, that will indeed be truly and properly a Sin; but this he dares not say. Besides, his Distinction of a Sin, and a Consequence of a Sin, is wholly vain. For, if in all Use of Marriage, the effect of a Sin interveneth, then cannot Marriage be used without some precedent sin: A Proposition so false and erroneous, that the Use of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was intended for our first Parents in the state of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and would have been practis'd to this very day, had they never fallen. Nay farther, whether fallen or not fallen, it was their Duty to make use of Marriage for the Propagation of Mankind; and even for some Ages after the Creation, it was so far from being meritorious, that it was Unlawful to continue Virgins. But if by the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent sin, which produceth this Pollution in the Act of Marriage; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> means, only the Original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102659:11"/>
of our Nature: if it be a Necessary effect of this depravity, then God cannot in Justice, and will not in Mercy impute it to us; if it be not a Necessary effect of it, then Marriage may be used without it, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position will fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>However, because this ever was, and is still the great Engine of the Patrons of Virginity, wherewith they gained Applause in the World, and blinded the eyes of unwary People, it will not be amiss to clear this matter a little further, and demonstrate that a true and proper Chastity and Continence may be observed in Marriage; which will also overthrow most of the Authorities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the Writings of the more moderate and disinteressed Fathers, as insinuating no more than an Advice of Chastity in the Use of Marriage. If this Proposition seemeth either harsh or like a Paradox, it is only because we are unacquainted with it, and our judgment anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by false notions of Chastity, which consists as well in a moderate and well regulated Use of Matrimonial Acts, as in a total Abstinence from them; nay, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer will always be a Vertue, the latter sometimes a Sin, (as in the Infancy of the Creation, and if one married Person totally abstaineth without the consent of the other) and in most cases but a thing indifferent, and then only a Vertue, when it administers occasion and opportunity to a greater good, than is the Propagation of Mankind, and vertuous Education of Children for the future Service of God. Such Cases did often happen in the Beginning of Christianity, and the Times of Persecution; but in the calm and flourishing estate of the Church, are more rarely to be found. So that in all others, Chastity in the notion of a total Abstinence, is a thing wholly indifferent, even although such Abstinence should be true and perfect. But alas! the far greater part of Mankind are not capable of such an Abstinence, which consisteth not only in the preserving the Body from actual Pollution and unlawful Pleasures, for that may be a matter of Necessity as well as Choice, and is common to thousands who shall never see the Glories of Heaven; but also in refraining the Mind
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102659:12"/>
from the desires, and even the thoughts of Uncleanness, and preventing the circles of an inward Fire. Such a Man may truly be said to retain a pure and unspotted Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity; but then I doubt, that at the same time he will be the Phoenix of his Age. And then after all, if he want either Abilities or a Will to employ himself in Vertue and the Service of God, to greater advantage than he could have done in a Married state, his Celibacy will be devoid of all merit, and become wholly indifferent.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the conservation of a true Chastity, is both possible and easie in Marriage; if it be not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that ariseth from the corruption of Mankind, not any desicience or imperfection of Marriage. Now that Chastity and Continence may be here found and practised, the Apostle assureth us, when he saith,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note>

            </p>
            <p>If then Chastity is common both to Marriage and Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy, the latter can have no intrinsick Excellence beyond the former: Nor indeed do our more judicious Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries pretend to that. Few are guilty of so foul an errour, except some zealous and unlearned Monks. The Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence therefore of it is wholly accidental, and consists only in affording greater advantages of Piety, Knowledge, and Beneficence, than Marriage. This therefore is next to be examined. Let us then consider any one as a Man, a Christian, and a Priest. If in the first quality, as a Member and Citizen of Mankind, that estate will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the preheminence, which is most communicative of good, and beneficial to the whole Universe. The benefits of Celibacy are indirect, accidental, and rare; those of Marriage, direct, natural, and frequent. If as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, that state will be most eligible, that more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately procureth the grace and favour of God; this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy directly affords to none; Marriage conferrs on all, in the Opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who make it a Sacrament. If as a Priest, that state is preferrable, which giveth the greater and more diffusive Example to the Laity. A Vertuous Celibacy will be indeed Exemplary to Virgin Laicks, the smallest and most inconsiderable part of the Church: But then a prudent and religious conduct of Marriage will serve as a Rule for other married Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the far greater part of the Laick Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:102659:13"/>Thus far the Merits of both are at least equal. If we recurr to the Authority of Examples, we may begin at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, and the first state of Mankind. Here we sind a married Couple even in the state of Innocence, and the very first Blessing given by God unto Mankind, to be this, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Be fruitful, and multiply.</hi> And as it can be no laudable. Ambition, to desire to exceed the Piety and Innocence of Paradice, so neither can it be any great Perfection, to defeat the first Blessing of the Creation. If we descend hence until the Times of <hi>Moses,</hi> we shall find all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs both before and after the Flood, to have pleased. God, and served their Generations at the same time. All this while Celibacy hath no Example, nor any one Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. If we look into the Mosaick Law, Marriage was there expresly permitted, and indirectly commanded to the Priest, since none but their own Posterity could be admitted into that Order. I am not ignorant that the Patrons of Celibacy urge mightily the Three days Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence <note n="(b)" place="margin">Exod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. 15.</note> from their Wives, imposed upon the People, in preparing themselves to receive the Law of God in <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> But this was enjoyned not only to the Priests, but to all the People; was a short and temporary, not a total and perpetual Abstinence; served only to typifie that inseparable Purity of Mind and Body, which was to flourish in the Church of Christ; and was a meer Rite and Ceremony, unworthy of the dignity and simplicity of the Christian Religion. Again, if we consider the Saints and Prophets of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

That most, if not all the Apostles were Married, we shall prove here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102659:13"/>
and if our Saviour chose a Single state, wherein to pass his life on Earth, <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> shall answer for us, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Strom. l. 3. p. 446.</note> That He had his proper Spouse, the Church; that He was no ordinary Man, who should either want an help, or be subject to the temptations of Incontinency; that it was not necessary for him to continue his <hi>Species</hi> by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, who was himself God, blessed for evermore. And then if we cast our eyes upon the Worship and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Gentiles, we shall find Celibacy in no great esteem among them, and Marriage not only allowed to their Priest, but even made necessary to some of them; insomuch as the <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> could continue no longer in his Office, than his Wife liv'd. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Adv. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin. l. 1. in sin.</note> St. <hi>Herom</hi> indeed, and after him all the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of Celibacy, alledge the Exmple of the <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantae</hi> of <hi>Athons.</hi> But had that good Father in the heat of his Disputation, considered the Character of those Priests, he would not have ventured to produce their Example. For if we may believe the Relations of <hi>Lucian,</hi> and the more Ancient Christian Writers, those <hi>Hierophantae</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> practised in their secret Rites and Mysteries, the most abominable Lusts and Villanies of the Pagan Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perftition. In speaking of this matter, I will further observe, that there was but one great Order of Priests among the Heathens, which professed Virginity, those of <hi>Cybele</hi> or <hi>Isis</hi> (for as for the Vestal Virgins, they were permitted to marry, when their time of Service was expired,) and but one Sect of Philosophers, that decried and contemned Marriage, the <note n="(c)" place="margin">Vid.

               <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and of these the first were the most Infamous and Incontinent of all Priests, the latter the most Debauched and Voluptuous of all Philosophers.</p>
            <p>Lastly, If we consult Reason (for Scripture we have before examieed, and Tradition we shall hereafter,) neither will that declare in favour of Celibacy. That will only teach us, that state is more Noble, which most advanceth the Happiness of Life, and gives the greatest assistance to the Perfection of our Nature. For neither Marriage nor Celibacy have of themselves any intrinsick
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102659:14"/>
Merit, at least not Celibacy, as we before proved: Neither of them doth immediately and directly illuminate the Understanding, refine the Reason, or purge the Will. Now the Happiness of Human Life, and the Perfection of Nature, consists in the tranquility and imperturbation of the Mind, whereby it is sitted for the Contemplation of her Creator, and the Exercise of all more noble and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime Vertues. This Tranquility, next to Habits of Vice in the Soul, is chiefly interrupted by immoderate and ungoverned Passions in the Body, although even those Habits were produced at first by the intemperance of these Passions. The greatest and most vehement of our Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are those of Desire, and among them the propensity to the continuation of our <hi>Species</hi> obtains thefirst place. A a right Use of Marriage satisfies this propensity, allays its violence, secureth the Mind from all tempests on that side. This Celibacy can do only in those who have the Gift of Continence, who perhaps are not the thousandth part of Mankind; if those be excepted, to whom not God or Vertue, but some defect of Nature, hath given a reprieve from this Passion. In the rest, Celibacy, especially when enforced, will be only the occasion of perpetual, or at least intermitting tempests, which instead of a sweet Serenity, will introduce into the Mind a turbulent Commotion, dissorder all her Thoughts, and deprive her of all Happiness: Or if we should grant, which is most false, that Celibacy well governed, is in all able to give the Mind the same tranquility, and secure her from all pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations arising from the passion of Desire; yet still the Merits and Advantages of Marriage and Celibacy will be equal, even in this Consideration.</p>
            <p>There remains then only arguments of temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, and outward decorum of the Church. And here though it might suffice to observe that arguments of convenience are of no validity against a probability of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness, much less against an express Divine Permission; yet shall I briefly examine the Reasons of this kind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by our Adversaries. They may be reduced to three Heads: A greater immunity from secular cares and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102659:14"/>
business, and thereby a better opporunity to attend the Service of God, and execute the Duties of their Office: Secondly, A certain indecency in the use of Marriage, which renders it incompatible or at least inconvenient, to the Sacerdotal Office: Thirdly, The better administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goods and revenues of the Church. As for the First that might indeed with some colour have been pleaded in the infancy of the Gospel, when many of the Clergy were designed as itinerant Preachers, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Faith; although it was then so far from being necessary, that many of the Apostles did in their travels lead about with them, if not their wives, which is most probable, yet at least women. But now when the Faith is planted, and the Clergy have particular limits assigned them wherein to execute their Office; that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ceaseth. Another case may happen wherein this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may take place; in times of Persecution, when 'tis of great advantage and interest to the Church, that her Clergy give examples of patience and constancy to their flock, and is very probable that a man will embrace Martyrdom with a greater resolution and unconcernedness when freed from the solicitude of Wife and Children, whose consideration and perhaps importunities might tempt him to Prevarication; but then Celibacy is here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so so far from being necessary, that it will augment the Merits and the Glory of Martyrdom to break through those Obstacles, and slight those Considerations. However, certain it is, that in the Peaceable and Flourishing Times of the Church: this Reason is of no Validity. Hence appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, with how little Reason our Adversaries urge that so much celebrated Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 32.</note> 
               <hi>He that is Unmarried, careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord.</hi> An admonition by the Apostle adapted to those times of Persecution; as appears by the Preface of it: <hi>But I would have you</hi> (speaking to all Christians) <hi>without Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</hi> For otherwise, Marriage does not necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve more Carefulness or Disquiet, than Celebacy.

Cannot those who please their Wives in a lawful way, give thanks to God? May not a Married Man, together with his Marriage, care for the things that belong to the Lord?</hi> Further, these Texts do no more prove the Necessity or Convenience of Priests Celibacy, than it doth of all other Christians. Nor can it be here pretended, that the Clergy are more peculiarly devoted to the Service of God, and therefore more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly obliged to this Duty. For, first, That would suppose some Excellency in Celibacy, which we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved cannot be found; and then the Priests under the Old Law, were no less solemnly Dedicated to God, who yet were not debarred Marriage. Besides, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> excludes not those from holy Orders, who have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Buried their Wives, or vow a perpetual Abstinence from them, although they may have many Children then alive: As if an equal Solicitude and<note place="margin">

Not to say that the Ancient Hereticks made use of the same Plea, and shunned Marriage, to avoid the trouble of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Necessaries for a Family; and that the Apostle was not ignorant of this inconvenience, if it be any, and yet thought it not sufficient to enjoyn Celibacy to the Clergy. But in truth it is a meer Chimaera, a Figment, and a vain Suspicion. For to use St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s words <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Marriage doth not only not hinder the Practice of Divine Philosophy, if we will be sober, but also administers to us great Assistance in it, by culming the turbulencies of. Nature, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to be tossed in tempests, but preparing it a haven, wherein to ride securely. Wherefore God hath herein granted a Priviledge to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102659:15"/>
Mankind.</hi> Again, if a Priest or Bishop must therefore be Unmarried, that he may decline the Cares and Troubles of the World; then certainly with much more reason he ought not to intermeddle in Secular Business, and the Government of whole Provinces. For who can imagine that the government of a single Family involves more care and trouble, than the administration of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? Lastly, I appeal to the Experience of the whole World, Whether the Regulars of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who to their Vow of Continence have added another of Retirement from the World, do not busie themselves in Secular Matters, exercise Merchandise, and heap up Riches, beyond the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England?</hi>

            <p>The Second Reason alledged by our Adversaries, is a certain indecency and impurity in the act of Marriage, which renders it unfitting for a Preist to proceed from the late embraces of his wife to the administration of holy things. So that because the Clergy of the Christian Church do either daily administer the Sacraments, and offer up Scrifices of praise and thansgiving to God, in the name of all the people; or at least ought to be alwaies ready and prepar'd to do it: They ought therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to abstain from conjugal Duties. This was ever the chief Argument and Foundation of Celibacy. Popes and Councils in enjoyning it to the Clergy, seldom make use of any other than this; and all the enemies of Preists Marriage from the times of <hi>Origen</hi> to this day, have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly plac'd it in the front of their Arguments. Yet after all it is a shameful and most foolish Sophism. For, if by this indecency and impurity in the use of Marriage, they mean a moral one; that is absolutely false, and flat He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie: The very opinion of the <hi>Marcionites, Encratites,</hi> and other more absurd Hereticks. But if they mean only a natural impurity, that in no ways renders any man less sit for the Service of God, nor ought to exclude him from the administration of holy things, any more than the other more frequent evacuations of Nature. So gross a conceit is unworthy the simplicity of the Christian Religion, and makes it degenerate into the dregs of Judaism. Besides,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102659:16"/>
if we should suppose a natural impurity somewhat indecent in the Clergy (which yet is foolish to imagine of a secret and hidden impurity, such as this is) yet will it be infinitely outweighed by the inevitable danger of a moral tupitude to which Preists are expos'd by enforc'd Celibacy. Lastly, this Argument of the daily celebration of Mass and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating of the Eucharist, affects not Deacons nor Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons; and is entirely overthrown by the practice of the Church in the Apostolick and Primitive times; when all Baptized Christians daily receiv'd the Eucharist, and yet cannot be suppo'sd either to have been enjoyn'd or have used perpetual abstinence from their wives.</p>
            <p>The Third Reason is the better Oeconomy of the goods and revenues of the Church; which our Adversaries would not have expended upon wife and children, but in publick acts of charity. This might indeed with some pretence be urg'd, if all the unmarried Clergy employed the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of their Revenues upon Piety and Charity, or none of the married Clergy did it, or if the well ordering of Families and good Education and decent provision for children were not of advantage to the Publick. But these are equally false. And then in vain are wives and children removed, when nephews and other relations can gain access. The examples of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the last two hundred years, demonstrates that Popes have employed themselves with greater zeal and fervour to the aggrandizing of their Families, than ever the married Clergy of the Reformed Churches did to the enriching of their Posterity.</p>
            <p>Thus have we examined the pretended advantages of the Clergies Celibacy, and found them to be null and vain. But suppose them valid, and really as great as they are represented to us by our Adversaries. If after all it hath in other respects no less disadvantages, Celibacy will yet remain indifferent, both in its nature and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. To pass by therefore the inconvenience of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy in general, as that it ordinarily produceth Morosness, Pride and Uncharitableness, to say nothing worse, when affected and chosen as a matter of Merit,

               <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> of old obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: I shall consider only the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inconveniences arising from the enforced Celibacy of the Clergy, and mention but Two of them; but those so great and sensible, that each of them infinitely outweigheth all the pretended advantages of it. The First is the inevitable and most certain danger of open Incontinence in many of the Clergy, and thereby introducing a horrible Scandal into the Church of Christ, which may alone more effectually obstruct Piety and Vertue among the Laity, than the Preaching of all together can promote it. For all ignorant Christians, which are the far greater part of the Church, are led more by Examples than Reason, and assent to the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion meerly for the authority of their Pastors that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it. So that the Scandal caused by the Lust of one Incontinent Priest, is more dangerous to the Church, than the Celibacy of an hundred Chaste Priests can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to it. Now that forced Celibacy betrays the Clergy to open Incontinency, let St. <hi>Bernard</hi> speak. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Tolle de ecclesiae honorabile connu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium &amp; torum immaculatum, nonne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eam concubinariis, incestuosis, semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistuis, mollibus, masculorum conoubito<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Second inconvenience of forced Celibacy, is that it deprives the Church of the service of many Pious and Learned Men; who either being already married, will not consent to separate themselves from ther Wives; or being yet single, will not receive Orders upon the terms of Celibacy, as either finding that they have not the Gift of Continency, or doubting whether they shall always have it. The lamentable Effects of this Truth in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> in the Eleventh and Twelfth Ages, we shall afterwards have occasion to mention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:102659:17"/>Lastly, Suppose that Celibacy had all the aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Advantages, and none of the Inconveniences; yet still if Marriage hath peculiar advantages, which Celibacy wants, both will remain indifferent, and neither to be preferred.

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:102659:17"/>Having thus proved that the Celibacy of the Clergy was neither instituted by Christ nor his Apostles, and hath no excellence in it self, or convenience to the Church: I proceed to the Third Proposition, That the Imposition of it upon any Order of men, is unjust and repugnant to the Law of God. And here because the possibility of Continence in all will intervene as the main Question, I will divide my Discourse, and prove,</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. That the Church hath no Authority to Inhibit Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the Clergy, even supposing that all can contain.</item>
               <item>II. That all cannot contain, and consequently that to impose Celibacy upon any Order of men, made up of all Ages, Constitutions and Humours, is directly contrary to Reason, Justice, and the Law of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. First then, the Church hath no Authority to forbid Marriage to the Clergy, even supposing that all men may by due diligence obtain the gift of Continence. This may be evidently deduc'd from what was last proved. For the Church cannot challenge a greater Authority than the Apostles had. But their Authority, as we are assured by <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 8.</note> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was given them only <hi>for Edification and not for Destruction.</hi> Not that the Imposition of Celibacy tends not to the edification of the Church, we have already proved, that it naturally tends to the destruction of many members of the Church is manifest. For in so numerous a Body as the Clergy is, 'tis morally impossible that many of them should not neglect those means whereby the gift of Continence may be acquired, and thereby falling into Inconinency lose their own Souls, and by their Scandal and Example draw many into Perdition with them: Whereas had Marriage been permitted them, both would in all probability have been prevented. Indeed if the edification arising from the imposition or prohibition of any thing indifferent be obvious and evident, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction either none, or dubious and uncertain; or even if the edification be uncertain, so as there be not the least
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102659:18"/>
danger of destruction; or perhaps even although both edification and destruction were equally dubious; the decrees of the Church in all these cases ought to take place: For otherwise a door would be left open for the obstinate contradiction of foolish and unreasonable men. But in this case the edification produced by the Celibacy of the Clergy is, as we have proved, none, or at least, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dubious: Whereas the danger of destruction, which may be caused by it, is most certain, manifest, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Secondly, The Church cannot totally deprive any man of the liberty of enjoying any lawful and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pleasures; nor take from him any of those comforts and benefits, which nature and the right of creation first gave him and intended for him. She may restrain and limit the use of them as to time and place, but can by no means totally abollish it. So the Church may forbid flesh to be eaten, or Marriage to be contracted at some certain seasons of the year; but as she cannot enjoyn to any man a perpetual abstinence from flesh; so neither can she totally forbid Marriage to any order of men. For this is contrary to the very genius and constitution of the Christian Religion; whose peculiar glory is the simplicity of it, and the entire conformity in all the <hi>Agenda</hi> of it to the law of nature. Thirdly, Whatsoever may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for inhibiting Marriage to the unmarried Clergy, the Church most certainly cannot dissolve the Marriage of those, who never made any vow of of continence, and were lawfully married before the prohibition of the Church: Since our Saviour expresly saith <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 19. 6.</note> 
               <hi>What God hath joyned together, let no man put asunder.</hi> Yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did this in the Eleventh and Twelfth Ages, when many Popes and Councils commanded the married Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to be separated from their wives upon pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, not permitting them to retain their wives, by relinquishing their Offices, and retiring into Lay Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: Although the Clergy in their Remonstrance offered to <hi>Nicolas</hi> II. protested that they had never made any vow of Continence, and could not contain without the use of Marriage. I know it is pretended, that the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102659:18"/>
Clergy in receiving Orders, are supposed to have made a Tacite and Interpretative Vow of Chastity. But the vanity of that pretence, I shall manifest immediately. Other Reasons might be produced, but these are sufficient.</p>
            <p n="2">II. All Men cannot contain, and therefore to impose Celibacy upon any Order of Men is injust, and contrary to the Divine Law. For all Persons who cannot contain, have a right to Marry by the Law of Nature, that they may not be necessitated to Sin; and are commanded to Marry by the Law of God. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Cor. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>But if they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, let them Marry: For it is better to Marry, than to Burn.</hi> In imposing Celibacy therefore upon the Clergy, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> forbids many to Marry, whom God commands to do it. Now that all Men cannot contain, appears from this very place of the Apostle, which Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates that in some Persons, there is no Medium between Marriage and Burning; but it is evident beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction from the Reason of this Permission of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age assigned in the precedent Verse: <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ver. 7.</note> 
               <hi>For I would that all Men were even as myself:</hi> (that is, Continent.) <hi>But every Man hath his proper Gift of God; one after this manner, and another after that.</hi> Our Saviour expresly Teacheth the same thing, when to the Apostles objecting; That if the the Case were so, it is not good to Marry. He answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Mat. 19. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>All Men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.</hi> And, <hi>He that is able to receive it, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</hi> God hath obliged himself indeed by Promise, to Confer upon us all Graces necessary for the performance of our Duty, and attainment of Salvation; but the gift of Continence is not of this Nature, since God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Marriage for a remedy of Incontinency; which if we will not make use of, the danger lieth at our own Doors, God is no further obliged. Indeed, if through any Accident, which disables either of the Married Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Marriage fails to be a remedy of Incontinency, (which our Adversaries frequently Object) God must be them supposed to have obliged himself to bestow the gift of Continence when duly asked, because in that case he hath provided no other Remedy. So that the Argument
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102659:19"/>
of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that, <hi>God will not deny this Gift</hi>
               <note place="margin">(c) Sess. 24. Can. 9.</note> 
               <hi>to those that rightly ask it, as having promised, not to suffer us to be tempted above what we are able;</hi> is wholly Impertinent. Since God thereby obliged himself to no more than with the Temptation also to make a way to escape, not that way which we best like, for that is not promised, and is highly unreasonable, but which Himself pleaseth: And that he hath abundantly done, in Assigning the easie and natural way of Marriage. As for <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Argument, That whosoever desireth the gift of Continence, thereby to form a Habit of it, and that God will not be wanting to Crown our honest endeavours with a perfect Possession of it: That is many ways false. For, first, A desire of Continence rather supposeth, that we yet want it. Then it is not an Honest Endeavour to covet all kind of Divine Gifts, but only those which are Necessary; as it would not be laudable now to desire the gift of Tongues, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Ostentation. <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 17.</note> 
               <hi>But as God hath distributed to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man, so let him Walk.</hi> Lastly, God Crowns not all even Honest Desires with with a grant of them. For suppose any Man should out of the abundance of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity desire the gift of Miracles, meerly to cure the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, relieve the Necessities, and remove the Errours of Mankind, without any admixture of Interest or Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein; yet would it be Irrational to expect the performance of it. As for that place (which is urged by some) <hi>I would that all Men were even as myself.</hi> That no more proves the possibility of Continence in all, than that other place: <note n="(e)" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I would that ye all speak with Tongues;</hi> doth, <hi>that all can obtain the gift of Tongues.</hi>

            <p>The Ancients thought the same thing. So St. Ambrose, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Virginitas in voto magis est quam in magisterie. De Virginib. l. 1</note>

               <hi>Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitan</hi> determines, <hi>The Pope, even with the greater part of a Council, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoyn Continence to any Order of Persons after their promotion, if they resist and refuse; because Continence is a thing which can be perswaded, but cannot be commanded.</hi> Upon the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, of the Impossibility of Continence in many, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded most of those many Fathers, whom we shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently produce for the validity of Marriage Contracted after a Vow of Continence. I deny not, that many of the Fathers believed it possible for all to obtain the Gift of Continence; but that doth not in the least prejudice my Argument. For the Church cannot lawfully impose Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy upon any, unless it be a point of Faith, that all can contain; which the Dissent of those Doctors I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready produced, evidently manifest it is not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:102659:20"/>If it be objected, that the acquisition of Continence is possible to all, by the use of frequent Watchings, long Fasts, and other great austerities: I answer, first, it may be perhaps justly questioned, whether it be lawful to afflict the body with those austerities, which are in some Persons necessary to the attainment of Chastity. For the Soul ought sweetly to guide and direct, not tyrannize over the Body; which was given as a Companion, not a Slave to it. Here, as in all other Actions, Reason ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe limits to the government of the Soul. Now such a Mortification as is necessary to destroy Lust in inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Persons, will at the same time destroy their Health, and consequently more hinder the service of God, the practice of Vertue, the exercise of Piety,, than a single Life can promote it, or Marriage would obstruct it. Secondly, If it should be lawful for the Soul voluntarily to exercise this Arbitrary Power upon the Body, yet most certainly it is unlawful for the Church to impose any thing, which will induce a necessity of offering violence to Nature, weakning the energy of the Soul, heaping diseases upon the Body, and dissolving the harmony of Both. Thirdly, All are not able to undergo these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities; and when undergon, they are not always suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prevent Incontinency. The frequent repetition of them, demonstrates this; which would be useless and foolish, if the disease did not as often recurr.

            </p>
            <p>But the great Plea of the Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> remains behind, which must be more largely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed. They pretend that the Church imposeth Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy, or a Necessity of Continence, upon no Man: That she hath annexed it indeed to the four Superior Orders of the Clergy, but then forceth none to enter into those Orders: That the Unlawfulness of the Clergies Marriage, is not so much founded in the Prohibition of the Church, or Incompatibility of Marriage with Holy Orders, as in the Vow of Continence, which all either do make, or are supposed to make, when they receive those Orders. To this I shall Oppose, and in order Prove these Three Propositions.</p>

               <item>I. This Plea cannot justly be used by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor will excuse her Practice.</item>
               <item>II. A Vow of Continence obligeth not in case of insupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Incontinence, and then may not only lawfully, but must necessarily be violated.</item>
               <item>III. Whether lawfully or unlawfully, necessarily or unnecessarily violated, if Marriage be Contracted after a Vow of Continence, it is firm and valid, and cannot be rescinded.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:102659:21"/>I. For the First, That this Plea neither belongs to, nor availeth the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it appeareth many ways. As First, Although it should be granted the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> directly imposeth Celibacy upon none; yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied that she forbiddeth all who have once made a Vow of Continence, ever after to violate it, although in case of Incontinence; when the impossibility of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving it any longer without actual sin, maks the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it become necessary and commanded by the Law of God. Secondly, She hath actually and often imposed Continence upon those who never vowed it; as when she first enjoyned Celibacy to the Clergy, and renewed that Injunction when become obsolete. Nor can she at this day be excused from the same Imposition, since a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous society of Clergymen are necessary to the being and continuance of the Church, and she hath enjoyned Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy to all who will be Members of this Society; although it be uncertain, whether there be so many continent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Church, as are necessarily required to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Ministery of it; much more, whether among all continent Christians there be so many both worthy and willing to receive Orders, as may serve the necessities of the Church. Thirdly, Whether the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands any to make a Vow of Continence, or forbids them to violate it when made? Both equally defeat all the great Advantages and glorious Merits which are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be in Celibacy. For nothing can be either accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or meritorious, which is not purely voluntary, neither commanded nor punished by any human Laws. Otherwise it can never appear, whether the Action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Dictates of the Will, or rather from the Awe of that Command, and the Fear of that Punishment. And therefore St. <hi>Hierom</hi> introduceth Christ thus speaking, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mihi illi Eunuchi placent, quos castravit non necessitas sed voluntas. <hi>l. 1. adv. Jovin.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Those Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs please me, which Will, not Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, hath emasculated.</hi> Whereas in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> none can be admitted into the Four Great Orders, nor yet in the Three Lesser Orders enjoy any Ecclesiastical Benifices or Privileges of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102659:22"/>
unless they Vow perpetual Continence. Nor is it permitted to the former ever to violate their Vow, by Contracting of Marriage, although they should resign their Preferments, and depart from the Execution of their Office. Fourthly, which is chiefly to be respected, It can never appear that any Vow is truly made by those who are ordained, if the Church commandeth all such to make that Vow. For a Vow is the peculiar, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and free act of him that Voweth, as being a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to God, and consisteth in the internal Action of the Soul, which necessarily supposeth an Intention of Vowing. So that if any Person pronouncing the Form of the Vow, should either not mind what he saith, or at the same time resolve the contrary of what he saith; the first is guilty of Negligence, the second of a Lye; but neither can truly be said to have Vowed, and therefore if they afterwards Marry, do violate no Vow. This <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Durandus, Dorbellus, Paludanus,</hi> and other Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do expresly teach; and for this very reason maintain, that Marriage is unlawful to the Clergy, not upon the account of any Vow annexed to their Orders, but meerly for the authority of the Church's Prohibition.</p>
            <p>As for a tacit and interpretative Vow, which many recurr to, supposing a Vow of Continence to be insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annexed to Orders; so that these cannot be received but that at the same time a Vow must be supposed to have been made; that is wholly vain. This refuge was invented as well to avoid the Reason last mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as to solve an Objection drawn from the Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which even for the last Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years have not always required an explicit Vow, nor doth at this day, although many Popes have enjoyned it to be openly and expresly made; but their Decrees meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with great Opposition, they were forced to let them fall, and recurr to this Expedient of an Interpretative Vow. This Vow must be annexed to Orders, either by Divine Right, or only by the Command of the Church. If the former, that were indeed sufficient, but then it is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102659:22"/>
absolutely false, as we proved in the first Proposition; and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Decretam, quo votum an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexum est ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, non qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem proprie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum est. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy. Tom II. l. c. 18.</hi>
               </note> expresly acknowledgeth; and may be further evinced by this Argument, that then neither the Church nor the Pope could grant a Dispensation of Marriage to any of the Clergy. If it be annexed only by Ecclesiastical Right or Command of the Church, then our former Argument will return with more force. For he who in receiving of Orders shall omit to make that tacit Vow, will not be guilty of so much as a Lye or Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. He neglected indeed the command of the Church; but a Vow he neither made, nor pretended to make. So that there remains only a presumptive Vow; the truth of which resides in every mans breast and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: So that none ought to be excluded from Marriage by a Vow, even supposing it valid and inviolable, but those who shall confess they made it. And therefore the Author of the Gloss <note n="(b)" place="margin">Decret. Greg. l. 3. tit. 3. cap. Cum olim.</note> upon the Decretals of <hi>Gregory</hi> IX. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that himself, and many other Doctors with him, cannot imagine how the Clergy of the Western Church can be said to be obliged by Vow to Continence. This were enough to silence the Plea of a tacit Vow: yet I shall add somewhat more, as first, The II. Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> Decrees that none be looked upon to have vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">(c) Cau. 1.</note> Continence, but those who being asked by the Bishop promise it, <hi>Coram tota plebe,</hi> before the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And all Councils which command a Vow to be taken by the Clergy at their Ordination, order it to be made openly in the face of the whole Church.</p>
            <p n="2">Secondly, in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> many were Ordained violently and against their wills. So St. <hi>Augustine</hi>

                  </gap> boni. <hi>Ep. 204.</hi> in init.</note> tells <hi>Donatus, That many were apprehended to be ordained Bishops, kept in bold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their wills, dragged, shut up, and imprisoned, and suffer all this unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till they be forced to receive Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So was St. <hi>Augustine</hi> himself <note n="(e)" place="margin">Possid. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Vit. Aug. ca. 4.</note> seized npon violently by the people of <hi>Hippo,</hi> dragged to their Bishop <hi>Valerius,</hi> and ordained amidst abundance of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102659:23"/>
tears. So <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ordained <hi>Paulinianus</hi> Brother of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> as himself confesleth. For seeing him present at<note place="margin">(a) Epist. ad Jo. Hier inter Hieronym Opp. Tom. II. P. 156.</note> Divine Service, without the least apprehension of any such violence intended against him, he commanded the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to apprehend him, and hold his mouth with their hands, and in that posture ordained him Deacon; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after he had with many Intreaties perswaded him to do somewhat at the Altar belonging to the Office of a Deacon, commanded him to be anew apprehended, and in the same manner ordained him Priest. Now shall such Clergy-men as these be thought to have made a tacit Vow of Continence at their Ordinations, or must they forfeit all right of marrying, or if already married, must their marriage be dissolved, and against their will by the violence of others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Almost all the Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> agree that Children are capable of receiving Holy Orders. Many Examples of it have been seen in that Church; and at this day <note n="(h)" place="margin">Alvarez. Hist. AEthiop.</note> great numbers of Children are ordained Priests and Deacons in the Abyssine Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <note n="(c)" place="margin">Greg. Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. in vita ejus P. 976.</note> 
               <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi> was ordained Bishop of <hi>Neocaesarea</hi> by <hi>Phadimus</hi> of <hi>Amasea,</hi> absent, and not so much as dreaming of it. Now shall either he or those Children be presumed to have made a Vow of Continence at their Ordination, when the first were not capable of making a Vow, the second did not know that he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained?</p>
            <p>Lastly, Supposing this Vow to have been openly and explicitely made, granting it to have been intended, and none of all these many necessary Circumstances wanting, yet will it not oblige, if it be not accepted by God. For that the Vow is made to God, not to the Church, all agree; so that if it be not accepted by God, it becomes only a simple Resolution of the Mind, which every man hath a right to change as he shall see good. Now we cannot be assured God accepts this Vow, unless it be either for some excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and holiness in Celebacy, or because himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, both which we before disproved. Nay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102659:23"/>
seeing it draws many into open Incontinency, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth all to the danger of it, it is prejudicial to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, to imagine that he accepts, much less delights in such Vows: At least there is no promise of acceptance, and therefore the Obligation of these Vows will ever be uncertain.</p>
            <p>I pass to the Second Proposition, that a Vow of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence obligeth not in case of insuperable Incontinence. For no man can be obliged by Vow, or even the greatest Authority upon Earth to commit a sin, which in this case will be inevitable, unless the Vow be violated. And that cases of insuperable Incontinence without the use of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage may and do often happen, I proved before, when I demonstrated that all cannot contain. And certainly if in temporal Affairs no Vow, Contract or Promise obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in case of a natural impossibility, much more will it not oblige in case of moral impossibility; by how much the Vertues of the Soul are of more concern than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of the Body. But I will not further enlarge upon this Argument, which is in it self so evident; I choose rather to observe, that it is highly probable that not only in case of impossibility, but even of great and apparent difficulty a Vow of Continence ceaseth to oblige. For first, all the Defenders of the Pope's dispensing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proceed upon this foundation, that Circumstances may alter the Obligation of a Vow; and that when a greater good is to be attained, it ceaseth to oblige. And indeed this is highly reasonable: For if circumstances can alter the nature of Actions as to Vice and Vertue, which is on all hands granted, then a Vow which in some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be laudable, or at least lawful, may in others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unlawful, or at least not obligatory. Now in case of violent, although perhaps not insuperable, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Incontinence after a Vow of Chastity, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of him that Vows are altered; and by violating the Vow, a greater good may be attained, serenity of Mind, freedom from unruly Passions, and an escape from the danger of Sin. Not in this only, but in many other cases also, the diversity of circumstances may change the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102659:24"/>
Obligation of a Vow. Whence <hi>Aquinas</hi> determines, That <note n="(a)" place="margin">Quia in his quae ad seipsum pertinent de facili fallitur homo in judicanda, talia vota congruentius secundum arbitrium su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioris sunt vel servanda vel prae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in matters belonging to himself, a Man is easily deceiv'd in judging; it is most fit such Vows should be either ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served or omitted, according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his Superiour, yet so, that if any great or manifest inconvenience should arise from the observation of such a Vow, and there were no opportunity of recurring to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, a Man ought not to keep such a Vow.</hi> Secondly, It is acknowledged even in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that a Vow of Continence made by one married Person without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the other, is null and void, and that because of the danger of Incontinency, to which the other party is thereby exposed. Wherefore <note n="(b)" place="margin">Lib. 9. Ep. 44.</note>

But if the danger of another's Damnation produced by a Vow of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, can dissolve the Obligation of it, certainly much more will the danger of any one's own Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produce the same effect.

               <hi>Salas</hi> the Jesuite teacheth, That a Fryar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd of any approved Order, who shall have a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Divine Revelation, that God dispenseth with his Vow to enable him to Marry, may Marry, and make use of this probable, though doubtful Dispensation; certainly he who after Continency Vowed in the taking of Orders, shall find himself assaulted with any grievous temptations of Incontinence, may make use of the same remedy, having more than a probable, even a plain and undoubted Revelation of the Lawfulness of it, in those words, <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 2, 9.</note>

For Marriage is a thing of Natural and Divine Right, whose continuance, when once Contracted, is commanded by the Laws of God, and first Principles of Reason; whereas Vows of Continence are but of human Instituion, as we have proved; or at the most, but of Evangelical Counsel, as all our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries confess; and therefore must in all cases give place to a matter of Natural Right, and Divine Preeept. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Apu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This distinction is wholly vain: For that External Act addeth nothing Essential to the Vow; and although a Solemn Vow only can subject any Man to the Censures of the Church, and Punishment of the State, yet a Simple Vow doth equally oblige in Conscience; so that all the use that can be made of such a distinction, is this, that such a Contract is not valid in the present Canon or Civil-Law, although it be a true Marriage in the Eyes of God, which is sufficient for our purpose, and will make the annulling of it to be unlawful in the Sight of God, although lawful in Human Judicatures. However, the contrary of this, was the only thing which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> adventured to define in the Cause of Celibacy, most unhappy in their Choice; for that in all the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Questions of Vows, Marriage and Celibacy, there is none more apparently false, nor any one opposed by so constant and uninterrupted a Tradition from the Apostles Times to the Days of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> when such Marriages were first declared to be null and void, if we except two

or three obscure or inconsiderable Councils about the Year D. CCCC. All the Fathers before that time, who treat of this Matter, not one excepted, allow their vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; and even after that time, all the more Famous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Canonists till the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Councils indeed, after the Year D. ordered those who had Contracted such Marriages, to be separated from each other; but that was not for any invalidity, which they supposed to be in those Marriages, but in way of Penance, to expiate the guilt of the Violation of their Vows, and the Scandal given to the Church; as may appear from all those Canons which <note n="(b)" place="margin">Loc. cit.</note> 
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth in Defence of the Decree of <hi>Trent.</hi> Sometimes also a Separation of such Married Persons was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or rather permitted, only thereby to enable the Man to be re-admitted into the Ministry. As for the Council of<note n="(c)" place="margin">Can. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> commanding all who Contract Marriage after a Vow of Continence, to be Excommunicated, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who might have added many such like Canons of other Councils. They rather prove the validity of these Marriages, because contented to inflict the Punishment of Excommunication, they proceed not to a Dissolution of them; especially since the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in the close of that Canon, leaveth to every Bishop a Power of Remitting even that Punishment. But that Excommunication doth not suppose the invalidity of these Marriages, evidently appears from the Canons of all those many Councils (as <hi>Aurelianense</hi> II. Can. 19. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernense</hi> Can. 6. <hi>Toletanum</hi> IV. Can. 63. <hi>Nicaenum</hi> Can. <hi>Arab.</hi> 53. <hi>Arelatense</hi> I. Can. 11.) which Excommunicated those Christians which Married Jews or Gentiles; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though none will deny those Marriages to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly valid, and further ordered the Married Persons to be separated; which also proves, that a Sentence of Separation doth not simply imply the invalidity of any Marriage.</p>
            <p>To manifest then the constant Tradition of the Church to have been contrary to the Definition of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> I might produce a long Bead-roll of Councils, Popes,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102659:25"/>
and Emperours, who in the their Canons, Decrees, and Laws, have inflicted upon the Clergy, who Married after a Vow of Continence, no other punishment than that of Degradation, and some no more than an Incapacity of rising to higher Dignities in the Church. All these by permitting the use of such Marriages must necessarily be supposed to have owned the validity of them. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Authority, however certain, yet is indirect; I will content myself with those, who if not <hi>in terminis,</hi> yet at least directly, assert the validity of these Marriages. I begin then with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who giveth these Instructions to <hi>Timothy</hi> concerning the Deaconnesses of the Church: <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 9, 11, 12, 14.</note>

               </gap>, which is too severely tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated) <hi>because they have cast off their first faith; I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that these marry.</hi> These Deaconnesses were Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, chosen out of the Widdows, to attend the Service of the Church; who, maintained with the Revenues of the Church, were with some peculiar Ceremonies set apart, and as it were Ordained to that Office; whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and the Custom of the Church permitted not to Marry again, because thereby they must have quitted their Offices, and so defeated the end of their solemn Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Church; or as the Apostle termeth, <hi>have cast off their first faith.</hi> In taking upon them therefore this Office, they obliged themselves not to Marry again, and therefore as to a Vow of Continence, were in the same condition with the Clergy of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now at this time in the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> some young Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows had imprudently been chosen into the number of Deaconesses, who either not being able or not willing to contain, had some of them Married, and others (as the Apostle seems to imply) had given Scandal by their loose carriage. The Apostle therefore ratifies the Marriages of those who were already Married, and giveth free leave to the rest to Marry.

               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:102659:29"/>Having thus dispatched the Controversial, I pass to the Historical part of my Design; and therein will evince, that the Celibacy of the Clergy was looked upon as a thing Indifferent in the Two first Centuries, Proposed in the Third, Magnified in the Fourth, and in some Places Imposed in the Fifth, yet so, as that even that Imposition did infinitely differ from the present Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> that however Commanded in some Provinces of the <hi>West,</hi> it was no where univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally Practised; that in a few Ages this Imposition became obsolete; this Yoke intolerable, and Marriage univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally prevailed, till condemned and forbidden by the Popes of the Eleventh Age; that even their Decrees and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons became ineffectual by an universal Opposition of the whole Church; and the lawfulness of Marriage in the Clergy was aftewards allowed and permitted by many Popes, and one General Council of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; that all this while Celibacy never was imposed or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church from the Apostles time; but the Imposition of it was rejected by one, and condemned by another Council of the Universal Church; and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not even in the <hi>West,</hi> till the Ambition and Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Popes drawing to themselves the Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all greater Ecclesiastical Preferments, Poverty became necessary to the Married Clergy; which caused Marriage to be wholly laid aside by them about Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before the Reformation. The Proof of these things shall be the Subject of the remaining part of my Discourse. But first I shall premise these few Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Although the Ancient Church should have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, or universally practised Celibacy, yet the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that Law, and Authority of that Example, would be no reasonable, much less necessary Motive to the present Church to continue the Imposition; since the Reasons which might have induced the Antients to enjoyn or use it, are long since ceased. Those Reasons were to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102659:29"/>
make the Clergy more ready and willing to renounce the Pleasures of the World, and suffer Martyrdom in Times of Persecution, and by their brave Example incite the Laity to the same generous Constancy of Mind. In the flourishing and peaceable Times of the Churches, there could be no other reason of enjoyning it, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an extraordinary Veneration to the Clergy, by their Abstinence from permitted Pleasures, and thereby facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and promote the common Edificacion of the Church. As for the Reasons of some Admirers of Celibacy, who were led aside with false Prejudices, and pre-conceived Errours; they vanish together with the detection of their falsity, and do no longer oblige than those Errours are maintained. But as for the other more solid Reasons, Providence has annulled the first, by giving rest unto the Church; and an universal decay of Piety, as well in Clergy as Laity, hath defeated the second: Since what perhaps was before Exemplary, is now become a Scandal to the whole Christian World.

For first, we see that by this Decree Chastity and Continence is so far from being promoted in the Clergy, that thereby a door is rather opened to all kind of Lust and Villany: and Coveteousness in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy so far from being restrained by it, that it seems hence to have received no small encrease.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. To Confute our Adversaries pretence of Antiquity, and establish my Design, it is sufficient to produce the Authority of some Fathers, who thought the Imposition of Celibacy unlawful or inconvenient to the Church; to alledge the Testimony of some Historians, assuring us that Marriage was in their Time used indifferently by the Clergy; and propose the Examples of some
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102659:30"/>
Married Clergy: Althogh some Fathers and Writers were of a contrary Opinion, or the greater part of the Clergy perhaps practised Celibacy. For this will undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prove, that both Marriage and Celibacy were left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to all; that neither was a Point of Faith, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Christ or his Apostles. or a matter of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Practice. Whereas our Adversaries pretending herein to an uninterrupted Tradition, and constant Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the whole Church in all Ages, must to that end produce a perfect consent of all Doctors, Historians and Writers; and an universal Practice of all Times. If any one Writer occur, not condemned; or any one Example not censured by the Church; the Plea of Tradition must fall. Some indeed of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> and <hi>Cassander,</hi> pretended not to so Universal a Tradition and Practice; but then they were so far from Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the present Constitutions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Authority of the Antients, that they were open Enemies to the Imposinion of Celibacy. However, the Dissent of ancient Doctors and Councils, and the diverse Practices of private Clergymen, will manifestly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, that Celibacy was neither universally imposed nor practised in the Ancient Church, as it is at this day in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but that, as well as Marriage, left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different both to Clergy and Laity, if not in some particular Provinces, yet at least in the Universal Church.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The numbers of the Married Clergy in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, ought not to be estimated only from the accounts of them which we find in Ecclesiastical History of Monuments of Antiquity. For the Relation of Wives or Children, add neither Ornament nor Use to History, nor have any part in it, unless upon extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which rarely happen. It concerns not Posterity to know, whether <hi>Aristotle</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> were Married; since neither Marriage nor Celibacy will inhaunce their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or diminish their Worth. And if mention of Wives be rarely found in Civil, much less will it in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102659:30"/>
History. For Women sometimes bear a share in Civil Matters; but in publick Acts of Religion, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Church, it is even unlawful for them to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle. So that if but a few Examples of Marriage in the Clergy of the Ancient Church can be produced; we may thence reasonably conclude, that the Married Clergy were then very numerous.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Reader may observe, that almost all those places, which we shall produce out of the Ancient Doctors for the lawfulness of Marriage in the Clergy, and against the Imposition of it, are taken either from their dogmatical Treatises, which were written delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and in a sedate temper of Mind; or from their Harangues of Virginity, where the very force of Truth extorted from them those Confessions. Whereas the Testimonies made use of by our Adversaries, for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity or Convenience of Celibacy in the Clergy, are for the most part drawn either from these Encomiastick Discourses of Virginity, where they employed all the force of their Eloquence to magnisie the Merits of that State, and recommend it to the World; or from their Polemick Writings against the Adversaries of Celibacy, wherein they were more intent to Destroy Errour, than Establish Truth. And no wonder, if in both these Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, corrupted with Prejudice, or transported with Passion, they bent the Bow to much, and receded from that Exactness of Truth, which is seated in the middle way.</p>
            <p>To these Observations, I may add the Confession of many Great Men in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> who allow Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy, neither to have been imposed, nor universally practised in the Antient Church. To pass by then <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander, Erasmus,</hi> and the more moderate Divines of that Church, I will produce only <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Mendosa;</hi> the last <note n="(a)" place="margin">De consirm.

            <p>However, Celibacy and the Merits of Virginity, began to be highly extolled, and gained great Reputation in the Third Age. Many Causes concurred to advance this Reputation, as the Convenience of the Church at that time, the Mistakes of Catholick, and Artifices of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102659:35"/>
I shall begin with the last, and observe, that in all the numerous train of Heresies, from the Apostles time to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> scarce was there any one which did not condemn Marriage, or at least decry the Dignity of it, and cry up Celibacy as the most Perfect and most Vertuous state, and the nearest way to Heaven. Which alone is no small Prejudice to the Doctrine and Practice of the present Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Excellencies of Celibacy were unknown to the World, till discovered by the grossest and most foolish Hereticks that ever infected the Christian Church. I do not hereby accuse the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of their Heresie, yet cannot but take notice, that in urging Celibacy to her Clergy, she proceeds upon the same Principles with them, a greater Perfection, and more refined Piety, an unusal abstinence from all Pollutions of the Flesh, and Pleasures of the World: That some of them enjoyned not Celibacy to all their Followers, but only persuaded it to those who aimed at Perfection; and that the Heresie of <hi>Eustathius,</hi> condemned by the Council of <hi>Gangra,</hi> was <hi>in terminis</hi> revived by the Popes and Councils of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Age.</p>

the ambition of a Christian to surmount all the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Flesh, and by afflicting of it intirely subject it to the Soul: not to yeild to the unruly Passions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but rather by such a Mortification increase the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Soul with Faith and Knowledge. Nor were these their only Reasons: They also pretend to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and although immediately after the Apostles deaths, intitled their horrid Doctrines to those Sacred Names; and to confirm their Plea forged Gospels, Acts, and Histories under the Apostles names, injurious to Marriage, and consonant to their own Opinions. But so gross a Heresie, however, backed with great and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences, survived not the middle of the Third Age. When that declined, other more subtil and refined Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks arose in their stead, who indirectly and obliquely oppose Marriage, yet upon the same topick of greater Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Perfection. Thus the Montanists condemned all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriages; and reviled the Catholicks, who defended them, with the opprobious Title of <hi>Pry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>hici</hi> or Carnal Men. Thus the Novatians revolted from the Church, and accused her of licentionsness, because she admitted to Communion those Digamists, who after a Divorce of one Wife, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever cause, even for that of Adultery, had married another. Lastly, thus the Manichees, although enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Celibacy to none, nor forbidding Marriage to any, through a mistaken Impurity in the use of it, excluded all married Persons from the rank of their Elect, or more perfect Christians, and permitted it only to their Hearers, or inferiour order of their Sect. And when all these He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies were every where exploded by the Catholick Church; the Reputation of Celibacy still found entertainment in the World, as being more speciously and cunningly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, especially by the <hi>Eustathian</hi> Hereticks, who aflixed it only to the Clergy, and refused to communicate with married Priests, imagining the Sacraments by them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred to be wholly ineffectual.</p>
            <p>Thus did the Celibacy of the Clergy gradually advance from a gross and foolish Heresie to a regular and well

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102659:37"/>
into the Minds of Men; and although they could not cause it to be universally condemned, yet at least pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it to be generally despised. And indeed never did any Heresie prevail in the Church, which did not leave some tincture of it self, even in the Minds of Catholicks. Thus it may be observed, that there is not one Writer in the Fifth Age, wherein some touch either of Pelagianism, or Predestinatism may not be discovered. How far the Heresie of these Encratites prevailed, and secretly corrupted the Judgment of Catholicks, I shall next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>First then, The Relicks of the <hi>Eustathian</hi> Heresie so far prevailed among the Catholicks, that many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it highly indecent for him to meddle with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Sacred Things, who indulged himself the liberty of Marriage, as if he had contracted some Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereby, and made himself unworthy of the holy Office: an Errour common to all the Patrons of Celiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which proceeded so far in the time of <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> that many would not willingly receive Baptism, or the Eucharist from married Priests; but much farther in the time of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> and once again advanced into the formal Heresie of the Eustathians. From the Montanists the Catholicks received their dislike of second Marriages, one of the most palpable Errours of Antiquity; since what the Apostle expresly alloweth, and in some Cases adviseth, most of the Ancients decry as scandalous and inconvenient, oft-times as a tolerable Evil, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even as a grievous sin. <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath written whole Books against it. <hi>Athenagoras<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Many other erroneons Opinions obtained in the antient Church, which proceeded from no other cause but this.

               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:102659:38"/>Such weaknesses of the Antients had deserved indeed to be buried in Oblivion; if they had not influenced their Practice, and laid the Foundations of an Errour, which continueth even to this day, that Marriage is a state Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting, and Celibacy therefore Necessary to the Clergy: An Opinion first taken up upon those Prejudices which we have just now mentioned, and maintained upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of those who are led away with these Mistakes. So that to take away the Plea of Antiquity from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the case of Celibacy, it were sufficient to shew, that the Antients received and embraced it meerly for the sake of these Prejudices and Mistakes: Which we have already done. For these were the great and only Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Celibacy, for the first Thousand years; while none were yet so foolish as to imagin it to be of Divine or Apostolical Institution. The pre-conceived Opinions of the impurity of Marriage in all, and great indecency of it in those who administred Holy things, tended di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to introduce the Celibacy of the Clergy. For these Reasons, <note n="(e)" place="margin">Unde mihi videtur quod illius so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius est sacrificium offerre indesinens, qui indesinenti &amp; perpetuae se devoverit casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiati. <hi>Hom. 28. in Num.</hi>

               <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who were the only Orthodox Writers before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> who openly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Celibacy of the Clergy to their Marriage, desired it might be introduced. For they rather faintly wished the thing, than dogmatically used it; and by their Wishes manifest, that it was not yet introduced. As for their unreasonable prejudice against Digamy, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed no less to the cause of Celibacy, than the other Mistakes, For the unlawfulness of Digamy once sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, the force of the Apostles Precept of Marriage to all who could not contain, became wholly enervate; since a Man is no less subject to Incontinence after enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Wife for some few years, perhaps days, than he was before he ever married. Besides, all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of Celibacy failed not to make use of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That if Second Marriage be unlawful or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the Laity, even First Marriage will be so to the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102659:39"/>
Clergy; it being usual for them who disallowed Second Marriage in all, to think First Marriage only a tolerable evil, and permitted in some; as Divorce was formerly to the Jews. And then it was a natural order of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, first to forbid Second, and then all Marriage to the Clergy. Therefore we may observe, that in the beginning of the Third Age,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ad Uxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. l. 1. c. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> affirms Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy to have been forbidden to the Clergy both by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Tradition, aud the Discipline of the Church, and to be generally discussed by them in his time, as a scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Imperfection, if not a Crime. But we no where find Marriage forbidden to the Clergy, till the time of the Apostolick Canons, first published in the end of this, or beginning of the next Age.</p>
            <p>These Mistakes and Prejudices, and Reasons of Celiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy founded upon them, were common to both Churches; but there was one Reason peculiar to the Western Church, which however it may seem light, was of great efficacy: and that was the unhappy Fall of <hi>Tertullian</hi> into Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism. That Great and Learned Person, naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with an ardent Genius, of a severe and inflexible temper of Mind, infinitely zealous for all outward appearances of religious Mortification, and after his Fall prompted with that Enthusiastick Spirit, which was the peculiar Character of the Montanists, set himself to advance the Opinion of his Sect with all imaginable vigour. The unlawfulness of Digamy, was the chief Tenet of that Sect, and that founded upon an erroneous Supposition of some Imperfection in the Use even of First Marriage. In maintaining and recommending these Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to the World, <hi>Tertullian</hi> employed all the force of his Wit and Eloquence to debase the dignity of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and extoll the merits of a Single-life, whether Widowhood or Virginity. The extraordinary reverence and esteem which his great Learning and apparent Zeal procured to him in succeeding Ages, mightily propagated his Errours, and corrupted his Readers with false Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and Notions of Marriage and Virginity. For altho' it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102659:39"/>

               </note> 
               <hi>Hierome</hi> once said, when pressed hard with his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, He was a Schismatick, no Writer of the Church: Yet few considered that; the persuasive force of his Eloquence was more sensible than the remembrance of his Schism; and then few enquired which Books he writ before, and which after his Fall; or rather it was a common Errour, that he writ very few after, and almost all before his Fall. Whereas in truth he writ before his Fall only the Three little Treatises of Baptism, Repentance, and Prayer; not the Twentieth part of his Works now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. To this Reputation of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and the ill Effects of it, contributed not a little the infinite esteem and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had for his Writings; while unwary Persons imagined, that the deference, which that blessed Martyr paid to his Learning and Zeal, was an effect of the soundness and orthodoxy of his Doctrine. However, certain it is, that the Fall of <hi>Tertullian</hi> advanc'd and encreas'd the former Prejudices; and this I take to be the only reason, why Celibacy ever prevailed more in the Western than in the Eastern Church.</p>
            <p>All these Prejudices were in themselves unlawful. But there were other Reasons of preferring Celibacy in the Ancient Church; which might have been allowed, if not attended with such fatal Consequences. And first, many Catholicks openly espoused the cause of Celibacy, and others winked at their Policy, meerly to prevent the Delusion of more simple Catholicks, by the no less glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than fraudulent Pretences of the <hi>Encratites:</hi>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102659:40"/>
very Perfection, which the Hereticks so much boasted of, and the Multitude were apt to admire, as being always casier led with great Pretences, than sober Truth. A not unlike Policy with this, was afterwards used by<note n="(b)" place="margin">Socrat. l. 6. c. 8.</note> St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> against the <hi>Arians;</hi> when fearing the People would be seduced by their Enthusiastical singing of Hymns, he set up the same way of singing of Hymns among the Catholicks, and thereby prevented the design of the <hi>Arians;</hi> a Stratagem, as the<note n="(c)" place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> Historian obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, and may be applied to our case; which however specious, was the Occasion of very ill Consequences.</p>
            <p>While Celibacy thus gained ground by the Artisice of Hereticks, and Connivance of Catholicks, few interposed themselves to undeceive Mankind, and stop the torrent of these vulgar Prejudices; as well because the immoderate esteem of Celibacy seem'd a Matter of no great moment, while it was forcibly imposed upon none, nor made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to any; as because the dis-favour and unjust suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of the Multitude would probably have attended such an undertaking: While unreasonable Men would have esteemed such a Person as a Libertine, an Enemy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and more severe Religion, and thought him to have therein pleaded only for his own Passions and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And when Celibacy became once universally esteemed, and great numbers of Lay-men vowing Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, voluntarily abstained from Marriage, who by their supposed Sanctity and specious Abstinence, drew to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the eyes and admiration of all Men; the Clergy also were necessitated to make some advances in the Use of Celibacy, that they might not suffer loss of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and seem less Vertuous and Spiritual than Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Hence St. <hi>Hierome</hi> frequently urgeth the Celibacy of the Clergy, by the Example of Lay-Virgins, affirming it to be highly indecent that the Laity should exceed the Clergy even in voluntary Acts of Piety and Mortification. This Reason afterwards received great advantage from the wonderful encrease of Monkery, and Vows of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102659:40"/>

               <hi>Faustus</hi> the <hi>Manichee</hi> objected to St. <hi>Austin,</hi> that the immoderate Commendation of Virginity had among the Catholicks produced this Effect, that in all their Churches there seem'd to be a greater number of professed Virgins, than mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Women. No wonder then, if Reverence attending the unmarried, and Contempt the married Clegry, Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy prevailed in the Church, and Marriage by being dis-esteeemed became also dis-used; especially since Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition contributed not a little to it. For from the end of the Fourth Age, the Bishops and greater Clergy were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally chosen out of the Monks, and thereby Celibacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the nearest way to Preferment.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Third Age; the frequent Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of that time, did not a little advance the Cause of Celibacy; it being highly convenient to the Church, that the Clergy should shew an Example of Constancy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to all other Christians, which it was believed they would more readily perform, when freed from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances of a married state, and not with-holden with the temptations of Wife and Children. For the fury of the Heathen Persecutors generally fell most heavy upon the Clergy, and sometimes was directed against them only: So that to be promoted to any eminent Place in the Church, was to be exposed to certain Martyrdom. For this reason, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> somewhere relates, in the Choice of Bishops, single Persons were commonly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before married Men, in Times of Persecution. And then Celibacy was no grievous and intolerable burthen, when attended with a continual Expectation of Death, and being hurried away to Execution. To which may be added, that few were then received into the Priesthood, but aged Men, who by a long course of Vertue, had given sufficient proof of their Continence and unspotted Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity. Whereas in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Boys were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Profess or make a Vow of Continence at Fourteen,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102659:41"/>
Girls at Twelve years of age, till the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which reduced it to Sixteen.</p>
            <p>All these Reasons concurred in the First Ages, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the esteem of Celibacy, and prejudice the Marriage of the Clergy. The way was opened, by forbidding Second Marriage to the Clergy, and receiving none into Holy Orders, who had married twice after Baptism. For if a Man married once before, and again after Baptism, he was commonly reputed no Digamist. This Prejudice against Second Marriage encreased so far, that all were made uncapable of Holy Orders, who had married Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; lest they should seem to countenance thereby the supposed scandal of Digamy. I mean not hereby, that Second Marriage was forbidden to the Clergy by any Council, or Orders denied to all Digamists, none excepted; for neither the one nor the other of those Suppositions is true, but only that it became the general and ordinary practice of the Church, not to permit Second Marriage to those already ordained, nor Orders to those already twice married. In the same manner a Custom was introduced, and by the end of the Third Age established in the Church, that the Clergy might indeed freely retain their Wives married before the reception of Orders, but not marry after Orders once received. Not that this was yet forbidden by any Canon, nor practised without Exception, (for the contrary of that we shall immediately demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,) but only was the usual and more ordinary Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church: Whence both the Prohibition of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy, and Marriage after Orders to the Clergy, were inserted among the Apostolical Canons, wherein that is the Sixteenth, this the Twenty fifth <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Canon. These Apostolical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons were not the Constitutions of any Council, much less Precepts and Institutions of the Apostles, but only the Customs and Usages of the Eastern Church, in the end of the Third and beginning of the Fourth Age; which seem to have been collected about that time by some private Hand, however then authorized by the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102659:41"/>
Use, and afterwards confirmed by the Decree of the Church.</p>
            <p>This Custom of the Ancient Church, however it may seem almost equivalent to an Imposition of Celibacy, was yet far from it. For first it was not so strict and universal, as to admit no Exception. Marriage was permitted to many, even after the reception of Orders, as we shall shew by and by from the Canon of <hi>Ancyra;</hi> and allowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to all, if they receded from the Execution of their Office, and returned to Lay-Communion in order to it; as we shall also hereafter prove. Secondly, If any Person to be ordained were not yet married, and did in the least suspect he should not be able afterwards to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain without Marriage; he was not only permitted, but even advised by the Church, first to Marry, and then to receive Orders: So that they frequently married, whilest Candidates of the Priesthood, and already designed to that Holy Office, perhaps but some few days before their admittance into it. So the Sixth General Council renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this very Apostolick Canon, forbid any to marry after Orders once received; and adds, <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Can. 6.</note> 
               <hi>But if any one who comes to be ordained, hath a mind to joyn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto a Wife with the bond of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, let him do it before he be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Deacon, or Sub-deacon, or Priest, and then- receive Orders.</hi> Thirdly, By allowing to the Clergy the free Use of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage contracted before their Ordination, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged both the lawfulness and decency of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, whether contracted before or after Ordination. For if there be any indecency in Marriage, which makes it unbecoming the dignity and holiness of the Priesthood, it must be in the Use of it, as all confess; and if so, the Use of Marriage, contracted before as well as after Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, will become indecent. For the Contract itself is a thing most honest and decorous, so far from carrying any impurity and indecency along with it, that the Churh of <hi>Rome</hi> believeth it to be a Sacrament. What were the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102659:42"/>
particular Reasons why the Antient Church permitted to the Clergy the Use of the one Marriage, and disallowed the other, may be probably reduced from what we have already said. For those Men who were led away by the Mistakes and Prejudices produced in the Church by the Heresie of the <hi>Encratites,</hi> endeavoured at least to introduce this Custom; when they despaired of a total Abrogation of the Clergies Marriage, and perhaps thought that into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable in itself, or inconvenient to the Church. And then those who otherwise clearly perceived the falshood of these Prejudices, contented themselves with silence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at the Introduction of this Custom, as well for fear of a Popular Odium and Dis-esteem, as because they were convinced by the Reasons last mentioned, that such a Custom, if it proceeded no farther, was little less than equivalent to a total Permission of Marriage. To which may be added, that the Rites of Marriage being anciently, especially among the Greeks, always celebrated with great Riot and Luxury, continued for many days together; it was thought unbefitting the gravity of a Clergyman to be present at, much more to be chief Actor in such licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Solemnities. Upon which account, the Councils of <note n="(a)" place="margin">Can. 54.</note>

               <hi>Quinisext</hi> Council restrained that Prohibition only to the Iudicrous and more trifling part of the Solemnity.</p>
            <p>In some of the Clergy, these Prejudices of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Celibacy, and the Inconvenience of Marriage to the dignity of their Order, prevailed so far, that upon pretence of Continence and greater Purity, they sequestred their Wifes, although unwilling, from their bed, and sometimes from their society. The superstitious and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous conduct of these Men was universally condemned and censured by the Church: Whence among the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Canons, this is one; <note n="(d)" place="margin">

            <p>In the beginning of the Fourth Age, Celibacy received great Advances from the increase of Errours and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices taken up in the former Age, and the length and a sharpness of the last Prosecution begun by <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and continued by <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> which infused melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly thoughts into all Christians, and an unusual reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for all shews of Austerity and Mortification. Then was Marriage first forbidden to Priests and Bishops after Ordination by a judiciary Act of the Church, but that formed in a Provincial and inconsiderable Council, whose Canons were never taken notice of, or ratified by any subsequent Councils, or even Popes, till the midst of the Ninth Age: I mean the Council of <hi>Neocasarea,</hi> which in the year 314. made this Canon, <note n="(e)" place="margin">

That this Canon forbids not the use of Wives married before Ordination. 2. That it forbids not to Deacons and Subdeacons to contract Marriage even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ordination. 3. That it manifestly distinguisheth between Fornication and Marriage after Ordination. 4. That it doth not command a Separation from Wives so Married, but only a dimission of the holy Office.</p>
            <p>However, the pretentions of Celibacy received no small check from the Council of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> held the same year: A Council of far greater Esteem and Authority, which was ratified and confirmed by many subsequent Councils and Popes, particularly by <hi>Leo</hi> the First, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Apud <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <note n="(d)" place="margin">Can. 1.</note> in the year 531. To which we may add what Sir <hi>H.

            <p>The Decree of <hi>Ancyra</hi> was indeed favourable to the Marriage of the Clergy, but the restless Importunities and scandalous Practices of the Sectatours of Celibacy obliged the Church to proceed yet farther, and declare it self more openly in favour of their Marriage.

               </gap>, it will not be here inconvenient to speak somewhat of the Book <hi>de Singularitate Clericorum,</hi> which we just now cited. This Book, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in its Title it may seem to oppose the Marriage of the Clergy, is one of the most pregnant Evidences of the Use of it in the Ancient Church, that is now extant. It is by some ascribed to <hi>Origen,</hi> by others to St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> but by most to St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> However, all Learned Men now agree, that it belongs to none of them. The late Learned Editors of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Works, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> conjecture it to have been written about the time of <hi>Bede.</hi> Rather it was most certainly written before the middle of the Fifth Age, because the Author of it makes use of the old <hi>Italick</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which was in use in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church before St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>'s Translation. Most probably therefore it was writ in the Fourth Age. The scope of it is to decry and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the abuse of House-keepers, which (as the Author saith) <note n="(n)" place="margin">Non du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant sine faemi. nae sodalitate dormtre.</note> was then become so scandalous in the Church, that the unmarried Clergy <hi>could not endure to sleep without the company of a Woman.</hi> If in the heat of Disputation he lets fall any thing injurious to Marriage, it is such as opposeth no less the Marriage of the Laity than of the Clergy; and indeed the former part of the Treatise is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102659:47"/>
nothing else but a Satyr against Women. But the design of the Author, and the lawfulness and use of the Clergies Marriage in his time, may be evidently collected from many places. I will produce one or two of them, premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this Observation, that the Author ranks those Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men also among the <gap reason="foreign">

And this he said, being himself unmarried, and brought up from his Youth in a Monastick and Ascetick Life.

By House-keepers, the Canon, which is the Third of that Synod, meaneth Women taken into the houses of unmarried Clergymen, and dwelling with them.</hi> Lastly, to omit the Confession of other Learned Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, <note n="(d)" place="margin">De consirm.

               <hi>Mendoza</hi> not only granteth, but proveth, that in this Canon, House-keepers were forbidden only to those Clergymen, who never had married Wives, or had lost them by death.</p>
            <p>The Determination of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> settled the Matter, and put an end to the Controversie about Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy in the Eastern Church. Thence forward is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Silence in the Acts of the Eastern Synods, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Marriage or Celibacy of the Clergy, till the <hi>Quini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ext</hi> Council in the Year 692. where Bishops were forbidden the Use of Marriage, which till then was permitted to them as well as to the inferiour Clergy. Of that Council we shall speak more largely hereafter. In the mean while, the general Custom which obtained in the Eastern Church, of permitting to the Clergy the Use of Marriage contracted before, but not after Ordination, received some little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation. Three several ways, which deserve to be next ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. First then, A total abstinence of the Clergy from<note place="margin">Socrat. l. 5. c. 22</note> their Wives, was introduced into the Province of <hi>Thessaly</hi> by <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Trica,</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Arcadius,</hi> in the end of the Fourth, or beginning of the Fifth Age. So that the Clergy accompanying with their Wives after Ordination, were deposed. The same Custom obtained in the Provinces of <hi>Thessalonica, Achaia,</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> in the time of <hi>Socrates,</hi> in the middle of the Fifth Age,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102659:49"/>
but in no other Part of the Eastern Church, as he obesrveth. How long this Custom continued in any of these Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is uncertain. Secondly, Towards the end of the Fourth Age, it became very usual for Bishops both in the Eastern and Western Church, when they were assumed to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, publickly to Vow perpetual Abstinence from their Wives. This they did <hi>voluntarily, not necessitated to it by any Law,</hi> as <note n="(a)" place="margin">

               <hi>Socrates</hi> observeth; that they might raise to themselves the greater Reputation of Holiness among the People, and equal the supposed Continence of unmarried Bishops. In this case, it was not permitted to them to return to the embraces of their Wives. If they did, the Fact was esteemed Scandalous, and sometimes punished with the Censures of the Church. Thus among the Seven Heads of Accusation, for which <hi>Antoninus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> was deposed by St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in a Synod in the Year 400. one was, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Quod cum Uxori propriae abre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Siricius) that many Priests and Deacons have a long time after their Ordination, had Children, as well by their own Wives as by Fornication, and defend this their Doing by Prescription, because in the Old Testament Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was permitted to the Priests.</hi> It seems to have been by this time become a general Custom in the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the greater Churches of <hi>Italy,</hi> for Bishops, Priests and Deacons to abstain from the company of their Wives. This they did voluntarily, there being yet no Ecclesiastical Constitution to enforce it; and in that case removed their Wives out of their Families, and lived sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately from them. That this was voluntarily, is manifest as well because no Command of any such Abstinence as yet made by the Church can be produced, as from several Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Italian Clergy of this time, who enjoyed the company of their Wives after Ordination, as we shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after prove. That this Custom extended not into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter Provinces, is manifest from the words of St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who writ about this time, and persuading this total Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to his Clergy of <hi>Milan,</hi> saith, <note n="(b)" place="margin">In pleri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Siricius</hi> therefore seduced with the common Prejudices of that Age, and imagining it to be no small Crime in the Clergy of <hi>Spain,</hi> not to canform to the Customs of <hi>Rome,</hi> interposed his Authority, and commanded them to do that, which he saw they would never perform of their own accord. The embracing of the Vulgar Prejudices about Celibacy, are not the only argument of <hi>Siricius</hi> his simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. This very Epistle carrieth other evident tokens of it along with it. For to omit the many Superstitious Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the Marriage of the Inferior Clergy, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids Marriage to all Persons whatsoever, who had ever done publick Penance for Fornication. A Command which wholly evacuates the Apostles Precept of Marriage, making<note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> Fornication an impediment of Marriage, which by the Apostle was assigned as a remedy of it. The next year, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricius</hi> writing to the Bishops of <hi>Africa,</hi> pursueth the same design; but here remembring that he acted out of his own Patriarchate, he presumeth not to command, but only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth Celibacy. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Suademus ut sacerdotes &amp; levitae cum uxoribus suis non codant. hortor, moneo, rogo. <hi>Epist. 4.</hi>

               <hi>I persuade, advize, admonish, intreat, that Priests and Deacons would not accompany with their Wives:</hi> And all upon the same topick of the Incongruity of conjugal Embraces with the Priestly Office. Let us now see what effect this Command of <hi>Siricius</hi> had in <hi>Spain,</hi> or his Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition in <hi>Africk.</hi> In <hi>Spain,</hi> the first Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> was held in the Year 400. which decreed, <note n="(c)" place="margin">Can. 1.</note> That those Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons who had not abstained from their Wives after Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, should continue in their Office, but be made inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ever rising to the Priesthood; and in like manner Priests who had not abstained, should be incapable of the Episcopal Dignity; inflicting on them no further Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The same Command had it seems been sent by <hi>Siricius</hi> to the Bishops of <hi>Piemont,</hi> who meeting in a Council at <hi>Turin. An. Dom.</hi> 397. made a <note n="(a)" place="margin">Can. 6.</note> Canon of the same nature with that of <hi>Toledo,</hi> only debarring the Clergy, who would not submit to a total Abstinence, from ascending to higher Dignities in the Church. In <hi>Africa</hi> the Pope received a Repulse. The Eleventh Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> was in the year 390. wherein a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made by <hi>Faustianus</hi> the Popes Legat, that Bishops, Priests and Deacons should be enjoyned <note n="(b)" place="margin">Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentes esse in omnibus, <hi>Can. 2.</hi>
               </note> to total Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102659:50"/>
The Synod would not yeild to that, but only decreed, <note n="(c)" place="margin">Ut Episcopi, Presby. &amp; Diac. vel qui Sacramenta contrectant, pudicitiae cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodes, etiam ab uxoribus se abstineant, ut in omnibus &amp; ab omnibus pudicitia custodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur, qui altari deserviunt. <hi>Can. 2. ex edit.

               </note> 
               <hi>That Bishops, Priests and Deacons, or those, who administred the Sacraments, should always preserve Chastity, and when they ministred at the Altar, even abstain from their Wives.</hi> For that the Antients be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Chastity not to be inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the use of Marriage, we before proved. And this partial Abstinence of the Clergy in the time of their waiting at the Altar, fully satisfied <hi>Siricius</hi> his Argument, which proceeded upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency of performing the Duties of Marriage and the Administration of Holy Things, at the same time. That this is the trne sense of the Canon, we shall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate by proving that the Canon, which we shall next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, meant no more. For that both are to be understood in the same sense, all agree. In the year therefore 398. was held the Fifth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which made this following Canon <note n="(d)" place="margin">Placuit Episcopos Presb. &amp; Diac. secundum propriastatuta etiam ab uxoribus continere.

               <hi>Be it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, That Bishops, Priests and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons abstain even from their Wives in their own courses. Which if they do not, let them be deposed. But that the rest of the Clergy be not compelled to do this, but the customs of every particular Church are to be observed. Bellarmin, Binius,</hi> and other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintain that a total Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is here enjoyned to the Clergy, contrary to the plain sense of the Canon. For this they alledge only the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of St. <hi>Austin,</hi>

               <hi>Gratian,</hi> that is of no Moment, when opposed to the constant Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Latin Copies of the Acts of this Council. Nor even can we be assured that <hi>Gratian</hi>'s Copy read it <hi>Secundum priora Statuta,</hi> since it is very usual with him to represent the Antient Monuments of the Church, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in their own Words, but accommodated to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and Practice of his own time. As for St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:102659:51"/>
his Authority indeed would be sufficient; for he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Council: but he saith nothing of it in the place alledged, only proposeth to the Laity, who hardly endured to be restrained to the Embraces of one Woman, the Example of the Clergy, who practised a total Asti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. For this infers no more than that some or many of the Clergy did totally abstain; which none denieth, and we readily grant. The confutation of our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Reasons were sufficient in this case. However, I will produce some further Reasons in confirmation of that sense of the Canon, which we follow, and the words do naturally import. First then, The Antient Greek Code <note n="(a)" place="margin">Can. 70.</note> of the Canons of the <hi>African</hi> Church compsosed before the time of the Sixth Council, followeth this sense, translating the Words into Question, by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in their proper courses, or times of waiting.</hi> Secondly, the Fathers of the <hi>Quinisext</hi> Council commanding Priests and Deacons wholly to contain <note n="(b)" place="margin">

                  </gap>. Can. 13.</note> 
               <hi>in the time of the Administration of Holy Things,</hi> profess they herein follow and ratifie this Canon of the Council of <hi>Cartharge.</hi> And that they did not mistake or misrepresent the sense of it, appears from the Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Peter,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and his <hi>African</hi> Bishops, to the Acts of the <hi>Quinisext</hi> Council; which they would never have done, had they been conscious, that the Canons of their own Church were therein falsified and misrepresented. Lastly, <hi>Balsamon</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">Annot. in Can.</note>, <hi>Zonaras</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">Annot. in Can.</note>, <hi>Aristenus</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">Annot. in Can.</note>, and <hi>Blastares</hi> do thus unanimously explain it only of a partial Abstinence of the Clergy from their Wives, when they celebrate the greatest Festivals and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of the Church. I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce only the words of <hi>Blastares</hi> 
               <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               </note>. <hi>When the time calls them to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Holy Things, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Sacraments; then ought they to abstain even from the company of their own Wives, manifesting their continence by their Works. But the fourth Canon of this Code</hi> (which is the second of the Eleventh Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> beforementioned) <hi>and others like it being obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worded, and Commanding the Clergy, administring Holy Things, to abstain from their Wives, gave occasion to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102659:51"/>
to require those, who are to be ordained, to put away their Wives. Or if we should grant that this is the sense or these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; themselves would be more worthy to be put out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sacred Canons, than the Apostolick Canons of those of other Councils, which decreed the direct contrary to them, if they be taken in the sense of the Latins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the end of this Age, <hi>Helvidius</hi> and <hi>Jovinian,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the next <hi>Vigilantius</hi> appeared in defence of Marriage, against the exorbitant pretention of Celibacy. What their particular Opinions were, is not well known; nor may we safely believe St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> their professed Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, in representing of them; since all the World knows how much he hath misrepresented <hi>Ruffinus.</hi> However, certain it is all of them were guilty of some Errours. <hi>Hilvidius</hi> thought the V. <hi>Mary</hi> to have had several Children by her Husband <hi>Joseph,</hi> after the Birth of Jesus; <hi>Jovinian</hi> 
               <note n="(e)" place="margin">August. de Haeres cap. 82.</note> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the equality of all sins, &amp; impeccability of regenerate persons. <hi>Vigilantius</hi> believed it convenient for the present State of the Church, which received great prejudice from the incontinence of the unmarried Clergy, that none should be admitted into Orders which were not married; that so all danger of future scandal might be prevented. All these we willingly grant to have been Errours, but not Heresies. The first might be owing to a mistake of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the last of Policy; and the second indeed was noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously false, but far from the Contagion of Heresie. As for their common Opinion about Marriage, it seems to have been no more than this, that the intrinsick merits of Marriage and Celibacy were both equal; which however branded with the name of Heresie by St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> is a most certain Truth. If they believed the accidental Merits of both to be equal, which it can be never proved that they did; this indeed was a mistake (for Persons, who have the gift of Continence, may do greater service to God and the Church, in an unmarried, than in a married State) but a mistake that neither injured Faith, nor was repugnant to Revelation. Indeed <hi>Jovinian</hi> had a peculiar Errour of a grosser nature, that the violation of a Vow of Continence was a thing indifferent, even in those who could contain. For we willingly allow, that when a Vow of Continence can without any great difficulty or danger be preserved, it ought in no case to be violated. However, that any of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102659:52"/>
them were formal Hereticks, can by no means be proved. Rather it is most certain, that <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> not only drew se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral<note place="margin">Hierom. adv. Vigil in init.</note> Catholick Bishops into the same Opinion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who thereupon conferred Orders to none but married<note place="margin">Non ordinant Diaconos, nissi prius uxores duxerint nulli caelibi creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes pudicitiam.</note> Men, but that he lived and died in the Communion of the Catholick Church. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> indeed loadeth them all with the most opprobious names, and termeth them the worst of Hereticks: but his Prejudice and Passion is too well known to be herein trusted.</p>
            <p>In opposition to these Men, St. <hi>Hierom</hi> writ several Tracts; which in truth are so many Panegyricks of Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and invectives against Marriage: Here he adopts and reinforceth all the prejudices and mistakes of the former and present Age: particularly so far urged the supposed Impurity of Marriage, that he asserts it to be a Sin, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes married Persons from all hopes of Salvation; as we before proved by producing several places, to which might be added many more. This was an Errour far greater than any of those which he opposed; and which, if dogmatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proposed, and pertinaciously maintained, would be down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Heresie. But we charitably suppose, those harsh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions were rather the effects of his Passion, than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of his Judgment. And if he hath exceeded all bounds and limits of Reason in depressing Marriage, no less hath he in exalting Celibacy. This himself acknowledgeth, when upon a review of his Book against <hi>Helvidius,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati sumus, &amp; in morem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamatorum Paululum lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus. Adv. <hi>Hilvid.</hi> in fine.</note> he plaid the Oratour too much, and extended his Rhetorick beyond the bounds of severe Truth. This his Errours about Marriage, and proceeding upon false prejudices, may justly invalidate St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> Authority in the case of Celibacy, which yet he no where saith is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the Clergy, but only highly eonvenient and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the dignity and holiness of their Order. It may be some further Diminution to his Authority in this case, that all these extravagant Encomiums of Virginity seem to have proceeded only from an immoderate desire of repairing thereby his injured Reputation, and the honour of his Name suffering under unjust suspicions of too great familiarity with the Lady <hi>Paula;</hi> which had proceeded so far, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken such deep root in the Minds of the Romans, that he was forced to leave <hi>Rome</hi> in disgrace; when he was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all men to succeed <hi>Damasus</hi> in the Popedom.</p>

            <p>In the beginning of the Fifth Age Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> I. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and confirmed the Constitutions of his Predecessour <hi>Siricius,</hi> in Two Epistles, one <note n="(a)" place="margin">Epist. 2. cap. 9.</note> to <hi>Victricius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Roan,</hi> written in the Year 404. the other <note n="(b)" place="margin">Epist. 3. cap. 1.</note> to <hi>Exuperius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> in the Year following. In both he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth and enforceth only the old Argument of the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Marriage, which made it incompatible with the daily Administration of Holy Things performed by the Clergy. He commandeth Priests and Deacons (for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons he mentions not) who abstained not from their Wives in Obedience to the Constitution of <hi>Siricius,</hi> to be deposed; except perhaps they had been ignorant of the Constitution. For in that case he would only have them obliged to Continence for the future. That these, and indeed all the first Twenty Six Epistles of this Pope are spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, many learned Men have endeavoured to prove with many Arguments. But I will not insist on that. It is not improbable that he made such a Decree.

As for the Western Councils of this, and the following Ages, they were all Provincial, and pretended to no Authority out of their own Provinces. The Council of <hi>Orange</hi> was the first, which ever imposed total Abstinence upon the Clergy. It was a Convention of no more than Seventeen Bishops, in the Year 441. who then made this Canon. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Si quis post acceptam benedictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem leviticam cum uxore sua incontinens invenitur, ab officio abjiciatur, <hi>Can. 23.</hi>

Whence it may be gathered, that total Abstinence was not yet enjoyned to the Clergy of the <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Church</hi> by any Publick Authority, and that the Decrees of Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> directed to the Bishops of <hi>Roan</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse,</hi> as acting out of his own Patriarchat, had not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. The Second Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> in the Year 452. comes next, which in the Second Canon forbids any married Man to be ordained Priest, who doth not vow Continence; in the Forty Third Canon extends the same to Deacons; in the Forty Fourth Canon forbids to Deacons the use of Marriage in the Words of the Council of <hi>Orange;</hi> in the Third Canon, forbids Bishops, Priests and Deacons to keep their VVives with them in the same House, unless they also have vowed Continence, upon pain of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This Punishment was thought too great, and was therefore moderated by the First Council of <hi>Tours, A.

In the year 506. the Council of <hi>Agatha</hi> received <note n="(d)" place="margin">Can. 9.</note> and confirmed the Constitutions of <hi>Siricius</hi> and <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> about the Continence of Priests and Deacons; and further enjoyn <note n="(e)" place="margin">Can. 10. 16</note> that their VVives be not permitted to dwell with them, although they also promise Continence. <note n="*" place="margin">The like did the Council of <hi>Girona</hi> ordain in the year 517.</note> In the year 531. the Second Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> decreed <note n="(f)" place="margin">Can. 1.</note> That those who from their Childhood were by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents dedicated to the Holy Office, and were to that end brought up at the Charge of the Church, should, when they came to the Age of Eighteen, be asked publickly by the Bishop in the face of the Church, VVhether they were willing to oblige themselves never to marry. If they were, then they might be ordained Subdeacons, and gradually arise to the higher Offices of the Church. If not, then they might have leave to marry; and whensoever both married Parties should promise Continence, the Husband should be received into Orders. Here is the first mention of a Vow of Continence exacted of those that were to be ordained, that can be found in Ecclesiastical History. And here also it was first forbidden to Subdeacons to marry VVives after their Ordination, (for this concerned not those Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons who married before Ordination) whereas in all the precedent Councils it was left free to Subdeacons, as well as to the other inferiour Orders, to enjoy their Wives married either before or after their Ordination to that Office.

Many other Councils between the year 600, and a 1000. forbid the Cohabitation of all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and consequently also of VVives, to the Clergy: And many others permit only Mothers, Sisters, and Aunts to dwell with the Clergy, rejecting all other VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men under the Name of <hi>Extraneae;</hi> wherein they seem to have mistaken the meaning of the Third Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> Lastly, some Councils proceeded so far, as to inhibit to the Clergy the Cohabitation of all VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whatsoever, even Mothers, Sisters, Aunts, and the nearest Relations, permitted by the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> Thus did the Council of <hi>Mentz</hi>

published his Constitutions, <note n="(n)" place="margin">Concil Tom.

            <p>These were the Progresses and Gradations of Celibacy in the VVestern Church from the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> to the times of <hi>Hildebrand.</hi> Proposed it was by some Doctors of great Authority, enforced by Popes, and enjoyned by Councils; yet could not all these Authorities effectually recommend to the Practice of the Clergy a Doctrine so contrary to the first Notions of Reason, and common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of Mankind. The frequent and continual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition and renewing of Decrees and Canons to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of it, argue the universal Opposition which it met with in the World, every later Decree manifesting that the former was unsuccessful. And indeed most of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions are ushered in with a Preface of the Obstinacy of the Clergy in retaining their VVives, against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Prohibitions of the Church. All the aforementioned Councils were Provincial; and Popes had not yet claimed the Government of the whole Church. So that all these Decrees affected not the Eastern Church at all; nor those Parts even of the VVestern Church, which were neither subject to the Roman Patriarchat, nor the Jurisdiction of the particular Councils. And even in those Churches which were then subject to either of them, the Laws of Celibacy were never universally receiv'd and obeyed; and at last so far neglected and grown obsolete, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Eleventh Age, Marriage of the Clergy was as freely used, and as generally practised in most parts of the VVestern Church, as it is at this day in the Reformed Churches. This I come next to prove; where I might justly have omitted to speak of the Eastern Church, if our Adversaries did not pretend an universal Practice of Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy in the Eastern as well as Western Church, till the time of the <hi>Quinisext Council.</hi> The Refutation of this Pretence will necessitate us to speak in general of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Discipline of the antient universal Church in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Ordinations.

            <p>That the Laws of Celibacy were no less disobeyed, and all the antient Testimonies of the universal Practice of it, are no less wide mistakes, I come next to prove; and will begin with the Eastern Church. St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> not long after the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> writing to <hi>Dracontius,</hi> a Holy Monk, rebukes him for declining the Episcopal Office, and refutes the Reasons of his Refusal, the chief of which was, That in the Episcopal Dignity he could not live so retiredly, as he desired, but must be forced to lead a secular kind of Life. In answer to this, <hi>Athanasius</hi> shews him, that as to that, nothing can be performed in the one State, which may not in the other; and that when a Bishop, he may as well use the retiredness of a Monk, as many Monks do the usual Freedom of a Bishop; and produceth this Instance, <note n="(c)" place="margin">

As we have known Bishops Fathers of Children, and Monks having no Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For both are alike lawful to each</hi> Order, <hi>neither the one nor the other is forbidden to them.</hi> A more express Passage than this cannot be conceived, where he affirms many Bishops to have gotten Children after their Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and by the Instance insinuates, That this was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry usual with the Bishops of that time. That this Procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Children was performed by them while Bishops, not before, is most evident; since otherwise the Instance of <hi>Athanasius</hi> would have been highly impertinent. For <hi>Dracon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> in declining the Episcopal Dignity, did not dread the Life of Bishops, before they were made Bishops, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State wherein himself then was, and desired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, but the supposed incumbrances of a Bishop's Life, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was made Bishop.</p>

About the year 375. some Superstitious Christians had conceived so great a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Celibacy, that they despised the Married Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and would rather defer Baptism for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than be baptized by Bishops and Priests who abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not from their Wives.

            <p>I will produce but one example more, but that so preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and express, that it might alone teach us what was the Discipline of the Eastern Church in that Age. About the year 410. <hi>Synesius</hi> was, for the repute of his great Learning, chosen Bishop of <hi>Ptolemais</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> He was then married, and had a Wife, whom he professed to love passionately. It seems the voluntary Abstinence from the use of Marriage, which some Bishops of the East had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone, was become an universal Custom among the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Egypt,</hi> so that the People expected that a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man promoted to the Episcopal Dignity, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Pleasures of Marriage. And there was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reason, why this Custom should generally obtain in <hi>Egypt,</hi> rather than in any other Provinces of the East. <hi>Egypt</hi> was then the great School and Nursery of Monastick Discipline, which had probably at that time more Monks residing in it, than the whole VVorld besides. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Egypt</hi> were almost all taken out of these Monks, and consequently so great a Veneration for Celibacy pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that those few married Bishops which were among them, could by no other means conserve the Reverence and esteem, which was due to their Character, than by a voluntary renunciation of their Marriage: <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesius</hi> therefore, that he might not deceive the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People, and willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the burden, professed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>And indeed the more sober and moderate Popes seem never to have intended their Constitutions about Celibacy should be urged upon the Clergy out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chat; nor did they calculate them for the universal Church. It was <hi>Innocent</hi> alone, of all the antient Popes, who equalled the Ambition of his later Successors, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to make the Roman Patriarchat as extensive as the Roman Empire.

into narrower Bounds by the Invasions of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who by their Success of Arms alienating many Provinces from the Government of the Roman Prefect, withdrew them at the same time from the Jurisdiction of the Roman Patriarch. Hence it was that <hi>Sicily,</hi> being in possession of the barbarous Nations, when P. <hi>Leo</hi> made his Decree about the Celibacy of Subdeacons, the Clergy of <hi>Sicily</hi> thought not themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by it, nor took any notice of it.

And this was the reason why, when once the voluntary Zeal of Celibacy, which had possessed the Clergy of <hi>Milan</hi> in the time of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> grew cold and expired, Marriage was publickly used by the Clerg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The same was the Case of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which owing no Obedience to the antient Papal Constitutions, and not intermedling in the Councils, which decreed Celibacy, retained to her Clergy the free use of Marriage, till by the Procurement and Artifices of <hi>Anselm,</hi> she forbid it in a National Synod in the Twelfth Century; as we shall hereafter more largely prove.</p>
            <p>This was the Case of Celibacy in those Provinces, which were not influenced by the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, nor had obliged themselves by any Synodical Act. Let us now view the State of those Provinces, which were the Stage of those several Councils we before numbred, <hi>viz. Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> in the Ninth Age.

in several Synods, is evident from the Policy of <hi>Vei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiza,</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the year 702. who, conscious of his own Wickedness and Tyranny, and fearing the Clergy, in revenge of it, might excite the Populacy to<note place="margin">Jo.

            <p>In the Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> Celibacy most certainly was not universally practised by the Clergy in the end of the Eighth Age, when Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> offered to <hi>Charles the Great</hi> his Collection of Canons fitted for the Government of the Churches in his Kingdoms.

            <p>Many other Arguments might be produced to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, that the use of Marriage was retained by the Clergy of the antient Church; which however they be less direct than those already mentioned, yet are they no less conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. Of this kind is the Practice of all those Hereticks and Schismaticks, who departing from the Western Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Celibacy was introduced, retained the use of Marriage to their Clergy.

Hence it was, that when towards the end of the sixth Age they began to be converted apace to the Orthodox Faith, most of their Clergy were found to be married; which forced the third Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> in the year 589. in a manner to dispense with them in this Canon, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Compertum à S.

            <p>An evident Argument of the use of Marriage per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Clergy, may be also drawn from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and forcible Ordinations of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, which were frequent in the antient Church. For many of these persons, thus violently and against their wills ordained, were married, whose resolutions to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102659:67"/>
abstain from their Wives, could not then be known, and as all acknowledge, could not be forced. Or if they should condescend to such a renunciation of the pleasures of Marriage, yet was it uncertain, whether their Wives would con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Who if they should dissent, they ought not to be defrauded of their Husbands Embraces, as all will grant: and therefore total abstinence was not universally used by the Clergy, while such violent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations were in use.

In <hi>Africa,</hi> about the same time, <hi>Pinianus</hi> an illustrious Nobleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> but more famous for his Piety, going with his Wife <hi>Melania</hi> to visit St. <hi>Augustin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">August.

This he did, his Wife <hi>Melania</hi> being not only unwilling, but even weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and protesting against it, as loath to descend from the pomp of a Roman Lady, to the humility of a Priests Wife.</p>
            <p>The Titles which were antiently bestowed upon the<note place="margin">Vid. Can. 13. 19.

            <p>In the end of the Seventh Age, that undisturbed free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Marriage, which the Eastern Clergy had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to enjoyed, suffered some little diminution in the <hi>Quini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sext</hi> Council. This was a Council assembled at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> in the Year 692. to supply the defects of the Fifth and Sixth General Councils, of which the last was held but eleven years before, and neither of them had made Canons for the better government of the Church, being wholly taken up with the determination of Matters of Faith. To remedy this defect the <hi>Quinisext</hi> Council was called, which in truth was nothing else but a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sixth Council, almost the same Bishops being present in both; and therefore the Canons of it are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cited under the name of the Sixth Council. A voluntary abstinence from the use of Marriage, was now become common to all the Bishops of the East; which is not at all to be wondred at, for that custom was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taken up, which at this day continueth in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Church, of chusing the Bishops, not out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Clergy, but out of Monasteries. This voluntary Abstinence therefore being now become universal, was in this Council formed into a Law, upon occasion of the Bishops of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Libya,</hi> who still retained the use of Marriage. This the Council inhibited <note n="(a)" place="margin">Can. 12.</note> to them and all other Bishops for the future, professing <hi>they did it not</hi>

               <hi>in derogation of the ancient Apostolical Discipline, but for the greater edification of the Church:</hi> whereby they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the use of Marriage was permitted even to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops by the Apostles, and that permission continued down in the Church till their times.</p>
            <p>As for the Marriage of Priests, and all the other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Clergy, the Council only commanded an abstinence from the use of it in the time of the celebration of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102659:69"/>
more sacred Mysteries of Religion, at which times it had been forbidden also to Laymen by the Canons of many Councils. Thus only renewing the Third Canon of the Fifth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in all other things they left to the Clergy the free use and enjoyment of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. And not only so, but condemned also the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in these words: <note n="(c)" place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>Whereas in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>we understand it is prescribed in form of a Canon, that those who are to be invested with the Order of Priest or Deacon, should promise perpetual abstinence from their Wives: we following the ancient Canon of Apostolical Truth and Discipline, enact, that the lawful cohabitation of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy with their Wives cease not to be accounted valid, not daring to dissolve the union between them and their Wives, nor depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving either of the convenient Society</hi> (or Embraces) <hi>of the other. Lest we should thereby be unavoidably injurious to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which God ordained, and blessed with his own presence; the Holy Gospel pronouncing this Sentence,</hi> What God hath joyned together, let no man put asunder; <hi>and the Apostle teaching us, that Marriage is honourable, and the bed unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; and again,</hi> Art thou bound unto a Wife? seek not to be loosed. <hi>If any one therefore shall presume against the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Canons, to deprive the Clergy of the lawful company of their Wives, let him be deposed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Council was ever held sacred, and the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it about the Marriage of the Clergy continued down in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church without variation to this very day. That it was an Oecumenical Council the <hi>Greeks</hi> always believed, and the <hi>Latins</hi> have sometimes confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledgeth the Third <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Council to have been General, of which the <hi>Quinisext</hi> was no more than an Appendix, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore always accounted part of it.

the first and last Session of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> can hinder them from being esteemed parts of the same Council. Besides, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth at this day receive the Definitions of the Second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and accounts it Oecumenical. But this Council expresly confirmed the Sixth General Council, and therein also the <hi>Quinisext</hi> Council.

            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:102659:70"/>This was the state of Celibacy in the Christian Church for the first thousand years. No-where imposed in the better and purer Ages of Christianity, introduced into the Roman Patriarchate by a rash Pope, commanded by many Provincial Councils of the West, but in no place universally observed; the imposition of it always disused, and at last condemned in the Eastern Church; and the practice of it in these latter Ages, become obsolete in the West. It will not now be amiss to look back a little, and make some Observations upon the Authors, and advance of Celibacy; whereby we may the better judge, how far the Authority and Example of those times ought herein to influence and direct the practice of the present Age.</p>
            <p n="1">First then, the Celibacy of the Clergy was hitherto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed by all, a matter of meer Discipline, first intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for reasons of Decency, Convenience, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Edification; which have not only long since ceased, but Celibacy is now become a Snare to the Clergy, and a Scandal to the whole Church. So that the obligation of the Laws of Celibacy, even in those particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches where it was antiently introduced and commanded, have long since ceased. The pretence of Divine or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Institution, was not heard of, till the days of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> and is but faintly maintained in these times. That the antient Imposers of Celibacy never thought of this pretence, is evident, because they never made that plea. This we before observed, particularly of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of <hi>Siricius</hi> and <hi>Innocent,</hi> and may be affirmed of all Popes and Councils, which favoured or commanded Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy in those times. Not to say that some Councils, as the <hi>Quinisext</hi> II. of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and others, expresly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the permission of Marriage to the Clergy to be of Apostolical Institution.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Example of the antient Church in this case, is not only not conclusive, but even of no authority; it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessitates nor recommends Celibacy to the present Church. For all the deference which we ow to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Example of these times, proceeds from a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102659:71"/>
probable supposition, that the antient Church had greater and better opportunities of knowing the mind of <hi>Christ,</hi> the intentions of the Apostles, and the exigences of the Church, than the present Age can pretend to, as being more removed from the Fountains head, and animated with a less vigorous and impartial zeal for the knowledge of Truth, and increase of Piety. But when this supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becomes not only improbable, but is evidently false; when we are assured the practice of the antient Church was occasioned and introduced by prejudices and mistakes, false notions of Piety, and gross errours about the nature of things; imitation would not only be not laudable, but even foolish, and perhaps unlawful; lest the continuance of such a practice should uphold the errours which first produced it. At least, when these mistakes are discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, these prejudices removed, the authority of this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will vanish with them. That this was the case of Celibacy in the antient Church, we have all along obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and proved; and need not here repeat our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="3">III. If we should allow the usage of the antient Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>o be in all cases a Rule and Pattern to the present Age, yet will Celibacy receive no advantage from it. The Marriage of the Clergy may put in a larger and much better Plea of antiquity, as being able to produce the practice of the Universal Church in the four first Ages of Christianity, of the whole Eastern, and many parts of the Western Church to this day, and alledge the Suffrage of two General Councils, the first and fourth, which confirmed and allowed it. Whereas the imposition of Celibacy was unknown to the first and better Ages, not universally practised in the latter, rejected by one, and condemned by another General Council, and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by other than Provincial Synods, whose Acts may be annulled; and Decrees abolished by the single authority of any particular Church. And certainly if, what most of our Adversaries pretend, the tradition and practice of the present Universal Church be the only certain method of knowing the Opinion and Doctrine of all precedent
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102659:71"/>
Ages, the lawfulness and convenience of the Clergies Marriage must have been the belief of the antient Church: since all the Eastern Churches, the greatest part of the Universal Church, not to speak of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches in the West, do at this day permit the use of Marriage to the Clergy, and maintain the impositio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of Celibacy to be unlawful. Which also is no small pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the cause of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truth or solidity in that grand Argument of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, that in the case of two dissenting Churches, when the one openly condemneth the practice of the other, and receiveth not the same severe Sentence from her Adversary, Truth and Justice must necessarily ly on that side. For however the Greek Church hath always condemned, as impious and unjust, the imposition of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy in the Latin Church, the <hi>Latines</hi> never dared to return the same Sentence upon the permission of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the Clergy in the Greek Church. Rather the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Eastern Church hath been allowed and ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the publick Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For to omit the great <hi>Later an</hi> Council under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, wherein our Adversaries confess that permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Marriage was continued to the Greek Priests, thus Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the First answered to the Inquiry of the <hi>Bulgarians:</hi>

            <p n="4">IV. The practice of the ancient Church in the imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Celibacy, was various and divers; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102659:72"/>
neither Celibacy it self can be of Apostolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, nor the antient practice of it be a fixed Rule to succeeding Ages. The great variation of the Canons of those several Councils, which enjoyned Celibacy, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore observed; and might add the alterations introduced into the practice of the Greek Church by the <hi>Quinisext</hi> Council, and Novels of <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour. But I will here insist only upon the case of Subdeacons, who in the present Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are no less forbidden the use of Marriage, than the superiour Clergy. Not to the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church. <hi>Siricius</hi> and <hi>Innocent</hi> left Marriage free to them. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the First endeavoured to impose Celiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon them; but his Decree gained no acceptance. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Councils after that time, permitted Marriage to them. <hi>Palagius</hi> the Second forbid it to the Subdeacons of <hi>Sicily:</hi> but his Successour <hi>Gregory</hi> repealed that prohibition. That Continence was not yet commanded to Subdeacons, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Spain</hi> nor <hi>Sicily,</hi> at the time of the third Council of <hi>Toledo, Anno</hi> 589. <hi>Baronius</hi>

In <hi>England, Augustin</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had consulted Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> whether Clergy-men not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to contain, might marry; and whether when married, they ought to resume a secular Life. <hi>Gregory</hi> returned answer, that <note n="(c)" place="margin">Clerici ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra sacros or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.

            <p n="5">
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:102659:72"/>V. Whatsoever <hi>Popes</hi> and Councils in the antient Church forbid Marriage to the Clergy, did at the same time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to them the company of Concubines, with much greater and severer penalties. Which doth not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, that they believed not the use of Marriage by the Clergy, to be equal to the crime of Fornication; but also takes away from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> all just title to any plea of antiquity in the imposition of Celibacy; since she hath sometimes openly permitted the use of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines to the Clergy, and always in these latter Ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed greater punishments to the Marriage, than to the Concubinacy of the Clergy. And therefore the Gloss upon the Canon-Law <note n="(a)" place="margin">Dist. 34. cap. 7.</note> observeth, that Fornication is less disadvantageous to the Clergy, than Marriage; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in many cases Marriage would exclude a man from Orders, or deprive him when ordained; when a Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator might be admitted into and continued in the sacred Office.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The antient Church, in imposing Celibacy upon the Clergy, ever left open a Refuge for incontinent persons, and thereby prevented the danger of their incontinence and scandal of the Church. And not only those who could no longer contain, but even all who desired Marriage, were permitted to contract it, by quitting the sacred Office, and retiring to Lay-Communion; maintained still by the Revenues of the Church, and sometimes allowed to rank themselves among the three inferiour Orders. Thus the Councils of <hi>Orleans</hi> I. of <hi>Tours,</hi> and many others in the Western Church. In the East, no other punishment than deprivation, was ever inflicted upon the superiour Clergy contracting Marriage. So the Council of <hi>Neocaesarea,</hi> and the Novels <note n="(b)" place="margin">Novel. 6. cap. 5.</note> of <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperour. And even this punishment of total Deprivation, <hi>Leo</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">Novel. 79.</note> the Emperour thought too severe, and therefore moderated it, decreeing, That Priests, Deacons, and Subdeacons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Marriage after Ordination, should only be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed from that degree wherein they were before their Marriage, and be reduced to a lower Station among the Clergy, using in the mean while the Habit of the Clergy,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102659:73"/>
and attending to the administration of holy things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though acting in a lower Sphere. And this <hi>Balsamon</hi> 
               <note n="(d)" place="margin">Comm. in Can. 5. Conc. 6.</note> proposeth, as the constant practice of the Greek Church in his time. In the West however, many Popes and Councils of the fifth, sixth, and seventh Ages, commanded the Clergy contracting Marriage, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated and separated from their Wives: these furious Decrees vanished and grew obsolete in the next Ages: and Deprivation was thought a sufficient punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Marriage, when <hi>Isidore Mercator</hi> forged the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals about the beginning of the ninth Age; as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from a spurious Decree of Pope <hi>Lucius,</hi> cited by <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> 
               <note n="(e)" place="margin">Dist. 81. cap. 19.</note> and from the Canons of the Councils of <hi>Worms</hi> and <hi>Mentz,</hi> towards the end of this Age. I may add, that no more than a temporary Deprivation seems then to have been sometimes used. For the spurious Acts of the second Roman Council, under Pope <hi>Silvester,</hi> forged by the same <hi>Mercator,</hi> decrees, <note n="(f)" place="margin">Nemo Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter à die su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scepti Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii conjugium in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The scandalous and bad effects, which too great an affectation, much more the imposition of Celibacy, produced in the antient Church, might justly deter the present Age from imitating that Example, and thereby continuing and augmenting the same scandals. The horrible and sad abuses of Eunuchs and House-keepers, we have before described; whose ill examples have done greater injury, and given deeper wounds to the honour and reputation of the antient Church, than ever the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or imposed Celibacy of the Clergy brought lustre or advantage to it. And if in those times when the first zeal of Christianity was not yet expired, when Piety and Vertue were excited by Miracles, and fomented by Persecutions; when a generous renunciation of the World, and contempt of all Sublunary Pleasures, was the common practice, and seem'd to be the very genius of Christianity: if under all these advantages Celibacy could not make good its glorious pretences, nor promote that, for which it was at first intended, true Virginity: if then the voluntary practice of it betrayed the Church to open scandals and manifest inconveniencies, in vain do we hope in this degenerate state of Christianity, to attain a perfection which former and latter Ages wanted, and introduce among the unmarried Clergy such an uniform exemplariness of Continence and Chastity, as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote among the Laity the great ends of Holiness and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and advance the true interests of the Church. It may be a laudable ambition, to surpass the Vertue of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; but little less than madness, to attempt that which the Experience of so many Ages hath demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be impossible.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. If it be imprudent to imitate a practice, from which naturally floweth so many Scandals and Abuses, no less unsafe is it to place this imitation upon a matter, which seems to have been the great Stumbling block of Antiquity, and chief Fountain of her grossest Errours. I mean Marriage, about which the many false Opinions that obtained in the Church, evince that most Christians had false notions of the nature and institution of it. And

The 17th Apostolick Canon, and third of the <hi>Quinisext</hi> Council, command, that none be admitted into the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, or if admitted, that he be deposed, who hath married two Wives after Baptism, or one which hath been a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or a divorced woman, or a Whore, or a Servant, or a Stage-player. The Council of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> in the year 578. forbid <note n="(b)" place="margin">Can. 22.</note> the Widows of a Priest, Deacon, or Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, to marry after the death of their Husbands.

Such unnecessary cautions about the Marriage of the Clergy, and unlawful prohibition of it to their posterity, could be no other than the effects of some gross mistakes or foolish superstition.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. It is no small prejudice to the cause of Celibacy, that all the great Patrons and Defenders of it could not themselves preserve that Virginity, which they either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired or imposed. They had not only suffered under, but even yielded to, the temptations of Incontinence, and could never themselves obtain that perfection, which they recommended to the practice of mankind. In these men I will not say a satiety and glut of unlawful pleasures procured a contempt of lawful enjoyments; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an injudicious repentance and abhorrence of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was prejudicial to a right esteem of the latter. For when these persons, many of whom afterwards were eminent for holiness, reflected upon the greatness of their crime, and their violation of the divine laws of chastity, no wonder if in exaggerating the one, and seeking to compensate the other, they misplaced the guilt of their crime, by removing it from the unlawful use of those pleasures to the very nature of them; and then imagining no sacrifice too great to appease the divine anger, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to promote and preserve that chastity in others, which they had prostituted themselves, and by restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many from lawful pleasures, expiate the guilt of their own unlawful enjoyments. This is manifest from the example of all those, who were the main Authors of ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and imposing Celibacy for the first 1100 years, I mean <hi>Tertullian, Eustathius, Heliodorus, Epiphanius,</hi> St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, Dunstan, Hildebrand, Lanfranc,</hi> and <hi>Anselm;</hi> to whom we may add the Founders of the four great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastick Orders in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I begin with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who acknowledgeth, <note n="(a)" place="margin">De spectac. c. 19. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrect. c. 59.</note> that in his youth he had been guilty of all the debaucheries of the age, and

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>elibacy to the times of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> or the middle of the Eleventh Age: when although the Marriage of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lergy was once again become frequent, and connived at over all the West, yet the fatal ignorance and stupidity of the precedent age had prepared the way to a renewed impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Celibacy, by anticipating the judgments of men with false prejudices and notions of the nature of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Celibacy. All the mistakes of ancient times were then resumed and with advantage improved: and the supposition of some hidden impurity in the use of Marriage, had so far prevailed, that it gained belief and reception even among the married Clergy. For this I take to have been the only reason of that abuse, frequent in the Ninth Age, (which <hi>Elfric</hi> complaineth of in his Epistles to <hi>Wulfin</hi> and <hi>Wulfstan)</hi> whereby the Priests ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring the Eucharist, communicated not themselves. Besides all these errours and mistakes, and the miserable ignorance and barbarity of those times, which prepared the minds of men: there concurred another great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which induced the Popes to impose Celibacy upon the Clergy. The Popes of the Eleventh Age, especially <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, had formed a design of subjecting the whole Christian World to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well in Temporals as in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals. To this end nothing could be more subservient than to withdraw the Clergy from the Allegiance due to their Princes and Affection to their Countries, and tye
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102659:76"/>
them up wholly to the interest of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> This could not be accomplisht while Marriage was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Clergy, since the consideration of Wives and Children endeared their Countrey to them, and were so many Pledges of Fidelity to their Natural Princes. This Obstacle therefore was to be removed, and the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to be invested with a perfect liberty of blindly pursuing the dictates of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> This observation may be hence confirmed, that the same <hi>Hildebrand</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to subject Temporal Princes to the Papal power, and to deprive the Clergy of the use of Marriage. For altho some Popes of this Age attempted the imposition of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy before <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> yet was the whole attempt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed and managed by him, who is known to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised an absolute Tyranny in <hi>Rome</hi> more than twenty years before he was made Pope.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Ninth led the way: who although he made no formal Decree, at least not any now extent, against the Marriage of the Clergy in the West, sent Legates to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in the year 1054. Cardinal <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> who fiercely contending there with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> both by Writings and Disputations, among other heads of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, charged them with the Heresie of the <hi>Nicolaites,</hi> for permitting Marriage to the Clergy, and pronounced an <hi>Anathama</hi> against them. How foolish and false this accusation was, is evident from what we before said touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the History of <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Deacon. The cause of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church was defended by <hi>Nicetas Pectoratus,</hi> a Regular Priest, who, besides the common right of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the divine permission, and the necessity of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the constant Practice and Tradition of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church in all precedent Ages in favour of the Clergies Marriage. In the year 1056. the Council of <hi>Tholouse</hi> was held by the command and by the Legates of Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the Second, which commanded<note n="(a)" place="margin">Can. 7.</note> Priests, Deacons, and all other Clergymen possessing Ecclesiastical Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to abstain from their Wives, upon pain of Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Excommunication.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102659:76"/>
the Marriage of the Clergy; whose Acts are lost. The Clergy generally despised these Censures and Canons, and retained their Wives in opposition to them. This obliged the Popes to invent and make use of new strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems. None could be more effectual than to forbid the Laity to hear Mass and receive the Sacraments from the hands of the married Clergy. This was indeed the very formal Heresie of the <hi>Eustathians</hi> condemned of old by the Council of <hi>Gangra;</hi> but the advantage which it might bring to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> did abundantly in their esteem compensate the danger and contagion of its errour. Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Second, therefore in a Synod held at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the year 1059. decreed,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Can. 3.</note> that none should hear the Mass of a Priest, whom he undoubtedly knew to have a Concubine, (for such the imposers of Celebacy in this Age would have the Wives of the Clergy to be esteemed) or a House-keeper. And that whatsoever Priests, Deacons or Subdeacons after the Constitution of <hi>Leo</hi> the Ninth, concerning the chastity of the Clergy, had openly married a Concubine, or put her not away when married, should be deposed from his Office and lose his Revenues. In this Canon it may be observed, that a general and uninterrupted use of Marriage by the Clergy is acknowledged to have obtained in the West immediately before the Constitution of <hi>Leo</hi> the Ninth, and that the universal opposition of the Clergy to the imposition of Celibacy had forced the imposers of it to mitigate the Penalties of Marriage, and inflict only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation upon the married Clergy. This Canon was renewed and confirmed by the Council of <hi>Tours</hi>

The mistakes and errors of precedent Ages, which they adopted and improved, need no repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. I will insist upon those only which were peculiar to this and the former Age. An universal ignorance had fitted the minds of men to be abused and deceived; and the Patrons of Celibacy failed not to make use of this advantage. They pretended the Marriage of the Clergy to be in it self null and void; and therefore in their Decrees and Canons gave to the Wives of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy no other name than that of Concubines; and ever termed their Marriage, <hi>Adultery, Concubinacy, and</hi>

Another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice was then set on foot, which nothing but the highest impudence could devise or maintain, and that was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the <hi>Greek</hi> Church of imposing Marriage upon the Clergy, pretending the 13th Canon of <hi>Quinisext</hi> Council had decreed none should be admitted into Priests Orders, who had not first married a Wife.

superstitious Age, when that cause was triumphant, not which was most rational, but whose followers could by a pretence of Miracles delude the World with greater art and impudence.

The second, is far longer, was never elsewhere published; and seems to have been the Remonstrance or Apology of all the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Clergy of the Western Church, offered to Pope <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas</hi> the Second, and the other Bishops of the Church, who endeavoured to impose Celibacy, presently after the <hi>Roman</hi> Synod, in the year 1059. which forbid the Laity to hear Mass from the married Clergy. The Author of it writes far more elegantly, and argues more strongly than <hi>Huldericus:</hi> and indeed, abating some allegorical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of Scripture, the peculiar Genius of those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, it may be accounted a rational and exact Treatise. The sum of it is this: That Continence is the peculiar Gift of God, not bestowed upon all; which therefore cannot be commanded. That no Vow or Gift is grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, but what is voluntary, not compelled. That it savoured of Judaism, to impose such burdens upon men under the Gospel. That the Governours of the Church were not invested with an arbitrary power, nor could lay such grievous impositions on the Clergy, against their will. That this Yoak was imposed for vain ostentation, and worldly ends. That although many of the inferiour Clergy were awed by Force, Authority, Threats, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema's, to submit to this Imposition, yet they unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly underwent the burden of Celibacy, and hated the cross laid upon them, because they bore it rather to their destruction than salvation. That from the imposition of Celibacy, greater inconveniencies arose; Sodomy, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, Fornication, Incest, and other horrid Lusts. That Marriage is the only Remedy assigned by God to incontinent persons; which they who contemn and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a greater shew of perfection, commonly fall into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102659:80"/>
That the Apostle commandeth, that to avoid Fornication, every man should have his own Wife; and expresly teacheth, all have not the Gift of Continence. That the Apostles advice of Virginity, was temporary, himself professing that he cast no snare upon us. That as for themselves, they professed they could not contain without the use of Marriage, and therefore by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Apostle had a right to marry. That it was a vain and false pretence, that this Indulgence was given by the Apostle only to the Laity, and not to the clergy. That the Yoak of Celibacy was unlawful and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, condemned of old by <hi>Dionysius Corinthius,</hi> and <hi>Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius. Lay not therefore, we beseech you, this heavy burden upon us, which we are not able to bear; nor violate the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to Holy Orders and the sacred Mysteries, for our sakes. Certainly, you render both contemptible in the sight of men, whilst you forbid the Sacraments to be received from our hands. A Prohibition directly contrary to the antient Canons; which define, that the Sacraments lose not their efficacy by the unworthiness of him that administers them. By these Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Reasons you ought to be perswaded, and neither remove us from the sacred Office, nor deprive the Laity of the benefit of the Sacraments.</hi> Concluding with a protestation, that they could not contain without Marriage, nor obtain Continence any otherwise than by the peculiar Gift of God.</p>
            <p>Thus the married Clergy wanted neither learning nor courage to defend the justice of their Cause, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were overborn by the violence of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and prevailing interest of the Monastick Order, yet many of them retained their Wives for some Ages after the times of <hi>Hildebrand;</hi> although from his Popedom the marriage of the Clergy gradually decreased, and at last was born down by an universal Celibacy.

These Laws seem not to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> till the year 1199. when a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil being held there by the Popes Legates, this Canon <note n="(b)" place="margin">Can. 2.</note> was made: <hi>Whereas the Priests of God ought to live conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, they are said to hold both their Wives and Churches in the parts of</hi> Dalmatia <hi>and</hi> Dioclia. <hi>Wherefore we enact, That Clergy-men having Wives married before Ordination, live with them and resign their Benefices; but that those who have Wives married after Ordination, dismiss their Wives, and retain their Benefices.</hi> To pass by other Councils, I will produce only the great <hi>Lateran</hi> Council under <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, in the year 1215. which not only allowed the Marriage of the Clergy, when contracted, to be valid, but also permitted Marriage to the Clergy of some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, wherein the Laws of Celibacy had not yet been received.

               </gap>lude the Authority of a Council, so much reverenced by them, declaring in favour of the Clergies Marriage, would have this clause under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the Greek Clergy; but produce not the least shew of Reason for their pretence. No mention is made of the Greek Clergy either before or after: nor did the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102659:81"/>
Fathers of the Council, in forming this Canon, any more dream of them than of the Clergy of the <hi>Abyssine</hi> Church. Lastly, almost the whole 17th Title of the first Book of Decretals of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Ninth, is made up of Epistles written by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Second, to the Bishops of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> about admitting or not admitting the Sons of Priests into the Benefices of their Fathers, without any interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Successour. In these Epistles Bastardy is no-where objected to the Sons of the Clergy, but only the danger which may accrew to the Church, if Ecclesiastical Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices should descend like a Lay Inheritance from Father to Son. And this danger the Pope sometimes dispensed with. For it is manifest from the 9th Chapter, that he had given a Faculty to the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Sons of the Clergy into the Benefices of their Fathers, immediately after the death or cession of the latter. The 12th Chapter hath these words: <hi>Clement</hi> III.<note place="margin">An à potifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus generati valeant ad sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cros ordines promoveri—Si ex legitimo matrimonio sunt procreati, licitè possunt.</note>

But if any scruple remains, the 14th Chapter will remove it, which is this: <hi>We understand that</hi> N. <hi>begotten in Priesthood, born</hi>

Wherefore let it be done</hi> Thus did Popes, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, and the practice of the Church, after the times of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> acknowledge the lawfulness of the Clergies Marriage, and connive at it; till the Papal am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition drawing the disposition of all Ecclesiastical Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to themselves, and allowing the use of Concubines to the Clergy, Marriage was at last forced to yield to the more advantageous and easie way of Fornication.</p>

               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:102659:82"/>It remains that we speak somewhat more particularly of the state of Celibacy in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which more peculiarly concerns us, and probably the last of all the Churches in the West, submitted to the imposition of it. The Church of <hi>England</hi> being no part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarchate, nor intervening by her Bishops in those Western Councils which enjoyned Celibacy, took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, nor gave any obedience to the Decrees of Popes, or Constitutions of Councils in that matter; but allowed an uninterrupted freedom of Marriage to the whole body of her Clergy, till the end of the tenth Age, and to the far greater part of them till the beginning of the twelfth Age. <hi>Elfric</hi>

               <hi>This I will affirm, That this enforced Chastity is so far from surpassing conjugal Chastity, that even the guilt of no crime ever brought greater disgrace to the Holy Order, greater damage to Religion, or greater grief to all good men, than the stain of the Clergies Lust. Wherefore it would perhaps be the interest as well of Christianity as of the Holy Order, that at last the Right of publick Marriage were restored to the Clergy; which they might rather chastly pursue without Infamy, than defile themselves by such brutal Lusts.

Gift of Continence in those to whom it is bestowed by God; we admire Monogamy, and the decency of one Marriage: yet assert, that we ought to indulge with, and bear the burdens of others, lest he who thinks he standeth firmly, should fall.</hi> We dislike not the Virginity of the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy, but slight the pretence, and condemn the imposition of it. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience demonstrates the one to be false, and Reason the other to be unlawful. We affect not the name, but the purity of Virginity; and while we impose Celibacy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on none, nor deny Marriage to any, we promote a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Continence in many, and secure a real Chastity in all, of the Clergy.</p>
