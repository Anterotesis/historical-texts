            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AS the knowledg of things to come, not viſible in their Cauſes, is the alone priviledg of God, and which he ſo peculiarly challengeth, as to diſtinguish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thereby from all thoſe Beings, to whom thro the fallacy of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and their own ignorance, the ſottish and deluded part of Mankind had aſcribed a Divinity; ſo the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting thoſe things before their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment, and the Events co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming afterward to correſpond with the Prophecy, is an infallible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Divine Original of that Book wherein they are foretold &amp; recorded. In which reſpect, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> only can lay claim unto &amp; boaſt of God as its Author, ſo upon
<pb facs="tcp:108142:3"/>
that account as well as many other, it ought to be received, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto, with a humility, venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and faith due unto writings that proceed from divine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion But tho many other <hi>Books</hi> of the Sacred Scripture, do ſufficiently proclaim whoſe Oracles they are, by this divine and infallible Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet there is not one, all whoſe parts and every line, do ſo eminently carry this heavenly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and impreſſion upon them, as the <hi>Apocalypſe of St. Iohn</hi> doth. For God being to shut up the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he thought fit to Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe unto mankind, for the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their Faith, Worship, and Obedience, and for encouraging them unto ſelf-denial, patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, &amp; hope; hath been pleaſed by theſe <hi>Propheſies,</hi> not only to affix his Seal to all the other parts of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ſo as to acknowledg himſelf for the Author of them: but to
<pb facs="tcp:108142:3"/>
compenſate for denying the Spirit of Prophecy any more unto men in order to their guidance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the <hi>Church,</hi> he hath left us in this <hi>Divine Book</hi> an unerring ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all things, that were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eminently to befall the <hi>Empires</hi> of the World, or to be the lot and portion of the <hi>Church,</hi> till the time of the conſummation of all things And tho it be no extenuation of the neglect of thoſe, with whom our Lord Jeſus Chriſt had intruſted with the care and inſtruction of Believers, and to whom he had committed the Paſtoral office, that theſe Prophetical <hi>Viſions</hi> were not anciently more ſtudied and efforts made to explain and enlighten them; yet the Wiſdom of God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play's and magnifies it ſelf in the ſloath and omiſſion of men, and his tender compaſſion towards his people manifeſts it ſelf in th ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of their overſeers; ſeeing had
<pb facs="tcp:108142:4"/>
the many tragical things here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, with which the Saints were ſo long to conflict and wreſtle, been clearly known and underſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were haſtening towards their <hi>period;</hi> theſe bleſſed <hi>Oracles,</hi> which adminiſter comfort to us, might have diſanimated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged thoſe, whoſe lot was caſt in the firſt and more early times. And among other evidences, that the <hi>perſecutions</hi> with which the <hi>Church</hi> hath been ſo long exerciſed, are drawing towards an End, we have this conſiderable proof of it, that ſo many perſons of Eminent learning and ſingular piety, have of late applied themſelves to the Explication of theſe <hi>Propheſies,</hi> and who have not only with ſo much pains and induſtry, but with ſo much ſucceſs inquired into the ſenſe and meaning of them. In which liſt, this <hi>Author</hi> deſerveth not the laſt place, who as he hath given us
<pb facs="tcp:108142:4"/>
a compleat <hi>Syſteme of the Revelation;</hi> ſo he hath done it with wonderful ſuccinctneſs, coherence, and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity. Nor do I know any, who ſeemeth to have more happily gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the meaning of the <hi>Viſions</hi> which are ſtill to be accomplished, or who enforceth his conjectures with more probable reaſons, and all accompanied with ſuch a modeſty as became an Inquirer into things, not only future but extreamly My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious. The preſenting my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen with it in their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, cannot be ungrateful unto them: it being the glory of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> that their piety, as well as Genius, have diſpoſed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches of this natute, of whom ſome have had the happineſs of affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that light into theſe <hi>Myſteries,</hi> that Forraigners are not asham'd to acknowledg the having kindled their Torches at their Lamps. 'Tis true, there are ſome things wherein
<pb facs="tcp:108142:5"/>
our Author differs from the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Mr. Jurieu,</hi> who hath ſo well merited of the Churches of Chriſt, by his many accurate and learned writings, particularly by his late Treatiſe of the <hi>Accomplishment of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies.</hi> But as their harmoniſing in ſo many and material things, is much more to be admired, than their differing in that particular about the <hi>Effuſion of the Vials;</hi> ſo their managing the difference with that Chriſtian meekneſs, with that defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to one anothers learning and worth, is a ſingular commendation to themſelves, and ought to be a pattern for all others to Imitate. The preſent poſture of affairs in <hi>great Brittain</hi> as well as elſewhere, render this diſcourſe and others of the like complexion exceeding ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. For while the <hi>Factors</hi> for <hi>Rome,</hi> are endeavouring to put ſuch a varnish upon the <hi>Papal Church,</hi> as may ſerve to allure and delude the
<pb facs="tcp:108142:5"/>
ſilly into her communion; behold she is here repreſented in lines and colours originally drawn by the H. Spirit, that are fit to excite and kindle all mens loathing and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of <hi>her.</hi> And while the <hi>Popish Miſſionaries</hi> flatter themſelves with hopes, &amp; fright others with mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of their bringing the world into ſlavery and bondage again to the <hi>Triple Crown;</hi> lo! we have not only the approaching downfal of <hi>Babylon</hi> here demonſtrated unto us, but an account both of the ruin of all that would ſupport her, and of the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and triumphant reſurrection of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> that lye ſlain for the Teſtimony of Jeſus and the word of his patience. To whoſe glorious revival in other parts, I do not doubt but that the ſtedfaſtneſs, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and victory of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> over the Beaſt, will be found not only conduceable but inſtrumental. Which I pray God to grant. <hi>Farewel.</hi>

                  <p>'TIs reported of a great perſon, that being reading <hi>Perſius,</hi> and not able to comprehend what he meant, by reaſon of the obſcurity which that <hi>Poet</hi> ſeems to have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly affected, he thereupon threw away the book in anger and diſdain: <hi>ſaying,</hi> that it was not worth his pains to imploy himſelf about an Author, who had writ in ſo dark a ſtile, as if he had a mind not to be underſtood: <hi>non vis intelligi, debes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many and even good men, who treat the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>St. John</hi> much after the ſame manner. They complain, that this <hi>Divine Book</hi> is full of unintelligible <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and of <hi>Ridles</hi> darker than that of <hi>Samſon.</hi> That is reſembleth the <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> into which the cloud not only hindred men from entring, but which made that they who went in, could diſcern nothing ſave darkneſs. In a word, they ſay it is in vain to ſtudy <hi>Propheſies,</hi> which it is impoſſible
<pb facs="tcp:108142:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to know the meaning of, unleſs illuminated by the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> which Revealed them, or without attending till we ſee their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion, which is that alone whereby they come to be infallibly interpreted.</p>
                  <p>Nor ought we to wonder, that a perſon of parts and abilities, and who can ſpend his time about ſomething elſe, should decline to waſt his Spirits in ſearching out the ſenſe of a <hi>Book,</hi> to whoſe compoſition there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred nothing ſave human wit and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; and which eontained only picquant <hi>Satyrs</hi> upon the brutal Vices of <hi>Nero,</hi> and the profligacies of other depraved <hi>Monſters</hi> of that unhappy <hi>Reign;</hi> and wherein the beſt that was to be met with, were only ſome <hi>Moral Inſtructions,</hi> and a little diverting <hi>Railery</hi> upon Fools and Villains.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Revelation</hi> contains in it the great <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Divine <hi>Providence;</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> the <hi>Fate</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and gives us not only a <hi>Deſcription</hi> of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> which is the <hi>Myſtical Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>Spouſe</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> but Vouchſafes us a <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of the <hi>True Church,</hi> which is the <hi>Heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Spouſe</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> All which are matters ſo Holy, and of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb facs="tcp:108142:7"/>
to the Conſolation of every Believer, that knows how to read, that none ought to be diſcouraged from ſtudying it, by the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wherewith it is envelop'd.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Spirit foreſeeing the diſlike, which the obſcurity of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> might occaſion, took care to Invite <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to the reading of it by a moſt alluring promiſe, regiſtred at the beginning of this Book; <hi>Bleſſed is he who readeth, and heareth the words of this Prophecy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis a matter worthy to be remarked, that tho' the <hi>Revelation</hi> be not the alone <hi>Book,</hi> which is dark and hardly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, there being divers parts of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Prophets</hi> incircled with no leſs obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; yet this is the only <hi>portion</hi> of the Divine <hi>Writings,</hi> which the Holy Spirit hath tanqa particular care to recommend unto our peruſal and ſtudy. Which doth unqueſtionably inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>two</hi> things. (1) That of all Divine <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> there are none of more Importance, than thoſe which are the ſubject matter of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> (2) That whoſoever shall <hi>read</hi> this <hi>Book</hi> with all due regard and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in order thereby to be rendred holy and wiſe, he shall not find the ſtudy of it uſeleſs and unprofitable, nor miſs the being in ſome meaſure and degree guided into an
<pb facs="tcp:108142:7"/>
underſtanding of it. For were it otherways, the Holy Spirit would not have been guilty of ſo unaccountable a thing, as to tempt and oblige our ſearching into it by ſo ſignal a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> like the Cloudy Pillar that conducted the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> tho it be <hi>dark</hi> on the one ſide, yet it is <hi>lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi> on the other. Where the Spirit of God hath given no Explanation of the Prophetick <hi>Schem's,</hi> and where the Event hath not illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated them, there we are ſtill upon the dark and cloudy ſide of it. But where either the Holy Spirit hath expounded any of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> or where the accomplishment hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted them, we are there furnished with ſuch a light, that it is impoſſible to miſs the underſtanding thoſe portions of this Divine Book without a wilful shutting of our eyes, and a choſen muffling of our Intellects.</p>
                  <p>When we are to learn crabbed and abſtruſe Sciences, we begin with Common Notions, and with principles which are the moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: and ſo we proceed by degrees till we have advanced unto, and have conquered that which is more ſublime and difficult.</p>
                  <p>This Method is natural and good. By ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:108142:8"/>
both at their knowledg and their renown. And if we take the ſame courſe in our ſearch into the <hi>Apocalyptick Myſteries,</hi> there will remain little but what we may maſter and unravel. There are <hi>ſome Viſions,</hi> which the <hi>Angel</hi> who revealed them to St. <hi>John,</hi> Vouchſafed alſo to explain. There are <hi>others,</hi> which the <hi>Event</hi> hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. And there are a <hi>third</hi> ſort, in the ſenſe of which all men are agreed. So that being firſt aſſured of the Scope and meaning of thoſe which are explained; and then of the ſignification of ſuch as there is no conteſt among Authors about; we may afterwards proceed to the reſt. By this method we shall enter upon the darker places with a Torch in our hand, and thereby come to diſcover all the Myſteries of this <hi>Book,</hi> as far as is either neceſſary or profitable.</p>
                  <p>'Tis evident, that there are but <hi>three</hi> principal <hi>Viſions</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> in which are contained both all that was to befall the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, which is the True <hi>Church;</hi> and all that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Papal Empire,</hi> which is the falſe. Theſe <hi>Viſions,</hi> are thoſe of the <hi>Seals,</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Vials</hi> The reſt are only Tablets and Draughts, wherein what had been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb facs="tcp:108142:8"/>
in thoſe of the <hi>Seals, Trumpets</hi> and <hi>Vials,</hi> is reaſſumed, inlarged, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly deduced and explained.</p>
                  <p>The number <hi>Seven</hi> being <hi>Myſtical,</hi> and marking perfection, ſerveth to inform us, that theſe three <hi>Viſions</hi> do comprehend all. For it is found in the <hi>Seals,</hi> in the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> in the <hi>Vials,</hi> and in the <hi>Thunders,</hi> which are the <hi>Fore-runners</hi> of the <hi>Vials.</hi> Moreover theſe three <hi>Viſions</hi> are ſo link'd one to another, that the <hi>Second,</hi> which is that of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> begins under the ſeventh <hi>Seal;</hi> and the <hi>third,</hi> which is that of the <hi>Vials,</hi> commence under the ſeventh <hi>Trumpet.</hi> Finally, 'tis upon the Effuſion of the <hi>Vials,</hi> that the <hi>Myſtery of God is to be finiſhed,</hi> whereof there is mention <hi>chap. 10.</hi> which conſiſteth in the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> from all that She ſuffered by and under the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and in the reduction of all the Kingdoms of the World to Jeſus Chriſt, which will usher in the <hi>Millennian</hi> peace of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being fully perſwaded, that this Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which I have laid down, is the true <hi>Key of the Apocalypſe;</hi> I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſtribute this Work into <hi>two</hi> parts. The <hi>firſt</hi> shall explain the <hi>Viſions</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:108142:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Chapters 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</hi> The <hi>ſecond</hi> shall illuſtrate thoſe of <hi>Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11,</hi> and 16.</p>
                  <p>By this means there will be found here an entire <hi>Syſteme</hi> of the whole <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,</hi> where one may ſee the <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of all the <hi>Viſions,</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> of the ſeveral <hi>Events</hi> therein fore-told; and all this in ſo compendious a manner, as is not to be met with elſewhere. For whether they be Commentaries, or other Tracts, in which all theſe <hi>Viſions</hi> are explained, they are either of a length ſufficient to weary and diſcourage the Reader; or if they be ſo short as by reaſon of their brevity to invite one to peruſe them, they do at moſt but expound a part of theſe <hi>Viſions,</hi> and afford a very imperfect account of this Divine <hi>Book,</hi> and leave the Reader under great deficiency as to the knowledg of it.</p>
                  <p>There are divers of the <hi>Refugies,</hi> who had the ſight of this Diſcourſe while they were in <hi>France.</hi> For the <hi>Author</hi> had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed it near the end of <hi>Auguſt 1685.</hi> about two day's before the arrival of the new <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries</hi> the <hi>Dragoons,</hi> who plundred him of all he had. So that this was the whole that he was able to ſave out of that doleful Ship-wreck; which ſince his arrival at a
<pb facs="tcp:108142:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
place of ſecurity, he hath reviewed and corrected in ſeveral places. And having met with the <hi>Accompliſhment of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> written by the famous <hi>Monſr. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieu;</hi> the Author was exceedingly pleaſed to find that he had explained the <hi>11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap.</hi> as promiſſory of there eſtablishment of the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> according as that great Man hath done.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it may be feared, leſt this conformity in their opinions, ſeconded with a general hope, should make the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who remain ſtill in <hi>France,</hi> the more inclinable to abide there, tho they may find opportunities of making their eſcape; he thinks fit to admonish them as from God, to obey immediately that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly voice, <hi>Come out of</hi> Babylon, <hi>my people, leſt pertaking of her ſins, ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reive alſo of her plagues.</hi> And to let them know, that they cannot go to <hi>Maſs,</hi> without either <hi>worſhipping the Beaſt,</hi> or <hi>worſhipping his Image;</hi> or without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>having his Name,</hi> or the <hi>Number of his Name,</hi> and without receiving his <hi>Mark,</hi> either in their <hi>Foreheads,</hi> or in their <hi>Hands.</hi> And by becoming inrolled in that liſt, they ceaſe to be of the <hi>Number</hi> of the 144000. that are <hi>ſealed,</hi> and of
<pb facs="tcp:108142:10"/>
thoſe who are to Reign with Jeſus Chriſt. And as they cannot worship the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> which is but a Creature, without being <hi>Idolaters;</hi> ſo they cannot plead, that in their hearts they do it not, without the being <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> and through being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Idolaters</hi> or <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive upon themſelves the Judgments of God. Neither are they to make the <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment</hi> of <hi>Prophecies,</hi> nor theſe <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations</hi> upon the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> the Rule of their conduct; but they are to govern themſelves by the alone Word of God, which requires them to <hi>beware of Idols,</hi> to <hi>withdraw from Idolaters,</hi> and to fly from one place to another in time of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and that not only to the hazarding their Eſtates and their Liberties, but their very lives, as thouſands of Exiles of all quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Sexes and Ages have done.</p>
                  <p>The infinite mercy of God, his ineffable and immenſe Wiſdom, his Titles of <hi>mighty in Power, wonderful in Counſel, the ſtrong God, who can do both above our thoughts and our deſires, his being a God to whom vengeance belongeth; a jealous God, who worketh all things for the glory of his Name;</hi> together with the Interceſſion of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb facs="tcp:108142:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of an innumerable company of Souls, that pray to God day and night for the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his anger away from his people: Theſe I ſay, are Conſiderations which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford infinitely more ſolid foundations for the ſupport of our hopes, in reference to the re-eſtablishment of the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> than all human conjectures and reaſonings can adminiſter. But how firm ſoever the foundation is, that this hope is built upon; yet it ought not to hinder thoſe who know the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> either from withdrawing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately out of the Kingdom, provided they can find a door open to eſcape; or from repairing the injury which through their ſacrilegious <hi>Abjuration,</hi> they have done to <hi>Religion,</hi> by a publick and conſtant Confeſſion of the Truth for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Finally,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> made uſe of no <hi>Books</hi> towards the compoſure of this Diſcourſe, ſave of <hi>Launay's</hi> Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, published under the name of <hi>Jonas le Buy, Sr. de la Perie,</hi> and of the <hi>Synopſis Criticorum.</hi> He chiefly follows <hi>Launay,</hi> as having a great eſteem for his judgment as well as his Learning; and as thinking that ſo good a Guide, could not conduct

                  <p>But this <hi>Preface</hi> is too long, for an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that would equally avoid length as well as obſcurity. And he hopes, there will be no cauſe of faſtning upon him that Reproach.</p>

having in the <hi>Viſion,</hi> related in the 13. <hi>Chapter,</hi> deſcribed this <hi>Beaſt</hi> unto us; we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>firſt</hi> place to inquire, what is meant by this <hi>Beaſt</hi> with <hi>Seven Heads</hi> and <hi>Ten Horns,</hi> that we may be able thereby to know with the more certainty, and with the greater plainneſs, who this <hi>Woman</hi> is that is called <hi>Babylon the Great,</hi> whom the <hi>Beaſt</hi> carries.</p>
                        <p>Nor will it be difficult to underſtand the meaning and import of this Term <hi>Beaſt,</hi> it having been explained in the <hi>Viſions</hi> of <hi>Daniel.</hi> For that <hi>Prophet</hi> having in the <hi>7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. v.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. declared, how that he beheld <hi>Four Beaſts riſing out of the Sea,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> whereof <hi>reſembled a Lion,</hi> the <hi>ſecond a Bear,</hi> the <hi>third a Leopard,</hi> and the <hi>fourth different from the three former:</hi> He adds, that having asked one of the <hi>Angels,</hi> that ſtood before the <hi>Ancient of Day's,</hi> what the meaning of that <hi>Viſion</hi> might be? it was anſwered him <hi>v.</hi> 17. that theſe four <hi>Beaſts</hi> were four <hi>Kings,</hi> which ſhould ariſe upon the Earth. So that this Explication vouchſav'd by the <hi>Angel</hi> unto <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the four <hi>Beaſts,</hi> do's fully inform us, that this Term <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the Revelations of St. <hi>John,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Power,</hi> àn <hi>Empire,</hi> a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Rulers;</hi> as the <hi>four</hi> in <hi>Daniel's Viſions</hi> repreſented the <hi>four Empires,</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian, Perſian, Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> with which the Church of God was concerned; and which <hi>four Empires</hi> had been before repreſented by the <hi>Image</hi> that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in his Dream, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="3" facs="tcp:108142:14"/>The word <hi>Beaſt</hi> being then uſed in the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of <hi>Daniel,</hi> to denote an <hi>Empire,</hi> or a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of <hi>Soveraign Rulers;</hi> it can have no other ſignification affixed unto it in the <hi>Viſions</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> foraſmuch as one Spirit inſpired both the Apoſtle, and the Prophet. And this is the more evident, in that <hi>Daniel's fourth Beaſt,</hi> is the ſame with that in <hi>St. Johns Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> as do's plainly appear by the univerſal and perfect Agreement that is between the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Whereas <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us, <hi>c. 7. v.</hi> 7. that the <hi>Fourth Beaſt,</hi> which is the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and to which he gave no Name, was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the <hi>three</hi> former, from the <hi>Lion,</hi> the <hi>Bear,</hi> and the <hi>Leopard;</hi> ſo <hi>St. Iohn</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the <hi>Beaſt</hi> upon which the <hi>Woman</hi> ſitteth, not only as diverſe from thoſe three; but as that which there is none that bears any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance unto; and which (as he ſays) <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 2. had the <hi>Body of a Leopard, and whoſe Feet were as the Feet of a Bear, and his Mouth as the Mouth of a Lion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Whereas <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 7. 7. ſays of the <hi>fourth Beaſt,</hi> that he had <hi>ten Horns. St. Iohn</hi> ſays the ſame of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that carried the Woman, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12.</p>
                        <p>3. And as <hi>Daniel</hi> informs us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 24. that the <hi>ten Horns</hi> of the <hi>fourth Beaſt</hi> were <hi>ten Kings,</hi> that should ariſe out of that Kingdom; <hi>St. Iohn</hi> likewiſe aſſures us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12 that the <hi>ten Horns</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> upon which the <hi>Woman</hi> ſitteth, are <hi>ten Kings,</hi> which had not then received any Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>4. Whereas <hi>Daniel</hi> ſays, <hi>Chap. 7. v.</hi> 8. 25.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108142:15"/>
that the <hi>little Horn</hi> of the <hi>fourth Beaſt,</hi> had a <hi>Mouth, ſpeaking great things; and uttering words againſt the Moſt High. St. Iohn</hi> alſo ſay's of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that carried the <hi>Woman, Rev.</hi> 13. 5, 6. that <hi>there was given unto him a Mouth ſpeaking great things, and that he opened his Mouth in Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemies againſt God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. Foraſmuch as <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap. 7. v.</hi> 21. concerning the <hi>little Horn</hi> of the <hi>fourth Beaſt, that he made war with the Saints, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt them. St. John</hi> ſay's the ſame of the <hi>fourth Beaſt,</hi> upon which the <hi>Woman</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7. namely, that <hi>it was given unto him to make war with the Saints, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. And whereas <hi>Daniel</hi> declares, <hi>Chap. 7. v.</hi> 25. that the <hi>Saints shall be given into the hands of the fourth Beaſt a time, times, and the dividing of time; St. John</hi> declares alſo of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> upon which the <hi>Woman</hi> ſitteth, <hi>Rev. 13. 7. that Power was given unto him, to continue forty and two moneths,</hi> which make juſt three <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical years</hi> and a half.</p>
                        <p>7. Laſtly, Foraſmuch as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſays of the <hi>fourth Beaſt, chap. 7. v.</hi> 11. that <hi>he was ſtain, and his body deſtroyed, and given to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flame. St. Iohn</hi> declares the ſame of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> that carried the <hi>Woman, Rev. 19. v.</hi> 20. how that <hi>he was taken, and caſt into a Lake of Fire burning with Brimſtone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that after the agreement of the <hi>one Beaſt,</hi> with the <hi>other,</hi> in ſo many particulars, there is no room left for ſuſpition, but that <hi>Daniel's fourth Beaſt,</hi> is the <hi>ſame</hi> with the <hi>Beaſt</hi> deſcribed by <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> upon whom the <hi>Woman</hi>
                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:108142:15"/>
ſtiled <hi>Babylon the Great</hi> ſitteth; and that all the <hi>Revelations</hi> of <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> are nothing elſe but a continuation of the <hi>Prophetical Hiſtory,</hi> which <hi>Daniel</hi> had begun of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>

Here is the mind,</hi> (ſay's he) <hi>that hath wiſdom; the ſeven Heads are ſeven Mountains, on which the Woman ſitteth.

                        </p>
                        <p>So that from and by means of theſe <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> we come to be aſſured, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> according to the expoſition given by the <hi>Angel,</hi> can be nothing but the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this is made further evident by the <hi>ſeven Kings,</hi> which as the <hi>Angel</hi> tells us, are alſo ſignified by the <hi>ſeven Heads, Rev. 17. v. 10. And there are ſeven Kings, five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come.</hi>

it hath paſſed ſince its Foundation. For it is the <hi>Scripture</hi> method of expreſſion, to ſignify by <hi>Kings</hi> all ſorts of Supream <hi>Governors.</hi> As appears both from the 36. of <hi>Geneſis v.</hi> 31. where <hi>Moſes</hi> having reckoned up the <hi>Kings</hi> that reigned in <hi>Edom,</hi> before there reigned any <hi>King</hi> over the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> means no more, than before there was any <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Magiſtrate</hi> in Iſrael; and from <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. v. 5. where <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to have been <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Ieshurun.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>ſeven</hi> kinds of Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, by which <hi>Rome</hi> hath been governed, are <hi>Kings, Conſuls, Decemviri, Military Tribunes, Dictators, Emperors,</hi> and <hi>Popes. Five</hi> whereof the <hi>Angel</hi> ſays, <hi>were fallen,</hi> and that the <hi>ſixth,</hi> which was that of <hi>Emperors, now is,</hi> namely, in the time of St. <hi>Iohn;</hi> but that the <hi>ſeventh was not yet come,</hi> foraſmuch as the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> was not at that time, what he is ſince grown up unto by his Uſurpations, of being as well the <hi>Soveraign Maſter</hi> over Kings and Emperors, as <hi>Monarch</hi> over the <hi>Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But we are not yet come to prove the <hi>Pope</hi> to be meant by the <hi>ſeventh Head,</hi> it being neceſſary before we advance to that, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain divers other particulars; ſo that it is enough for the preſent, to have shewn, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> can repreſent nothing elſe ſave the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi>

                        <p>THE <hi>Lamb,</hi> by which our Saviour is repreſented, is ſaid to have <hi>Horns,</hi> as well as the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> but the ſignification of the <hi>Horns</hi> of the one, is ſomewhat different from the meaning of the <hi>Horns</hi> of the other. Thoſe of the <hi>Lamb</hi> do denote the <hi>Power</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and the number <hi>ſeven</hi> intimates the perfection of it, <hi>Rev. 5. v.</hi>

                           </gap>. So that the <hi>Lamb's</hi> being repreſented with <hi>ſeven Horns,</hi> is to ſignify the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of his <hi>Power,</hi> or, as it is in the language of <hi>St. Paul, Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10. His <hi>having a Name given him above every name, that at the Name of Ieſus every Knee should bow.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> do ſignify <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> and <hi>Dominions,</hi> as appears by their being applied to ſuch a ſenſe in the <hi>Viſions</hi> of <hi>Daniel.</hi> Thus the <hi>Ram,</hi> by which was ſignified the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Perſia, Dan.</hi> 8. 3. is repreſented with two <hi>high Horns,</hi> and whereof the one was higher than the other, becauſe the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia</hi> was more powerful than that of the <hi>Medes.</hi> And accordingly the <hi>Angel</hi> tells St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that the <hi>Ten Horns</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> are <hi>Ten Kings.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor is it of any great moment, whether the number <hi>Ten</hi> do ſignify punctually ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it being ſufficient to take the word <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely,</hi>
                           <pb n="9" facs="tcp:108142:17"/>
for the intimating a conſiderable number, it being ſo uſed elſewhere. And thus it both ſignifies the <hi>great Extent</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and ſerves to demonſtrate that it is only <hi>this Empire,</hi> which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> there being no other in <hi>St. Iohns</hi> time that could anſwer the vaſt importance of this <hi>Phraſe,</hi> or at leaſt none that was known, and with which the Church of God had any concernment.

                        <p>So that there remain only two <hi>Queſtions</hi> to be decided, whereof <hi>one</hi> is, whether we are to underſtand by <hi>Babylon, Rome</hi> as it was <hi>Heathen,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> as it is <hi>Chriſtian?</hi> And after we shall have demonſtrated, that it is <hi>Rome Chriſtian</hi> that is intended by <hi>Babylon;</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Queſtion</hi> will be, whether by <hi>Babylon,</hi> we are to underſtand <hi>Rome</hi> as it <hi>now</hi> is, or as <hi>it is to be</hi> under the Reign of a certain pretended <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> whom the Advocates for the <hi>Pope</hi> will have yet to come?</p>

                           <pb n="11" facs="tcp:108142:18"/>1. 'Tis certain, that the Holy Ghoſt, in deſcribing the <hi>Apocalyptick Babylon,</hi> does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to <hi>Babylon</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> where the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were held captive ſeventy years. <hi>Babylon</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> of this whereof St. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaks. And it being of the nature of <hi>Types</hi> to be of a different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and frame, from thoſe things which they <hi>typify,</hi> and whereof they are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems; it does neceſſarily follow, that the <hi>Chaldean Babylon</hi> being <hi>Heathen,</hi> this whereof St. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaks, muſt be of a <hi>Religion</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from that, and conſequently <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi> And withal, that as the <hi>Bondage</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> was <hi>Corporal,</hi> ſo that of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptick Babylon</hi> muſt be <hi>Spiritual.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2.

                        </p>
                        <p>3. The <hi>Babylon</hi> which <hi>St. Iohn</hi> deſcribes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 8. is one that <hi>aſcended out of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit,</hi> and which is an infernal Power, and contrary to the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, and to his Word: which cannot be affirmed of the Soveraignty of <hi>Rome</hi> as it was <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> in that all the ſeveral <hi>Governments</hi> of this World <hi>were ordained by God, Rom.</hi> 13. 1. but may very well be ſaid of <hi>Rome</hi> as it is <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. <hi>St. Iohn</hi> deſcribes <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was to be after the deſtruction of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and its diviſion among <hi>Ten Kings,</hi> who were to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108142:19"/>
their pomer at the ſame with the Beaſt, Rev.</hi> 17. 12. which as it can no ways agree to <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Heathen,</hi> ſo the event hath shewed that the <hi>Popes</hi> grew up to their Domination, at the ſame time, when thro the ſubverſion of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> by the Northern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, many <hi>Kingdoms</hi> were formed out of it.</p>
                        <p>5. St. <hi>Iohn, Rev.</hi> 18. 13. deſcribes <hi>Babylon</hi> as a <hi>Merchant, that bought the Souls of men;</hi> which is not applicable to <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Pagan,</hi> it being certain that it never uſed that abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Traffick. It bought Slaves, to ſerve it ſelf of their Bodies; but it never <hi>bought Souls,</hi> nor ſought to purchaſe men by money to be of the <hi>Heathen Religion;</hi> that was never practiſed but by <hi>Rome Chriſtian.</hi> It is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly known, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> have for divers years advanced a <hi>Fond,</hi> for the <hi>buying</hi> the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and have drove that Traffick and made Purchaſes of them in all the <hi>Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> So that from this Topick alſo, it muſt be <hi>Rome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> that is the <hi>Babylon</hi> here meant.</p>
                        <p>6. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> foretels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 2. that <hi>Babylon</hi> shall be <hi>deſtroyed, and become the Habitation of Devils:</hi> But it did not befal <hi>Rome Heathen</hi> to be deſtroyed; and when it was taken by the <hi>Goths,</hi> it was <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> So that the <hi>Babylon</hi> here meant, muſt be <hi>Rome Chriſtian,</hi> and which for becoming <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and the Habitation of Devils, is to be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
                        <p>7. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſays, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 3. of the <hi>Babylon</hi> that he intends, that after its ſubverſion it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108142:19"/>
shall never be built again, but that it shall be a perpetual deſolation. Which foraſmuch as it did not befal <hi>Rome Pagan,</hi> it muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be <hi>Rome Chriſtian,</hi> that is the <hi>Babylon</hi> threatned to be ſo thrown down, as that <hi>She shall be found no more at all, Rev.</hi> 18. 21.</p>
                        <p>8. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> upon his beholding <hi>Babylon Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous,</hi> and <hi>drunken with the Blood of Saints and Martyrs,</hi> he was ſurpriſed and aſtonished: <hi>when I ſaw,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 5, 6. that <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> was become a <hi>Harlot,</hi> and an <hi>Idolatreſs,</hi> and that <hi>She was drunken with the Blood of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, I wondred with great admiration.</hi> Now he muſt be under more than a natural blindneſs, who does not perceive that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> would not have been aſtonished, to ſee <hi>Rome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> and as She was in his time, an <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs</hi> and a <hi>Murthereſs,</hi> ſeeing he had never known her otherwiſe than with theſe two Qualities: whereas he had reaſon to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſed, that the <hi>Viſion</hi> should repreſent unto him what was to be afterwards, and how that <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Chriſtian</hi> was to be immerged in <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and to perſecute <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for not being Idolatrous as She was. So that there cannot be a more foolish imagination, than by <hi>Babylon</hi> to underſtand <hi>Rome</hi> as it was <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>9. Laſtly, The <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> are one and the ſame power; ſo that St. <hi>Iohn, Rev.</hi> 19. 21. joins the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> which proveth beyond all poſſibility of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Contradiction, that <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is nothing elſe ſave the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is in truth a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Power,</hi> but founded upon a ſpecious
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108142:20"/>
pretence of Religion, and upon the <hi>Vicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and upon St. <hi>Peter;</hi> ſo that thereby alſo it appeareth, that it is <hi>She,</hi> in whom the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> is fulfilled, 2 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 7. Rev.</hi> 17. 5.</p>
                        <p>As for the other <hi>Queſtion,</hi> whether that ſeeing <hi>Babylon</hi> ſignifies <hi>Rome Chriſtian,</hi> we are therefore to underſtand thereby <hi>Rome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> as She is now, and hath been for many Ages paſt; or as She is to be under the Reign of a certain <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> whom the Partiſans for the <hi>Pope</hi> will not have to be yet come: I ſay, that <hi>Queſtion</hi> will be fully reſolved, when we have made it appear, that the <hi>Beaſt with the Two Horns,</hi> is the <hi>Papal Empire,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Eighth King,</hi> the <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>

large deſigns the <hi>Roman Empire. Secondly,</hi> As it is uſed preciſely or ſtrictly to denote the <hi>Beaſt</hi> under the <hi>ſeventh Head,</hi> which is the <hi>Pope,</hi> or Papal Power, and ſo it is repreſented by the <hi>Beaſt with Two Horns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis moſt evident, that it is <hi>Rome</hi> under the <hi>ſeventh Head,</hi> which is the <hi>Pope,</hi> that is here ſpoken of; in that it is the <hi>Healing of the Wound,</hi> which the <hi>Beaſt</hi> had received under the <hi>ſixth Head.</hi> For he both ſpeaks of this <hi>Wound</hi> in the <hi>third Verſe,</hi> and then of the <hi>Healing</hi> of it by the <hi>Beaſt with two Horns,</hi> which is the <hi>Papacy,</hi> in the 12. <hi>Verſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now that the <hi>Papal Empire</hi> is the <hi>Seventh Head,</hi> or the <hi>Beaſt with Two Horns,</hi> will be demonſtratively proved, by obſerving the conformity which is between that <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the <hi>Papal Kingdom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. For whereas the Term <hi>Beaſt,</hi> does ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a <hi>Domination</hi> and an <hi>Empire;</hi> it cannot be denied, but that the <hi>Romish Church</hi> is an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> and that it may be ſtiled the <hi>Papal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Foraſmuch as <hi>Horns,</hi> according as we have proved, do denote <hi>Iuriſdictions</hi> and <hi>Powers;</hi> ſo the <hi>Papal Authority</hi> comprehends a <hi>twofold Power,</hi> and <hi>two kinds</hi> of <hi>Domination;</hi> one over that which is <hi>Temporal,</hi> and another over that which is <hi>Spiritual.</hi> One over this <hi>Life,</hi> and another over that which is <hi>to come.</hi> So that the <hi>Papal Kingdom</hi> muſt be that which is meant by the <hi>Beaſt with Two Horns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Whereas 'tis ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11. that the <hi>Two Horns</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> were like the <hi>Two Horns</hi> of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> All do know that Jeſus

And whereas 'tis ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11. that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with <hi>two Horns ſpake as a Dragon;</hi> 'tis undeniable, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſpeaks in the ſame manner, and not only like the <hi>Devil, Matth.</hi> 4. 9. aſſumeth to himſelf a <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Diſpoſing of all the Kingdoms of the World,</hi> and of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding men to obey the Commandments of God; but as the calumniating Spirit, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth Gods Word, both by accuſing it of falſehood, and by robbing it of its <hi>perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, integrity, perfection, ſufficiency,</hi> and of its <hi>Authority,</hi> which he challengeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                        <p>5. It being ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 12. that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with <hi>two Horns exerciſeth all the power of the firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed.</hi> This does perfectly agree to the <hi>Papal Power.</hi> For the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> that flourished in St. <hi>Iohn's time,</hi> having received a <hi>Deadly Wound,</hi> it became <hi>healed</hi> thro the application of the <hi>Papal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> as a Plaiſter unto it. Now that <hi>Wound</hi> conſiſted in <hi>two</hi> things; in the Subverſion of the <hi>Pagan Idolatry,</hi> and in the Abatement of the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> And the <hi>Heathens</hi> were wont to obſerve in their Diſputations againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that as the ancient <hi>Religion</hi> fell from its ſplendor, ſo the Glory of <hi>Rome</hi> did
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108142:21"/>
proportionably <hi>decay.</hi> And as the <hi>Pagan Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> became in effect deſtroyed, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the care of his <hi>Succeſſors;</hi> ſo <hi>Rome</hi> as to its <hi>Glory,</hi> being firſt much darkned, and almoſt extinguished, and then being deſtroyed by the <hi>Goths;</hi> tho it came afterwards to be reſtored, yet it was never honored to be the <hi>Reſidence</hi> of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,</hi> in that they fixed their abode at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna</hi> and <hi>Millan.</hi> Theſe <hi>two Wounds</hi> ſeemed to be <hi>incurable;</hi> but the <hi>Papal Soveraignty</hi> did perfectly <hi>heal</hi> them both. For in the room of the <hi>God's Worshipped</hi> under <hi>Paganiſm;</hi> there was ſet up the <hi>Adoration</hi> of <hi>Angels, Saints,</hi> the <hi>Conſecrated Bread,</hi> and of <hi>Relicks.</hi> So that by this new <hi>Idolatry, Panagiſm</hi> became again reſtored. And withal <hi>Rome</hi> hath recovered a Glory not only equal unto its former, but greater than what it had; ſeeing the <hi>Pope</hi> thro having made it the <hi>Seat</hi> of his <hi>Empire,</hi> appears there as the true <hi>Succeſſor</hi> of the <hi>Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> as the <hi>Commander</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and as the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream <hi>Pontife,</hi> as well as Chief <hi>Ceſar,</hi> who hath united the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> to the <hi>Imperial Dignity.</hi> In a word, the <hi>Pope</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>Senate</hi> attired in Purple, and challengeth a Right of Depoſing Kings, and of diſpoſing Crowns, and who receives Tribute from all People, and makes himſelf to be adored, not only with a Civil, but with a Religious Adoration, as the <hi>Emperors</hi> of old uſed to be.</p>
                        <p>Both <hi>Blondus</hi> and <hi>Steuchus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Egu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium,</hi> do ingenuouſly deſcribe, without being aware of it, how the <hi>Wound</hi> which <hi>Rome</hi> had received, is again healed thro
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108142:22"/>
means of the <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> that is come to be veſted in the <hi>Pope.</hi> The firſt ſays, <q>That the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is now greater than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was, becauſe the <hi>Princes</hi> of the Earth, do now worship the Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter</hi> as perpetual <hi>Dictator,</hi> that is, as Soveraign <hi>Pontife,</hi> and as <hi>Vicar</hi> of the High Prieſt Jeſus Chriſt. And the other tells us, That if after the Subverſion of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> God had not raiſed up the <hi>Papacy,</hi> in which the ancient Majeſty of <hi>Rome</hi> is revived, that <hi>City</hi> had been a Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Brute Beaſts; whereas by the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> it hath recovered a grandure very little different from that which it had in the time of the old <hi>Empire;</hi> ſeeing all Nations do now no leſs Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> than heretofore they obeyed the <hi>Roman Emperors.</hi>
                           </q> So that by this it appears, that the <hi>Beaſt with Two Horns,</hi> is nothing but the <hi>Papacy;</hi> foraſmuch as the <hi>Papal Power</hi> hath healed <hi>Rome</hi> of the <hi>Wound</hi> she had received under the <hi>Emperors,</hi> and rendred her again both <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> and <hi>Miſtriſs</hi> of the World, as she was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                        <p>6. Whereas 'tis ſaid of the <hi>Beaſt with Two Horns, Rev.</hi> 13. 12. That <hi>he cauſeth the Earth, and them that dwell therein, to worship the firſt Beaſt;</hi> this agrees alſo to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> which cauſeth that <hi>Rome</hi> being <hi>healed</hi> of its <hi>Wound,</hi> is as much, if not more reverenced, than ever it had been, upon an alledged pretence of having been the <hi>Chair</hi> and <hi>Seat</hi> of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> As the <hi>Pagans</hi> made a <hi>Goddeſs</hi> of <hi>Rome Heathen,</hi>
                           <pb n="19" facs="tcp:108142:22"/>
by conſecrating a Temple, and dedicating a Feaſt unto her, which they called <hi>Septimon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium:</hi> ſo <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do no leſs make a <hi>Goddeſs</hi> of <hi>Rome Chriſtian,</hi> both by ſtiling her the <hi>Miſtriſs of the World,</hi> and thro attributing to her the Priviledg of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> that does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to none ſave unto God.</p>
                        <p>7. 'Tis further ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 13. That <hi>the Beaſt with two Horns, doth great Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſo that he maketh Fire come down from Heaven.</hi> Now all men do not only know, that the <hi>Romish Legends</hi> are full of the <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> pretended to be done in the <hi>Papal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> but that the <hi>Excommunications</hi> which flow from the <hi>Papal</hi> Juriſdiction are as much dreaded by <hi>Princes,</hi> who ſtand in aw' of that Authority, as Fire and Lightning from Heaven. Hiſtory affords us many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Princes,</hi> who have been ruined by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Excommunications.</hi> To this day they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear not to proclaim the <hi>Miracles</hi> which are conſtantly wrought in the <hi>Papal Kingdom,</hi> and the Partiſans for the <hi>Pope</hi> vaunt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon them, as <hi>marks</hi> of the true <hi>Church.</hi> But this is peculiar to thoſe <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> that they are no where done but in the <hi>Papal Empire,</hi> and that out of the view of <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Nor are they profitable unto any, ſave unto thoſe who do eſteem them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any of their Wonder-mongers, that have Raiſed the Dead.

                        </p>
                        <p>8. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 14, 15. That <hi>the Beaſt with two Horns, commandeth them that dwell on
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108142:23"/>
the Earth, that they should make an Image unto the Beaſt which had the Wound; and that it was granted to the Beaſt, to give Life unto this Image, that it should ſpeak.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now this <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is nothing but the <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> as appears from the 14. <hi>Chapter v.</hi> 9, and 11. where the Deſcription of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is the ſame with this of his <hi>Image.</hi> Which would not be, if the <hi>Beaſt with two Horns</hi> were other than the <hi>Pope.</hi> And the being an <hi>Image</hi> that <hi>ſpeaks,</hi> shews plainly that it does not differ from the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,</hi> or from that whoſe Image it is. We uſe to ſay of a Picture that is done natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to the life, that it wants nothing but that it cannot ſpeak, and that if it could ſpeak, it would be another <hi>Original.</hi> None to whom the <hi>Papal Authority</hi> is known, can be ignorant that the <hi>Pope</hi> has the ſame <hi>Power,</hi> which the <hi>Emperors</hi> had; the ſame <hi>Throne;</hi> the ſame Soveraign <hi>Pontifical Dignity;</hi> and that he is <hi>worshipped</hi> with the ſame <hi>Adoration,</hi> and hath as ſtately a <hi>Senate,</hi> and as magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent a <hi>Court.</hi> Now the <hi>Pope</hi> is ſtiled an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> and not the thing it ſelf; both becauſe he is ariſen to his greatneſs under a pretence of <hi>Religion,</hi> and under the Title of being the <hi>Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and becauſe he is alſo the <hi>Vicar</hi> of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the <hi>Succeſſor</hi> of <hi>Ceſar.</hi> And as he is in that Quality an <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Ceſar;</hi> ſo being an <hi>Image</hi> that <hi>ſpeaks,</hi> he is cloathed with all the Majeſty of the <hi>Emperors,</hi> and poſſeſſed of their whole <hi>Authority.</hi> Accordingly he will have his Feet kiſſed as the Feet of the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi>

were; and will have Kings kneel before him, as they did before the <hi>Ceſars.</hi> For as the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> notes of the Emperor <hi>Caligula,</hi> that he had his Feet kiſſed, ſo the Poet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> ſpeaking in one of his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of a <hi>Prince</hi> that kneeled before <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſays, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before him <hi>Genibus minor.</hi>

                        <p>9. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 15.

                        </p>
                        <p>10. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Rev. 13. 17.

                        <p>11. Whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 17. That the <hi>Beaſt with two Horns</hi> hath three ſorts of Subjects or Followers. One that <hi>bears</hi> his <hi>Mark;</hi> another that <hi>carry's</hi> his <hi>Name;</hi> and a third, that hath the <hi>Number of his Name.</hi> The
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108142:24"/>
                           <hi>Pope</hi> hath alſo three ſorts of Adherents: one that <hi>beareth</hi> his <hi>Mark,</hi> which is the <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,</hi> that are tyed to him by an Oath, and who boaſt of an <hi>indelible Character.</hi> Another that <hi>carrieth</hi> his <hi>Name,</hi> which is thoſe that do ſtile themſelves <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and who do glory in it, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> did. The Third ſort <hi>bear</hi> the <hi>Number</hi> of his <hi>Name,</hi> and theſe are they who are ashamed to be called <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and account it for an Injury to be ſo ſtiled, as the moſt part do in <hi>France.</hi> But they call themſelves <hi>Catholicks,</hi> which is a word that hath reference to <hi>number, Catholick</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Univerſal,</hi> and this cauſeth that the <hi>Pope</hi> does acknowledg them for his.</p>
                        <p>12. There remains the <hi>Number of the Beaſt,</hi> which is 666. and in order to our being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that this is the <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> we are to obſerve, that he treats not of the <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt alone, Rev.</hi> 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. but alſo of the <hi>Number</hi> of his <hi>Name;</hi> becauſe it comes to be ſpoken of thoſe who have the <hi>Number of the Name of the Beaſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Holy Ghoſt doth acquaint thoſe who shall read, that this <hi>Name</hi> is not kept ſo hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in reference to where it is to be found, but that they who have wiſdom, may be able to diſcover it. For by telling us, that it is the <hi>Number of a Man,</hi> we are to <hi>count</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner that men uſe to do. <hi>Here is Wiſdom,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>let him that hath underſtanding, count the number of the Beaſt; for it is the Number of a Man, and his Number is ſix hundred threeſcore and ſix.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In order then to find in the <hi>Papacy</hi> the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108142:24"/>
666. we are after the manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation among men, to extract the <hi>Cubical Root</hi> of that number. For as 144. is in the Book of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> the Number of the <hi>Heavenly Ieruſalem;</hi> ſo 666. is made there the Number of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> And as 12. is the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bical Root</hi> of 144. ſo if we can but find in the <hi>Papacy</hi> a number that is the <hi>Cubical Root</hi> of 666. we need not in the leaſt doubt but that 666. is the Number of the <hi>Papal Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They call that in <hi>Arithmetick</hi> the <hi>Cubical Root</hi> of any ſpecified number, which being multiplied by it ſelf, does conſtitute that Number, whether it be with a <hi>Fraction</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, or without one. Thus 10. is the <hi>Cubical Root</hi> of a 100. becauſe 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by it ſelf, makes a 100. But if we would ſeek for the <hi>Cubical Root</hi> of 55. we can aſſign no other than 7. and becauſe 7. mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by it ſelf, makes but 49, there muſt to the making up 55. be 6. added, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticians</hi> ſtile a <hi>Fraction.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And it is worthy of Obſervation, that the Holy Ghoſt doth not require us to count the Number of the <hi>Heavenly Jeruſalem;</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he hath done it himſelf, both in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that it is 144. and in diſcovering 12. to be the <hi>Cubical Root</hi> of it. For not being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied to tells us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 5, &amp;c. that there were 12000. ſealed out of every Tribe, he gives us further to underſtand, that all things relating to the <hi>Heavenly Ieruſalem,</hi> are to be counted by <hi>twelve.</hi> Thus there are aſcribed unto it 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Foundations, 12. Gates, 12 Angels, 12. Tribes, 12000. Furlongs, Rev.</hi> 21. 12, &amp;c. and 12.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108142:25"/>
manner of <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Tree of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 2. And becauſe 12. times 12. make 144. he therefore expreſly tells us, that the <hi>Wall</hi> of the <hi>Myſtical Ieruſalem</hi> was 144. <hi>Cubits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This the Holy Ghoſt hath not done in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> for contenting himſelf with the having revealed his <hi>Number,</hi> he doth not diſcover the <hi>Cubical Root</hi> of it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth us to ſearch it out. <hi>Let him that hath underſtanding,</hi> ſays he, <hi>count the Number of the Beaſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let us then obey this command, and ſearch out the <hi>Cubical Root</hi> of 666. and we shall find it to be 25. Becauſe 25. multiplied by it ſelf, makes 625. to which the <hi>Fraction</hi> of 41. being added, there reſults the number of 666.</p>
                        <p>Now it is moſt evident, that the number 25. is Sacred in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, being to be found every where, both in her <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and in her <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>According to <hi>Onuphrius, Rome,</hi> which is the Seat and Throne of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> hath 25. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Gates,</hi> and as many <hi>Myſtical</hi> Ones, or 25. Churches wherein they do baptize.</p>
                        <p>According to <hi>Baronius, Ciaconius, Pot. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil. Onuphrius,</hi> and <hi>Platina, Rome</hi> had at firſt but 25. <hi>Cardinals, 25. Curates,</hi> and 25. <hi>Parishes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>According to <hi>Onuphrius</hi> and <hi>Lipſius,</hi> the Compaſs and Circumference of <hi>Rome</hi> is 25. Furlongs.</p>
                        <p>According to <hi>Bzovius,</hi> She hath 25. <hi>Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> 25. <hi>Altars,</hi> and the great <hi>Altar</hi> hath according

to <hi>Aug. Rocca</hi> a <hi>Croſs</hi> upon it, that is 25. Span high. And if we may believe <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> each ſide of that <hi>Altar</hi> is 25. Foot large.</p>
                        <p>There is alſo upon all their <hi>Altars</hi> the number of 25. imprinted, in that the <hi>five Wounds Chriſt</hi> are graven upon them in five ſeveral places.</p>
                        <p>There are uſually 25. <hi>Monks</hi> in their <hi>Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi> And for ſome Ages they have held their <hi>Jubilee</hi> every 25. years.</p>
                        <p>There are 25. <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Papal</hi> Faith; for ſo many the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the fourth containeth.</p>
                        <p>And the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> which gave us the laſt Summary and account of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, was both finished in 25. <hi>Seſſions,</hi> and ſigned by 25. <hi>Archbishops.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that 25. being the <hi>Cubical Root</hi> of 666. and this number being found in the <hi>Popish Church,</hi> running thro all that is Sacred and Auguſt, both in their <hi>Hierarchy, Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> it doth undeniably follow, that 666. is the <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence that the <hi>Romish Church</hi> is the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with <hi>two Horns.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>If the <hi>Reader</hi> should now demand, why the Holy Ghoſt gave the <hi>Number</hi> 666. for the Mark of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> rather than the <hi>Number</hi> 625. ſeeing 25. maketh the juſt Square <hi>Root</hi> of 625. without a <hi>Fraction,</hi> whereas to raiſe 666. from a multiplication of 25. there muſt be added a <hi>Fraction</hi> of 41.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, that if the Holy Spirit had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to mark out unto us only the <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> he would have ſatiſfied himſelf with the <hi>Number</hi> 625. but deſigning to point out unto us alſo the <hi>Number</hi> of his <hi>Name;</hi> it became his Wiſdom to give us the <hi>Number</hi> 666. that ſo by theſe two delineations he might the better paint him out unto us, it being evident that the <hi>Letters</hi> of the <hi>Beaſts Name,</hi> do contain and produce that <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>

Was it not <hi>Ireneus,</hi> one of the Holieſt, as well as one of the moſt Ancient of all the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that made it? One that had been the Diſciple of <hi>Polycarp,</hi> who had converſed with <hi>St. Iohn.</hi> There may indeed be found ſome other <hi>Greek Names,</hi> whoſe <hi>Letters</hi> make that <hi>Number;</hi> but then the other <hi>Features</hi> of the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which do all agree to the <hi>Papal Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> are not found in any of thoſe other ſubjects. So that we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that the <hi>Papal Empire</hi> is the only thing which the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> had a mind to repreſent in this deſcription.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath afforded us more Repreſentations of the <hi>Papacy</hi> than one, that he might both make it the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernable, and render thoſe inexcuſable that will not know it. In the 13. <hi>Chapter</hi> he deſcribes it both under the <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Beaſt i. e.</hi> of a <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Empire;</hi> and of a <hi>Beaſt with two Horns, i. e.</hi> that hath a <hi>twofold Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and a <hi>Temporal.</hi> Of which <hi>twofold Authority</hi> all men know that the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom does conſiſt. Tho there be ſome <hi>Popish Princes</hi> that cannot bring themſelves to confeſs it, becauſe their Ambition will not ſuffer them to acknowledg a Maſter.</p>
                        <p>But in the 17. <hi>chap.</hi> he ſets it before us under the Portraiture of a <hi>Woman;</hi> to give us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that this <hi>Kingdom</hi> repreſented by the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is a <hi>Church,</hi> and a <hi>Religious Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> For it is the <hi>ſtile</hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to ſpeak of the <hi>Church</hi> as of a <hi>Spouſe.</hi> Nor doth the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> deſcribe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108142:27"/>
it only to us as a <hi>Woman,</hi> but as a <hi>Harlot,</hi> and an <hi>Adultreſs;</hi> to intimate her <hi>Spiritual Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> which is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and by which she hath violated her Covenant with God. Which is enough to convince the moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> neither ſpeaketh in the 17. <hi>Chapter,</hi> nor in the 13. of a <hi>Heathen</hi> Society; God having never honoured any ſuch with the taking it into Covenant with him. But upon the whole, it appears to be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Society, which thro its <hi>Idolatry</hi> is become <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor doth this Portraiture repreſent her only as a <hi>Woman</hi> that is an <hi>Adultereſs,</hi> but as a <hi>Woman,</hi> that is the <hi>Mother of Harlots, Rev.</hi> 17. 5. to declare thereby the more plainly unto us, that it is the <hi>Roman Church</hi> which is meant, who calls her ſelf as well the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> as the <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of all thoſe <hi>Chriſtian Churches,</hi> that are become <hi>Idolatrous</hi> as She is.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the Holy Ghoſt repreſents this <hi>Woman,</hi> that is the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Harlots, ſitting upon many Waters, Rev.</hi> 17. 1, 15. to point out as it were with the finger unto us, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which extendeth and exerciſeth her Domination both Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, over multitudes of People and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Finally,</hi> he deſcribes this <hi>Woman, ſitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Beaſt with ſeven Heads and ten Horns, Rev.</hi> 17. 3. that he may tell us thereby plainly, and without shift or evaſion, that it is the <hi>Papacy</hi> and the <hi>Papal Kingdom,</hi> which is meant, which is riſen up in the room, and hath taken
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108142:28"/>
the place of the ancient <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as hath been already demonſtrated.</p>
                        <p>That we may yet better know this <hi>Papal Empire,</hi> let us take a view of the <hi>Image of Gold, Silver, Braſs,</hi> and <hi>Iron,</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Babylon beheld</hi> in his <hi>Dream,</hi> and which <hi>Daniel</hi> expounded unto him. Theſe are the words of the Prophet, <hi>Chap. 2. v. 20. The fourth Kingdom shall be ſtrong as Iron; for as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron breaketh in pieces all things, ſo shall the fourth Kingdom break in pieces and ſubdue all.</hi> That <hi>fourth</hi> Kingdom is the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> under Conſuls and Heathen <hi>Emperors.</hi> But <hi>Daniel</hi> adds, <hi>Whereas thou ſaweſt the Feet and Toes, part of potters Clay, and part of Iron: the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom shall be divided, but there shall be in it the ſtrength of the Iron.</hi> This Diviſion arrived after the Death of <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> For then the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire became divided, into the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire. Now as the <hi>Feet</hi> are united with <hi>Legs;</hi> ſo the <hi>Papal</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is united with the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire. For it hath both ſucceeded to it, and is poſſeſſed of all the Soveraign Rights and Majeſty of it. The <hi>ten Toes</hi> of the Feet, anſwer to the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> and to the <hi>ten Kingdoms,</hi> over which the <hi>Papal</hi> Empire is eſtablished, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends its Domination.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Empire,</hi> ſaith <hi>Daniel, shall be ſtrong as Iron, and weak as Potters Clay.</hi> Which agrees fully to the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom. Upon the one hand there was never an <hi>Empire</hi> more <hi>formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,</hi> as it hath proved towards <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperors,</hi> who have ſuffered themſelves to be rob'd and derived of their Eſtates and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108142:28"/>
Dominions, by the meer <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>Papal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications.</hi> And upon the other hand, there was never an Empire more <hi>feeble</hi> in that there needs no more to deſtroy it, but not acknowledg it. Its great weakneſs appeared in the loſs and diſaſter which the bare Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Luther</hi> brought upon it. The Kings who now depend upon it, need do no more to be delivered from its yoak, but to diſclaim its Headship.</p>
                        <p>There is one conſiderable thing more which <hi>Daniel</hi> adds in reference to the <hi>Feet</hi> of the <hi>Image,</hi> and which no <hi>Expoſitors</hi> have rightly underſtood. The <hi>Prophet</hi> ſays, <hi>Chap. 2. v.</hi> 43<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that as <hi>Iron cannot cleave to clay, ſo they shall not cleave to one another, but they shall mingle themſelves with</hi> (or by means of) <hi>the ſeed of men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thoſe whom <hi>Daniel</hi> intends by ſaying, they ſhall <hi>not join together,</hi> are either the <hi>two Empires,</hi> the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and the <hi>Weſtern;</hi> or the <hi>ten Toes,</hi> the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> and the <hi>ten Kingdoms,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire. 'Tis probable that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> deſigned both, but more eſpecially and principally the latter. And the event hath made it certain, that the <hi>Diviſion</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> could never be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated and repaired. For even while it was <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> it had <hi>two Heads, one</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> in the <hi>Weſt</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> The difference that aroſe in their <hi>Creeds,</hi> cauſed that the <hi>Greek Church</hi> could not unite with the <hi>Latine.</hi> Yet theſe two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires did ſometimes <hi>mingle</hi> by the <hi>ſeed of men,</hi> in that they mutually aſſiſted each other
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108142:29"/>
with Forces. When the <hi>Eaſtern Empire</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Mahometan,</hi> it was then impoſſible to unite that Empire with the Empire of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> which is the <hi>Papal.</hi> Nevertheleſs they have <hi>mingled</hi> by the <hi>ſeed of men,</hi> i. e. by the <hi>Greeks</hi> educated in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> with whom the <hi>Pope</hi> fills the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> under the Dominion of the <hi>Turks.</hi> For to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there are <hi>Seminaries</hi> maintained at <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence there are <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> ſent eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year into the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>ten Kingdoms</hi> repreſented by the <hi>ten Toes;</hi> it is certain, that if they minded their intereſt, they would never unite with the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſeeing he hindreth them from being Soveraigns, through challenging to be above them; and yet even they mingle and unite by the <hi>Seed of men.</hi> Which <hi>Seed of men</hi> is nothing but the <hi>unwritten Word, Humane Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Traditions,</hi> called by the <hi>Prophet</hi> the <hi>Seed of Men,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Divine Seed,</hi> the <hi>Seed of which we are born again,</hi> which is the <hi>Word of God, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 23. Nor is it any thing ſave <hi>Bigotry</hi> in reference to <hi>human Traditions,</hi> that maketh <hi>Kings</hi> to <hi>mingle</hi> and unite with the <hi>Pope,</hi> as Children with their Father, and cauſeth them to court him, for obtaining his Favour and <hi>Pontifical</hi> Benediction.</p>

                           </hi> it will be eaſie to know, who this <hi>Eighth King</hi> is, of whom there is mention made <hi>Chap. 17. v.</hi> 11. To this purpoſe let us firſt hearken to the Expoſition of the Angel, <hi>Rev. 17. v. 9, 10, 11. The ſeven Heads,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are ſeven Mountains and ſeven Kings Five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come.

                        </p>
                        <p>He of whom the <hi>Angel</hi> ſaith, <hi>one is,</hi> was the <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> who was Maſter of the Empire in St. <hi>Iohn's</hi> time. He of whom it is ſaid, <hi>the other is not yet come,</hi> is the <hi>Pope,</hi> who was not in the time of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> but hath been ſince the <hi>fifth Century.</hi> The <hi>Angel</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth concerning the Elevation of this <hi>Bishop</hi> to his Grandure, <hi>when he cometh,</hi> i. e. when he shall uſurp the Soveraignty and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>that he muſt continue a short ſpace.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> became Maſter of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Temporal Lord over it, when <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſecond excommunicated <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Emperor.</hi>
                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:108142:30"/>
Then ſaith <hi>Sigonius,</hi> Rome <hi>paſt from the Greeks by reaſon of their Hereſie about Images, into the hands of the Pope.</hi> And for ſeventy years it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the ſame condition under the <hi>Popes,</hi> that it had been formerly under the <hi>Emperors;</hi> and was the ſubject and Slave of theſe new <hi>Lords.</hi> But that <hi>Form</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment continued not above <hi>ſeventy years;</hi> for ſo ſaith the <hi>Angel, it muſt continue for a short ſpace.</hi>

                        <p>Afterwards the Soveraignty became di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided betwixt the <hi>Pope</hi> and the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> For if the <hi>Pope</hi> was <hi>Temporal Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter, Rome</hi> was alſo <hi>Lady</hi> and <hi>Miſtriſs.</hi> And this is exactly what the <hi>Angel</hi> ſays to St. <hi>Iohn, and the Beaſt that was, and is not, even he is the eight King.</hi> This bears no difficulty, becauſe he adds, <hi>he is of the Seven.</hi> For ſeeing the <hi>Pope</hi> is the <hi>ſeventh Head,</hi> and the <hi>ſeventh King,</hi> and that the <hi>Angel</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Eighth King</hi> is of the <hi>ſeven,</hi> it cannot otherways be, but that he underſtandeth the <hi>Pope</hi> as exerciſing his Domination after <hi>two</hi> different manners. The <hi>firſt</hi> alone, in the quality of Temporal Lord of <hi>Rome,</hi> and after the manner of the <hi>Emperors,</hi> whoſe Seat with all their Rights and Soveraignty he had uſurped.

                        <p>'Tis in vertue of this union between the <hi>Pope</hi> and the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that upon the <hi>one</hi> hand, <hi>Rome</hi> is reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced as the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> as the <hi>Mother</hi>

and <hi>Miſtriſs</hi> of all <hi>Churches;</hi> the <hi>Guardian</hi> of Faith, having her Senate made up of <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> qualified with the Title of <hi>Cardinals</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and by whoſe Counſel as Affairs are managed, ſo it is by their votes that the <hi>Pope</hi> is choſen: and it is from this upon the <hi>other</hi> hand, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped as <hi>Succeſsor</hi> of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> as <hi>Vicar Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Husband</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> and as Soveraign <hi>Iudge</hi> of all, and who can be judged by none.</p>
                        <p>This is what we have repreſented in the 13. <hi>Chapter v.</hi> 12. where it is ſaid, <hi>That the ſecond Beaſt excrciſeth all the power of the firſt Beaſt, and that he cauſeth them that dwell on the Earth to worship the firſt Beaſt.</hi> For upon the one ſide, <hi>Rome</hi> and her <hi>Senate</hi> do all they can to maintain the Soveraign Authority of the <hi>Pope;</hi> and upon the <hi>other</hi> ſide, the <hi>Pope</hi> uſeth his utmoſt endeavour to make all men Reverence the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the <hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Miſtriſs</hi> of all Churches. Thence it comes alſo to paſs, that as the <hi>Pope</hi> is not ſtiled the <hi>Chriſtian Bishop,</hi> but the <hi>Roman Bishop;</hi> ſo <hi>Rome</hi> is not called by the name of <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> but by the name of <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolick,</hi> which is as much as <hi>Papal Church.</hi> For according to the ſtile of the Court of <hi>Rome, Apoſtolick</hi> ſignifies the ſame that <hi>Papal</hi> doth; ſo that the <hi>Popes Miter,</hi> his <hi>Slipper,</hi> his <hi>Mule,</hi> his <hi>Habit,</hi> his <hi>Bulls,</hi> his <hi>Notaries,</hi> and in a word, all that relates to the <hi>Popes</hi> Perſon, are called <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick.</hi> There is not one, from the higheſt to the loweſt, that belongs to him, even to

                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover theſe two kinds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that of the <hi>Pope</hi> alone, and that of the <hi>Pope</hi> in conjunction with <hi>Rome,</hi> are clearly marqued and recorded in Hiſtory. <hi>It was Gregory the ſecond,</hi> ſaith <hi>Sigonius, that took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Dominion of Rome from the Greeks. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the ſecond,</hi> ſaith <hi>Onuphrius, being more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious than his Predeceſſor</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>took from</hi> Leo <hi>the Emperor, all that he had left of the Kingdom of the</hi> Lombards <hi>in</hi> Italy: which was done in the year 729. And this Domination of the <hi>Pope alone,</hi> laſted to the year 798. <hi>But then,</hi> ſaith <hi>Vignier, certain Citizens being incenſed againſt Pope</hi> Leo <hi>the third, they did under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reſtoring</hi> Rome <hi>to its ancient Freedom, flirr up the people, who ſeiſing upon the</hi> Pope <hi>at a proceſſion put out one of his Eyes, and threw him into priſon, whence being delivered by the Duke of</hi> Spoletto, <hi>and brought to</hi> Charlemain, <hi>that Prince carried him back to</hi> Rome <hi>the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and reconciled him with the</hi> Romans.</p>
                        <p>This reconciliation being made, the <hi>Popes</hi> travelled ſo well for the re-eſtablishment of their loſt Soveraignty, that they recovered it, but in conjunction with <hi>Rome;</hi> having to this purpoſe ſetled there before hand the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> and <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>St. Peter;</hi> ſo that if the <hi>Pope</hi> was from thenceforth reſpected as the <hi>Soveraign Bishop,</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Royal Judg</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church: Rome</hi> alſo was honoured

                        <p>So that this point cannot be rendred clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, ſeeing both the <hi>ſeventh</hi> and the <hi>eighth King</hi> appear ſo plainly in Hiſtory, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the Popish Hiſtorians. <hi>Sigonius, Vignier,</hi> and <hi>Onuphrius</hi> do exactly marque the <hi>two</hi> ways wherein the <hi>Popes</hi> have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed their Domination.

                        <p>THE <hi>Falſe Prophet</hi> is ſpoken of in two places of the <hi>Revelation.

                        <p>
                           <pb n="38" facs="tcp:108142:32"/>The Beaſt with <hi>two Horns,</hi> is the <hi>Pope</hi> with his <hi>twofold</hi> power, the <hi>one</hi> over that which is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> over that which is <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> The ſeventh head of the beaſt with ten Horns, is the <hi>Pope,</hi> as Succeſſor of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors. The <hi>Eight King,</hi> is alſo the <hi>Pope</hi> as he is the <hi>Husband</hi> of the <hi>Roman church,</hi> which Rules in conjunction with him over all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>Papal</hi> Communion.</p>
                        <p>And the <hi>Falſe Prophet;</hi> is likewiſe the <hi>Pope,</hi> as he is a <hi>falſe Teacher,</hi> one who ſeduceth the world by his falſe Doctrines, and who hath eſtablished the moſt Deſpotical Empire that ever was in the World, upon the pretence of being the <hi>Supream Teacher</hi> of the Church. 'Tis true that the word <hi>Prophet</hi> ſignifieth uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one that <hi>Fore-telleth</hi> things to come; but it is alſo evident, that in the Scripture it doth ſometimes ſignify only a <hi>Teacher.</hi> According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>St. Paul</hi> in his <hi>firſt Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Chap.</hi> 14. uſeth the <hi>Term Prophet</hi> to ſignify meerly a <hi>Teacher,</hi> or one that <hi>Explaineth</hi> a Doctrine. And it is in this ſenſe, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is ſtiled a <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> which is as much as to ſay a <hi>Falſe Teacher,</hi> one that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth falſe Doctrines; becauſe that as they are not Revealed, ſo they are contrary to all Revelation.</p>
                        <p>We have already proved in the fore-going <hi>Illuſtrations,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> is the <hi>Seventh Head</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with <hi>ten Horns;</hi> that <hi>he</hi> is the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with <hi>two Horns;</hi> and that <hi>he</hi> is the <hi>eighth King;</hi> ſo that he is therefore the <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> Now if it do upon the other ſide appear, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:108142:32"/>
it will from thence follow, that he is the <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> the <hi>eighth King,</hi> the <hi>Seventh Head</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with <hi>ten Horns,</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with <hi>two Horns.</hi> And we will endeavour to give that light to theſe <hi>two</hi> Truths, that all who have eyes to ſee may eaſily diſcern them.</p>
                        <p>That the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> appeareth from this, that there is nothing ſaid in the ſacred <hi>Scriptures</hi> concerning <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> but what perfectly agrees to the <hi>Pope (1) St. John</hi> tells us in the <hi>4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapt.</hi> of his <hi>1ſt Epiſtle,</hi> v. 3. <hi>that he is Antichriſt, who denieth that Ieſus Chriſt is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in the flesh.</hi> Now the Papal Doctrine of the <hi>Real preſence,</hi> anſwereth this Character, in that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> cometh not in <hi>Flesh</hi> upon their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, being he is there (according to the doctrine of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church) <hi>after the manner of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which hath neither <hi>flesh</hi> nor bones. There is nothing ſo Auguſt and ſacred in the <hi>Papal</hi> Religion, as their <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> their <hi>Hoſt,</hi> which they call <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts Body;</hi> but a <hi>Chriſt</hi> that is <hi>not like unto his Bretheren,</hi> &amp; a <hi>God</hi> that <hi>is</hi> not <hi>manifeſted in the Flesh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(2) <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> who is <hi>the Anti-chriſt,</hi> tells us in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                           <hi>Epiſt.</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> chap. 2d v. 4. that he <hi>exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelf above all that is called God.</hi> Now <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> are called <hi>Gods</hi> in Scripture, Pſa. 82. v. 6. I <hi>have ſaid ye are Gods.</hi> And the <hi>Pope</hi> does exalt himſelf over <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperors,</hi> not only in the quality of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Father, but in that of <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> and of an <hi>abſolute Soveraign,</hi> who diſpoſeth of their Crowns, and giveth them to whom he pleaſeth. Of which and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and lofty attempt, Hiſtory doth furnish many examples.</p>

                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:108142:33"/>(3) <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Son of perdition, exalteth himſelf above all that is worshipped.</hi> Now the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is <hi>worshipped</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and to this end it is <hi>elevated</hi> by the <hi>Prieſt; Expoſed</hi> upon their <hi>Altars; born</hi> about in <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; carried</hi> to ſuch as are <hi>ſick</hi> by the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> with a Bell rung before it, whereby to give notice to all that are in the ſtreets and in their Houſes, that they <hi>worship</hi> the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> But yet the <hi>Pope</hi> do's <hi>Exalt</hi> himſelf above this grand object of the Churches Adoration; in that he Travelleth no where, without the having it carried before him as the <hi>chief</hi> of his <hi>Guard,</hi> and with leſs <hi>ſtate</hi> than he is born him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Therefore Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> ſtiles the <hi>Sacrament</hi> the <hi>Popes Guard of Defence,</hi> ſo that the <hi>March</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who is concealed under the <hi>vail</hi> of the Sacrament, is accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto and Governed by the Popes neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and occaſions, and <hi>Christs</hi> Steps are orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to thoſe of his <hi>Holineſs.</hi> When the <hi>Pope</hi> ſtops, the holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> muſt ſtop alſo; which is to ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> whom the Angels adore, muſt wait upon the pleaſure, and depend upon the <hi>caprices</hi> and humours of the <hi>Pope.</hi> And thus, as belongeth unto the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Perdition</hi> to do, the <hi>Pope exalteth himſelf above all that is worshipped.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(4) <hi>St. Paul</hi> tell us, that the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſitteth in the Temple of God:</hi> which cannot be meant of the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> becauſe there hath been no ſuch thing for theſe ſixteen hundred years. And if that <hi>Temple</hi> were, yet it would not be the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> ſeeing ever ſince the rejection of the <hi>Iews,</hi> it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108142:33"/>
is called ſimply the <hi>Temple,</hi> and never the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Tho it were to be now again rebuilt, and made every way what it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> yet there would be no reaſon why it should becalled the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> foraſmuch as ſince the abolishment of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Service, <hi>God dwelleth no more in Temples made with hands,</hi> Act. 7. 48. So that the <hi>Temple</hi> here meant is the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> which by the holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> is called the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> There it is that the <hi>Pope ſitteth,</hi> as is here very well expreſſed. And there he is shewed as if he were a <hi>God.</hi> For they ſpeak of nothing, but of the Holy <hi>Chair,</hi> the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> and of the <hi>Roman Chair.</hi> They uſe to ſay, that ſuch a one doth now ſit, or that ſuch a one poſſeſſeth the Holy <hi>Chair.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Pope ſitteth</hi> there as a <hi>Judg,</hi> giving out Decrees and Oracles, as an <hi>Infallible Iudg,</hi> and as the <hi>Soveraign Iudg</hi> of Coutroverſies. So that the <hi>Pope,</hi> as the Son of Perdition; <hi>ſitteth in the Temple of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(5) <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſays further of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he sheweth himſelf that he is</hi> (or as if he were) <hi>God.</hi> Now the <hi>Pope behaveth himſelf as God,</hi> not only becauſe he <hi>diſpenſeth</hi> with the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and as if <hi>he</hi> were <hi>God, requireth obedience</hi> to his <hi>own Laws</hi> under pain of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and becauſe he boaſteth as a <hi>God</hi> to have the <hi>Keys</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> but becauſe upon the day of his <hi>Election</hi> he is carried into the great <hi>Church,</hi> and there placed upon the great <hi>Altar</hi> with the <hi>Bible</hi> under his feet, and <hi>worshipped</hi> both by all the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and by all the <hi>people,</hi> with an <hi>Adoration</hi> that is more than a <hi>Civil</hi> one.</p>

                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:108142:34"/>(6) <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſays moreover of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Perdition,</hi> that <hi>his coming is with all Power, and Signes, and lying Wonders.</hi> Which Character of <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi> is alſo as diſcernable in the <hi>Pope</hi> as the former are; in that his <hi>Authority</hi> as well as his <hi>Doctrine</hi> is founded upon Miracles. Nor is there amy thing elſe to be met with in their <hi>Legends,</hi> and in the <hi>Lives</hi> of thoſe <hi>Saints</hi> whom the <hi>Popes</hi> have <hi>Canoniſed.</hi> But they are <hi>Lying Wonders,</hi> and whoſe falſity is ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to ſtare us in the face. Foraſmuch as the tendency of them, is not to ſupport the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Goſpel, and to bring <hi>Glory</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> but to uphold <hi>Error,</hi> and to give <hi>Glory</hi> to <hi>Creatures.</hi> Nor hath <hi>St. Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced any thing concerning the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> which more fully agrees to the <hi>Pope</hi> than this doth.

                        <p>That the <hi>Pope</hi> is a <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> and a falſe Teacher, as well as <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which we
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108142:35"/>
have proved, we need only to obſerve two Propheſies, one of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and another of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for the clearing of it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt <hi>Epiſt.</hi> to <hi>Timothy, 4. chap. v.</hi> 1. ſaith thus, <hi>The Spirit ſpeaketh expreſly, that in the latter times, ſome shall depart from the Faith, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heed to ſeducing Spirits, and doctrines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; ſpeaking Lies in Hypocriſie, forbidding to Marry, and commanding to Abſtain from Meats, which God created to be received with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</hi> Now the <hi>Pope</hi> does forbid <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> to <hi>marry;</hi> and tho she alloweth both the one and the other to have <hi>Concubines,</hi> yet he will not ſuffer either a <hi>Bishop</hi> or a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to be joined to a Wife by lawful Matrimony. He alſo prohibiteth, and that upon pain of Damnation, the <hi>eating</hi> of <hi>Flesh</hi> in <hi>Lent</hi> and upon <hi>Fryday.</hi> So that from hence, he is a <hi>ſeducing Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Teacher</hi> of <hi>Lies,</hi> and a <hi>Falſe Prophet.</hi>

                           <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> likewiſe ſays in the 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>St. Matthew, v.</hi> 24, 25, 26. that <hi>there shall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and shall shew great Signs and Wonders, inſomuch, that if it were poſſible, they shall deceive the very Elect. Behold I have told you before, wherefore if they shall ſay unto you, behold he is in the Deſert, go not forth: behold he is in the ſecret Chamber, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it not.</hi> He muſt be under a ſupernatural blindneſs, who doth not in this Propheſie of the Son of God, ſee the Doctrine of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> teacheth it by his Emiſſaries. 'Tis in vain that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſeek to relieve themſelves from this Expoſition by flying to the Teſtimony of the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
                           <pb n="45" facs="tcp:108142:35"/>
becauſe none of them have taken notice of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> in this paſſage, as we pretend to do. For how should the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> obſerve a thing, of which there had then nothing appeared in the Doctrine of the Church? It being in the beginning of the ninth Age, that <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> firſt brought it upon the ſtage, and it not being received and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by the <hi>Pope</hi> till in the eleventh. How could the <hi>Fathers</hi> then, that lived in the firſt 800. years, divine of an event, for which they had no foundation towards the botto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a Conjecture; ſeeing from <hi>Adam</hi> down to this day, there was never any thing ſeen like it? In a word, the <hi>Fathers</hi> were not Prophets, and their knowledg was bounded as well as that of other men.</p>
                        <p>It being ſo, we are not to wonder, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> did not underſtand the meaning of this Prediction of our Saviour, before it came to be cleared by the <hi>Accomplishment,</hi> which is the only ſure Interpreter of <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</hi> But if we do not underſtand it, after the help of having ſeen its completion, we shall have no excuſe to alledg for our ſelves. For all the <hi>Characters of the Real Preſence of Chriſt's Body,</hi> do evidently appear in this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> This <hi>Preſence</hi> as it is taught by the <hi>Pope,</hi> is <hi>inviſible;</hi> begetteth <hi>Adoration;</hi> and placeth <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a <hi>Box</hi> (or Cupboard) which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſtile the <hi>Pix;</hi> yea in many <hi>Boxes;</hi> and is founded upon <hi>Miracles.</hi> And if all theſe Characters be found in the <hi>Propheſie</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> what can we deſire more towards our being convinced, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt foretold</hi>
                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:108142:36"/>
it as a <hi>falſe Doctrine,</hi> that should be advanced by a <hi>Falſe Prophet?</hi> Now it is apparent, that all theſe Characters are found in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> here predicted by our Saviour. (1.) The <hi>Preſence</hi> here ſpoken of is <hi>Inviſible;</hi> becauſe <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> tells us, that the <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> shall ſay, <hi>Lo, here is Chriſt; lo, he is there.</hi> To what End would he ſay of the Preſence of a true <hi>Human' Body, Behold it is here, behold it is there;</hi> if it were not to inſtruct us that this Preſence shall be <hi>inviſible, and according to the manner of a Spirit.</hi> For if it were <hi>viſibly</hi> preſent, there would be no need to be advertiſed of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Nor would <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> have ſaid, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it not.</hi> For how would he forbid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a preſence of his Body, that should <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly</hi> appear? Would he have us to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Teſtimony of our own Eyes? (2.) The Advertiſement, <hi>Behold, he is here, lo, he is there,</hi> can be given upon no other deſign, but to intimate the <hi>Adoration</hi> that all men should be laid under an obligation unto. (3.) The <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is according to the <hi>Papal</hi> Doctrine, shut up in a <hi>Ciborium</hi> or Cupboard. And this the Greek word here uſed doth ſignify. (4.) Nor is the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> shut up meerly in <hi>one Cupboard,</hi> which they call a <hi>Pix,</hi> but in <hi>many;</hi> which the Term here being in the <hi>plural number</hi> doth alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note. (5.) The <hi>Real Preſence</hi> is built upon <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</hi> This every one knows by the many ſtories which we have of the <hi>Hosts</hi> having appeared in the <hi>Form</hi> of an <hi>Infant,</hi> and that it hath been ſeen all <hi>Bloody.</hi> Which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour alſo foretold, in ſaying, that they who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108142:36"/>
should teach this <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> should <hi>shew great Signs and Wonders, inſomuch that if it were poſſible, they should deceive the very Elect.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over our Saviour forbids us to believe this <hi>inviſible Preſence</hi> of his Body; <hi>Behold,</hi> ſays he, I <hi>have told you before, believe it not.</hi> And withal he declares, that the <hi>Preſence of the Son of man shall be like unto Lightning, which shineth from one end of Heaven unto the other.</hi> And forasmuch as he declareth, that they shall be <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> who shall teach this Doctrine, it does neceſſarily follow, that tho the <hi>Pope</hi> through putting it into the <hi>Romish Creed,</hi> and entorcing it by <hi>Anathema's,</hi> is that very ſame <hi>Falſe Prophet</hi> of whom <hi>St. John</hi> ſpeaks in the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor is the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of Chriſt's Body upon their Altars, and that ſingular Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which they give unto the Sacrament, the only falſe Doctrine in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to prove the <hi>Pope</hi> to be this <hi>falſe Prophet.</hi> But there are many more which ſerve to give evidence unto it. And particularly that of the <hi>Worshipping</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> than which there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Doctrine more notoriouſly <hi>falſe.</hi> 'Tis moſt certain, that God had forbid <hi>three</hi> things in his Law; the <hi>making Images of things that are in Heaven, or things that are in the Earth; the bowing down before them, and the ſerving them;</hi> ſee <hi>Exod, 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 5.

All which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> not only practiſeth, but perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes all thoſe as <hi>Hereticks</hi> and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who do in reference to this matter, both obey the Injunctions of the Law, and imitate the Example of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſince the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108142:37"/>
time they returned from the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>
                        <p>Is it not a falſe and an <hi>Heretical</hi> Doctrine, to apply to the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> in order to our being ſaved, and to <hi>invocate her,</hi> as the <hi>Gate</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Mother of Mercy?</hi> If that <hi>Doctrine</hi> which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the <hi>Foundation</hi> be a <hi>Hereſie?</hi> Then it cannot be denied but that this is a groſs one; in that the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all Salvation is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt alone. Other Foundation</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, can no man lay, than that that is laid, which is Ieſus Chriſt, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 11. And <hi>St. Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>that there is not Salvation in any other, nor any other Name given among men, ſave that of Ieſus Chriſt, whereby we may he ſaved, Act.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
                        <p>Beſide, can there be a <hi>Doctrine</hi> more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falſe, than that of <hi>Popery,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the <hi>Maſs</hi> to be a <hi>proper Sacrifice,</hi> wherein our Redeemer is every day <hi>ſacrificed.</hi> Seeing the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us expreſly in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews, chap. 10. v.</hi> 10. that <hi>we are ſanctified through the offering of the Body of Ieſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> And he maketh this difference between the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and that of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> that they by reaſon of their <hi>imperfection</hi> were <hi>dayly offered;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> becauſe of its being infinitely <hi>perfect,</hi> was offered but <hi>once.</hi> And he addeth further in the ſame place, <hi>v.</hi> 18. that there being under the Goſpel <hi>Remiſſion of Sins, there is no more offering for Sin.</hi> So that here is enough to make it appear, that the <hi>Pope</hi> who teacheth Doctrines ſo notoriouſly falſe and Heretical, as theſe are, can be no
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108142:37"/>

                           <bibl>REV. CHAP. 12.</bibl>

                        <p>INterpreters are divided about who this <hi>Michael</hi> should be, who fought with the <hi>Dragon.</hi> Some will have it to be <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Archangel, who diſputed with Satan about the Body of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and who durſt not bring againſt him a railing accuſation,</hi> as St. <hi>Jude</hi> tells us, <hi>v.</hi> 9. The ſame <hi>Michael</hi> being called by Dan. <hi>chap. 10. v. 13. one of the Chief Princes</hi> of the People of God. But others will have it to be <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> who in his own perſon fights againſt the <hi>Dragon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this opinion ſeems to be the trueſt, becauſe the Victory obtained in this Battel is above the power of a <hi>created</hi> Angel. The defeat given to Satan and his Angels, in <hi>caſting them out of Heaven unto the Earth;</hi> is a work that belongs properly to none ſave to Jeſus Chriſt; who as he is here ſtiled by the name of <hi>Angel,</hi> becauſe he is the <hi>Angel of the covenant,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Great Council;</hi> ſo he is called <hi>Michael,</hi> that is, one who is like unto God, becauſe he is the <hi>true God, the Brightneſs of the Fathers Glory,</hi> and the <hi>lively and expreſs Image of his Perſon.</hi> And of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108142:41"/>
whom the <hi>Michael</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>Daniel</hi> was a <hi>Type.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have already shew'd in the foregoing Explanations, that the <hi>Dragon</hi> is the ancient <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> under the <hi>ſixth Head,</hi> which was the <hi>Emperors;</hi> but called the old <hi>Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Devil</hi> was as the <hi>Soul</hi> that enlivened that Empire, and was worshipped in it as a <hi>Deity</hi> under the name of <hi>Mars;</hi> ſo that <hi>Rome</hi> was ſurnamed <hi>Martia,</hi> the City of the Idol-God <hi>Mars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This being laid down, there is no difficulty in the <hi>Viſion.</hi> It being nothing but a Deſcription of the <hi>Perſecutions</hi> which laſted under the <hi>Emperors</hi> for about the ſpace of <hi>three hundred years.</hi> It was then that <hi>Satan</hi> had juſtly the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Accuſer of the Bretheren,</hi> according as he is called <hi>v.</hi> 10. For the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> during the time of 300 years, could not aſſemble openly, but were forced to keep their <hi>Mettings</hi> in <hi>Dens,</hi> or in <hi>Woods,</hi> or in <hi>Holes</hi> of Rocks; and were accuſed of committing there execrable Crimes, and Murders, and of being guilty of Conſpiracies againſt the Government, and of Uncleanneſſes and inceſtuous Converſes; as doth appear by the <hi>Apologies</hi> of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and other Writers of that time.</p>
                        <p>And whereas it is ſaid, that the <hi>Dragon was caſt out of Heaven unto the Earth, and that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was no place found any more for him in Heaven, nor for his Angels:</hi> this was verified by the <hi>converſion</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and her <hi>Emperors;</hi> becauſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108142:41"/>
                           <hi>Paganiſm</hi> being then deſtroyed, both in <hi>Rome,</hi> and through the whole <hi>Empire,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> being neither any more <hi>Worshipped</hi> under the name of <hi>Mars,</hi> nor his <hi>Angels,</hi> which are they that were his perſecuting <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi> reſpected and dreaded as they had been before; there was no place found any more for him in heaven. `For in <hi>Rome</hi> he had no more a Temple, where he was worshipped, nor were there throughout the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire any more <hi>Pagans,</hi> who did adore him; ſo that he is thenceforth accounted of as fallen from <hi>Heaven to Earth,</hi> according to the <hi>Prediction</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God, Luc. 10. 18. I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And foraſmuch as <hi>St. John</hi> farther ſays, <hi>I heard a loud voice ſaying in heaven, now is come ſalvation, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt; for the Accuſer of our Brethren is caſt down.</hi> This is a deſcription of the joy that was among believers, when they ſaw <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> victorious and triumphant over the <hi>Dragon;</hi> the ſubverſion of <hi>Idols;</hi> the down fall of <hi>paganiſm;</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> come out of Caves, Woods, and the Holes of Rocks, and to aſſemble openly in the very <hi>Temples,</hi> where the <hi>Dragon</hi> had been worshipped, and there to worship the true <hi>God, Creator</hi> and <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that if it be asked, who thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>Dragon</hi> are that <hi>fought</hi> for him; I anſwer, that they are the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> the <hi>Orators,</hi> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>Idols Gods,</hi> and

Magiſtrates, who made uſe of all ſort of Tricks, Frauds, Outrages of blind Zeal, Violence, Fines, Banishments, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Executions.

<bibl>REV. CHAP. 12. v. 14.</bibl>
                        </head>
                        <p>THis <hi>Flight</hi> of the <hi>Woman</hi> had been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>v.</hi> 6. where it is ſaid, that after the Man child was caught up unto God, and to his Throne, the <hi>Woman fled into the Wilderneſs, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore Days.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But it appeareth by the 14 <hi>verſe,</hi> that this was ſpoken there by way of <hi>Anticipation,</hi> and that the <hi>Flight</hi> of the <hi>Woman</hi> fell out after the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> that is, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> and the converſion of the <hi>Emperors.</hi> Which gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108142:42"/>
that the <hi>Birth</hi> of <hi>Atichriſtianiſm,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſoon after the deliverance from the Perſecutions of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperors. For ever ſince the <hi>Church</hi> decayed in her Purity, the proſperity which She enjoyed under the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperors having ſuddenly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly corrupted her. And <hi>Platina</hi> tells us, that a voice was then heard, <hi>Hodie venenum funditur in Eccleſiam;</hi> i. e. <hi>Poiſon is now poured forth upon the Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs, this <hi>Flight</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> did not lye in a change of <hi>Place,</hi> but in a change of her external <hi>State.</hi> In a word, it was an Eclipſe, rather than a proper Flight; a Darkneſs, rather than a Retreat; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it in the pride, Covetouſneſs, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury, and Diſſoluteneſs of the Churches Guides; and in the Doctrines, Worship, and Ceremonies, which She borrowed from the <hi>Pagans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Place which God had prepared for her,</hi> was a little <hi>Corner</hi> of that <hi>Temple,</hi> which is ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 1. when the <hi>outward Court was trodden under foot by the Gentiles,</hi> that is, by thoſe who had adopted and brought in Human Traditions, and <hi>Heathenish</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, into the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Two Wings</hi> given unto the <hi>Woman,</hi> to forward her <hi>Flight,</hi> and to render it the more expeditious and ſafe; do denote the ſame thing, that the <hi>meaſuring</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> doth in the eleventh <hi>chap.</hi> For he ſpeaketh here of the ſame perſons, to wit, the Church;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108142:43"/>
and of the ſame Time, namely, that which ſucceeded ſoon after the End of the Churches <hi>Perſecution</hi> by the <hi>Heathen Emperors;</hi> and of the ſame Deſign, which is the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of <hi>Believers,</hi> againſt the <hi>Calamities</hi> threatned by the <hi>Trumpets.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> into which She fled, Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth unto us the Churches <hi>Obſcurity, Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>Diſtreſs;</hi> of which there were diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees. For at ſome ſeaſons the Church was not ſo much as <hi>viſible,</hi> no more than the <hi>ſeven thouſand</hi> of the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> were under <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> that were unknown to the <hi>Prophet Elias.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>She fled into the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> with the <hi>Wings of an Eagle,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſaid to have been carried upon <hi>Eagles Wings, Exod.</hi> 19. 4 which both shews the <hi>ſpeedineſs</hi> and the <hi>ſafety</hi> of her Flight, and that She should remain and be entertained within the <hi>Bounds</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> And as the <hi>Eagle's</hi> being the <hi>Arms</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> putteth this out of all doubt; ſo the <hi>Two Wings</hi> of the <hi>Eagle,</hi> do denote the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and that of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> where the <hi>Church</hi> of God hath been kept hidden, and had been fed, during the time of her Poverty and great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>And She hath been <hi>Fed,</hi> not with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury and poiſonous <hi>Food</hi> of Human Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and Ceremonies or Doctrines, drawn from the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion; but with the ſound and wholſom Food of the <hi>Word of God.</hi> Nor can She be <hi>fed</hi> with any other
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108142:43"/>
Nourishment; ſo that this is the ſame thing with that which is ſaid in the 11. <hi>chap. v.</hi> 2, 3. viz. that <hi>while the Holy City should be trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot by the Gentiles, the Lord should cauſe his two Witneſſes to propheſie a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes, cloathed in Sack-cloth.</hi> For this <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the two Witneſſes, is nothing elſe, ſave the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Food</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which he ſpeaketh of here. From which it neceſſarily followeth, that this <hi>Flight of the Woman into the Wilderneſs,</hi> is of the ſame <hi>Date</hi> with the <hi>treading down of the City</hi> by the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> which is mentioned <hi>chap. 11. v.</hi> 2.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Time</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> was to be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the Wilderneſs, is expreſſed by <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>half a Time.</hi> Which amounts to the 1260. <hi>dayes</hi> of the <hi>ſixth verſe.</hi> Nor can this be gainſaid, in that no man can deny but that the <hi>Flight</hi> ſpoken of <hi>v.</hi> 6 is the ſame with the <hi>Flight</hi> that is diſcourſed of <hi>v.</hi> 14. Now we shall ſee elſewhere what is meant both by the 1260. <hi>Dayes,</hi> and by the 42. <hi>Moneths,</hi> mentioned <hi>chap.</hi> 13 when we come to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min how long <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
                        <p>In the mean while, that which is ſpoken <hi>v.</hi> 13. is worth the ſerious conſidering. <hi>When she Dragon</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John) ſaw that he was caſt unto the Earth, he perſecuted the Woman.</hi> There had been another Perſecution of the <hi>Church;</hi> for during the time of three hundred years, She had been perſecuted by the <hi>Pagans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> but this is a Perſecution begun by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or by ſuch who called themſelves ſo. The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>

being through the converſion of <hi>Rome</hi> and her Emperors, dethroned, and caſt from Heaven unto the Earth, he left the <hi>Church</hi> in Peace. But it was only for a very short time; for he ſuddenly bethought himſelf of aſſaulting her by Error and Superſtition. The <hi>firſt Perſecution,</hi> which was that by <hi>Pagans,</hi> was open and avowed; but this, which is by the <hi>Antichriſtian Followers</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on more darkly.</p>

                        <p>Yet this <hi>Doctrine</hi> can be none of the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> with which the <hi>Church</hi> was exerciſed during the firſt three hundred years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Church</hi> is here treated of after the time of the caſting down of the <hi>Dragon</hi> from Heaven unto the Earth: that is, after the <hi>converſion</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and her <hi>Emperors.</hi> So that it muſt needs be ſome <hi>Hereſie</hi> ſtarted after the <hi>Flight</hi> of the Woman; foraſmuch as it is here ſaid, that the <hi>Serpent</hi> caſt this Floud <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Woman,</hi> as being in the purſuance of her upon her <hi>Retreat into the Wilderneſs.</hi> Now the <hi>Woman</hi> (as we have shewed) <hi>withdrew</hi> into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> after the <hi>Emperors</hi> were turned Chriſtian, in that the <hi>Church</hi> begun then to decay in her purity.</p>

The Councils are therefore no other but a <hi>humane</hi> Mean, becauſe <hi>Infallibility</hi> doth not reſide in them; but in the alone <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that is the Rule by which they do judg.

                           <hi>XIII. ILLUSTRATION.</hi> Of the War, which the Dragon, being full of Wrath, made againſt the Remnant of the Seed of the Woman.
<bibl>REV. CHAP. 12. v. 17.</bibl>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE <hi>Serpent</hi> (ſaith <hi>St. Iohn) was wroth with the Woman;</hi> and this was upon the finding himſelf diſappointed of that effect which he expected from the <hi>Floud</hi> which he had caſt out of his Mouth, and upon his ſeeing that the <hi>Earth</hi> had opened her mouth, and <hi>ſwallowed</hi> it up. And being enraged with <hi>wrath, he went to make War with the remnant of her Seed,</hi> which <hi>keep the Commandments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Ieſus Chriſt</hi> But what? was not the <hi>Dragon wroth</hi> with the <hi>Woman,</hi> before the Earth had ſwallowed up the Floud, and before the condemnation of the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſie? Hath he not alway's made <hi>War</hi> with thoſe that are of the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman?</hi> It is ſo, nor is the contrary intended here, but it is the Scripture way of ſpeaking, to expreſs the <hi>increaſe</hi> of a thing, as if it were the beginning of it. Thus 'tis ſaid 1 <hi>Sam. 23. 18. that David and Ionathan made a Covenant,</hi> that is, they renewed it, for they had made it before. So <hi>St. Iohn</hi> tells us in his <hi>firſt Epiſt. chap, 5. v.</hi> 13. that he wrote to thoſe <hi>who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> that <hi>they might believe,</hi> i. e. that they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108142:46"/>
might increaſe in Faith. So that, that which the Spirit of God would plainly ſay, is that the <hi>wrath</hi> of the <hi>Dragon</hi> became <hi>inflamed,</hi> and that he went to make a more dangerous war, than he had made before.</p>
                        <p>But who are this Remnant of <hi>the Seed of the Woman, which keep the Commandments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Chriſt?</hi> Is there any difference betwixt <hi>them,</hi> and the <hi>Church?</hi> Is not the Church made up of ſuch, as keep the Commandments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt? There is the ſame difference between the <hi>Woman,</hi> and thoſe who are her <hi>Seed,</hi> as there is betwixt a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and a <hi>Daughter.</hi> The <hi>Oriental</hi> or <hi>Greek Church,</hi> that had been diſtreſſed for about 200 years by the Hereſie of <hi>Arius,</hi> is the <hi>Mother:</hi> and the <hi>Weſtern,</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> Church, is the <hi>Daughter,</hi> and the <hi>Remnant of the Seed of the Woman.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Bitonto</hi> uſed this Diſtinction in a <hi>Sermon</hi> which he made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent. The Greek Church,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is our Mother, to whom the Latin is indebted for all that She hath.</hi> And in truth, the Terms, <hi>Church, Bishop, Prieſt, Deacon, Baptiſm, Euchariſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> it ſelf, are all <hi>Greek</hi> Terms, and plainly shew, that our Religion is derived from them, from whom we have borrowed the Terms.</p>
                        <p>They then who are ſaid to be the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman,</hi> againſt whom the <hi>Serpent</hi> went to make <hi>War,</hi> is the <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church, where the <hi>Dragon</hi> all along ſince that time, hath been labouring to accompish the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108142:47"/>
of Iniquity,</hi> which <hi>was at work</hi> in <hi>St. Pauls</hi> days, 2 Theſ. 2. 7. And this is nothing elſe, ſave <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> or the <hi>Papacy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But ſince the time that a Church of God Separated it ſelf, from that, which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Myſtery of iniquity; the Church that ſo withdrew, is the <hi>remnant of the Seed of the Woman.</hi> And particularly the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> are this <hi>Seed;</hi> and whoſe <hi>Separation</hi> is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged both by <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> and <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> who ſpeak of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> as of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who have been <hi>Separated</hi> from the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> from the time of <hi>Sylveſter</hi> and of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Claudius Seſſelius,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Turin,</hi> tells us in a Book which he writ againſt the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> that the <hi>Sect of the Waldenſes took its riſe from a moſt religious perſon called</hi> Leo, <hi>that lived in the time of Conſtantine the great, and who deteſting the covetouſneſs of Pope</hi> Sylveſter, <hi>and the immoderate bounty of</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>choſe rather to embrace poverty, with the ſimplicity of the Chriſtian Faith, than with</hi> Sylveſter <hi>to be defiled with a Fat and rich benefice; and that all they who were ſeriouſly Religious joined themſelves to him.</hi>

Seeing it is <hi>Idolatry</hi> that is ſpoken of, which is <hi>Spiritual Adultery,</hi> and diſſolveth Gods Covenant, as Adultery doth the Covenant of Marriage. Now the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is guilty of too groſs <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to be any ways able to juſtify her ſelf. She worshippeth not only the Holy <hi>Virgin,</hi> in giving her the Titles of the <hi>Gate of Paradiſe,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> but in advancing her above <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> through begging of her in one of their prayers, that she would <hi>jure matris imperare,</hi> i. e. <hi>uſe the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

of a Mother in Commanding her Son.</hi> Nor doth she only <hi>Adore Images</hi> according to the Decree of the <hi>ſecond Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> which is confirmed by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent:</hi> but she alſo <hi>Adores</hi> the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt inſtituted to be a <hi>memorial</hi> of his death, and which therefore muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe than Chriſt himſelf. Nor can she according to her own Doctrine have any aſſurance either divine or human, that the <hi>Bread</hi> is the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt; foraſmuch as she cannot be aſſured of the <hi>Intention</hi> of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> upon which the whole <hi>Conſecration</hi> doth depend. To which may be added, her <hi>Worshipping</hi> the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and that with the higheſt kind of worship called <hi>Latria,</hi> having to this purpoſe ſet apart and aſſigned <hi>Good Friday.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church that leads men to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> may be juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>Wine,</hi> and not to water; and to <hi>Wine of Wrath,</hi> i. e. furious Wine; becauſe they who drink it become intoxicated, and deprived of their ſenſes. So that they not only furiouſly purſue the Objects of their Superſtition, as ſo many mad men, whom none can hinder or withdraw from it; but they are tranſported with hatred &amp; rage againſt all thoſe who do not approve their falſe and abominable devotion. And it is worth our obſerving what the difference is, between <hi>true</hi> Doctrine and <hi>falſe.</hi> Whol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſome and true Doctrine, is uſually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>Water,</hi> becauſe it rendreth ſuch

as embrace it, meek, gentle, patient under injuries, ready to teach thoſe who are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded with mildneſs; and filled ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Pity and Compaſſion towards them, than tranſported with hatred. But in reference to the effects of falſe Doctrine, all is otherwiſe. For it maketh ſuch as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it, violent, cruel, quarrelſom, outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, ready to aſſault, and fall upon thoſe that contradict them, and who refuſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their example. And therefore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to <hi>Wine,</hi> and to <hi>Wine of wrath,</hi> i. e. <hi>heady Wine,</hi> that inflameth and diſtracteth men, and in a word, rendreth them that are poſſeſſed with it perſecutors to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
                        <p>Nor can the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> deny, but that she doth after this manner perſecute all thoſe whom she calls <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and for this only reaſon, becauſe they will not own her to be the <hi>Empreſs of the world,</hi> and the <hi>Mother and Miſtriſs of Faith,</hi> and acknowledg her <hi>Bishop</hi> to be the <hi>Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Center of Chriſtian Unity.</hi> The <hi>Croiſado's</hi> againſt the <hi>Valdenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> of whoſe ſucceſs <hi>Bellarmin</hi> triumpheth to that degree as to ſay. <hi>that in one only Croiſado there were a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand killed;</hi> the Maſſacres committed in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, France</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> in the forego'ing Age; thoſe perpetrated in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Valleys</hi> of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and in <hi>Ireland</hi> within theſe forty or fifty years.

                        <p>HERE we have a Deſcription of the State of the <hi>True Church,</hi> and that during the time in which <hi>Babylon</hi> was drunk with the Blood of the Martyrs. For whereas one might have queſtioned, whether the Church
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108142:53"/>
was not wholly loſt, ſeeing all the world not only <hi>wondred after the Beaſt,</hi> but that they <hi>who refuſed</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> his <hi>mark,</hi> and to <hi>worship</hi> his <hi>Image,</hi> were <hi>killed:</hi> therefore the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> repreſents a <hi>Viſion</hi> to St. <hi>John,</hi> in which he might clearly ſee, that the <hi>Church</hi> did ſubſiſt, in deſpight both of the <hi>Victories</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> of the <hi>extent</hi> of his <hi>Empire,</hi> and of the <hi>Violence</hi> of his <hi>Perſecutions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I <hi>looked,</hi> ſaith St. John, <hi>and lo, a Lamb ſtood on the Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and with him 144000. having his Fathers Name written in their Foreheads; and I heard a voice from Heaven, as the voice of many Waters, and as the voice of a great Thunder. And I heard the voice of Harpers harping with their Harps; and they ſung as it were a new Song before the Throne, and before the four living Creatures, and the 24. Elders, and no man could learn that Song, but the</hi> 144000. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing difficult in this Viſion. The <hi>Lamb</hi> is Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Sion</hi> is a Mountain ſeparated from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and is a Figure of the <hi>True Church.</hi> The 144000. <hi>who have the Fathers Name written in their Foreheads,</hi> are <hi>Believers,</hi> who compoſe the <hi>True Church,</hi> and who by keeping themſelves <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> have this comfort, that they do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the gracious preſence of their <hi>Saviour,</hi> as <hi>Sacrificed</hi> for them, and they will hearken to no other Saviour but him.</p>
                        <p>He then who would know the <hi>True Church,</hi> in order to join himſelf into Communion with it, needs no more, but to conſider this <hi>Portraiture,</hi> which the Holy Spirit hath
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108142:54"/>
vouchſav'd us, and wherein he hath given us <hi>ſix</hi> Characters of her, that ſo we may not be deceived.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'tis ſaid, that <hi>they were redeemed from among them,</hi> or from among thoſe of the Earth. Now it had been ſaid in the 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> that all the Earth <hi>went</hi> or <hi>wondered</hi> after the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> 'Tis then from <hi>this Earth,</hi> that is from among the <hi>Followers</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that they who conſtitute the <hi>True Church</hi> are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed</hi> and <hi>ſeparated.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, they are thoſe <hi>who are not defiled with Women; for they are Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</hi> Which words cannot be underſtood of the <hi>Romish Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> without a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt injury to the <hi>Text.</hi> Foraſmuch as the term <hi>Virgin</hi> agreeth only to <hi>Females;</hi> nor is the word in the <hi>Original</hi> uſed of any but of thoſe of that <hi>Sex.</hi> We are not then to take the Phraſe in a <hi>Literal</hi> ſenſe, but in a <hi>Myſtical;</hi> for he ſpeaketh of a <hi>Chaſtity</hi> and of a <hi>Virginity</hi> that is <hi>Myſtical,</hi> of a purity of Soul, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth <hi>Idolatry</hi> as ſpiritual <hi>Adultery.</hi> For they <hi>who are Virgins, and who are not defiled with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> are ſet in oppoſition to thoſe <hi>whom the Woman hath made drunk with the Wine of the Wrath of her Fornication,</hi> that is, with <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> whereof the <hi>Papal</hi> Church is manifeſtly guilty.</p>
                        <p>(3.) 'Tis ſaid, that they <hi>follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth.</hi> Which is as much, as that the Members of the <hi>True Church</hi> are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by indiſſoluble Bonds, and that they follow him on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:108142:54"/>
as well as Mount <hi>Tabor;</hi> in a Wilderneſs, as well as in a Land that flows with Milk and Honey; on the raging Sea, as well as upon firm ground; and as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>through ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and dishonor; through evil report and good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
                        <p>(4) They are thoſe <hi>in whoſe mouth there is found no Guile, for they are without fault before the Throne of God.</hi> Which is the language where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the Church, <hi>Eph. Chap. 5. v. 25, 26, 27. Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it with the washing of Water by the Word, that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</hi> So that it is not true, that worldly and wicked perſons do conſtitute the true Church.</p>
                        <p>(5.) They are thoſe <hi>who could learn the new Song, that is ſung by the 24. Elders, and by the four living Creatures.</hi> What Song can this be, which they of the Earth could not learn? Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that we do not learn Songs, but in order to ſing them; there muſt be ſome <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> contained under this <hi>new Song.</hi> We learn not but in order to practiſe: and they who do not practiſe, do not know, nor have they learned. So that in a word, this <hi>new Song,</hi> is the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of denying our ſelves, and or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to bear the Croſs. Worldlings might learn the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Religion, if they would. The <hi>Theory</hi> doth not exceed their capacity. But to be obliged to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to take up the Croſs, is unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible

to them, or at leaſt that which they will not ſubmit unto and practiſe.</p>

So that the <hi>Eternal Goſpel</hi> is the ſame with the <hi>Reed</hi> wherewith the Temple was meaſured, in the 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> The Followers of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> have alway's uſed to accuſe thoſe of <hi>Novelty,</hi> that have condemned their Errors.

                        <p>Theſe <hi>Teachers</hi> are repreſented <hi>crying with a loud voice, Fear God;</hi> becauſe at that ſeaſon <hi>Babylon</hi> alone was <hi>dreaded;</hi> it being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon language of every one at that day, <hi>Who is like unto the Beaſt? who is able to make war with him?</hi> as the Holy Ghoſt hath marked, <hi>Rev. chap. 13. v.</hi> 4.</p>
                        <p>They are farther repreſented crying, <hi>Give Glory to God;</hi> becauſe then the <hi>Honor</hi> due to <hi>God,</hi> was <hi>transferred</hi> to <hi>Creatures,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108142:56"/>
to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is a with-holding or a not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Glory to God. For that <hi>Apoſtle</hi> being ſpeaking of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> he accuſeth them of <hi>not having glorified God,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>their gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that honor to the Creature,</hi> which <hi>belonged to none ſave to the Creator, Rom.</hi> 1. 21, 23. Moreover, they are here introduced, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the men of that Age with the Judgments of God; <hi>The hour,</hi> ſay they, <hi>of his judgment is come.</hi> Which Denunciation was fulfilled in the ſame <hi>Century.</hi> For the Quarrels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> filled all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> with Civil Wars, and overwhelmed it with Deſolation Beſides, the Voiage of <hi>Louis</hi> the ſeventh into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> proved moſt unhappy; and then <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> towards the end of that Age conquered the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo that all the Chriſtians became defeated and droven out of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They are further introduced, preaching the Goſpel <hi>to every Nation, and kindred, and Tongue, and People,</hi> that is through all parts of the <hi>Papal Kingdom,</hi> which in theſe Viſions is ſignified by the Kingdom of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> Of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Chap. 13. v 7. that power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him, over all kindreds, and Tongues, and Nations, and that all who dwelt upon the Earth worshipped him.</hi> Which can be meant of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but of the <hi>Roman Papal</hi> Empire.</p>
                        <p>In the fourteenth Age about the year 1360. <hi>Iohn Wicklif</hi> aſſaulted the <hi>Pope,</hi> and both cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him <hi>Archheretick, Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>Impoſtore</hi> of the Church; and proved him to be ſo, by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108142:57"/>
Scripture, Hiſtory, and his own Actions. He preached likewiſe againſt the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> againſt <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images, Relicks,</hi> and <hi>Saints.</hi> The voice of this <hi>Angel</hi> was ſo powerful and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, that <hi>Edward</hi> the third King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ordained in <hi>Parliament,</hi> that from thence forward <hi>Bishops</hi> should not go to <hi>Rome</hi> for confirmation, but be confirmed at home by their own <hi>Metropolitans.</hi> This <hi>Wicklif</hi> upon his withdrawing into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> had <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> for his Diſciple. Which <hi>Hus</hi> by the alone power of his Doctrine, drew the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia</hi> off from obedience to <hi>Rome.</hi> And thence it is, that this <hi>Angel</hi> is introduced crying, <hi>Babylon is falling, is falling.</hi> Becauſe that was a <hi>preſage</hi> of the falling away of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from her, which should enſue in the next Age. <hi>John Hus</hi> was burnt by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> contrary to the <hi>publick Faith,</hi> and the <hi>ſafe Conduct,</hi> that had been given him by the Emperor <hi>Sigiſmond.</hi> And Hiſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of him, that he should ſay to his Judges, <hi>ye are putting a Gooſe to death</hi> (for ſo <hi>Hus</hi> in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Language ſignifies) <hi>but a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years hence God will raiſe up a Swan, whom tho ye would never ſo fain deſtroy, ye shall not be able.</hi> Which Prophecy was exactly fulfilled at the time. For as <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> was burnt anno 1415. ſo <hi>Luther</hi> begun the work of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> by writing againſt <hi>Indulgences,</hi> in the year 1515. And tho the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did all they could, both to ſtop his mouth, and to deſtroy him, yet they could never effect it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="89" facs="tcp:108142:57"/>It was therefore in the 16. <hi>Century,</hi> that the voice of the <hi>third Angel</hi> was heard, ſaying loudly, <hi>If any man worship the Beaſt and his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and receive his mark in his Forehead, or in his Hand; the ſame shall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Angel</hi> is <hi>Luther,</hi> who writ with that ſtrength, and preached with that efficacy, and with ſuch ſucceſs, againſt the Errors, Idolatry, and Tyranny of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that near one half of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and People, who reverenced her as their <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>feared</hi> her as their <hi>Queen,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from her Communion, and look't upon her with deteſtation, as the <hi>Mother</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs and Abominations.</p>
                        <p>And as <hi>Rome</hi> could not behold the ſucceſs of the voice of the <hi>third Angel,</hi> but with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite and rage; ſo Believers could not eſcape ſuffering a great deal from a power, which ſaw it ſelf ſo dangerouſly weakned by their Separation.

<bibl>REV. CHAP. 14. v. 14, 15, &amp;c.</bibl>
                        </head>
                        <p>THeſe two <hi>Viſions,</hi> do without doubt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the Judgments of God, againſt his Enemies and the Perſecutors of his <hi>Church.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Ieremiah</hi> uſeth the ſimilitudes of <hi>Vintage</hi> and <hi>Harveſt</hi> againſt <hi>Babylon</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees, Chap. 51. v.</hi> 33. The <hi>Daughter of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is like a threshing floor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her Harveſt shall come. Ioel</hi> alſo makes uſe of them both, <hi>Chap. 13. 3. Put in the Sicle,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for the Harveſt is ripe: come get you down, for the Preſs is full, the fats overflow, for their wickedneſs is great.</hi> There are ſome who do think, that the <hi>Harveſt</hi> reſpecteth and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108142:58"/>
the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Empire; but all are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that the <hi>Vintage</hi> referreth unto, and threatneth the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>As for me, I think it moſt probable, that both theſe Judgments do threaten the <hi>Papal</hi> Empire. And that the <hi>Harveſt</hi> ſignifies an <hi>Initial</hi> Judgment, or a Deciſion as to ſome one or more particulars; and that this <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was executed by means of the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which begun in the laſt Age, thro the Miniſtry of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius.</hi> But that the <hi>Vintage</hi> ſignifies a <hi>definitive</hi> Judgment, which shall ruin the <hi>Papal</hi> Empire beyond recovery, thro a general <hi>Reformation,</hi> that shall take place in the beginning of the next Age, when the 42. <hi>Months</hi> and 1260. <hi>days</hi> will be accomplished.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two <hi>Reformations</hi> ſeem to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by that repetition of the voice from Heaven; <hi>Bayblon is fallen, is fallen.</hi> However they may be ſolidly eſtablished upon the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the ancient People of God, the <hi>Iews.</hi> The <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a <hi>twofold</hi> coming out of <hi>Babylon</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees.</hi> One in vertue of the Edict of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> under <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Iehoſuah;</hi> a ſecond in the virtu of the Edict of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Ezra.</hi> Now that the <hi>Antitype</hi> may correſpond with the <hi>Type,</hi> there muſt be two remarkable <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> to anſwer the <hi>two</hi> deliverances out of the Captivity of <hi>old Babylon.</hi> The one was about 160. years ago, and was effected by the Miniſtry of <hi>Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Luther.</hi> The other is to be when God
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108142:59"/>
comes to execute his decree againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> and to make her drink the <hi>Cup</hi> of his fury. Upon the firſt return of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all they did was to erect the <hi>Altar</hi> and rebuild the <hi>temple:</hi> but upon that which was the <hi>ſecond,</hi> they built the <hi>Walls</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which made the re-eſtablishment of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> entire and perfect. 'Tis to be much after the ſame manner in the <hi>two</hi> Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In the <hi>firſt,</hi> the worship of God was reſtored: which was like the building of the Altar, and the rearing up of the Temple. But the walls of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> are not yet reſtored, that is, the Church of God is not ſetled in peace and ſafety. Nor will that be, till the next coming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> thro a general &amp; ſecond <hi>Reformation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In a word, the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church, is at preſent very imperfect. It hath neither the <hi>extent,</hi> nor that <hi>perfection,</hi> which it ought to have. Not the <hi>Extent;</hi> in that it reacheth only towards the weſt and towards the North. Not the <hi>perfection,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> are much divided, and there are many <hi>Sects</hi> which disfigure the <hi>Reformation.</hi> But the laſt Reformation shall be perfect, both in its <hi>Latitude</hi> and in its purity. In its extenſion, in that it shall reach into the South and into the Eaſt, and to all parts. In its purity, becauſe there shall be no more Sects, no more fondneſs for parties, no more Quarrels, no more diſputes. <hi>The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, the Lion and the Ox shall feed together, and a little Child shall lead them. They shall not hurt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108142:59"/>
nor deſtroy in all the holy mountain of the Lord. For the Earth shall be full of the knowledg of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea, Iſa.</hi> 11. 6, 7, 8, 9. Then shall this prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> be fulfilled, when the <hi>Vials</hi> of Gods wrath are fully pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, and when the Lord shall have executed his <hi>laſt judgment</hi> againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is here expreſſed by the <hi>Vintage.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This judg'ment is denounced in <hi>Terms</hi> that are certainly <hi>Hyperbolical.</hi> But yet we have a <hi>hyperbole</hi> parallel to it, both in the 8 chap. of <hi>Iſaiah v.</hi> 7. and in the 30. <hi>chap. v.</hi> 27, 28. The words of <hi>St. Iohn are</hi> theſe; <hi>and blood came out of the Wine-preſs, even unto the horſe-bridles, by the ſpace of a thouſand and ſix hundred furlongs.</hi> The meaning of which is this, that there hath not hitherto been ſo terrible a judgment, as God will bring upon <hi>Rome,</hi> the Seat of the <hi>Papal Empire.</hi> And if the Obſervation of a certain Learned <hi>English man</hi> be true, that the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical State which is called <hi>Romania,</hi> and which extends it ſelf from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Ancona,</hi> and to the Ponds of <hi>Verona,</hi> be in length <hi>two hundred Italian miles;</hi> we need not doubt but that this is the place here intended, ſeeing 200 <hi>Italian Miles,</hi> make juſt 1600 furlongs.</p>
                        <p>He who is ſaid here to appear, <hi>like unto the Son of Man, ſitting upon a white Clowd, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on his head a Golden Crown;</hi> is Jeſus Chriſt; as is evident by comparing the 14. v. of this chap. with v. 13. of the 1. Chap. and with v. 2. of the 19 ch. The <hi>Angel</hi> that is repreſented <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of the Temple,</hi> &amp; ſaying to him that ſate upon the Cloud, <hi>thruſt in thy ſickle;</hi> is the <hi>Church</hi>
                           <pb n="94" facs="tcp:108142:60"/>
calling for vengeance. As in <hi>Luke</hi> chap. 18. v. 7. where it is ſaid, <hi>shall not God avenge his own Elect, which cry night and day unto him.</hi> Now the delaying to thruſt in the <hi>ſickle,</hi> till called upon and commanded; contains an alluſion to the cuſtom of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were not to put the Sickle into the corn, till the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> who was in the Temple had given order for it.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, this is the very ſame judgment, with that which is deſcribed chap. 19. where the <hi>Wine Preſs of</hi> Gods wrath is alſo ſpoken of. And the ſame likewiſe with that denounced in the Effuſion of the <hi>Vials;</hi> only with this difference, that what the <hi>Vintage</hi> expreſſeth in <hi>general,</hi> the <hi>Vials</hi> declare in <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi>

                        <p>As for thoſe <hi>who had gotten the Victory over the Beaſt and over his Image, and over his mark, &amp; over the number of his Name, and who ſtand upon this Sea of Glaſs, with the harps of God in their hands, and who ſing the ſong of Moſes, &amp; of the Lamb.</hi> They can be no other than the <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> and <hi>Martyr's,</hi> who died in the faith of the Lord, victorious over all the perſecutions of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And who are here compared to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that ſung a ſong to the honor of God, upon their having paſſed through the red Sea, and ſeen the entire deſtruction of their Enemies.

And (3) the Temple is not here Repreſented open in order to give a <hi>paſſage</hi> to the <hi>ſeven Angels</hi> that pour out the <hi>Vials;</hi> but to give <hi>way</hi> for all <hi>Nations</hi> to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in, according as it is ſaid v. 4. that <hi>all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall come and worship before God.</hi> And this may be collected from v. 8. where it is ſaid, <hi>that no man could enter into the Temple, till the ſeven plagues of the ſeven Angels were fulfilled.</hi> Which plainly shews, that the <hi>Temple</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>opened,</hi> that there may be a way made for men to enter into it, againſt whom it had been ſo long shut.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Smoak</hi> that filled the Temple, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the <hi>Cloud</hi> that covered the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to the <hi>Divine Glory</hi> which ſo filled the <hi>Tent</hi> of the Congregation, that <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was not able to enter into it. <hi>Exod. chap. 40. v.</hi> 34. which thing is alſo reported of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of <hi>Solomon, 1 Kings chap. 8. v.</hi> 10; 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now as the <hi>Cloud</hi> was a <hi>Symbol'</hi> of Gods gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the midſt of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo the <hi>Smoak</hi> here ſpoken of, is a preſage of the <hi>Lords Return</hi> again into his <hi>Temple,</hi> which he had for ſo ſong time abandoned to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> i. e. to the <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and to the Citizens of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi> chap. 11. v. 2.</p>

man was able to enter into the Temple, till the ſeven plagues of the ſeven Angels were fulfilled.</hi> Which intimateth, that tho the time of the deſtruction of the Churches Enemies draweth near, and the time wherein the <hi>Goſpel</hi> shall shine bright in the world; yet that the Goſpel will not be univerſally received and followed of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till after the <hi>Subverſion</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which will not be until the <hi>Vials</hi> have been poured out.</p>

<bibl>REV. CHAP. 18.</bibl>
                        </head>
                        <p>THe <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> is deſcribed at length in the <hi>18th Chapter.</hi> But whereas <hi>Babylon</hi> may be taken either for the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> or for her <hi>Empire,</hi> which is the <hi>Papacy</hi> or <hi>Popery:</hi> the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> deſcribed in the <hi>18th chap.</hi> do's reſpect <hi>her</hi> only in the firſt ſenſe, to wit as <hi>She</hi> is the Seat of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> According as <hi>She</hi> is intended in the effuſion of the <hi>fifth</hi> Vial, that is, as <hi>She</hi> is the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Papal Kingdom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For after that the Angel had ſaid, <hi>that her plagues shall come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine, and that she shall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly burnt with fire, becauſe ſtrong is the Lord God who judgeth her;</hi> he then addeth, <hi>that the Kings of the Earth, who have committed fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108142:62"/>
and lived diliciouſly with her, shall bewaile her, and lament for her, when they shall ſee the ſmoak of her burning; &amp; that the merchants alſo shall mourn over her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe none buyeth her Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe any more; and that every Ship-maſter, and all Sailers in Ships, shall caſt duſt on their heads, when they shall ſee the ſmoak of her burning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now who are theſe Kings, theſe Merchants, theſe Shipmaſters and theſe Sailors, that do thus mourn and lament, upon the ſeeing the ſubverſion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the total ruin of <hi>her</hi> that was both the mother of their Faith, and of all Churches? The <hi>Kings,</hi> are partly the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> who do eſteem themſelves, equal to Princes; and partly Kings themſelves and Soveraign's that are Secular. The <hi>Maſters of Ships,</hi> are Archbishops and Bishops. The <hi>Sailers,</hi> are the inferior Clergy. The <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> are the <hi>Friers</hi> that ſell the diſpenſations, the Indulgences, the Relicks, the <hi>Agnus Dei's, &amp;c.</hi> and who do vend thoſe Triffles as the moſt precious of all commodities; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king people believe, that the peace of their conſciences and the ſalvation of their Soul's pend upon them. So that there shall be <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> and Roman Catholicks ſubſiſting after that <hi>Rome</hi> is deſtroyed, and who shall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that <hi>Idol,</hi> tho reduced into ashes.</p>
                        <p>Thus 'tis ſaid in the <hi>16th chap. v.</hi> 10. that the <hi>fifth Angel poured out his Vial upon the Seat of the Beaſt, and his Kingdom became full of darkneſs.</hi> The <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is the City <hi>Rome,</hi> which is now the Seat of the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom, as it was heretofore of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                           <pb n="100" facs="tcp:108142:63"/>
Empire. But this <hi>Kingdom</hi> shall ſubſiſt for a while, after that <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf is deſtroyed. Foraſmuch as it is ſaid, that after the pouring out of the <hi>fifth Vial,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the Beaſt became full of darkneſs; i. e. ſorrowful, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, full of affliction and mourning; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that pomp and ſplendor, which it had enjoyed before the effuſion of that <hi>Vial.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yea, <hi>St. Iohn</hi> tells us in the 19. <hi>chap. v.</hi> 19. that he <hi>ſaw the Beaſt, and the Kings of the Earth, and their Armies gathered together, to make war againſt him that ſat upon the white Horſe, and againſt his Army: And that the Beaſt was taken, and with him, the falſe Prophet, that wrought miracles before him, with which be deceived them that had received the mark of the Beaſt, and them that worshipped his Image; and that theſe two were caſt alive into a Lake of fire burning with brimſtone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that it shall be after the deſtruction of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> ere the Papal <hi>Hierarchy</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> come to be entirely abolished. The <hi>Time</hi> that is to run out between the one and the other, is not expreſly marked by the H. Spirit; no more than the <hi>Time</hi> wherein <hi>Rome</hi> is to be deſtroyed. But in all probability this deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can not be far off. For of the <hi>two ſigns</hi> which are to precede it, we do already ſee <hi>one</hi> of them. <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>ſignes,</hi> is <hi>the increaſe and thickning of darkneſs.</hi> Nor is it without a <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that <hi>Babylon</hi> is threatned with <hi>plagues,</hi> in the plural number, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. It being evident, that the Holy Ghoſt doth therein allude to the <hi>Plagues</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> For it is ſaid of <hi>Babylon; chap. 11. v.</hi> 8. that she is <hi>Spiritually</hi> called <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108142:63"/>
                           <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now as she is ſtiled <hi>Sodom,</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe she hath committed the crime of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and is to be deſtroyed by fire as <hi>Sodom</hi> was, Rev. 18. 8. So she is called <hi>Egypt,</hi> both from her having afflicted the people of God, as <hi>Egypt</hi> did; and becauſe she is to be punished as <hi>Egypt</hi> was. And as the laſt plague wherewith the Lord ſmote Egypt was that of the death of their firſt-born, ſo the <hi>laſt</hi> ſave <hi>one</hi> was that of <hi>darkneſs.</hi> Of which 'tis ſaid, <hi>Exod. ch. 10. v. 22, 23. that it was ſo thick, that they could not ſee one another.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis a long time ſince the <hi>darkneſs</hi> of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and impiety, had over-ſpread the whole <hi>Romish Church. Baronius</hi> and a hundred other Popish writers, do acknowledg the thickneſs of it in the <hi>tenth</hi> age, to a meaſure and degree that is aſtonishing. But it was never ſo groſs and palpable as it is at preſent, nor is it poſſible that it should be greater. What ignorance can be more infamous, or what Impiety can be more enormous, than that which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the whole conduct of the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> againſt the <hi>Reformed in France?</hi> They compel them to go to <hi>Maſs;</hi> they compel them to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs;</hi> they compel them to <hi>Communicate;</hi> they compel them to <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> and to <hi>eat</hi> what they have <hi>worshipped,</hi> tho they know that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do not adore it. All which is as much as to ſay, that <hi>Rome</hi> will have her God ſerved by hypocrites, and that she doth believe ſuch a ſervice to be acceptable to him. Yea it importeth <hi>Romes</hi> obliging her pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, to prophane the moſt auguſt and Sacred thing in their Religion; which is the heighth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108142:64"/>
of impiety, and which can proceed from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an ignorance as groſs and palpable as the <hi>Egyptian darkneſs</hi> was. For tho the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> have <hi>prophaned</hi> the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and tho the <hi>Pagans</hi> have <hi>Prophaned</hi> the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and tho the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have <hi>Prophaned</hi> the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> yet nothing of all this is to be wondred at, ſeeing every one acteth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in according to his principles, and ſutably to that hatred which all men bear to a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that they believe to be falſe. But for either Chriſtians, or Jews, or Mahometans, or Pagans, and eſpecially the publick <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of thoſe <hi>Religions</hi> to compel their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to prophane the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of their own Religion, and to expoſe the object of their Adoration to the contempt of their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is a thing that was never heretofore done. 'Tis poſſible that it might be done by ſome particular men that were <hi>Libertines,</hi> &amp; had no Religion; but that <hi>Miniſters</hi> themſelves should do it, is a fact whereof we have no example in <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> But on the contrary, we find all men to have punished the contempt offered to the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of their <hi>Religion</hi> in the moſt terrible manner that they could. 'Tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Popish teachers &amp; the Emiſſaries, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Prieſts, and Friers of <hi>Rome,</hi> that are ſunk into this exceſs of impiety, and become guilty of this prodigious profanation, as to make people through force to worship and eat that, which they know in their hearts that they do not worship, but deſpiſe and abhor.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108142:64"/>
And as it is only the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> that is ſunk into this exceſs of wickedneſs; ſo it is but of late, and this may be ſaid to be the firſt time, that they have been given up to ſo horrid a profanation. They were wont alway's here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore to murther thoſe whom they ſtiled <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and they counted it both honorable and meritorious to kill them. 'Tis but within theſe few years that they have altered the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of their procedure; and that they have <hi>caſt their pearls before thoſe</hi> whom they themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves <hi>eſteem for ſwine,</hi> in order to make converts at the <hi>coſt</hi> of what is moſt ſacred and holy in their Religion. This Impiety muſt undoubtedly flow <hi>from a Darkneſs anſwerable to that of Egypt,</hi> which hindreth <hi>Rome</hi> from diſcerning and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing between its <hi>own Myſteries,</hi> and thoſe of its Enemies. And by conſequence the laſt <hi>plague,</hi> which is that <hi>of the death of the firſt-born,</hi> muſt ſuddenly follow.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>death of the firſt-born</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Rome,</hi> will be the loſs which she will ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain by the falling off of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> who are the <hi>firſt-born</hi> of the Earth. <hi>Rome</hi> will then loſe <hi>Kings,</hi> when they come to throw off her yoak. 'Tis ſaid <hi>Rev. chap. 17. v. 16. that Kings shall hate the whore, and eat her flesh.</hi> The <hi>Flesh</hi> of Babylon, is the vaſt <hi>riches</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Treaſures</hi> which she ſucks out of Kingdoms as a kind of Tribute, the <hi>Revenues</hi> and <hi>Benefices</hi> of her <hi>Clergy;</hi> which <hi>Kings</hi> shall ſeiſe into their own hands, and grow weary of being any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Tributaries to her. All know that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> is diſtinguished from all other
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108142:65"/>
Monarchs, by the Title of <hi>Eldeſt Son</hi> of <hi>the Church;</hi> and it is probable that he will not be the laſt in throwing off the yoak. And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the <hi>moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> to ſet ſuch an example, rather than to follow it.</p>
                        <p>Having ſaid that <hi>Rome</hi> shall perish, after the manner of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> I do further add, that she shall alſo perish after the manner of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and that this is one of the reaſons why ſhe is called by that name. When ſhe comes to ſee herſelf ſtript by <hi>Kings,</hi> she will endeavour to reduce them to her obedience, by the <hi>thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and by <hi>Papal Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</hi> But they upon the being thus treated, shall make war againſt her, to punish her inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And shall ſo beſiege and shut her up, that she shall come to feel all the ſcourages of divine vengeance.</p>
                        <p>If it shall be objected, that this is contrary to what <hi>St. Iohn</hi> ſaith of <hi>Kings,</hi> namely, that upon the beholding the ſmoak of her burning, they <hi>shall mourn over her.</hi> I anſwer, that when <hi>Rome</hi> comes to be beſieged, fire from heaven will fall upon her, as it did upon <hi>Sodom:</hi> and that the Kings who had beſieged her, will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mourn, to find that the immediate hand of God should ravish them of ſo fine a prey, and ſo rich a ſpoil, as that would have been.</p>

                           <hi>XXII. ILLUSTRATION.</hi> Of the binding of Satan for a thouſand Years; and of the Millenary Reign.
<bibl>REV. CHAP. 20.</bibl>
                        </head>
                        <p>I Do ingenuouſly confeſs, that I have been as much prejudiced againſt the modern <hi>Millenarians,</hi> as againſt the ancient. Tho there ſeemeth to me to be as great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the <hi>Ancient</hi> and the <hi>Modern,</hi> as between thoſe who carry a matter too far, and who obſerve no bounds; and thoſe who are extreamly moderate and ſober, and who uſe all the diſcretion and ſoftnings ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. But in truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after that I had through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined the viſion of <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> and the juncture of time where the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> placeth the <hi>Reign</hi> of a <hi>thouſand years,</hi> to wit between the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> and all the Enemies of the <hi>Church</hi> upon the one ſide, and the War of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> as a fruit of the looſing of <hi>Satan,</hi> after he had been impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned for a thouſand years, upon the other ſide. I muſt declare, that I find my ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and that I am forced to believe that <hi>the Church of God is to enjoy for ſome Ages an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and uninterrupted peace here on the Earth.</hi> I am confirmed in this opinion, by a vaſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108142:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
number of Propheſies, both of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, which cannot be expounded without violence offered to them, and are, if I may ſo ſpeak, ſo many inexplicable riddles, unleſs the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> be to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that peace in this world, of which thoſe promiſes give us aſſurance. And finding not the leaſt danger in embracing that opinion, I have cloſed with it without any further heſitation. For what danger can it be, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> shall enjoy a thouſand years Tranquillity here on the Earth. I do ſee none, unleſs it be that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſo will give offence to the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> who are of another mind, and who affirm that the <hi>Croſs</hi> is to be the <hi>Banner</hi> and <hi>Livery</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> thro all Ages. But theſe very Gentlemen do acknowledg, that the <hi>Church</hi> had reſt and peace during the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> And there are ſome who place the <hi>thouſand years</hi> here ſpoken of, under the Reign of that Emperor. And do underſtand by them the Tranquillity that the <hi>Church</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed from the converſion of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> till the time that She became diſturbed and perſecuted by the <hi>Arrians.</hi> So that the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Antimillenarians</hi> do confeſs, that the <hi>Church</hi> had at leaſt a twenty years calmneſs and ſerenity. Why then should they be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that others who are Orthodox, make the <hi>peace</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> is to enjoy, to be of a greater length and duration? And they cannot but own, that the <hi>Croſs</hi> is not eſſential to the Church of God. It is an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108142:66"/>
without which the Church may very well ſubſiſt. God can as well ſanctify the Church in proſperity as in adverſity, in a calm as well as in a tempeſt. <hi>Iob</hi> was righteous and rich in good works, in the time of his affluence, as well as in the time of his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And why may it not be ſo in reference to the Church of God? If the world be to laſt <hi>ſeven,</hi> or it may be <hi>eight</hi> thouſand years, what danger will there be, in allowing the Church of God, <hi>one</hi> thouſand years peace, for the <hi>ſix</hi> or <hi>ſeven</hi> thouſand that She is be in trouble and ſufferings?</p>
                        <p>But let us without prejudice, hearken unto what God ſaith to us upon this ſubject, both by the Miniſtry of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and that of the ancient <hi>Prophets.</hi> Lo, what St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, <hi>Rev</hi> 20.</p>
                        <p>V. 1. <hi>I ſaw an Angel come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, having the Key of the bottomleſs Pit, and a great Chain in his hand.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 2. <hi>And he laid hold on the Dragon, that old Serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thouſand years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 3. <hi>And caſt him into the bottomleſs Pit, and shut him up, and ſet a Seal upon him, that he should deceive the Nations no more, till the thouſand years should be fulfilled: and after that he muſt be looſed a little ſeaſon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 4. <hi>And I ſaw Thrones, and they ſat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I ſaw the Souls of them that were beheaded for the Teſtimony of Ieſus, and for the Word of God, and which had not worshipped the Beaſt, neither his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108142:67"/>
Image, neither had received his mark upon their Foreheads, or in their right hands; and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 5. <hi>But the reſt of the dead lived not again until the thouſand years were finished. This is the firſt Reſurrection.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 6. <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection: on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power, but they shall be Prieſts of God, and of Chriſt, and shall reign with him a thouſand years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 7. <hi>And when the thouſand years are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, Satan shall be looſed out of his priſon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 8. <hi>And shall go out to deceive the Nations, which are in the four Quarters of the Earth,</hi> Gog <hi>and</hi> Magog, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The Church of Jeſus Chriſt hath a right to ſay as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>I know that my Redeemer Liveth, and that he shall ſtand at the latter day upon the Earth, Chap. 19. v.</hi> 25. And that not only to raiſe and gather together my Bones, which are ſcattered about the Graves mouth, when he cometh from Heaven with his Glorious Angels, to judg the quick and the Dead, at the general Reſurrection: but alſo to deliver me from the miſery wherein I have been in this world, and to cauſe me to enjoy an entire peace after the deſtruction of all my Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For <hi>Iob</hi> was as well a <hi>Type</hi> of the Church of Chriſt, as of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who is her adorable Head. This is that peace of the Church, which <hi>St. Iohn</hi> doth here repreſent, after that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed her ſufferings. For he ſaw her <hi>Riſing</hi>
                           <pb n="109" facs="tcp:108142:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after the ruin of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and injoying the gracious preſence of her Redeemer, after the impriſonment of Satan, and the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the unbelieving and Idolatrous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>If we will give credit to ſome <hi>Divines,</hi> this is the moſt obſcure paſſage in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> but this obſcurity does ariſe from themſelves, and from three prejudices wherewith they are poſſeſſed. (1.) That the world is not to laſt any long time, becauſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>that the end of all things is at hand, 1 Epiſt. chap. 4. v.</hi> 7. (2.) Thar the opinion of the <hi>Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> who conceived that Jeſus Chriſt should come from Heaven down here upon the Earth, to converſe viſibly with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to cauſe them enjoy all ſorts of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for a thouſand years, hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as a carnal opinion tending to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality. (3.) That the Croſs is to be the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Chriſts Diſciples through all Ages; becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>if any man will come after me, let him take up his Croſs, Matth.</hi> 16. 24. and becauſe the Apoſtles have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>that through many tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 14. 22.</p>
                        <p>But we deceive our ſelves, if we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the World to be fo <hi>near its end;</hi> ſeeing before that the <hi>Jews</hi> are to be converted; the Kingdoms of the world are to be brought in to Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Babylon</hi> is to be deſtroyed; and who knoweth how long time there is to be, between the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the ruine of her <hi>King,</hi> and of her <hi>Religion;</hi>
                           <pb n="110" facs="tcp:108142:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
without reckoning what time there may be to run out from the end of the <hi>thouſand years Reign</hi> to the end of the War of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog;</hi> and from thence to the conſummation of all Ages.</p>
                        <p>They have reaſon to diſclaim the opinion of the ancient <hi>Millenarians,</hi> as carnal and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd: But there is no cauſe of counting it a carnal opinion, to believe that the <hi>Church</hi> shall enjoy Tranquillity and Peace for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, during which time she shall have no viſible Enemies, by whom to be oppreſſed, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> being totally deſtroyed, and all the Nations of the world enlightned with the knowledg of the Truth. In a word, to believe as is the common opinion now, that the <hi>thouſand years Reign</hi> shall be <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and that it will conſiſt in this, that the number of true Chriſtians shall be greater than ever it hath been, their knowledg more large, their Aſſemblies more holy, their Love more ſtrong, their Zeal more ardent, and that there shall be a moſt perfect peace both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward.</p>
                        <p>Neither hath Jeſus Chriſt, nor have his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſaid, that the Croſs and Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall be the Livery of Chriſtians, and the path to Paradiſe, to the end of the world; nor have they any where declared, that the <hi>Church</hi> is never to enjoy any long peace here on the Earth. For both St. <hi>Iohn</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> give us ground to hope for ſuch a calm and Tranquillity.</p>
                        <p>As for St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> it was not poſſible for him,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108142:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſpeak of it in a more expreſs manner, than he hath here done. For after he had foretold the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and of the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> whoſe rage had wearied the <hi>Church</hi> with ſo many perſecutions, and for ſo many Ages; he doth now repreſent <hi>Satan's being caſt into priſon, that he might not deceive the Nations for the ſpace of a thouſand years.</hi> How can the <hi>Church</hi> be perſecuted, during this whole time, wherein <hi>Satan</hi> shall be <hi>bound,</hi> and the <hi>Nations</hi> no more <hi>deceived,</hi> the <hi>Papacy</hi> being either wholly <hi>abolished,</hi> or ſo <hi>weakned,</hi> that it cannot lift up its head. This <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is then a natural and an infallible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſequence of <hi>Satan's</hi> being caſt into <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Iohn</hi> further added: <hi>I ſaws,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>the Souls of them that were beheaded for the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Ieſus, and which had not worshipped the Beaſt, and they reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years: this is the firſt Reſurrection.</hi> This Reign can be nothing, but a State of Tranquillity, and of a profound Peace of the <hi>Church;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſet in oppoſition to her ſtate of Bondage, Trouble, and Oppreſſion, during the cruel and bloody Reign of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to <hi>this firſt Reſurrection;</hi> it cannot be meant of that from the <hi>Grave of Sin,</hi> which is the Souls Converſion and Sanctification. For St. <hi>Iohn</hi> deſigns it by the Relative <hi>This,</hi> becauſe of its reference to what he had ſaid. Now he had not ſpoken one word of the Reſurrection from Sin; but had diſcourſed only <hi>of living and Reigning with Chriſt a thouſand
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108142:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
years;</hi> and <hi>of Thrones</hi> that were given where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to judg, i. e. to reign; which expreſſeth a flourishing condition of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> and that she is to have ſway and Authority over all the world for a thouſand years. But it can no way's agree to that Reſurrection, which conſiſteth in Sanctification.</p>
                        <p>Is it then to be thus, that the <hi>Martyrs</hi> are to be <hi>raiſed,</hi> and to live on the Earth a <hi>thouſand years</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt? It is certain, that this opinion containeth nothing that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres either with Reaſon, or with Faith. For this being the only place of the <hi>Bible,</hi> wherein this particular <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> is ſpoken of, and that in all other places the general Reſurrection is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; 'tis moſt ſafe, and moſt agreeable to the Analogy of Faith, as well as moſt conformable to the Stile of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> to underſtand by this <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> the <hi>deliverance</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> from all her Enemies, and her State of peace and Tranquillity. For <hi>Afflictions</hi> being called a <hi>Death, Ezek. 37. 2, 3. Iſaiah</hi> 26. 14, 19. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9, 10. by conſequence <hi>Deliverance</hi> from <hi>Afflictions,</hi> may be called both a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and a <hi>firſt</hi> Reſurrection, not only becauſe it goes before the general, but becauſe it is a <hi>pledg</hi> and a forerunner of it. They whom <hi>Babylon</hi> had condemned to death as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> were eſteemed by her Follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers to be damned, and to undergo the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death.</hi> But when the <hi>Church</hi> shall come to be delivered from her Enemies, her <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> shall then be fully juſtified. And when
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108142:69"/>
she comes to Reign a thouſand years, her <hi>Martyrs</hi> shall then be acknowledged to be happy, and to be Reigning with Chriſt. Thus it is clear, that they shall be bleſſed who have part in this <hi>firſt Reſurrection.</hi> And herein the <hi>Martyrs</hi> will have a part, becauſe their Honor shall be eſtablished, and their Memory univerſally bleſſed.</p>
                        <p>But it may be ſaid, that this ſeems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that all who shall live in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Chriſtian Church during the time of the 1000. <hi>years Reign,</hi> shall be ſaved, and that all they who have part in this <hi>firſt</hi> Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, shall be delivered from the power of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Death?</p>
                        <p>If one should believe ſo, it would be no Hereſie, nor can the will of God concerning this be known by any, nor how far he will extend the effuſion of his Grace. It may be that he will then pour out his Spirit upon all Flesh, and that all Chriſtians then shall be really and in truth, a <hi>willing People, in the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Holineſs, a Holy Nation, and a Royal Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> And it would ſeem as if St. <hi>John</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured this opinion, in that he ſaith not meerly, <hi>bleſſed is he,</hi> but <hi>Bleſſed and Holy is he who hath part in the firſt Reſurrection.</hi> At the leaſt, we may truly ſay, that whereas hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto Worldlings and Hypocrites have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the number of ſincere Chriſtians; the thouſand years Reign will shew us the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and that more than <hi>a third part of the ſeed of the word shall then fall into good and honeſt Hearts, and shall bring forth eighty and a hundred
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108142:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for one.</hi> Nor is there any thing carnal in this <hi>Millenarian</hi> opinion; but all doth become the magnificency of the Prophecies, and all is ſuteable to the wiſdom of God, and to the infinite riches of his Grace.</p>
                        <p>Nor is it St. <hi>Iohn</hi> alone, who hath promiſed this Reign of a thouſand years; but <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> have alſo promiſed it, tho' leſs clearly than this <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as there was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Daniel</hi> ſays in his <hi>ſecond Chap. v.</hi> 35, 44, 45. that the <hi>Image</hi> which appeared to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> in his Dream, was broken in pieces by a <hi>little ſtone cut out of a Mountain,</hi> and that this <hi>little Stone cut out without a hand, became a great Mountain, and filled the whole Earth.</hi> This <hi>little Stone</hi> is the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, which is to out-live the deſtruction and ruin of the <hi>Papal Roman</hi> Empire, repreſented by the <hi>Feet of the Image;</hi> and that after the ſubverſion of all Empires, which are contrary to this of the Son of God, it is to ſpread it ſelf throw all Nations. This is not yet fulfilled; but it muſt be before the laſt day. So that it is the ſame that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> meaneth by the <hi>firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> and by <hi>Reigning with Ieſus Chriſt a thouſand years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſame <hi>Daniel</hi> ſays in the ſeventh <hi>Chap. v.</hi> 27. that after the deſtruction of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> repreſented by the fourth Beaſt, that <hi>the Kingdom, and Dominion, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, were given unto the people of the Saints of the moſt High,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108142:70"/>
and that all Dominions shall ſerve and obey him.</hi> This cannot be after the general Reſurrection, becauſe then there will be no Dominions; nor hath it hitherto been accomplished; ſo that it muſt refer to the 1000 <hi>years,</hi> whereof <hi>St. Iohn</hi> doth here ſpeak.</p>
                        <p>But what can we deſire more plain, than that Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah chap. 65. v. 17. &amp;c.</hi> where God ſpeaketh in theſe Terms. <hi>Behold I create new Heavens and a new Earth, and the former shall not be remembred, nor come into mind. But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create. For behold I create Jeruſalem a rejoicing; and her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a joy. And the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. There shall be no more thence an Infant of day's, nor an old man that hath not fulfilled his day's; for the Child shall die a hundred year old. And they shall build houſes, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth Children for trouble. For they are the ſeed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and their offſprings with them. And it shall come to paſs, that before they call, I will anſwer; and while they are yet ſpeaking, I will hear.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are many things in this paſſage of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that there can be no room for in the life to come, yea not in an allegorical ſenſe. Nor have they been fulfilled from the time of the Prophet till our day's; ſo that they are to be accomplished after the <hi>firſt Reſurrection;</hi> i. e. after the deliverance of the <hi>Church</hi> from all her Enemies, and during the <hi>thouſand years</hi> in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108142:71"/>
which she shall enjoy a perfect peace. We can give no ſenſe to theſe words, whereby to adjuſt them to the ſtate of the glorified. There will not be <hi>from thence an Infant of day's, nor an old man that hath not accomplished his day's.</hi> Shall it be in Heaven, that theſe words are to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>the Child shall die an hundred years old?</hi> Or are the following words to receive their completion in the ſtate of Glory; <hi>They shall build houſes, and inhabite them; they shall plant vine yards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble: for they are the bleſſed of the Lord, and their off ſpring with them. And it shall come to paſs, that before they call, I will anſwer.</hi> If we take theſe words in a <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, as they may without any difficulty; it is then certain, that they are not hitherto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, nor hath any thing like unto this been ever ſeen on the earth. Nor can we affix unto them ſuch a <hi>Myſtical</hi> ſenſe, whereby to shew that they have been fulfilled in a ſtate of <hi>grace</hi> from the eſtablishment of the Goſpel till this time, and much leſs can ſuch a ſenſe be proved in reference to a ſtate of <hi>Glory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor can we avoid the faſtning the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon that other Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah, chap. 11. v. 1, &amp;c. And there shall come forth a rod out of the Stem of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>and a branch shall grow out of his roots. And the Spirit of the Lord shall reſt upon him. In righteouſneſs shall he judg the poor, and reprove the meek with equity. He shall ſmite the Earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall be ſtay the wicked. The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108142:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Leopard shall lie down with the Kid, the Cow and the Bear shall feed together, and the Lion shall eat ſtraw like the Ox, and a little Child shall lead them. They shall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountain: for the Earth shall be full of the knowledg of the Lord, as the waters cover the Seas.</hi> I dare maintain againſt the warmeſt <hi>Antimil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenarians,</hi> that this <hi>Propheſie</hi> is not yet fulfilled, and that it shall be accomplished on the Earth, after the deſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> The <hi>fourth verſe</hi> does plainly guide to this ſenſe; <hi>he shall ſmite the Earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he ſlay the wicked.</hi> And it evident, that <hi>St. Paul</hi> had theſe words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in his thoughts when he wrote the <hi>2d. chap</hi> of the <hi>2d. Ep.</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> For after that he had deſcribed <hi>Antichriſt</hi> by his principal Characters, he adds, v. 8. <hi>the Lord shall deſtroy this wicked one by the breath of his mouth, and shall deſtroy him by the brightneſs of his coming.</hi> Of what coming of the Lord doth <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſpeak? It cannot be of the laſt. It muſt be a coming, that may accord what is ſaid by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> with what is predicted by <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> And whenſoever the <hi>Iews</hi> come to be brought home, and all <hi>Nations</hi> converted; it will then appear ſo clearly, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is come into the world, that if he should deſcend from heaven unto the Earth, we could not be more convinced. This coming of the Lord will be magnificent and glorious, foraſmuch as it will make the Church from that time forward to appear as an Army glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in holineſs, and victorious over all her Enemies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="118" facs="tcp:108142:72"/>There are three things promiſed in this Oracle. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, a perfect union of the <hi>Iews</hi> with all Nations. This is promiſed under the <hi>Embleme</hi> of <hi>wild beaſts,</hi> dwelling and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding peaceably with the <hi>Lamb</hi> and with the <hi>Ox.</hi> When was it, that this was ſeen? In the times of the Apoſtles, when the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> were converted by. <hi>St. Peter</hi> and his fellow <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> I do affirm, that there was nothing then ſeen, ſave a ſmall pattern of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of this prophecy. Nor was that the time of the converſion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but rather of their rejection. And the peace which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared then in the Church made up of Jews and Gentiles, was of too short a continuance, to expreſs all the Force and the whole extent of this Union, and of this harmony of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Prophecy before us of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> gives ground to hope for.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>2d</hi> is, an abundance and large diffuſion of the knowledg of the true God. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly promiſed in theſe words; <hi>the whole Earth shall be full of the knowledg of the Lord, as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cover the Sea.</hi> From the time of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> till our day's, there hath been nothing ſeen, that may anſwer the greatneſs of this promiſe. The darkneſs of <hi>Paganiſm</hi> prevailed in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, till <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> That of <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi>-followed ſoon after that of <hi>Heatheniſm.</hi> And that of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> hath reigned for above theſe twelve hundred years, and is not yet diſſipated. Not to ſpeak of the darkneſs of <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> which hath ſpread it ſelf very far. But what? Is this plentiful effuſion of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108142:72"/>
the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> deſigned only for the <hi>Roman Empire?</hi> Is not all the Earth the Lords? Are not all <hi>Nations</hi> to have their share in it? This great Event will come to be ſeen, during the time of the <hi>Millennian</hi> Reign.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> is a great Innocency and a great Harmleſneſs. This is promiſed in theſe words, <hi>They shall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my Holy Mountain; And a little Child shall lead both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentils, expreſſed here <hi>by the Wolf and the Lamb, the Leopard and the Kid, the Cow and the Bear, the Lion and the Ox.</hi> When was there ever that Innocence and Harmleſneſs ſeen among people, that there needed only an <hi>Infant</hi> to conduct them? Nor can one without being ſtrangely prepoſſeſſed, confine it to the time of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> ſeeing it is but to take a view of thoſe times, and we shall find them filled with Traytors, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates, and profligate perſons, as all Ages have been ſince. So that the fulfilling of this Propheſie is to be expected under the <hi>thouſand years Reign.</hi> When <hi>Chriſtians</hi> shall be univerſally regenerated, delivered from thoſe paſſions that cauſe diviſions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the vices that diſturb Societies. Not becauſe there will not be then any wicked perſon, nor by reaſon that there will not be any vice; for that is not to be hop'd for but in a State of Glory; but becauſe good men and the fear of God, shall have the ſame advantage during that happy Reign, that vice and wicked men have had hitherto, over Religion, and over thoſe that have been
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108142:73"/>
vertuous. The more I think upon theſe words, <hi>a little Inſant shall lead them,</hi> I grow the more into a perſuaſion, that there shall then be no Tyrants, to govern people with a Scepter of Iron, by the falſe and villanous <hi>Maxim's,</hi> either of a Heathenish Policy, as that of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> or of a Divelish, as that of the <hi>Pope;</hi> but by the lively and pure Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> For God will then abundantly pour out his Spirit <hi>upon Young, and upon Old; upon Children, and upon Fathers; upon Maſters, and upon Servants,</hi> according to the Propheſie of <hi>Ioel, chap. 2. v.</hi> 28, 29. And all the people of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> shall be then a <hi>willing people,</hi> according to the promiſe of the Prophet <hi>David, Pſal. 110. v.</hi> 3. Finally, it is not more evident, that the <hi>calling</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is promiſed by the Prophets, than it is certain that the ſame Prophets have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, a <hi>plentiful Knowledg,</hi> a <hi>great Holineſs,</hi> a <hi>profound Peace,</hi> and a <hi>long proſperity.</hi> Theſe two <hi>Articles</hi> go generally together in the ancient <hi>Propheſies.</hi> And both the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> of them, is in the New Teſtament called a <hi>Myſtery</hi> and a <hi>Secret.</hi> That of the <hi>Converſion</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is uſually ſo ſtiled in the writings of Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> and that of the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>quiet State</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, is called ſo by <hi>St. Iohn, Rev. chap. 10. v.</hi> 7. where it is promiſed, that <hi>in the dayes of the voice of the ſeventh Angel, when he shall begin to ſound, the</hi> Myſtery <hi>of God shall be finished, as he had declared so his Servants the Prophets.</hi> What Myſtery? The <hi>Antimillena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>

underſtand that whereof <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſpeaks 1 Cor. 15. 51. <hi>behold I shew you a Myſtery, we shall not all ſleep, but we shall all be changad.</hi> But this Notion is only an effect of their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, foraſmuch as <hi>St. John</hi> doth ſo chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteriſe the <hi>Myſtery</hi> which he ſpeaketh of, that it can no way's be the ſame with that whereof <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſpeaks. For whereas <hi>St. Iohn</hi> ſaith, that it is a <hi>Myſtery, which God had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto his Servants the Prophets;</hi> there was not one of the <hi>Prophets</hi> that hath a word of the <hi>Change</hi> that shall be made in the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the <hi>living</hi> at the laſt day. But all the Prophets have promiſed, that the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> shall come to be rich in knowledg and holineſs, and to enjoy a grand peace on the Earth.</p>
                        <p>Seeing therefore that theſe two <hi>Articles</hi> have uſually accompanied one another in the ancient Propheſies; and that they are called <hi>Myſteries</hi> by the holy <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> we are not to marvel that one and the ſame accident hath befallen them both. And that ſeeing the Vocation of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> was a thing which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves could not comprehend, even after the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt; that therefore the State of <hi>Purity, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Proſperity,</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, should be a matter now ſo incomprehenſible to the moſt enlightned and learnedſt Divines. And as there were extraordinary Revelations vouchſav'd to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to bring them to like and approve the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the calling of the Gentiles; ſo it is to be hop'd that God
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108142:74"/>
will make uſe of ſome extraordinary revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to cauſe his ſervants that are moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with prejudice, to relish the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> Temporal felicity. And this Revolution will doubtleſs be the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the deſtruction of <hi>Mahumeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> and the converſion of the <hi>Jews;</hi> which as they make a part of this <hi>Myſtery,</hi> ſo they are a forerunner of, and an entrance into, this <hi>Reign</hi> of the <hi>thouſand years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is much at one, whether we are to take theſe <hi>thouſand years</hi> indefinitely, for a very long time, without determining how long; tho it be a received <hi>Maxim, that Times of a broken number are to be taken indefinitely, and thoſe of an Entire number are to be taken definitely.</hi> The thouſand years is an <hi>entire</hi> Number, and that of a thouſand two hundred and ſixty day's is a <hi>broken</hi> number; ſo that whereas this laſt ſeems to be <hi>indefinite,</hi> the former would ſeem to be <hi>definite.</hi> But whether we take the <hi>thouſand years,</hi> as ſignifying <hi>more,</hi> or as ſignifying <hi>leſs;</hi> both the one, and the other, may be concluded from the quality of the number. But I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to ſay, that the 1000 <hi>years</hi> do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignify a great deal more time, than a man according to the ordinary courſe of Nature, can live, and more than the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> lived before the Law, yea more than <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> who tho he lived longeſt of any that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood, yet he reached not to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years.</p>

<bibl>REV. CHAP. XIX. v. 7, &amp;c.</bibl>
                        </head>
                        <p>AS there are <hi>three Reſurrections</hi> ſpoken of in the Scripture (1) That wrought by the Goſpel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 14. (2) That which is to be at the end of the world; and (3) that which shall be the recalling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 11. 15. So there are <hi>three Marriages</hi> of the Church to Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>firſt</hi> cauſed by the Goſpel, 1 Cor. 11. 2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one huſband, that I may preſent you as a chaſte virgin to Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>third,</hi> which is to be ſolemniſed at the End of the world. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> which shall be celebrated, when the <hi>Iews</hi> come to be reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and when <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> shall <hi>Reign</hi> after an eminent manner upon the <hi>Earth</hi> for a <hi>thouſand years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis this <hi>ſecond</hi> Marriage which is ſpoken of here in the 19. chap. Which <hi>Chapter</hi> may be called an <hi>Epithalamium</hi> or a Wedding Song, becauſe <hi>St. Iohn</hi> ſay's, <hi>that he heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, ſaying, Alleluja; for the Lord God omnipotent Reigneth. Let us be glad &amp; rejoice, &amp; give honor to him; for the Marriage of the Lamb is come, &amp; his Wife hath made her ſelf ready; &amp; to her was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108142:75"/>
granted that they should be arayed in fine linnen, which is the Righteouſneſs of the Saints.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Spouſe</hi> of this <hi>Marriage,</hi> is the Chriſtian Church, being filled up with the fulneſs of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> refuſed to come to the <hi>Marriage</hi> of the Son of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they are here repreſented coming with joy. And that is doubtleſs the reaſon, why the Term <hi>Allelujah</hi> is four times uſed in this chapter, as a <hi>Term</hi> familiar unto the <hi>Iews,</hi> and ordinarily uſed by them in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Marriage</hi> is ſtiled a <hi>Supper: bleſſed are they who are called unto the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, v.</hi> 9. Becauſe it is to be celebrated, in the <hi>evening</hi> of the worlds duration. The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> to which the <hi>Iews</hi> were firſt invited by their Lord, is called a <hi>Dinner,</hi> Matth. chap. 22. v. 4. but here at this <hi>ſecond Marriage;</hi> they are called to a <hi>Supper,</hi> as being the laſt Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> rejected the <hi>firſt</hi> Invitation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt left the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the ſtate he found it; whereas the <hi>Iews</hi> had ſtrongly hop'd that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> would have delivered them from its domination. And now the ſame Roman Empire become <hi>Papal,</hi> doth as much and more keep them off from Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, becauſe they cannot imagine that <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> can be the <hi>people</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and they have reaſon for it. But when the <hi>Papal</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, shall come to be deſtroyed, as it aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly shall upon the Effuſion of the <hi>Vials,</hi> and when the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the <hi>Falſe Prophet</hi> shall be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108142:75"/>
caſt into the bottomleſs pit; in a word, when the <hi>Papacy</hi> shall be abolished with all its <hi>Idols;</hi> then the <hi>Iews</hi> will be no longer deaf to Gods call, but will come to the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Lamb, shall unite with <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to worship together the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> boaſteth herſelf to be the Church of God, but her vanity therein doth appear after ſuch a manner, that she might blush, if she were capable; being ſo vaſtly different from the <hi>Church</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt acknowledgeth for his Spouſe, and which is called here <hi>the Spouſe of the Lamb.</hi> There is as great a difference between the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as there is between <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Harlot</hi> and the <hi>Spouſe</hi> of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> She diſcovereth herſelf by her gaud'ries and coſtly habit's, which ſerve for nothing but to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the ſight and pleaſe the ſenſes. The Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> manifeſteth her ſelf by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind of Dreſs, which is nothing but Righteouſneſs and holineſs. <hi>For to her was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that she should be arayed,</hi> not in purpl' and ſcarlet, as <hi>Babylon,</hi> but <hi>in fine linnen, which is the Righteouſneſs of the Saints.</hi>

                        </head>
                        <p>ALL Interpreters do agree that this <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> deſcribed <hi>Chap.</hi> 21, is the <hi>Church</hi> of God; but they differ in this, that ſome do believe it to be the Church of God <hi>glorified</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> whereas others do take it to be the Church <hi>Militant</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> but victorious over all her Enemies, and enjoying an univerſal peace during the 1000 <hi>years,</hi> which have been ſpoken of.</p>
                        <p>This laſt opinion is the trueſt. (1) Becauſe the Angel entreth upon this deſcription of the <hi>Church</hi> of God, as he had entred upon the deſcription of <hi>Babylon, chap.</hi> 17. 'Tis there ſaid v. 1. <hi>One of the ſeven Angels, which had the ſeven Vials, talked with me ſaying; I will shew thee the whore and her judgment.</hi> The ſame is ſaid here, <hi>One of the ſeven Angels, which had the ſeven Vials, talked with me, ſaying, come hither, and I will shew thee the Bride, the Lambs Wife.</hi> After the ſame manner that the glory of <hi>Babylon</hi> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>there,</hi> is the glory of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> deſcribed <hi>here;</hi> but ſuch as she shall have afier the deſtruction of her Enemy. 'Tis in the proſpect and hope of this, that the Church do's rejoice, <hi>Mica 7, 8. &amp;c. Rejoice not againſt

me, O mine Enemy; tho I be fallen, I shall ariſe; tho I ſit in darkneſs, the Lord shall be a light unto me. I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him, until he plead my cauſe; then she that is my Enemy, shall be covered with shame, and mine eyes shall behold her troden down as the mire of the ſtreets.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(2) The Church of God is here called the <hi>great City,</hi> a Title which had been given to <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the 16, 17, <hi>and 18, Chapters.</hi> Becauſe the whole Earth went after <hi>Babylon,</hi> while the Church of God did hardly appear, being brought into a narrow compaſs, and to a ſmall number: but now <hi>Babylon</hi> hath abandon'd the field, and appeareth no more; and now the <hi>Jews</hi> are brought again in, and the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is entred into the Tents of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which being forced to ſtretch out her curtains by reaſon of the converſion of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is therefore called <hi>that great City.</hi> This is exactly <hi>the little Stone</hi> in the Propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which was to become <hi>a great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> And this <hi>Prophecy</hi> is to be fulfilled on the Earth before the day of judgment.</p>
                        <p>(3) 'Tis ſaid in the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                           <hi>verſe,</hi> that <hi>the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them which are ſaved, shall walk in the light of it, and the Kings of the Earth do bring their glory and their honor into it.</hi> Which can no way's be applied to the Church triumphant in heaven; but agrees unto her as she is victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious on the Earth over the fury of the Beaſt, and as she is in the enjoyment of her <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> tranquillity. It will be then, that the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> will be fulfilled, <hi>chap.</hi> 49.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:108142:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>v. 22, 23. Behold I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and ſet up my ſtandard to the people; And they shall bring thy Sons in their arms, and thy Daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders. And Kings shall be thy nurſing fathers, and their Queens thy nurſing Mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the Earth, and lick up the duſt of thy feet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, the Church of God, as she shall be glorified in heaven, having been deſcribed in the beginning of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> as well as the frightful ſtate of the damned is in the 8th verſe, it is evident that in the 9. <hi>verſe</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Angel deſcribeth a glory of the <hi>Church</hi> different from that of heaven, which can be no other ſave that of the <hi>Reign</hi> of the 1000 <hi>years.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor is there any doubt, but that this <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> which <hi>St. John</hi> deſcribes, is the very ſame with that whereof the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hath given a deſcription together with that of the Temple, and that there are very many things in that deſcription, which cannot be perfectly underſtood, till after the converſion of the <hi>Iews.</hi>

                        <p>This is a lofty deſcription of the Majeſty of God. And his not being named, is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his Glory.

                        <p>
                           <hi>v. 4. And round about the Throne were 24 Seats, and upon the Seats I ſaw 24 Elders ſitting, cloathed in white rayment, and they had on their heads Crowns of gold.</hi>

                        <p>Theſe are the Paſtors and Guides of the Church militant, under the name of the <hi>twelve Patriarchs</hi> of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of the <hi>twelve Apoſtles</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church; becauſe it was in favour of the Church <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant</hi> that God revealed his Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to <hi>St. Iohn.</hi> The Title of <hi>Elder</hi> is a Title of dignity, whereof alſo the <hi>whiteneſs</hi> of their <hi>Garments,</hi> and their <hi>Crowns</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> are marks and indications.

                        <p>This is a terrible threatning againſt the Enemies of Gods Church.

                        <p>
                           <hi>v. 6. And before the throne there was a Sea of Glaſs like unto Chryſtall.</hi>

                        <p>

                        <p>Theſe <hi>four living Creatures,</hi> are beyond all exception the ſame with thoſe in the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel, chap.</hi> 1. For that Prophet ſtiles them in his 10 <hi>chap. v. 5. Cherubims,</hi> which ſignify Angels. Theſe are then four chief <hi>Angels,</hi> as they are called in the 10 <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Daniel, v.</hi> 13. and they are elſewhere called <hi>Archangels,</hi> as having Angels under them. And thence it is ſaid, <hi>Rev. 15. 7. that one of the four living Creatures, gave unto the ſeven Angels, ſeven Vials full of the wrath of God who liveth for ever &amp; ever.</hi> Which cannot agree but to Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels. Theſe Archangels are repreſented by the number <hi>four,</hi> either with reſpect to the four <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> according to which the four gates of the new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which was repreſented by the Myſtical Temple of <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> or elſe with reſpect to the <hi>four Empires,</hi> under which the Church of God hath been in ſubjection and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Ezekiel</hi> theſe <hi>living Creatures</hi> are repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted each of them having the <hi>four</hi> reſemblances of a Lion, of an Ox, of a Man, and of an Eagle; but here each is repreſented as having but <hi>one;</hi> becauſe <hi>St. Iohn</hi> ſaw them in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of <hi>ſtanding,</hi> whereas <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw them in a poſture of <hi>motion,</hi> together with their wheels.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Lion</hi> is an Emblem of invincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108142:79"/>
The <hi>Ox</hi> is a Symbole of ſtrenth and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. The <hi>Man</hi> of meekneſs. And the <hi>Eagle</hi> of promptitude &amp; ſwiftneſs. All which ſerve to declare the qualities of theſe Angels in their Execution of divine Orders. As their being <hi>full of eyes</hi> expreſſeth the knowledg and wiſdom wherewith they execute them.</p>
                        <p>V. 9. <hi>And when theſe four living Creatures give glory, and honor, and thanks to him that ſat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 10. <hi>The four and twenty Elders fall down before him that ſat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and caſt their Crowns before the Throne, ſaying;</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 11. <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power; for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are, and were created.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here we have the exact <hi>form</hi> of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of lawful worship. The Myſtical living Creatures do adore none but God; the 24 Elders do worship none beſides the Lord; it is before him that they do alone bow; and it is only at his feet that they caſt down their Crowns. 'Tis to him alone that they aſcribe honor and glory, and they themſelves aſſign the reaſon of it. <hi>For,</hi> ſay they, <hi>thou haſt created all things.</hi> Whence is it that the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> is not here named, if She be alſo the object of Religion and of worship? And why ought we not to be content with that form of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Angels of Heaven practice; eſpecially ſeeing we every day ſay, <hi>thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="134" facs="tcp:108142:80"/>Moreover, the Scope of this <hi>Viſion,</hi> is to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that God will be alway's in the midſt of his Church, whatſoever Eclipſe does befall her, whether by <hi>Hereſies</hi> or by <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions:</hi> And that there shall alway's be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers in the Earth, who shall worship the one only true God, in Spirit and truth, even as the Angels and the bleſſed do adore him in Heaven.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108142:81"/>
and conducteth all events, as the ſoveraign Arbiter and Diſpoſer.</p>
                        <p>V. 8. <hi>And when he had taken the Book, the four living Creatures, and four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them Harps, and golden Vials full of Odours, which are the Prayers of Saints.</hi>

                        <p>V. 9. <hi>And they ſung a new Song, ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof; for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy Blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and Nation.</hi>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Here is the ſame worship given to Jeſus Chriſt, by the four living Creatures, and by the four and twenty Elders, that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapter had been rendred to Him who created all things for his pleaſure; which shews Chriſts being acknowledged for the true God by the four living Creatures and by the 24. Elders.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Harps</hi> which they have in their hands, are for the ſinging the praiſes of God; and the <hi>Vials full of odours,</hi> are for the invocating of him, which are the two Acts of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Odours</hi> are called <hi>the prayers of the Saints,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Incenſe</hi> offered by the Prieſts of old, were a <hi>Symbole</hi> of prayers, as appeareth in the 141. <hi>Pſ. v. 2. Let my prayer be ſet forth before thee as Incenſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some may poſſibly infer from hence, that the Saints who are in Heaven, do pray for thoſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:108142:82"/>
on Earth, and that they do preſent unto God the prayers of ſuch as are here in the world.</p>
                        <p>But this is to ſuppoſe, that the four and twenty Elders are in Heaven, and that the <hi>Saints</hi> ſpoken of in this paſſage, are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of <hi>Souls</hi> received into Paradiſe, or, as men are uſed to ſpeak in the world, of the <hi>Saints</hi> that are in Heaven: which is a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without any ground or foundation. For thoſe believers that are in Heaven, are not in any part of the Bible called <hi>Saints,</hi> but only ſtiled <hi>Bleſsed.</hi> Nor is it ſaid here, that theſe 24. Elders are <hi>Bleſſed.</hi> The <hi>Viſion</hi> is ſo far from ſaying this, that it declareth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; becauſe the very ſame perſons having <hi>Vials</hi> full of <hi>Odours,</hi> do ſay, <hi>v. 10. Thou haſt made us unto our God Kings and Prieſts, and we shall reign on Earth.</hi> Which sheweth that they who offer up the <hi>prayers of the Saints</hi> that are on the Earth, are themſelves likewiſe upon the Earth, and where they hope to Reign. So that the <hi>four and twenty Elders,</hi> do repreſent the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Guides</hi> of the <hi>Militant Church,</hi> who are ſaid to offer up <hi>Odours,</hi> by reaſon of their praying publickly for all the Congregations of Believers. And theſe Paſtors are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented under the number of 24. by an alluſion to rhe twelve <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the twelve <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of the New, as they were in the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the foregoing Chap.</p>
                        <p>Theſe 24. Elders, and the 4. living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſing a new Song, ſaying, <hi>Thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof, for thou haſt redeemed us,</hi> &amp;c. Which words
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:108142:82"/>
ſeem to give light to that ſaying of Jeſus Chriſt in the 13. Chap. of <hi>Mark</hi> v. 32. <hi>But of that day and hour of Judgment knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in Heaven, neither the</hi> Son of man, <hi>but the Father.</hi> Then the <hi>Son</hi> as man knew it not, becauſe he had not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Sacrifice of his death, for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Divine Juſtice; but now he knoweth both the day and the hour, and every thing that shall befal either the Church or the World, becauſe he hath been ſacrificed. Which is the reaſon of the four and twenty Elders ſaying unto him, <hi>Thou art worthy to open the Book, and to looſe the Seals thereof; for thou haſt redeemed us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It ought here to be carefully obſerved, that this <hi>New Song</hi> containeth the whole My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Goſpel worship. For here we have the death of Chriſt, which is the foundation of all; we have them whom his death hath redeemed; we have the fruits which believers receive by his Death, namely, the dignity of being Kings and Prieſts; and we have the Glory which accrueth to Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For he is thought worthy to know all the Secrets of providence, and to receive the Adoration of all Creatures, low, middle, and high. Which Adoration is here ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in a form that is moſt perfect, and which alone is that where with God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that which all the Angels with the four and twenty Elders publish aloud, that <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy is the Lamb that was ſlain to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:108142:83"/>
honor, and glory, and bleſſing.</hi> This is moreover what every Creature in Heaven, and on Earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the Sea, ſay likewiſe in their turn: <hi>Bleſſing, and Honor, and Glory, and Power, be unto him that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. And the four living Creatures ſaid, Amen, and the twenty four Elders fell down, and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is repeated again, becauſe it can never be ſaid enough. All worship that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to this pattern, is unlawful and diſpleaſeth God. Nor can we give the leaſt worship to a Creature, whatſoever degree of glory it hath arrived at, without a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from this divine model and falling into Idolatry. Here we have a Sentence that condemneth the worship of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> in their addreſſing their Hymn's and their Prayers to Angels and to Saints.</p>

                           <hi>IV. ILLUSTRATION.</hi> Of the Opening of the firſt ſix Seals.
<bibl>REV. CHAP. 6.</bibl>
                        </head>
                        <p>AS to the Six Seals, of the opening where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſixth Chapter treateth, the <hi>four</hi> firſt differ from the <hi>two</hi> other in <hi>two</hi> things. <hi>One</hi> is, that at the opening of the <hi>four</hi> firſt there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>four</hi> Horſemen, &amp; four living Creatures.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:108142:83"/>
The <hi>other</hi> is, that at the opening of theſe, St. <hi>John</hi> is called upon, to conſider the things which are there declared to be hereafter to come.</p>
                        <p>There is doubtleſs ſome reaſon for this difference, and this reaſon is in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity nothing but this, namely, that every one of theſe <hi>four</hi> Seals, containeth things which reſpect the whole courſe of the prophetick Hiſtory, both of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> and of the <hi>Church;</hi> which the two following do not.</p>
                        <p>This reaſon appeareth to be true, in that in the firſt Viſion of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> chap. 1. v 8. it is ſaid, that the men which the Prophet ſaw riding upon red, bay, and white Horſes, <hi>were thoſe, whom the Lord ſent to and fro through the Earth.</hi> And in that the <hi>four</hi> living Creatures ſignify (as we have proved) the <hi>four</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels ſet over the four parts of the world, which marketh Univerſality. And by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that the <hi>four</hi> firſt Seals, at the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof they do appear, contain the things that reſpect the whole ſeries of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire and of the <hi>Church.</hi> Which obſervation, if we duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto, we shall the more clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the opening of theſe Seals.</p>
                        <p>V. 1. <hi>And when the Lamb opened one of the Seals,</hi> i. e. the firſt; I <hi>heard one of the four living Creatures,</hi> (that is, the firſt) <hi>ſaying, as if it had been the voice of Thunder,</hi> Come and ſee.</p>
                        <p>V. 2. <hi>And I ſaw, and behold a white Horſe, and he that ſat on him had a Bow, and a Crown was
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:108142:84"/>
given unto him, and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>firſt</hi> living Creature is the <hi>Lion,</hi> whoſe Roaring is the moſt terrible voice of all the noiſes of Brutes. <hi>If the Lion doth Roar, shall we not tremble,</hi> ſaith one of the Prophets. It is compared alſo to the noiſe of <hi>Thunder,</hi> which is the thing of the world that is moſt frightful to men.</p>
                        <p>This is exactly the preaching of the Goſpel. They who preach it are <hi>Boanerges,</hi> Sons of Thunder; they carry dread along with them, whereſoever they are heard: <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were equally frighted at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom doth dread nothing ſo much at this day. Which is the reaſon that the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Clergy</hi> uſe all the power and induſtry that they are able, to ſtiffle this voice in all places; but it is in vain. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> hath been victorious over <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and will be ſo over the <hi>Papal</hi> Empire.</p>
                        <p>This is what is promiſed to <hi>the man upon the white Horſe, going forth conquering and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</hi> For this Man is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, who hath overcome. He eſtablished his Goſpel through the whole Pagan Roman Empire. The worshippers of falſe Gods, being pierced by the Arrows of our Saviour, became converted to the Faith. And he will do the ſame to the Papal Roman Empire.</p>
                        <p>V. 3. <hi>And when he had opened the ſecond Seal, I heard the ſecond living Creature ſay, come, and ſee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="143" facs="tcp:108142:84"/>V. 4. <hi>And there went out another Horſe that was red, and power was given unto him that ſat thereon, to take peace from the Earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great Sword.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>ſecond</hi> living Creature, is the <hi>Ox,</hi> the <hi>Symbole</hi> of patience, and of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for ſlaughter; which denoteth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, which believers, who are the Myſtical Sheep of Jeſus Chriſt, were to ſuffer.</p>
                        <p>And he that ſat upon this red Horſe, is no other than Satan, the red Dragon, that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer from the beginning; who is armed with a <hi>Sword,</hi> to preſage the <hi>Blood,</hi> which for the ſake of the Goſpel, and to hinder the victories of Jeſus Chriſt, he should shed through the whole extent both of the Pagan and Papal Empire.</p>
                        <p>V. 5. <hi>And when he had opened the third Seal, I heard the third living Creature ſay, come, and ſee; and I beheld, and lo, a black Horſe, &amp; by that ſat on him had a pair of Ballances in his hand.</hi> The word in the Original ſignifies a Yoak, as well as a Ballance. And that it ought to be here tranſlated a Yoak, the ſequel doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
                        <p>V. 6. <hi>And I heard a voice in the midſt of the four living Creatures, ſay, a meaſure of wheat for a penny, and three meaſures of barley for a penny, and ſee thou hurt not the Oyl and the Wine.</hi> This undoubtedly denoteth a great plenty of all things neceſſary to the comfort of life. Which sheweth that this Horſeman carrieth a Yoak, not a Ballance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="144" facs="tcp:108142:85"/>Here is indeed a change from white to black. The firſt Horſeman, who ſat upon the white Horſe, to wit Jeſus Chriſt, ſpread the light of his Goſpel, in order to eſtablish a ſpiritual Religion, which conſiſteth in <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping God in Spirit and in Truth;</hi> as he told the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that the time would ſuddenly come, that there should be a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion free from the Yoak of the Ceremonies of the ancient Law, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 23. But he who appears ſitting upon the black Horſe, to wit Satan, hath ſpread darkneſs of Errors, and hath founded a carnal Religion, that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in bodily ſervice, in Jewish and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish Ceremonies, in Altars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> external Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, Washings, Abſtinences, Faſtings, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and Relicks, &amp;c. which hath made a Yoak a thouſand fold heavier than all the Ceremonial Obſervances of the Law, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> called a <hi>Yoak of Bondage,</hi> Gal. 5. 1. and which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, were a <hi>Yoak that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we nor our Fathers were able to bear, Act.</hi> 15. 10.</p>
                        <p>This is what fell out under the Chriſtian Emperors. For the Devil ſeeing that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions could not ſtop the conqueſts of him that ſat on the white Horſe, nor hinder the courſe of the Goſpels victories; he took an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way, and bethought himſelf of a new Stratagem. And brought into the <hi>Church</hi> the Cuſtomes and Ceremonies of the Heathen, under the plauſible pretence of drawing the Pagans over to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> by means of the conformity of the Ceremonies
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108142:85"/>
of the one with the other. To which the proſperity of the Church at that time did wonderfully contribute, plenty and wealth having ſo lulled the Paſtors into ſleep, that while they ſlumber'd, <hi>the Enemy ſowed his tares in the Field of the Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis the property of great proſperity to corrupt Souls. Eaſe and plenty have been always fatal to godlineſs. Whereas on the contrary, affliction and poverty, have been at all times ſure and faithful guards of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who lived in the fifth Age, complains that in his time, <hi>they deſpiſed many of the Commands of the Sacred Scriptures, and that Superſtition had univerſally ſo prevailed, that if any one had touched the ground with his bare foot during the week wherein he was baptized, he was more ſeverely rebuked, than if he had been drunk; and that the Chriſtian Religion, which God in his mercy would have to be free, and to conſiſt of a very few Ceremonies, was become ſo loaded with ſervile burdens, that the condition of the Jews of old, was much more tolerable than that of Chriſtians. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Iews had been ſubjected to a bondage of the Law of God, but that in the place of this the Chriſtians were brought under bondage to humane Inventions.</hi> This is the complaint which that Doctor makes in the 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Chapt.</hi> of his 119. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to Ianuarius.</hi> And this complaint doth moſt clearly explain that ſenſe which we have given of the Yoak, which he on the black Horſe had in his hand.</p>
                        <p>'Tis the plenty which the <hi>Roman Prelates</hi> do at this day enjoy, of Wheat, of Wine, of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108142:86"/>
Barley, and of Oyl, which cauſeth that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in their Religion is carnal, and that it is a greater ſin to tranſgreſs the commands of the <hi>Church,</hi> than to break the commands of <hi>God;</hi> &amp; that they who do work on a holy day, or who eat Flesh in Lent, or on Friday, are accounted more guilty, than they who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, theft, or murther. Before the time of this abundance and proſperity, and before the Reign of <hi>Conſtantin,</hi> there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this Yoak known. In adverſity they hearkned to the voice of God; but in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they hearken only to the voice of man. Becauſe it is eaſier to obey man, than God. It is much eaſier to abſtain from ſome ſort of meats, than to forbear the pleaſures of luxury; to bow before an Image, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat a prayer by rote, and without minding what they ſay, than to worship God in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And therefore the living Creature who ſaid to St. <hi>Iohn</hi> at the opening of the <hi>Third</hi> Seal, <hi>come and ſee,</hi> appeared under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of a man; becauſe it is certain, that they are humane Inventions and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are the matter, whereof under the Proſperity of the Church, this Yoak is compoſed.</p>
                        <p>V. 7. <hi>And when he had opened the fourth Seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living Creature, ſay, come and ſee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 8. <hi>And I looked, and behold a pale Horſe, and his name that ſat on him, was Death, and Hell followed with him, and power was given unto
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108142:86"/>
them over the fourth part of the Earth, to kill with Sword, and with Hunger, and with death, and with the Beaſts of the Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>fallow</hi> or <hi>pale</hi> Horſe, upon which Death and Hell, or the Grave ſat (for the word in the original ſignifies moſt uſually the Grave in Scripture) does very juſtly follow the <hi>red</hi> Horſe with his perſecutions, and the <hi>black</hi> Horſe with his Yoak of Humane Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. It being righteous with God to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and overwhelm thoſe who perſecute his Goſpel; and to pour out the plagues of his vengeance upon them, who prefer mens commands, to his ſacred Laws.</p>
                        <p>The Hiſtory both of the <hi>Church</hi> and of the <hi>Empire,</hi> give ſo many examples of this ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God, partly by the Sword, partly by Famin, partly by Peſtilence, and partly by the inundation of Barbarous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned here by the <hi>Beaſts of the Earth;</hi> that we need ſeek for no other Commentary, in order to the underſtanding of this <hi>fourth</hi> Seal.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Eagle,</hi> which is the <hi>fourth</hi> living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which appeareth at the opening of this Seal, is a preſage of this divine vengeance, foraſmuch as it is a Scripture maxim, that the <hi>Eagles do gather thither where the Carcaſs is,</hi> Matth. 24. 28.</p>
                        <p>And if the plagues of God overtake only a <hi>fourth</hi> part of the Earth, it is an effect of his goodneſs to ſpare the greateſt part, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to invite them to repentance.</p>
                        <p>V. 9. <hi>And when he had opened the fifth Seal,</hi>
                           <pb n="148" facs="tcp:108142:87"/>
I <hi>ſaw under the Altar the Souls of them that were ſlain for the Word of God, and for the Teſtimony which they hold.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 10. <hi>And they cryed with a loud voice, ſaying, how long, O Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not judg and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 11. <hi>And white Robes were given unto every one of them, and it was ſaid unto them, that they should reſt yet for a little ſeaſon, until their fellow Servants alſo, and their Bretheren that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At the opening of this <hi>Seal,</hi> there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth neither <hi>Horſe,</hi> nor <hi>living</hi> Creature, as there did at the opening of the former; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing new here, this Seal being only an Explication of the <hi>Second,</hi> of that of the <hi>red</hi> Horſe, which preſaged the perſecutions of the <hi>Church.</hi> So that this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſtands in no need of an Interpreter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it only repreſents the ſufferings of thoſe, who had been killed for the Word of God, and the Glory wherewith they are crowned in Heaven, together with the efficacy of the voice of their Blood, which cryeth as <hi>Abels's</hi> did.</p>
                        <p>It is nevertheleſs true, that the ſame <hi>Seal</hi> does foretel the ſufferings that were to come, as it had expreſſed the ſufferings that were paſt. For the Martyrs having demanded, <hi>how long Lord ere thou avenge our Blood?</hi> It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered unto them, that <hi>they should yet reſt for a little ſeaſon, until their fellow Servants alſo, and their Bretheren that should be killed as they were,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108142:87"/>
should be fulfilled.</hi> So that as the complaint of the Martyrs, expreſſeth the perſecutions of the <hi>Church</hi> under the Pagan Emperors; the anſwer is a prediction of the ſufferings, which the <hi>Church</hi> was to undergo, under the <hi>Papal Antichriſtian Kingdom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, we may here obſerve, who it is that is a true Martyr, <hi>They are thoſe who are ſlain for the Word of God.</hi> So that this Title cannot be denyed to <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> becauſe it is only out of hatred to their Religion, that they are killed. Nor are they put to death for any other cauſe, but for the Word of God, and for the holding that their Religion is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſupported by a Soveraign and Divine Authority, &amp; full and ſufficient for Salvation. And is not the maintaining the rights and perfections of Gods Word, a maintaining of Gods cauſe? Is it not to die for Jeſus Chriſt, to ſuffer death becauſe they will not conſent to the injuries which the Papiſts do to his Goſpel?</p>
                        <p>V. 12. <hi>And I beheld when he had opened the ſixth Seal, and lo, there was a great Earth-quake, and the Sun became black as ſackcloth of Hair, and the Moon became as Blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 13. <hi>And the Stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth, even as a Fig tree caſteth her untimely Figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 14. <hi>And the Heaven departed as a Scrowl when it is rolled together, and every Mountain and Iſland were moved out of their places.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 15. <hi>And the Kings of the Earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief Captains,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108142:88"/>
and the mighty men, and every Bondman, and every Freeman hid themſelves in the dens, and in the rocks of the Mountains.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 16. <hi>And ſaid to the Mountains and Rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>V. 17. <hi>For the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to ſtand?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There appeareth not here any Horſeman, nor any living Creature, no more than there did at the opening of the fifth Seal; and the reaſon is, becauſe what is concealed under this Seal, extendeth not through the whole courſe of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and of the <hi>Church</hi> of God. Seeing that which is comprehended under this Seal, is only one of the Revolutions that was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. There were <hi>three</hi> changes to overtake it. By the <hi>firſt,</hi> it was to paſs from <hi>Paganiſm</hi> to pure and uncorrupted Chriſtianity. By the <hi>ſecond,</hi> it was to paſs from pure and ſimple <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity mixed and corrupted; which is no other thing but Antichriſtianiſm or Popery. And by the <hi>third,</hi> it is to paſs and return from <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> corrupted, and from Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to a Chriſtianity that is pure, and freed from all the Errors and Superſtitions of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</hi> This laſt change will be under and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the effuſion of the Vials; and the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that was made the laſt Age, is a ſample and earneſt of it. The <hi>Second</hi> was to appear under the <hi>Trumpets.</hi> And the <hi>firſt</hi> was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108142:88"/>
that which came to paſs under this <hi>ſixth Seal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In all the changes, there is ſpoken of the Heaven, of the Sun, of the Moon, of the Stars, of the Sea, of Earthquakes, of the removing of Mountains; becauſe it is the ſtile of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, to expreſs Revolutions which fall out in the world with reference to <hi>Religion,</hi> in terms that agree to a change in the whole Univerſe. Thus the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2. 14. &amp;c. applyeth the Prophecy of <hi>Ioel,</hi> to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment which God begun to give unto the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> by the pouring forth of the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>In that day I will pour out of my Spirit upon all Flesh, and on my Servants, and on my Handmaidens, and they shall propheſy; and I will shew wonders in Heaven above, and ſigns in the Earth beneath, Blood and Fire, and Vapours of Smoak; the Sun shall be turned into darkneſs, and the Moon into Blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis not probable, that the Holy Spirit should omit that memorable change, which befel the Empire when the <hi>Emperors</hi> were no more <hi>Heathen</hi> Perſecutors, but <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Goſpel, which if it be not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under this Seal, there is not the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep or mention of it in the whole <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And withal, that Event doth accord the beſt of the World with this Viſion. For if the Enemies of Chriſts name appear here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonished, deſperate, hiding themſelves in the Mountains, and <hi>crying to the Rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the Wrath of the Lamb;</hi> all
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:108142:89"/>
this accordeth admirably with the Event. For Hiſtory recounts unto us, how the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, fell after a terrible manner upon the five laſt Heathen Emperors, who had perſecuted the Chriſtians with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled rage. <hi>Diocletian</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily laid down the Imperial Dignity, being preſſed to it by the ſole remorſe of their Conſciences, which gave them no quiet. <hi>Maxentius</hi> was thrown headlong from the <hi>Milvian</hi> Bridg into the <hi>Tyber,</hi> and in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place where he had laid an Ambush for <hi>Conſtantin. Maximin,</hi> who had pulled out the Eyes of Chriſtians, loſt his own Eyes by a diſeaſe that was as loathſome as it was pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and <hi>Lieinius</hi> was murthered by the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Theſſalonica.</hi> After that <hi>Conſtantin</hi> was arrived at the Empire, all the Edicts againſt the Chriſtians were repealed; the Chriſtian Religion was eſtablished by publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the Idolatrous Temples were either pulled down, or conſecrated to the ſervice of the true God; their Altars were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; and the Heathens being ſtript of all Honors, were ſent into the Villages, from whence they came to be ſtiled <hi>Pagans,</hi> that is, Inhabitants of the Villages, a Title by which the Chriſtians had been denominated before.</p>

                           <q>After theſe things, I ſaw four Angels ſtanding on the four corners of the Earth, holding the four Winds of the Earth, that the Wind should not blow on the Earth, nor on the Sea, nor on any Tree.</q>
                           <bibl>V. 2.</bibl>
                           <q>And I ſaw another Angel aſcending from the Eaſt, having the Seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four Angels, to whom it was given to hurt the Earth and the Sea.</q>
                           <bibl>V. 3.</bibl>
                           <q>Hurt not the Earth, neither the Sea, nor the Trees, till we have ſealed the Servants of our God in their foreheads.</q>
                        </epigraph>
                        <p>IF thoſe <hi>four Angels</hi> be good Angels, then the withholding the four Winds, muſt be ſomething likewiſe that is good. And that they are good Angels, appeareth from thence, becauſe the Angel that had the Seal of the living God, ſpake unto them as Angels of God. <hi>Hurt not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Earth, neither the Sea, nor the Trees, until we have ſealed the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108142:90"/>
of our God in their Foreheads.</hi> For he doth not ſimply call them the Servants of God, as he would have done, had he been ſpeaking to Angels of Satan, but he calls them the Angels of <hi>Our God;</hi> thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging them for Angels, who toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with himſelf could ſay, <hi>Our God,</hi> which the evil Angels do not ſay, neither can they.</p>
                        <p>We muſt therefore inquire, what good thing this is, that the <hi>with-holding of the Winds</hi> doth ſignify. And without doubt it ſignifies Peace and Tranquillity, foraſmuch as the Wind is that which troubleth the Sea, and agitateth the Air. The <hi>holding of the four Winds,</hi> doth then ſignify an univerſal Peace in the Empire, and in the Church; nor can it be denied, but that there was ſuch a Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, during the Reign of <hi>Conſtantin.</hi> For neither was the Church perſecuted during his Reign, nor was the Empire moleſted with any War, either inteſtine or forraign, after the tragical death of <hi>Licinius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But what damage could an intire and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Peace bring to the Church? It is certain, that ſuch a bleſſing could not directly and of it ſelf, do any hurt; but it produced a great deal of miſchief, by accident, and through the abuſe that was made of it. The calm, which the Converſion of <hi>Conſtantin</hi> procured to the Church, corrupted her. For the Chriſtian <hi>Emperors</hi> having heapt riches and honors upon the <hi>Church,</hi> She became carnal, She opened a gate to Hereſies, to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108142:90"/>
to Idolatry, and to Tyranny; ſo that at laſt She is become that <hi>Babylon,</hi> upon which the Vials of Gods wrath are to be poured forth.</p>
                        <p>This corruption will be ſeen, both in its Birth, in its Growth, and in its Fulneſs under the <hi>Trumpets.</hi> But yet ſo that this general cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Chriſtian Church could not hinder, but that God preſerved a certain number of true Worshippers, as a <hi>Remnant of his Grace.</hi> And this is the Remnant, which the Angel that had the Seal of God, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth unto the other Angels, that he was going to mark, in order to their being preſerved from the general corruption, as ſo many <hi>Lots in Sedom,</hi> and as ſo many <hi>Daniels</hi> in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And that this was not a created Angel, but the Angel who was the Creator, to wit, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, there is no cauſe to queſtion. For he could be no other, than he who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Angel of Gods Council,</hi> Iſa. 63. 9. the <hi>Angel of his Covenant,</hi> Malach. 3. 1. and He who is called <hi>the Eternal,</hi> Gen. 18. 31. It is He indeed who hath the Seal of God, whereby to mark the Elect: and this Seal is the <hi>Holy Spirit, which he giveth unto us,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 24. 1 Joh. 4. 13. that whereby, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>we are ſealed unto the day of Redemption,</hi> Eph 3. 30. So that this Angel can be none elſe but the Son of God, becauſe it is he alone who <hi>ſendeth the Spirit,</hi> Joh. 16. 7. and who <hi>knoweth all the Sheep whom the Father had given unto him,</hi> Joh. 10. 14.</p>

                           <q>And I heard the number of them which were ſealed: and there were ſealed 144000. of all the Tribes of the Children of Iſrael. V. 5. Of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> were ſealed twelve thouſand; of the Tribe of <hi>Ruben, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>WE have in the 16. <hi>Illuſtration</hi> of the <hi>firſt Part,</hi> aſſigned the Reaſon why the Elect are deſigned by the number of 144000. ſo that all which remaineth to be done here, is to enquire why there are twelve thouſand ſaid to be ſealed out of every <hi>Tribe.</hi> And this is <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is the <hi>Stock,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, made up of Gentiles, is the <hi>Graft, inoculated</hi> into that of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Whence it is that Chriſtians are called by St. <hi>Paul, the Iſrael of God, and Iſrael after the Spirit. Iſrael</hi> is the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are the <hi>Children,</hi> who bear their Fathers Name. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to shew, that however impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable the wrath of God againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> may ſeem to be, even after it hath been avenging it ſelf upon them (as I may ſay) for theſe ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108142:91"/>
hundred years; yet he hath not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them, but will one day call them, will take away the Vail of <hi>Moſes</hi> that is upon their heart, and which hindreth them for acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging Jeſus Chriſt, and he will convert them <hi>Joſeph</hi> did not reveal himſelf to his Bretheren the firſt time that he appeared to them. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> carried it after the ſame manner, the firſt time that he came to the Jews. <hi>He came to his own, but his own received him not.</hi> But <hi>Ioſeph</hi> diſcovered himſelf to his Bretheren at the ſecond time, when he came among them; and that interview was full of endearedneſs; his Bretheren continued with him, and had the beſt part of the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> aſſigned them to dwell in. It will be after the ſame manner, when Chriſt shall manifeſt himſelf the ſecond time to the Jews; he will enrich them with the light of his Grace, and heap upon them his bleſſings. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh after one of the Prophets, <hi>There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodlineſs from Iacob, and ſo all Iſrael shall be ſaved, Rom.</hi> 11. 26. The honor which God doth the Children of Iſrael, in deſigning the Elect of God by the names of their Tribes, is a confirmation of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and of the Prophet.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>ſealed</hi> ones, are the ſame with thoſe ſpoken of <hi>Chap. 14. v.</hi> 1. with this difference notwithſtanding, that they are mentioned there, in order to be praiſed for having been faithful to the <hi>Lamb,</hi> while all the inhabitants of the world went after the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> but they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108142:92"/>
are here ſpoken of before hand, in token that they were to be preſerved from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral corruption that was foretold, and which was threatned by the <hi>Trumpets.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They weary themſelves in vain, who go about to ſeek for a reaſon, why there is no mention here of the Tribe of <hi>Dan.</hi> Seeing tho it be not mentioned in this place, yet it is both mentioned, and that firſt in the 48. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where he treats of the new diviſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and in the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which the Prophet makes of the Gates of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom the ſame which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> deſcribes <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. where there is one Gate for the Tribe of <hi>Dan.</hi> This obſervation ſerveth to overthrow all the reaſons, which are alledged for this omiſſion. Nor are we to ſeek for any other reaſon of it, but this, that the Holy Spirit would retain the number of <hi>twelve,</hi> becauſe of a reference to the twelve Apoſtles, as hath been already ſuggeſted in the forementioned <hi>Illuſtration.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And whereas it is ſaid, that the 144000. are ſealed in their Foreheads; that implieth, that the Elect shall make an open profeſſion of the Doctrine of the twelve Apoſtles, who are the twelve Patriarchs of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church. They are in their Hearts ſealed of the Spirit, but outwardly they have no other Mark, ſave that of the profeſſion of the pure Doctrine of the Apoſtles. By the Mark that is in their Hearts, they are known of God; and by that in their Foreheads, they are known of men.</p>

                        <p>THis multitude that could not be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, are the companions of thoſe Souls, who cried under the <hi>fifth</hi> Seal, <hi>How long O Lord, before thou avenge our blood? and white Robes were given unto them; and it was ſaid unto them, that they should reſt yet for a little ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, untill their fellow ſervants alſo, and their bretheren that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled,</hi> chap. 6. v. 10, 11.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Martyrs</hi> are repreſented <hi>innumerable,</hi> and there are <hi>two</hi> reaſons intimated for it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe they <hi>were of all Nations, kindreds, people, and Tongues. 2ly,</hi> becauſe they were <hi>come out of great Tribulation.</hi> And this great Tribulation, is ſo called from the long dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Nor could it be otherway's, for that it was to continue as long as the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom, namely <hi>two</hi> and <hi>fourty months,</hi> or a 1260 <hi>day's,</hi> which are 1260 years, as we shall afterwards ſee.</p>
                        <p>They are repreſented <hi>clothed in white Robes,</hi> as they under the <hi>fifth</hi> Seal were; to intimate both their <hi>dignity</hi> and their Joy. But beſides this, they are repreſented ſtanding before the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108142:93"/>
Throne and before the Lamb, with <hi>Palms in their hands;</hi> whereas they under the <hi>fifth</hi> Seal were repreſented <hi>under</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> and <hi>without Palms.</hi> The reaſon of that difference is this, becauſe under the <hi>fifth</hi> Seal, the Enemies of the Martyrs had the upper hand of them, and perſecuted their memories to that degree, as to dig their bodies out of the ground, and to throw their ashes into the wind, as accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them an abominable crew; whereas in the place of that, theſe here, (their great Tribulation's being finished, and the 1260 years expired, and the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet being caſt into the bottomleſs pit;) are repreſented <hi>ſtanding before the Throne of God,</hi> and <hi>with Palms in their hands,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors over all their Enemies. They shall be acknowledged bleſſed in Heaven; and ſuch who after the End of this Tribulation shall be found on the Earth, walking in their faith, shall Reign with Chriſt a thouſand years.</p>
                        <p>So that the Holy Spirit doth by way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation deſcribe here the felicity of the <hi>Church</hi> of God on the Earth, (whereof we have ſpoken upon the Subject of the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection) that the terrible calamity which is to be repreſented under the Trumpets, might not diſcourage believers, being ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and fortified before hand by a promiſe of the victory, which the Church shall at laſt obtain over her Enemies.</p>
                        <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath promiſed the ſame happineſs to the Church of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For he hath ſaid, <hi>chap. 25. v.</hi> 8. that God <hi>will wipe away
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108142:94"/>
tears from off all faces.</hi> And he hath ſaid <hi>chap. 41. v. 10. that they shall not hunger, not thirſt, neither shall the heat nor Sun ſmite them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis likewiſe to the <hi>Church</hi> made up of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that the Holy Spirit doth here promiſe the ſame felicity. The Terms uſed by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> do equally agree with the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Heaven</hi> for the Souls of the Martyr's; and with the happineſs on <hi>Earth,</hi> for thoſe who shall have part in the firſt Reſurrection, and who shall Reign a thouſand years.</p>

                        <p>Among the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome, Gregory</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> is particularly here repreſented by this <hi>great Star.</hi> And that not only becauſe he was ſtiled great, but becauſe he truly fell from Heaven, through abandoning the care of heavenly things, to purſue and cleave to thoſe of the Earth.

                        <p>The <hi>fall</hi> of this <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> does yet more appear, in that it was he who changed the Service of the Church, into that which from his name is called to this day the <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</hi> 'T was he likewiſe who moſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly equalled the four firſt <hi>Councils</hi> to the four <hi>Goſpels;</hi> and who in his <hi>four Books</hi> of <hi>Dialogues</hi> brought the belief of <hi>Purgatory</hi> into the Church.</p>

The <hi>Smokt</hi> came not all out of the bottomleſs Pit at one and the ſame time, but ſucceſſively and by degrees, anſwerable to the nature of the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> which hath eſtablished it ſelf by fraud and ſubtility.</p>
                        <p>Before <hi>Gregory</hi> I. about the end of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Century, Victor,</hi> upon the ſubject of what day <hi>Eaſter</hi> should be kept, was ſo rash as to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108142:101"/>
excommunicate all the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as if he had been the Soveraign Maſter of all Churches. Upon which account, St. <hi>Ireneus</hi> rebuked him according as he deſerved. <hi>Siri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> condemned the Marriage of Prieſts, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to that end the words of St. <hi>Paul, They that are in the Flesh, cannot pleaſe God;</hi> as if by <hi>being in the Flesh,</hi> the Apoſtle had underſtood the ſtate of Marriage. <hi>Boniface</hi> III. Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of <hi>Gregory</hi> I. challenged the Title of <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Bishop,</hi> which <hi>Gregory</hi> had condemned in <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as the Title of the Forerunner of Antichriſt. <hi>Boniface</hi> IV. conſecrated the <hi>Pantheon</hi> to the Holy <hi>Virgin,</hi> and to all the Saints, which the <hi>Pagans</hi> had dedicated before to <hi>Cibele</hi> the Mother of the Gods. And the Controverſie about the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> grew ſo hot in the eighth Age, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſecond excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the Emperor <hi>Leo</hi> for oppoſing it. In the ninth Age, <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> the Monk of <hi>Corby</hi> was the firſt that taught the <hi>Corporal Preſence;</hi> but <hi>Rathramu</hi> writting againſt it by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bold,</hi> the queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained undetermined. But the Truth beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming darkned by the Smoke that aroſe out of the bottomleſs Pit in the tenth Age, which <hi>Baronius</hi> ſtiles an <hi>Age of Iron and Lead,</hi> and which all Writers acknowledg to have been an <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> it came to be decided in the eleventh Age by <hi>Nicolas</hi> the ſecond. Who made it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to <hi>Berenger</hi> in his <hi>Retractation,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers did not only eat Chriſt <hi>Sacramentally,</hi>

but that he was <hi>really</hi> broken by their teeth. In the ſame Age, <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh made come out of the bottomleſs Pit, theſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions mentioned by <hi>Baronius, Anno 1076. num.</hi> 31. namely, <hi>that the</hi> Pope <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>alone hath Right to be called Univerſal. That all Princes ought to kiſs the Popes Feet. That his name only should be mentioned to the Churches. That he hath an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to depoſe Emperors. That without his command no Council ought to be called General. That no Book, nor Chapter, ought to be held for Canonical, without his Authorisy. That he may diſcharge Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance.</hi> And many other ſuch as theſe, which <hi>Baronius</hi> calls <hi>Dictata Papae</hi> Out of the ſame Pit came forth the Adoration of the Holy Sacrament, under Pope <hi>Houorius</hi> the ſecond. The Feaſt of God, or of <hi>Corpus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti,</hi> under Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the ſecond. <hi>Auricular Confeſſion,</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third.

                           <q>And the Shapes of the Locuſts were like unto Horſes prepared unto battel, and on their Heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.</q>

                        <p>THE <hi>Locuſts</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribes in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> do repreſent in general all <hi>Monks, Fryers,</hi> and that both for their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and for their uſeleſneſs. For we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve at the firſt ſight theſe two qualities in <hi>Locuſts; firſt,</hi> that they are in great number; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that they are unprofitable, and do more hurt than good. Which agreeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to all the <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryers.</hi> But the Holy Spirit had principally in his view the Society of Jeſuites, as the moſt exquiſite and the moſt powerful, and that which maketh greateſt noiſe in the world.</p>
                        <p>Naturaliſts do obſerve, that <hi>Locuſts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in them the properties, or at leaſt the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and ſomething of the shape of <hi>ten</hi> chief <hi>Animals.</hi> (1) The Face of a Horſe. (2.) The Eyes of an Elephant. (3.) The neck of a Bull. (4.) The Horns of a Hart. (5.) The Breaſt of a Lyon. (6.) The Belly of a Scorpion. (7.) The Wings of an Eagle. (8.) The Thighs of a Camel. (9.) The Feet of an Oſtridg. (10.) The Tail of a Serpent.</p>
                        <p>The like may be ſaid of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:108142:103"/>
they comprehend in their <hi>Order</hi> all the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of other <hi>Fraternities.</hi> (1.) They take the vow of Chaſtity. (2.) The vow of Poverty. (3.) The vow of Obedience. (4.) The vow of going to the Turks and Indians in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> (5.) They are Doctors. (6.) They are Preachers. (7.) They are Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. (8.) They are Prieſts. (9) They are Miſſionaries. (10.) They are Caſuiſts.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, that they do not oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any particular abſtinence, as other <hi>Orders</hi> do; but in recompence for this, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever there is among other <hi>Orders,</hi> it is found in the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Jeſuites</hi> in a more eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, which makes them to be diſtinguished from all others. For example, they do ſo take the vow of <hi>poverty,</hi> that there is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any <hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> who hath ſo much <hi>money</hi> as they. Which makes them ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the <hi>Councils</hi> of all Potentates, not only <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but alſo <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> They do ſo vow <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> that there are many of them married in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere, in order the better to compaſs their Ends. They do ſo vow <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> that they may forſake the <hi>Society</hi> after the firſt Vow; and this Right they have by the funadmental Law of their <hi>Order.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whoſoever conſidereth the great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> will not queſtion but that it is their <hi>Society</hi> which is the principal <hi>Scope</hi> of this <hi>Viſion.</hi> For by the <hi>Bulls</hi> of Pope <hi>Pius V.</hi> and of <hi>Gregory XIII.</hi> they enjoy all the priviledges granted to the four <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant Orders.</hi> By another <hi>Bull of Gregory
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:108142:104"/>
XIII.</hi> they do enjoy all the Rights and grants wouchſav'd to all other <hi>Religious Orders.</hi> By a <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Paul III.</hi> they have power to give Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution from all ſins, even without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe that are reſerved to the holy <hi>See.</hi> By another <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Gregory XIII.</hi> they have power to ſing <hi>Maſs</hi> both before day &amp; after it is noon. By another <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Paul III,</hi> it is allowed them to have portative Altars when they travel, that they may celebrate Maſs in all places, even in ſuch as are interdicted by the holy See. By another <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Paul III.</hi> they have Authority to pardon all Sins, to ſuch as shall one whole day in a year pay their devotions in the Churches of the <hi>Society,</hi> tho they ſay but one <hi>Pater Noſter</hi> and one <hi>Ave Mary.</hi> By another <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Gregory XIII,</hi> they are permitted to practiſe phyſick. And which is much more ſingular, the <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> is another <hi>Pope;</hi> being ſtiled by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety the <hi>Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as well as the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf. And upon the day of his Election <hi>he is Adored</hi> as well as the <hi>Pope,</hi> both by all the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> who are preſent at the Election, and by all other perſons who are there aſſiſting, to whom he Vouchſaveth his hand to be ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. So that all this sheweth, that if the H. Spirit hath by the <hi>Locuſts</hi> repreſented the <hi>Monks,</hi> as is extreamly probable, yet he more eſpecially intended the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> as being the <hi>Order</hi> that is moſt priviledged of all, and which hath furtheſt advanced the <hi>Monaſtick</hi> power.</p>
                        <p>But we muſt exactly conſider all that <hi>St.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108142:104"/>
Iohn</hi> hath ſaid of theſe <hi>Locuſts of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> that we may thereby ſee whether it may be reaſonably applied to the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> For if that can be, there will be no room to doubt, but that the <hi>Iejuites</hi> are the <hi>Locuſts</hi> here deſigned.</p>
                        <p>(1) 'Tis ſaid of the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> that they <hi>came out of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> that is to ſay, from Hell: and this doth immediately raiſe in our minds thoughts of the <hi>Society,</hi> whoſe Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy can have no other Author, ſave him who reigneth in the infernal Pit. It appeareth by their licentious <hi>Morality,</hi> that the Name of <hi>Ieſuite</hi> is a prophanation of that <hi>Ieſus.</hi> For they have given the world ſufficiently to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that there are theſe abominable <hi>Maxims</hi> taught in their <hi>Society</hi> and in their <hi>Schools,</hi> whereby it is rendred lawful to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the moſt horrid crimes. Beſides, they maintain a more particular devotion for the holy <hi>Virgin,</hi> than others do; and are the moſt zealous defenders of the Idolatrous worship that is given her in the <hi>Romish Church.</hi> The <hi>Monks</hi> in general are great avouchers of this falſe devotion; but the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> diſtinguish themſelves from all others, by the exceſſes which they practiſe in this unlawful Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; they have for their <hi>Mother Jeſus Maria,</hi> which is a ſolemn declaration of their making that holy and bleſſed Creature, copartner with the eternal Son of God in divine honors. And when it was thought needful a few years ago' to check the Superſtition of the people by-a Book Intituled, <hi>wholſome Advices to the Indiſcreet Worshippers of the Holy Virgin;</hi> it was
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108142:105"/>
a <hi>Ieſuite</hi> that immediately ſtept up to rebuke thoſe who would have reformed that abuſe. Father <hi>Creſſet</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> hath ſignaliſed the Devotion of the <hi>Order</hi> by his Book writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon that occaſion.</p>
                        <p>(2) 'Tis ſaid of theſe <hi>infernal Locuſts,</hi> that they <hi>were like unto horſes prepared for battel.</hi> The Horſe is a warlick Creature. And the Jeſuite <hi>Orlandinus</hi> who hath written the Hiſtory of the <hi>Society,</hi> tells us, that it is <hi>compoſed of Hero's, of ſuch as are the flower of Chivalry, the braves of war, and who are born with casks upon their heads.</hi>

                        <p>(3) 'Tis ſaid of the <hi>Locuſts of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> that <hi>they have on their heads as it were Crowns of Gold.</hi> All <hi>Prieſts</hi> wear a <hi>Crown,</hi> which the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> prefer as much above thoſe of Kings, as Gold is above lead. But that of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> is eſteemed by them, far beyond that of all others. Thence it is that they deſpiſe all <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacies,</hi> only they will put that honor upon the <hi>Cardinals Hat</hi> as not to refuſe it.</p>
                        <p>(4) 'Tis ſaid of theſe <hi>Infernal Locuſts,</hi> that <hi>their faces were as the faces of men.</hi> And are there any in the world, who are more courteous, more meek, more kind, than the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> are in shew and appearance? What ſweetneſs, what humanity, what love appeareth in their Countenances, in their manner and in their language?</p>
                        <p>(5) But it is ſaid, of the <hi>Locuſts of the bottomleſs

pit,</hi> that they had <hi>breaſt-plates of iron.</hi> All who have had to do with the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> know that their hearts are covered with Corſlets. They find by experience that they are as hard and inflexibl' as Iron; and that when their intereſt is concerned, they have neither pity upon Widow nor Orphan.</p>
                        <p>(6) 'Tis ſaid of theſe <hi>Locuſts,</hi> that they <hi>had hair as the hair of Women.</hi> Which ſignifieth the flatteries and carreſſes, by which they cajole thoſe that are young and ſuch as are wealthy. In a word, their adulations are like unto thoſe of women. But in this there is ſomething monſtrous, that after the H. Spirit had given unto the Locuſts <hi>the faces of men &amp; of men of war,</hi> he should alſo give them the <hi>hair of a woman.</hi> Thus theſe Locuſts are of an <hi>Ambiguous</hi> Sex. And there is the like <hi>ambignity</hi> in the <hi>Society</hi> of the <hi>Ieſuites.</hi> 'Tis not known, whether they be <hi>Monks,</hi> or whether they be not. <hi>Paſquier</hi> reports, that upon their being asked by the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> what they were; they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, they were <hi>tales quales,</hi> i. e. they were ſomething between both, they were either the one or the other.

                        <p>(10) 'Tis ſaid of the <hi>Locuſts of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> that <hi>in thoſe days,</hi> i. e. while they Reign, <hi>men shall ſeek for death, and shall not find it, and shall deſire to die, and death shall flee from them.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, that theſe <hi>Locuſts</hi> shall be inſupportable; and that the Evils which they cauſe, shall be beyond all reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and that they shall force the people over whom they have power, to curſe the day of their birth, as <hi>Iob</hi> did when his patience was put upon the utmoſt trial. And it may be ſaid in general, that the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> have impoſed ſuch a <hi>yoak</hi> both upon the publick and upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, that life is become very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:108142:107"/>
and uneaſie. They who know that Famons <hi>Society,</hi> will find nothing that is <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical</hi> in this deſcription; but that every thing is literally true. The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> do by their carriage ſtrangely provoke and enrage men; for while they are officious and adulatory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what one can ſay, they are in the mean time miſchievous and wicked to the higheſt degree. They are the plague of Families and Eſtates, and yet none can ſecure their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Eſtates from them: men dread them, and flee from them, as much as they can; but notwithſtanding all endeavours to avoid them, they are found every where. They inſinuate and intrude into all places, and mingle themſelves in all companies and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Wo to them that truſt them. They are a pot of iron, and in compariſon of whom all others being but earthen pitchers, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid being broken into shivers, if they rub againſt and juſtle with them. But we may aſcribe to the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> the art of giving a home blow, witneſs the invention of the <hi>new perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> whereby all <hi>France</hi> is rendred <hi>Catholick</hi> in three months time, and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are reduced to a condition <hi>of deſiring death.</hi> In all former <hi>perſecutions,</hi> they inflicted death, &amp; men ſought to avoid it: but in this death is deſired, &amp; they refuſe to grant it. In thoſe they made <hi>Martyrs;</hi> but in this they make <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> An Invention worthy of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> who are juſtly eſteemed for great Maſters in hypocriſy.</p>
                        <p>(11) 'Tis ſaid of theſe <hi>infernal Locuſts,</hi> that <hi>they had a King over them, which is the Angel of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:108142:107"/>
the bottomleſs pit, whoſe name in the Hebrew is Abaddon, but in the Greek Appollyon.</hi> The <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> have alſo a King, whom they vow to obey implicitely in all things. This <hi>King</hi> is the <hi>Pope.</hi> The Holy Spirit clearly expreſſeth him by the Term <hi>Abaddon.</hi> For this <hi>Abba</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>Father,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Pope</hi> doth. But the Holy Spirit makes him an <hi>Abaddon,</hi> an <hi>Appollyon,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>deſtroyer.</hi> This King of the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> is an <hi>Idol,</hi> who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all that <hi>worship</hi> him. And this is to <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> him; to believe him <hi>Infallible,</hi> and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him a blind obedience, and which knows no limits.</p>
                        <p>(12) Finally, it is ſaid of theſe <hi>Locuſts of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> that <hi>their power was to hurt men five moneths.</hi> If the Holy Ghoſt had mentioned this only once, we might have thought that it was only a bare alluſion to natural <hi>Locuſts,</hi> which do neither make a noiſe nor do appear ſave from <hi>May</hi> till <hi>September.</hi> But the Holy Spirit not being ſatisfied with the mentioning of it at the beginning of this deſcription of the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> v. 5. but repeating it again at the end, <hi>v.</hi> 10. he do's thereby inform us, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth more than a bare Alluſion, and that he would hereby mark out unto us, the time allotted and preſcribed to the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> for them to exerciſe their power in, and in which they are to be ſo formidable every where in the world.</p>
                        <p>This Time is deſigned by <hi>five Moneths;</hi> which are without doubt of the ſame nature with the <hi>fourty and two</hi> mon'ths, which make
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:108142:108"/>
up the duration of the Beaſts Kingdom, and which shall be proved to be <hi>prophetick</hi> mon'ths, whereof each amounteth to thirty years. According to which expoſition, <hi>five mon'ths</hi> ſigniſie one <hi>hundred and fifty years;</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as five times thirty make 150. 'Tis already more than 150 years ſince the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> have been in the world. But it is not the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that <hi>Society</hi> from its firſt Inſtitution to its End, that is here treated of. That alone which is here intended, is the <hi>Time</hi> that <hi>their power should continue.</hi> And if you ask what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer? I ſay, that <hi>to torment men.</hi> Now they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this power but from the <hi>Pope;</hi> The Pope did not give it unto them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way's than by the <hi>Bull</hi> by which he confirmed their <hi>Society.</hi> Nor was this <hi>Bull</hi> granted till the year 1540, that <hi>Pope Paul III.</hi> Emitted it in the mon'th of <hi>October.</hi> 'Tis in the vertu' of this <hi>Bull,</hi> that the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> have had eſteem, and that they have authority to do all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, that they have done within the bounds of the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom. From whence it may follow, that they shall not be in a condition to <hi>torment</hi> men for above <hi>three</hi> years from this time For being now in the year 1687. there are 147 years run out, ſince the <hi>date</hi> of the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pope Paul</hi> III; So that there ſeem to remain but <hi>three</hi> years until their having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished their five <hi>prophetical Mon'ths,</hi> and until their having exerciſed their power of <hi>Tormenting</hi> men for 150 years.</p>
                        <p>But if any in order to leſſen the probability which is in this conjecture, shall object, that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:108142:108"/>
there have been at leaſt 23. <hi>Bulls.</hi> published in favour of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> from the year 1540 until the year 1598, and that by five <hi>Popes,</hi> namely <hi>Paul</hi> III. <hi>Iulius</hi> III. <hi>Pius</hi> IV. <hi>Pius</hi> V. and <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. and that the <hi>power to Torment</hi> was not given unto the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> at once, but ſucceſſively aud by degrees, each <hi>Bull</hi> advancing their priviledges; And that therefore we cannot define the preciſe time, when this power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, ſo as to be able to determine from thence when it shall end. I anſwer, that none of the following <hi>Bulls,</hi> having derogated in any one priviledg from the firſt <hi>Bull,</hi> it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that we should fix and take up at the <hi>firſt</hi> which was granted in the mon'th of <hi>October</hi> 1540; foraſmnch as it was <hi>that</hi> which eſtablished the <hi>Society,</hi> and which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all the other Bulls.</p>
                        <p>It ſeems impoſſible, either to deſtroy, or to weaken the power of theſe <hi>Locuſts;</hi> in that they have ſo ſtrongly eſtablished themſelves in the <hi>Courts</hi> of all <hi>Princes.</hi> Nor is there any appearance, that <hi>Monarchs</hi> should attempt it, ſeeing they imploy them in their affairs of <hi>State,</hi> as well as in thoſe which relate to their <hi>Conſciences.</hi> But nothing is impoſſible to God, who is the Protector of Kings, and who holds their hearts in his hand. He hath marked out unto the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> the duration of their power. And it shall not exceed <hi>five mon'ths</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, which is the ſame with that of 150 years. It is withal extreamly probable, that God will make uſe of <hi>Kings</hi> for deſtroying the power of the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> as he will ſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108142:109"/>
of them for the ſubverting of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and as he had imploy'd them for the ruin of the <hi>Templers;</hi> who were not near ſo much hated, as the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> are; and whoſe vaſt Revenues was the greateſt reaſon that Princes had, to rid themſelves of them, and to ſeiſe their Eſtates. The Crimes whereof they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, were but in truth a pretence.</p>
                        <p>It may yet be objected againſt this expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the <hi>Locuſts</hi> aroſe out of the <hi>bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit</hi> under the <hi>fifth Trumpet,</hi> and that it is more than <hi>five prophetical Mon'ths,</hi> more than 150 <hi>years</hi> from the <hi>ſounding</hi> of the <hi>fifth</hi> Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to the <hi>Sounding</hi> of the <hi>ſixth</hi> under which we now are. And by conſequence, that the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> are not the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> ſeeing they did not appear till under the <hi>ſixth Trumpet.</hi> So that the <hi>five Mon'ths</hi> of the duration of the power of the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> muſt be ill apprehended and ill explained.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, that if the <hi>two and forty Mon'ths</hi> of the continuance of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Kingdom, amount each of them to <hi>thirty</hi> years, as shall be demonſtrated in its place; we are not to queſtion but that theſe <hi>five prophetick Mon'ths,</hi> being indiſputably ſuch as they are, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute 150 years.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, that there is a great deal more than an <hi>hundred and fifty years</hi> to be allowed for the courſe of the <hi>fifth Trumpet,</hi> to the <hi>ſixth,</hi> under which we live, and under which the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> came into the world. But we laid this down as a foundation at firſt, that all <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryers</hi> are repreſented by the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts,</hi>
                           <pb n="193" facs="tcp:108142:109"/>
as there is no part of the Character of the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> but which agrees to them all. And tho' the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> be riſen above 300. <hi>years</hi> after the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> and the <hi>Iacobins;</hi> yet it doth not follow, that they ought not to be ranked with thoſe <hi>Orders</hi> that ſprung up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſeeing they all make but one Body of <hi>Regulars,</hi> and are all equally both the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Supporters of the <hi>Pope.</hi> And the reaſon why the Holy Spirit had the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> chiefly in his aim, is becauſe they are the accomplishment of this new <hi>Phariſaiſm,</hi> the top of the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> and the laſt as well as moſt powerful Buttreſs of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Empire. Luther</hi> called them in this ſenſe, <hi>ultimus Diaboli crepitus.</hi> Beſides, ſeeing of all the <hi>Fraternities,</hi> that of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> hath had the greateſt power to do hurt, and have done the greateſt damage to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion:</hi> we are not to doubt, but that they are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended in this Prophecy concerning the <hi>Locuſts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Which nevertheleſs is ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the ruin of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> will draw along with it that of all the other <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryers.</hi> For that meaſure of Evil which the whole Body of the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryers</hi> hath done, being conſummated by thoſe miſchiefs, which the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> have added thereunto; partly as <hi>Politicans</hi> in <hi>States,</hi> whoſe councils they have animated; partly in the <hi>Church,</hi> under the quality of <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Directors,</hi> through corrupting the Conſciences of men, and infecting the Air of Religion, by their
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108142:110"/>
damnable Morality; it muſt needs be that the whole <hi>Monaſtick Body</hi> perish at one and the ſame time in reſpect of their power.</p>

                           <q>And the ſixth Angel ſounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, which is before God.</q>

                           <q>And the four Angels were looſed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to ſtay the third part of men.</q>

                           <q>And thus I ſaw the Horſes in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and them that ſat on them, having Breaſt-plates of fire, and of <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>WE do here ſee the growth and progreſs of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun under the <hi>fourth</hi> Trumpet; as we have ſeen under the <hi>fifth</hi> Trumpet the growth of <hi>Popery,</hi> that begun under the <hi>third.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the four Angels that are looſed, the dreadful number of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Breaſt-plates, the Fire, the Smoke, the Brimſtone, the Heads, the Tails, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, the Murders, and in a word, all the particularities which appear under this <hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpet, do evidently shew, that it is the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, and the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire, invaded by the <hi>Turks,</hi> that are here intended. And the reaſon alſo, which is here aſſigned, why that Empire fell into the hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> doth further confirm it.</p>
                        <p>(1.) The <hi>Turks</hi> being ſetled in <hi>Perſia,</hi> they muſt croſs <hi>Euphrates,</hi> before they could
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108142:111"/>
make any conqueſts on this ſide, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves Maſters of that of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, whereof <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was the Seat.</p>
                        <p>(2.) Their Armies appear here to be made up of none, but of Horſe. Thus the name <hi>Perſe</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Horſe.</hi> To which the Holy Spirit did doubtleſs allude. As in the <hi>Viſions</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Grecia</hi> is ſtiled a <hi>Goat,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Grecians</hi> were called <hi>Aegiades,</hi> which is to ſay <hi>Wild Goats.</hi> 'Tis certain that the Holy Spirit does often make alluſions to the names of perſons and of people. And in truth, the <hi>Turks</hi> have often come into the Field, with Armies of two or three hundred thouſand <hi>Horſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(3) The number of <hi>four</hi> is <hi>Myſtical</hi> in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, as the number <hi>ſeven</hi> is in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> When the <hi>Turks</hi> had paſt <hi>Euphrates,</hi> they eſtablished <hi>four Sultanies.</hi> That of <hi>Ceſarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> that of <hi>Aleppo;</hi> that of <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> and that of <hi>Antioch. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> boaſted that he had <hi>four Councellors;</hi> two from Heaven, viz. <hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>Gabriel;</hi> and two from the Earth, namely <hi>Ebubeker</hi> and <hi>Othmar.</hi> There were <hi>four</hi> falſe <hi>Teachers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to the making of the <hi>Alkoran; Iohn</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> an <hi>Arian; Barra</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> a <hi>Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite; Sergius</hi> a <hi>Neſtorian Monk;</hi> and <hi>Solam</hi> a <hi>Iew,</hi> who was an <hi>Aſtroleger. Mahomet</hi> left behind him <hi>four Succeſsors,</hi> whom he called the <hi>four</hi> cutting Swords of God, to wit <hi>Ebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beker,</hi> otherways called <hi>Abdalla, Oſman, Oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> and <hi>Haly.</hi> Which <hi>four Succeſsors,</hi> begot
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108142:111"/>
                           <hi>four</hi> Sects in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion. There are <hi>four Religious Orders</hi> among the followers of that falſe Prophet; the <hi>Gemaliers,</hi> the <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> the <hi>Calenders,</hi> and the <hi>Torlaquis.</hi> In a word, the number <hi>four</hi> is to be found in their <hi>Faſts,</hi> in their <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> in their <hi>Teſtaments,</hi> in their <hi>Marriages,</hi> and almoſt in every thing. Which ſo plainly anſwering to the <hi>four An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels looſed in the Euphrates,</hi> leaves us no room to doubt but that the Holy Spirit had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in this place to repreſent the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, and the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the place of the <hi>Oriental</hi> Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. And foraſmuch as both the name of <hi>fourth,</hi> and that of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> meet in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Grand Seignior;</hi> I do not know but that this <hi>Myſtical</hi> number of his Religion, may preſage his <hi>Empire</hi> to be near an end, and that he shall be the laſt <hi>Turkish Emperor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Breaſt-plates</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> of <hi>Jacinct,</hi> and of <hi>Brimſtone;</hi> denote the groſs darkneſs, and the loathſome ſilthineſs of the <hi>Turkish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> A Religion that can relish with none, ſave ſuch as are ſunk into all ſenſuality, and which could be invented by none, but by thoſe that were prophane and wicked.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Tails like unto Serpents which had heads,</hi> repreſent the <hi>Mahometan Teachers,</hi> clothed with the power of being <hi>Judges.</hi> In the 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah, v.</hi> 15. the <hi>Head</hi> ſignifies a <hi>man</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi> and the <hi>Tail</hi> ſignifies a <hi>falſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</hi> Now the <hi>Turkish Doctors</hi> or <hi>Prieſts,</hi> are the Supream Judges in all cauſes, as well ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil as Religious.

                        <p>(8.) It was upon the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that the <hi>Turks</hi> made all their Conqueſts; and of this the Holy Spirit gives ſuch a reaſon, as might ſerve to open the eyes of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> becauſe it convinceth them of being guilty of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> This accuſation the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do account the moſt ſenſible injury that can be done them; but it is a condemnation that they muſt bear. For ſaith the Holy Spirit, <hi>The reſt of the men that were not killed by theſe plagues, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship Devils, and Idols of Gold, and Silver, and Braſs, and Stone, and of Wood, which neither can ſee, nor hear, nor walk.</hi> At whoſe coſt was it, that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> erected their <hi>Empire?</hi> Againſt whom were they the Scourges of God, for the punishment of their <hi>Idolatry?</hi> It was not againſt the <hi>Heathens;</hi> for there were none ſuch within the whole extent of the <hi>Eaſtern Roman</hi> Empire.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:108142:113"/>
Murders; it is from thence evident that the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who were ſubdued, were <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> and alſo apparent wherein their <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> conſiſted.

                        <p>If it shall be ſaid, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> doth not worship <hi>Devils,</hi> as thoſe mentioned in the Text are ſaid to have done.

The <hi>other</hi> is, the mortification of the flesh by that Law which God hath preſcribed, <hi>of denying our ſelves, and of dayly taking up the croſs. St. Iohn</hi> expreſſeth theſe <hi>two</hi> effects, when he ſaith, that he found the Book <hi>ſweet in his mouth as honey,</hi> and that it made <hi>his belly bitter.</hi>

                        <p>Therefore <hi>Luther,</hi> and all thoſe others, who have travelled in the work of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> have executed the order which the <hi>Angel</hi> gave here to <hi>St. Iohn; Thou muſt Propheſie again before many peoples, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Tongues, and Kings.</hi> The <hi>Term</hi> to <hi>propheſie,</hi> ſignifies not only the foretelling things to come, as if this order had reſpected

only <hi>St. Iohn;</hi> but it ſignifies likewiſe to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, to teach, to preach the Goſpel; in which ſenſe the <hi>word</hi> to <hi>propheſie</hi> is applied in the 1 <hi>Cor. chap. 14. v. 24. &amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>HEre we have repreſented unto us the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> For this is the execution of the Order, which <hi>St. Iohn</hi> had received: <hi>Thou muſt propheſie,</hi> i. e. <hi>thou muſt preach the Goſpel afresh to many peoples, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Tongues, and Kings.</hi> And <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> as hath been obſerved, <hi>repreſents therein all thoſe</hi> whom God was to imploy in that great work.</p>
                        <p>For the Execution of this commiſſion,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:108142:118"/>
there is given unto <hi>St. Iohn a Reed like unto a Rod, and there is an Angel ſaying unto him. Riſe, and meaſure the Temple of God, and the Altar, and them that worship therein.</hi> This <hi>Reed,</hi> is the Word of God, called a <hi>Rod</hi> or a <hi>Scepter, Pſ. 45. v.</hi> 6. and a <hi>Rule, Gal.</hi> 6. 16. Becauſe neither <hi>errors</hi> nor <hi>manners</hi> can be otherway's refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, than by the application of the word of God; which condemneth both Errors and vices, and lay's before us what we ought to believe, and what we ought to practice. As often as the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was Reformed, it was done by the application of no other Rule. <hi>Ioſiah</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> made uſe of no other, no more did <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is here an Alluſion to the 40. <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> v. 5. &amp;c. where the prophet received Order to <hi>meaſure the Temple,</hi> to aſſure him of the deliverance from the Babylonish Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. And <hi>Iews</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are agreed, that the <hi>Temple</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> is not the <hi>Material Temple</hi> of Jeruſalem, but <hi>that of the Meſſiah,</hi> which neither is, nor can be any other, than his <hi>Church,</hi> which <hi>St. Paul</hi> calls the <hi>Temple of the Lord, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 16. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this is the <hi>Temple,</hi> which is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtablished, by the deſtruction of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Babylon;</hi> that ſo there may be a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence between <hi>St. Iohn</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He is commanded to meaſure both the <hi>Temple</hi> aud the <hi>Altar,</hi> becauſe there is nothing in the <hi>Church,</hi> but what ſtands in need of being Reformed. Since all Nations have been made drunk with the Wine of <hi>Babylon;</hi> both Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:108142:118"/>
and manners; Faith and Worship, Head and Members; in a word, every thing ought to be meaſured; every thing ſtands in need of <hi>Reformation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Court without the Temple trodden under foot by the Gentiles</hi> is the Chriſtian <hi>Church,</hi> but become Antichriſtian by its <hi>Idolatry.</hi> The <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Pagans,</hi> are repreſented <hi>treading,</hi> that is frequenting the outward Court of the Temple; becauſe almoſt all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church are borrowed from the <hi>Heathen.</hi> And for this cauſe alſo, it is called the <hi>Court without,</hi> which was no part of the Temple. For the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is not properly the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of our Lord; it is but the outward <hi>Court,</hi> where the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have liberty to come. Whereas it is given in command to leave the outward <hi>Court out,</hi> it is as much as the enjoyning all thoſe who are <hi>meaſured</hi> and <hi>Ruled</hi> by the Word of God, and who are elſewhere called the <hi>Sealed of God,</hi> to withdraw and actually ſeparate from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and to make a Society apart, in order to their worshipping God according to his word. So that is the very ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, with that given Rev. 18. 4. <hi>Come out of Babylon my People.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Babylon</hi> ought to ſubſiſt 42. <hi>Months,</hi> after that the outward Court of the Temple is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they may tread the holy City under foot ſo long; but of that time we shall ſpeak in another place.</p>

                        <p>THEY who by the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>old Teſtament</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> have not hit the meaning of this place. They have not come home to the ſenſe; but they have touched a little on the ſide of it. The word of God is the <hi>Teſtimony;</hi> for it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo called <hi>Pſa. 119. So St. Paul</hi> ſtiles
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:108142:119"/>
alſo the <hi>Goſpel 1 Cor. chap. 2. v.</hi> 1. But they who profeſs the Truth, and are the defenders of it, are properly the <hi>Witneſses</hi> here ſpoken of. They who ſince the birth of <hi>Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> have cried againſt its Errors and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And we muſt obſerve, that theſe <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> are ſtiled alſo <hi>Candleſticks,</hi> which is the <hi>Title</hi> given by Jeſus Chriſt to the <hi>ſeven Churches</hi> is the Epiſtle which he writ to them Rev. 1 20. Nor is it ſtrange that he ſpeaks only of <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> altho he be ſpeaking of a numerous Society, ſeeing in all language both divine and humane great <hi>Bodies</hi> of men do make but one <hi>Myſtical</hi> perſon. Thus the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are conſidered in <hi>Hoſea</hi> as <hi>one Woman.</hi> Thus likewiſe all <hi>ſincere Chriſtians</hi> are ſtiled in the <hi>Revelation</hi> the <hi>Lambs Wife,</hi> and all <hi>falſe Chriſtians</hi> are called the great <hi>Harlot.</hi> And the Hiſtorian <hi>Florus</hi> repreſents the whole <hi>Roman</hi> people as a <hi>man</hi> that had paſt through the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Stages of human life.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are preciſely <hi>two,</hi> neither more nor leſs. They are not <hi>fewer,</hi> that their Teſtimony may be ſufficient; they are not <hi>more,</hi> through an Alluſion to the Hiſtory of the ancient people of God, whoſe conduct had been committed two, to <hi>Moſes &amp; Aaron,</hi> to <hi>Ioſuah</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> to <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Elisha,</hi> to <hi>Zero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> and <hi>Jehashua,</hi> to <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah.</hi> And they are withal ſaid to be <hi>two,</hi> in Alluſion to their <hi>Teſtimony;</hi> the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> which beareth witneſs of Chriſt <hi>to</hi> come; and the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> which teſtiſieth of Chriſt <hi>as</hi> come. They are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:108142:120"/>
ſtiled <hi>two,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> which had ſubſiſted in the Valleys of <hi>Angrogna</hi> and <hi>Piedmont</hi> from the time of <hi>Sylveſter</hi> and <hi>Conſtantin,</hi> became at laſt divided into <hi>two</hi> Branches that are called <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as if you would ſay <hi>Atteſtants</hi> and <hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt the uſurpation of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and theſe <hi>two</hi> are the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make up one and the ſame Body with thoſe that were ſtiled the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Sackcloth</hi> in which theſe <hi>two Witneſses</hi> propheſied for 1260 days, which is the ſame time with that deſigned by 42 <hi>Months;</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the contempt and perſecution, which the Defenders of the Truth underwent all that time, from and by the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> party. Nor was there any kind of injuries and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which was not put in practice, to weary them and to ſtop their Mouths. They were called <hi>Berengarians, Stercoriſts, Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Albigenſes, Leoniſts, Petrobruſians, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricians, Wicliffiſts, Lollards,</hi> &amp;c. as they are now ſtiled <hi>Lutherans, Zuinglians, Calviniſts, Sacramentarians, Hugonots, Hereticks, Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi> &amp;c. And to theſe reproaches, there were added <hi>Fines, Confiſcations, Impriſonments, Banishments, and Condemnations to death.</hi> But if they were treated with that contempt and rage by the <hi>Antichriſtian Church;</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> who hath given them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Meaſure</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> and to leave the <hi>outward Court</hi> of the Temple <hi>out;</hi> will both advance their honor, and avenge the outrages
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:108142:120"/>
that they have ſuffered, when he comes to pour forth the plagues of his wrath upon their perſecutors.</p>
                        <p>The Holy Spirit do's aſcribe unto theſe <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> the vertue and power of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elijab,</hi> of <hi>turning waters into bliod,</hi> and of <hi>shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heaven.</hi> The <hi>Heathens</hi> uſed to accuſe the primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of being the Cauſe of all the Calamities that befell the <hi>Empire.</hi> And in one ſenſe they had reaſon for it, ſeeing the motive to Gods inflicting Civil wars, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and Peſtilence upon them; was to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the <hi>Empire,</hi> for the miſeries that they made the <hi>Church</hi> to ſuffer. The caſe is the ſame in reference to theſe <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> to whom God ſays as he did to <hi>Jeremiah, chap. 5. v. 14. I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wood, and it shall devour them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, whereas theſe <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>two Olive Trees, and two Candleſticks ſtanding before the God of the Earth;</hi> it is an Alluſion to the <hi>4th Chapter</hi> of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> where it is ſaid, that he <hi>ſaw a golden Candleſtick ſtanding between two Olive Trees, which diſtilled down oyl into the Candleſticks.</hi> The Candleſtick there, repreſents the <hi>Church;</hi> and the two Olive Trees, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Zerobabel</hi> and <hi>Iehoshua,</hi> by whom the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was then conducted.

                        </p>
                        <p>But whereas 'tis ſaid, that the Beaſt shall kill the <hi>Witneſses,</hi> when <hi>they have finished their Teſtimony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> this is not to be underſtood <hi>abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as if they were not to be overcome and ſlain, till after the 42 <hi>Months,</hi> or the 1260 days, which the Reign of the Beaſt is to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. But when they are about to finish their <hi>Sachcloath Teſtimony;</hi> and when the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to fall, and when the <hi>Witneſses</hi> appear in ſome degree of honor, through the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation's</hi> being ſupported by publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; then the <hi>Beaſt</hi> growing inraged and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with fury, shall make war with them, overcome them, and kill them.</p>
                        <p>So that this <hi>War,</hi> is different from that which had been during the time of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> propheſying <hi>cloathed in Sackcloth</hi> That is ſaid to have been made againſt them as <hi>cloathed in ſackcloth,</hi> becauſe there was no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign <hi>Prince</hi> who did then protect them, or gave them liberty to bear their Teſtimony.

Come, let us return unto the Lord; he will revive us, and we shall live in his ſight.</hi> And the <hi>Church</hi> being in that Captivity, is introduced ſpeaking in the ſame manner, <hi>Pſal. 85. 6. Wilt thou not, O Lord, revive us again; that thy people may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in thee?</hi> In a word, the <hi>Valley</hi> which <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> ſaw <hi>chap. 37. v.</hi> 1, &amp;c. <hi>covered with bones,</hi> was nothing ſave an Image of the <hi>Jews</hi> being captive in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in truth, the <hi>death</hi> of the Churches in <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. is of a nature anſwerable to the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108142:122"/>
                           <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> that is here promiſed to the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and which ſignifies no other thing but their re-eſtablishment. Which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why 'tis ſaid, that their <hi>Bodies lie unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</hi> For that is as much as to ſay, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> was not able to put them into Graves, becauſe the Favourers of the <hi>Reformation</hi> hindred it, and that they remain unburied, that they may the more readily be reſtored. The change of the Expreſſion in the Text, doth both favour and ſtrongly ſupport this Expoſition. For when the Holy Ghoſt is ſpeaking of their Enemies, he ſaith, that the <hi>Inhabitants of the Earth shall rejoice over the Witneſſes that are overcome and ſlain;</hi> but when he ſpeaketh of thoſe that favour and uphold them, he ſaith, <hi>that they of the people, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and tongues, and Nations, who shall ſee their dead bodies, shall not ſuffer them to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Graves.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But what is that to ſay? <hi>will not ſuffer them to be put into Graves?</hi> For the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it, we are to obſerve all that the Beaſt was to do againſt the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> (1.) It is ſaid, that the <hi>Beaſt shall make war with them.</hi> That is, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Papacy,</hi> shall make war againſt the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> This the Event hath made evident. 'Tis five or ſix and twenty years ſince this war begun. As ſoon as the peace of the <hi>Pyrenees</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, the <hi>Romish Clergy,</hi> and the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> took the field, and begun with the Church of <hi>Montauban,</hi> whoſe <hi>Colledg</hi> and <hi>Senate</hi> they put down. In a few years after, all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:108142:123"/>
in the Kingdom, ſaw themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, and threatned to be deſtroyed by a terrible battery of <hi>Edicts</hi> and <hi>Declarations.</hi> But that they might not make too much noiſe, they fell upon them by degrees, and attack'd them one after another. The firſt aſſault was againſt <hi>Miniſters Habits;</hi> the next againſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexes;</hi> after that againſt the <hi>Bells</hi> in their Temples; then againſt their <hi>Buryings;</hi> next againſt <hi>Children</hi> that had attained to the <hi>age of ſeven years;</hi> then againſt <hi>Midwives.</hi> It would make a large <hi>Volumn</hi> to recount all the <hi>Edicts</hi> and <hi>Declarations.</hi> But their main Engin was the matter of <hi>Summons,</hi> by which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to produce the Titles by vertu of which they enjoyed the publick exerciſe of their <hi>Religion</hi> in their reſpective places. This was a proclaimed War. The Table of Commiſſioners for execution of the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Nantes,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of Juſtice, the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> and the <hi>Council,</hi> were the Field of Battel, where the <hi>Beaſt</hi> appeared fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(2.) 'Tis ſaid, that the Beaſt <hi>overcame the Witneſſes.</hi> This hath been ſeen litterally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, when the Churches were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Liberty of their Worship, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Judgment of the <hi>Commiſſioners;</hi> or by the Sentence of the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> or by Arreſts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> if ſo be that any fled to the <hi>Council;</hi> at laſt, all without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were condemned by the Edict of <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> which repealed that of <hi>Nantes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(3.) 'Tis ſaid, that the Beaſt <hi>shall kill the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:108142:123"/>
Witneſſes.</hi> We have declared already that the death here intended, is a <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> death. Which conſiſteth in this, that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Congregations</hi> are ſuffered no more to aſſemble, neither publickly, nor privatly; and that they are not permitted to read the Word of God, nor any Book of the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> And in this, that all they of that <hi>Religion,</hi> are compelled by the Violence of Souldiers to abjure their belief, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to enter into fellowship with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> except it be ſuch that were able to make their eſcape out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſome Priſoners who hitherto ſtand it out.</p>
                        <p>(4) Whereas it is ſaid, that the <hi>dead bodies of the Witneſses were not buried, becauſe the kindreds, Tongues, People, and Nations would not ſuffer it;</hi> this muſt be ſome mercy and bleſſing that is promiſed unto them, in order to comfort them under their ſtate of death.</p>
                        <p>There is not one thing, which they who are dead, would more deſire, provided they could ſpeak, than to be put into graves, as eſteeming it a favour and an honor. And thence it is that by the Laws of Nations, Traitors and horrid Malefactors, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the honor of burial, and of reſt in a grave. The Spirit of God threatned one of the Kings of Iſrael, <hi>that he should be buried with the burial of an Aſs, Ierem.</hi> 22. 19. which is as much as to ſay, that he should not have the honor of a grave. And if the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had ſaid, that <hi>they who had ſlain the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:108142:124"/>
would not ſuffer them to be buried;</hi> there would have been no cauſe to doubt, but that the denial of <hi>Sepulture</hi> by thoſe murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, were to be expounded as a continuance of their fury, and to be interpreted for an addition of punishment, and for ſomething accounted worſe than death. But ſeeing they are not thoſe who had killed them, and who are deſigned by Inhabitants of the Earth, that would not ſuffer their bodies to be buried; but they are the <hi>Kindreds, Tongues, Peoples,</hi> and <hi>Nations;</hi> it is evident, that it muſt be ſome great benefit, that is procured for them by theſe <hi>Kindreds, Tongues, Peoples,</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> which is obtained in deſpight, and to the great regret of thoſe Inhabitants of the Earth who had killed them.</p>
                        <p>But how is this, that the not being buried, is a benefit and advantage to the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> whom the <hi>Beaſt</hi> had killed, and for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Flocks,</hi> whom the <hi>Romish</hi> Church hath ſcattered? I dare ſay, that before the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> for Repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Nantes,</hi> we could not have conceived, nor have in the leaſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended this State of the <hi>Witneſſes lying dead without being put into Graves.</hi> But that Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action which hath aſtonished all <hi>Europe,</hi> hath reflected ſo much light upon this Article; that I am perſwaded, that as the <hi>death of the Witneſſes</hi> is fulfilled in the extinction of all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches in <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. ſo the State wherein theſe extinguished Churches do now continue, giveth us to ſee the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishement
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:108142:124"/>
of this that is here ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Bodies of the Witneſſes, lying in the ſtreet of the great City, without being put into Graves.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are <hi>three</hi> ſorts of <hi>Catholicks</hi> among the <hi>new Converts.</hi> Some go willingly to the <hi>Maſs.</hi> Theſe are ſuch as have not taſted the good Word of God; Children of this world; Lovers of Earthly things; Ready to become <hi>Turks,</hi> by the ſame way that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Papiſts.</hi> There are others who go not at all to <hi>Maſs,</hi> but abhor it as a prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Supper of our Lord. There are a third ſort who do indeed go, but at the ſame time they teſtify that they do it through being forced, and pray heartily to God, being reſolved to depart the Kingdom if they can find way of eſcape, which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly ſeek for. And the number of theſe being doubtleſs the greateſt, it may be ſaid, that the <hi>Reformed</hi> are not <hi>buried,</hi> becauſe the greateſt part practiſe that which they do, with regret; and have the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and all which doth attend upon it, in the ſame ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency that they had them heretofore. For I do account thoſe who willingly go to <hi>Maſs,</hi> to be <hi>dead and buried</hi> altogether; nor is there any hope of their return. But for thoſe who go with repugnancy and ſorrow, tho they be <hi>dead,</hi> yet they are not <hi>buried,</hi> and there is cauſe to hope that they shall ſuddenly riſe. They are <hi>dead</hi> in the eſteem of thoſe who have compelled them, and who reckon upon them as good <hi>Catholicks,</hi> whom they
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:108142:125"/>
shall in time bring to what they would have them. But they are not <hi>put into Graves;</hi> they are not yet infected; there is ſome hidden ſpark of life in them, which will ſpeedily manifeſt it ſelf. This ſpark of life conſiſteth in the ſorrow they are under, for what they are forced to do, in a more ardent love to their Paſtors than heretofore, and in thoſe prayers which without ceaſing they make unto God for their reſtoration.</p>
                        <p>And to ſay all that I think on this ſubject. So long as there remain of thoſe ſeeming <hi>Converted,</hi> and forced <hi>Catholicks</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> it cannot reaſonably be ſaid, that the pretended Hereſie of <hi>Calvin</hi> is extinguished, or that the <hi>Witneſses are burried.</hi> The <hi>Witneſſes</hi> do yet appear, as Bodies not interred, and expoſed to be ſeen; and are look't upon by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves as <hi>dead;</hi> of ſome they are lookt upon with pity, of others with horror, and of all with miſtruſt. If the <hi>Popiſh Clergy</hi> had been hearkned unto, who are animated by that murdering as well as lying Spirit; we should have ſeen the revival of St. <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew</hi>'s day for the <hi>burying of thoſe Witneſſes,</hi> whom they have killed, and for the final extirpating of the pretended <hi>Hereſie.</hi> For they do ſee, that there is no other way to compaſs their End. Their inclination to Maſſacre appeareth in the cruel treatment which they uſe towards thoſe ſeeming <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi> who to repair the injury they have done, when they come to die, refuſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Popish <hi>Sacraments,</hi> whoſe dead
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108142:125"/>
bodies the Prieſts cauſe to be drag'd along the ſtreets, and thrown on the Dunghils. We may very well ſay, that the rage of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> hath no bounds; ſeeing after they have murdered the Conſciences of theſe <hi>new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi> they perſecute their very Carcaſſes, not only without shame, but without fear of being reproached for their inhumanity. This murdering Spirit which animates the <hi>Clergy,</hi> induceth them to demand of the <hi>King,</hi> or of his <hi>Council,</hi> a general <hi>Maſſacre,</hi> that they may thereby hinder the <hi>Hereſie,</hi> which they have extinguished, from recovering life and ſtrength again. But the <hi>Kindreds, Tongues, Peoples, and Nations,</hi> will not ſuffer, that the <hi>King</hi> should conſent to a <hi>general Maſſacre;</hi> for either the ſeeing the prejudice which that violent Counſel would do to his State, &amp; the advantage which that effuſion of Blood would give his Enemies; or the fearing to provoke his Neighbours againſt him; makes that his Majeſty will not hearken to thoſe Sanguinary Sollicitors for the <hi>burying of the Witneſses.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We are carefully to obſerve the place, where the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are to be <hi>overcome, killed, and left without burial. It is,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>in the Street of the great City.</hi> This obſervation obviates an Objection, that may be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what we have alledged in our affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the <hi>Extinction</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> to be the putting the <hi>Witneſses to death.</hi> For ſome may ſay, <hi>are the</hi> two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes <hi>no other ſave the Reformed Churches in</hi> France. <hi>The Church of</hi> England, <hi>the Churches
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:108142:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the</hi> United Provinces, <hi>thoſe of</hi> Piedmont, <hi>thoſe of</hi> Switzerland, <hi>thoſe of</hi> Germany, <hi>&amp;c. are not all theſe</hi> Churches <hi>of the number of the Witneſſes, as well as thoſe of</hi> France? Yes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt? But neither the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> nor the <hi>Cantons,</hi> nor <hi>Swedland,</hi> nor <hi>Denmark,</hi> nor <hi>Heſs,</hi> nor <hi>Saxony,</hi> nor <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> are <hi>Streets</hi> of the <hi>great City.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> receiveth no Tribute from thence, nor hath he any power in any of them. Neither is there any place, except <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have begun to make the like War, as they have done in <hi>France.</hi> As for <hi>England,</hi> I know not if it may be ſayd, that it is become a <hi>Street of the great City,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Popery's</hi> being reeſtablished on the Throne in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>King,</hi> who declared himſelf a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> upon his coming to the Crown. Nor do I know whether we are not to expect the effect of that ſecret <hi>Plot</hi> of which there hath been a rumor in that <hi>Kingdom</hi> for theſe twenty years, before we can tell whether the prophecy about the death of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> be fulfilled; and before we can particularly determin the time of their Reſurrection. But the word uſed here in the <hi>Greek</hi> do's deliver us from that Entanglement. For the Text not ſpeaking of <hi>places,</hi> but of one <hi>place;</hi> doth thereby ſeem to inform us, that the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are not to be killed any where elſe, ſave in that <hi>place</hi> or <hi>Street</hi> which the <hi>Text</hi> doth deſign. Which ſeems beyond all contradiction to be <hi>France,</hi> in that we ſee the <hi>Witneſſes Killed</hi> there, &amp; <hi>not put into Graves.</hi>

                           <q>And after three day's and an half, the Spirit of Life from God entred into them; and they ſtood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which ſaw them.</q>

                        <p>IF the 1260 <hi>Days</hi> ſignify 1260 <hi>Years,</hi> as shall be proved in another place; then there is no reaſon for the underſtanding the <hi>three days &amp; an half</hi> wherein the <hi>Witneſſes lie dead</hi> for three Natural day's. So that it is <hi>three years and a half,</hi> that the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue dead, and without being put into Graves. After which time they shall riſe, and shall aſcend into Heaven.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="228" facs="tcp:108142:127"/>This <hi>Reſurrection and Aſcention of the Witneſſes</hi> doth import <hi>two</hi> things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches</hi> shall be <hi>reeſtablished,</hi> and that in ſuch a manner, that the hand of God shall ſignally appear in it, becauſe there is none beſides God who can raiſe the Dead. <hi>2ly,</hi> That they shall be <hi>ſetled</hi> in a more <hi>Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious State,</hi> than they were before; even as the life which Chriſt had after his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſurpaſſed that in glory which he laid down on the Croſs. That is the meaning of the Alluſion, which the Holy Spirit maketh here to the Reſurrection and Aſcention of our Saviour, while he is ſpeaking of the reeſtablishment of the <hi>Church.</hi> Becauſe their death was in this like unto that of Jeſus Chriſt, that they were killed and extinguished by <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, even as our Lord was. For this is a Fact as remarkable as it is notorious, that they are the <hi>Prelates</hi> who have let looſe the Kings <hi>Troops</hi> againſt the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and that they are the <hi>Curates</hi> who have removed them from ſuch of the Reformed as have come to begg it under promiſe of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring their Religion. So that the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> bearing ſo great a reſemblance to the death of Jeſus Chriſt, their <hi>Reſurrection</hi> shall alſo reſemble his.</p>
                        <p>All that is here ſaid concerning the reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of the Proteſtant Churches, is to be conſidered with attention. (1) 'Tis ſaid, <hi>that the Spirit of life from God entred into the Witneſſes.</hi> This <hi>Spirit of Life,</hi> is certainly ſet in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that <hi>Spirit of Death,</hi> which killed them.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:108142:127"/>
Now what was that which killed them? It was the fear of men, the dread of miſery; apprehenſion that they should never ſee an End of their torments, and the Violence they were under from the Soldiers. It was that fallacious and enſnaring Reaſoning, which they every day heard from the Mouths of their perſecutors. <hi>Stand out as long as you pleaſe; When we have devoured you to the bone, you muſt at laſt obey. Flatter not your ſelves with hope of any eaſe; the King will not ſuffer himſelf to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. He who could take</hi> Cambray <hi>and</hi> Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, <hi>will he be withſtood by a</hi> Hugonot Dog? <hi>Nor shall ye be ſuffered to depart the Kingdom. What fools are ye to ſuffer your ſelves to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured? ye may be eaſed of the Dragoons, by the bare ſaying of one word. Say only,</hi> I do obey the King, <hi>and for the reſt you may believe as you will. Do you think, that the King would have you dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? He purpoſeth to reform the Church of</hi> France, <hi>as ſoon as he hath reduced and united all his Subjects. Do ye not know what he hath done already againſt the Court of</hi> Rome? <hi>You will ſuddenly ſee other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Will you be they after all, who shall alone make head againſt the King; and rob him of the Title of Conqueror and of Victorious. Do you not ſee that all do ſubmit; that young and old, poor and rich, Noble and Ignoble, Learned and Ignorant, throughout the whole Kingdom do comply?</hi> This was that <hi>Spirit of Death</hi> that entred into the <hi>Witneſses.</hi> It was this blaſt or tempeſtuous Wind, that hath ſcattered and overthrown all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches of <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in probability, the <hi>Spirit of life from
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108142:128"/>
God</hi> that shall <hi>enter</hi> into the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> will be a way of Reaſoning that is contrary to this. For example; <hi>what have we done, unhappy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that we are? How great is our crime? We are gone over to a Religion that cannot be good; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as its Miniſters, Bishops, and Prieſts have let looſe the Kings Troops upon us, and that it is they who are the Authors of all the robberies, violences, blaſphemies, and impieties, which the Souldiers have committed in order to pervert us. And ſeeing the Bishops and Prieſts will have forced Conſciences, they cannot be the Miniſters of God, who requireth the heart, and a willing people. Nor can they be the Miniſters of Chriſt, becauſe they have taken from us the only means of Inſtruction by depriving us of the Holy Scriptures, together with all Books tending to piety. What can that Religion be worth, which reduceth the whole of Religion to the Maſs, where we underſtand nothing, and where our Eyes are filled with certain ceremonies, of which we comprehend nothing, ſave that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship an object in which we ſee nothing that is Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and where they commit that affront againſt the Son of God, as to hale him from his throne of glory, to put him into the hands of wicked perſons, and into the Mouths of blaſphemers. Can that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be good where we hear not a Sermon, wherein they do not demand the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit but by the interceſſion of the bleſsed Virgin; which is both a plain Idolatry, and expreſly condemned by thoſe words of our Saviour;</hi> I will pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he shall ſend you the comforter; and no man cometh to the Father, ſave by me. <hi>Beſides, they do perform nothing of what

they promiſed us. We are not ſuffered to believe as we would. They have not Reformed one abuſe. They give us no reſt, neither as to our bodies, nor as to our Conſciences. They joined fraud to violence, which are the two Characters of Antichriſt, whereby to ſeduce us. Come, let us give glory to God. Let us depart out of</hi> Babylon. <hi>God will bleſs our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and either deliver us out of our captivity, or give us ſtrength to glorify him by our ſufferings.</hi> This in all likelyhood, is the <hi>Spirit of life from God,</hi> that after <hi>three years and a half</hi> will <hi>enter</hi> into the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(2) 'Tis ſaid, that the <hi>Witneſſes ſtood upon their feet.</hi> This is as much as to ſay, that they shall come to acknowledg their crime; shall forbear to go to the <hi>Maſs;</hi> that they shall take courage; that their zeal shall revive; that they shall Serve God according to his Word; that they shall aſſemble firſt in ſecret, then publickly, without fearing any more either the <hi>Bishops,</hi> or the <hi>Curates,</hi> or the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> or the <hi>Dragoons,</hi> or <hi>Miſery,</hi> or <hi>death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(3) 'Tis ſaid, that <hi>great fear fell upon them which ſaw them.</hi> We are not to doubt, but that the Holy Spirit do's by <hi>them that ſaw them</hi> underſtand, the Authors and Executioners of the <hi>perſecution.</hi> For the other <hi>Papiſts</hi> have ſcarce medled in it.

                           <hi>fear will fall,</hi> when they shall come to ſee the ſcattered congregations gather again. Nor shall they recover from that dread, becauſe the <hi>Court</hi> will be no more inclined to hearken to them; but on the contrary, all that will be done there, shall tend to the mortifying of them, and to the re-eſtablishing the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                        <p>(4) 'Tis ſaid, that the Witneſſes <hi>heard a great voice from heaven, ſaying, come up hither; and that they aſcended in a cloud.</hi> I am much deceived, if this doth not ſignify, that God, who is the Maſter of hearts, shall change the heart of the <hi>King</hi> and of his Council, and that we shall ſee a Revolution in <hi>France,</hi> of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary nature to what hath been ſeen in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> As in the year 1685<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſaw <hi>Popery mount</hi> into the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>great Brittain;</hi> ſo after the <hi>three years and a half</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> lying dead, we shall ſee the <hi>Reformed Religion get upon the Throne in France.</hi> We have not been much ſurpriſed to ſee the re-eſtablishment of <hi>Popery</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe it is long ſince it was known what judgment the <hi>Duke of York</hi> was of; but we shall be extreamly ſurpriſed at the re-eſtablishment of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>France,</hi> becauſe we know the <hi>King</hi> to be of oppoſite Sentiments to them. But as it is the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> who contributeth moſt to the Glory of the <hi>Papacy;</hi> So it shall be the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> that shall contribute moſt to its ruin. It was a <hi>Louis</hi> XII who in the laſt age threatned to deſtroy the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Babylonis nomen.</hi> And it shall be a <hi>Louis</hi>
                           <pb n="233" facs="tcp:108142:129"/>
who will execute the threatning of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous King. The God of heaven and Earth, the King of Kings, who has the hearts of Kings and of people in his hand, raiſeth in us this hope, becauſe it is further added in the Prophecy:</p>
                        <p>(5) <hi>That the ſame hour there was a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and the tenth part of the City fell.</hi> It may be doubted whether this <hi>Earthquake</hi> may come to paſs according to the letter. But it is moſt certain, that <hi>Earthquakes</hi> in ſcripture, ſignify great alterations that fall out in States. And to bring no other example ſave one that relates nearly to this matter. Whoſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members that <hi>Earthquake</hi> which was in <hi>France,</hi> when the <hi>King</hi> returned from the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renees</hi> after the Treaty of Peace and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of his Marriage; and conſiders the great alterations which have ſince fallen out in that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> not only in reference to <hi>Religion,</hi> as well <hi>Popish</hi> as <hi>Reformed,</hi> but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Juſtice, to Policy, to the Finances, and to War; will no longer queſtion, but that the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> which is to be after the <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> have lyen <hi>three days and a half dead,</hi> doth promiſe as ſurpriſing a change in <hi>France</hi> as to all thoſe regards, and an alteration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all the world will be contented, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Monks,</hi> and the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites.</hi>

                        <p>Some will doubleſs ask, what reaſon I have to underſtand <hi>France,</hi> rather than any other Kingdom, by this <hi>tenth part of the City, which is to fall after the Eartquake?</hi> My reaſons
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:108142:130"/>
are theſe. (1) I preſuppoſe that the <hi>City</hi> here ſpoken of is <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the <hi>Papal</hi> Empire, or the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, which is the Empire of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> This Truth we have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. (2) I preſuppoſe that <hi>France</hi> is <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>ten</hi> Horns of the Beaſt; <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>ten</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms that were to be formed out of the ruins of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, according to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and which was to begin at the ſame time with the Beaſt, according to <hi>St. John,</hi> that is, to begin with the <hi>Papal</hi> Empire. This is evident in Hiſtory. (3) I preſuppoſe <hi>France</hi> is one <hi>Street,</hi> and one part of the <hi>City,</hi> i. e. of the <hi>Papal</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Nor can any deny but that the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, or the Church of <hi>France</hi> ſtiles it ſelf by the Title of the <hi>Catholick Apoſtolick Roman Church;</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> Reigns there over what is called <hi>Spiritual;</hi> that he hath there his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> and <hi>Agents;</hi> that he receiveth <hi>Annates</hi> from thence; and that there is no <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> or <hi>Bishop</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> but who receives his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Authority from the <hi>Pope.</hi> (4) I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>France</hi> is the moſt beautiful and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Kingdom</hi> of all thoſe Kingdoms which are Tributary to the <hi>Pope.</hi> They do ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it, by calling the <hi>King</hi> of France the <hi>moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> and the <hi>eldeſt Son of the Church.</hi> And it is worthy of remark, that even in <hi>St. Johns</hi> time, <hi>France</hi> was by way of excellency ſtiled the <hi>Province;</hi> becauſe of all the Provinces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>France</hi> which was then called <hi>Gaul,</hi> was the beſt and the moſt powerful. This is ſo certain, that the name do's yet remain, and is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:108142:130"/>
to the <hi>Southern</hi> part of <hi>France,</hi> which is ſtiled <hi>Province,</hi> from the latin, <hi>Provincia.</hi> It being therefore ſaid in the Text, that the <hi>tenth part of the City fell;</hi> the Holy Spirit did queſtionleſs intend by that expreſſion, the moſt excellent part of all? So that it is from thence very natural to underſtand <hi>France</hi> by the <hi>tenth part of the City. Laſtly,</hi> we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved, that it is not ſaid that the <hi>two Witneſses</hi> were killed, and that they lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried in the <hi>places</hi> or <hi>Streets,</hi> in the <hi>plural</hi> number, but in the <hi>Street</hi> of the great City, in the <hi>ſingular;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, a <hi>Popish</hi> Kingdom marked out by way of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. And therefore ſeeing the Holy Spirit had the moſt excellent of all the Popish King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in his Eye; and ſeeing we have ſeen the death, which in ſo ſurpriſing a manner hath befallen the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in France; we may without any difficulty conclude, that it is <hi>France,</hi> which is this <hi>tenth part of the City that is to fall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(6) 'Tis ſaid, that the <hi>tenth part of the City shall fall.</hi> This may at the firſt view appear a dreadful prediction againſt <hi>France.</hi> But yet it is not ſo. For we muſt obſerve, that this threatning, is not as it would at firſt ſeem, denounced againſt the <hi>tenth part</hi> of the City, but againſt the <hi>City</hi> it ſelf. Becauſe as that is the alone cauſe of the death of the <hi>two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> ſo that is alſo the object of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. 'Tis then the <hi>City,</hi> the <hi>Papal Kingdom,</hi> which is to receive a terrible loſs, by the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away of <hi>France.</hi> Whereas <hi>France</hi> it ſelf
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:108142:131"/>
will increaſe both its ſtrength and Glory, by that falling off and withdrawing. So that upon the whole, I do not doubt, but that it is the converſion of that beautiful Kingdom, which is promiſed in this place.</p>
                        <p>And that which confirmeth me the more in this conjecture is what followeth, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>there,</hi> i. e. in <hi>the tenth part of the City,</hi> which was to fall by an Earthquake, there shall <hi>be ſlain of men ſeven thouſand, and that the remnant shall be affrighted, and give glory to God.</hi> In which words we have two Events repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto us, whereof the one is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the other; both of them worthy of obſervation. The <hi>one</hi> is an effect of the <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> of God; the <hi>other</hi> an effect of his <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> event, is the death of <hi>ſeven thouſand names of men.</hi> Which is a figure, where ſeven thouſand <hi>names of men,</hi> are put for ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>men of name,</hi> that is, of quality, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and dignity. Theſe <hi>Men of Name</hi> are doubtleſs, either the <hi>Doctors,</hi> who make a great deal of noiſe in <hi>France,</hi> in the <hi>Sorbone,</hi> in the Society of the <hi>Oratory,</hi> in the Society of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and among the <hi>Clergy;</hi> or elſe perſons of quality, who are diſtinguished from others by their birth and by their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. The Number of <hi>ſeven thouſand,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes an indefinite number, but very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. And the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>theſe men,</hi> will be a death parallel to the Death of the <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> that ſo like may be returned unto them for like. For that the <hi>ſame</hi> shall be rendred unto <hi>Babylon,</hi> which She rendred unto <hi>Sion,</hi> is both
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:108142:131"/>
threatned in the Propheſies of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and in the Revelations of <hi>St. John; Iſa. 14. 6. Rev.</hi> 18. 6.</p>
                        <p>Not that theſe <hi>ſeven thouſand men,</hi> shall be compelled by the fury of Miſſionary <hi>Dragoons</hi> to abjure <hi>Popery,</hi> and to embrace the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> Religion. For that is not the way by which the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion planteth it ſelf in the hearts of men. That is a method only ſutable to the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion, and to the <hi>Mahometan.</hi> But the meaning is, that they shall no more dare to write, or to ſpeak in favour of <hi>Popery</hi> againſt the <hi>Reformation;</hi> that their Societies shall be put down, and that they shall banish themſelves out of the Realm, upon their not finding it to be their intereſt to continue; all which will be a death unto them. But we may take the words of the Text litterally and without a Figure. Seeing there shall be killed ſeven thouſand <hi>names of men,</hi> that is, there shall be no more of that kind of <hi>Doctors</hi> who are diſtinguished by their <hi>Societies</hi> and <hi>Fraternities,</hi> no more <hi>Monks,</hi> no more <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and it may be no more <hi>Arch-Bishops,</hi> no more <hi>Abbots,</hi> and no more <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals</hi> in the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                           <hi>Event</hi> marked in the Prophecy, is <hi>that the remnant shall be affrighted by the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and aſcention</hi> of the Witneſſes; i. e. by ſeeing the reeſtablishment of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, and <hi>shall give glory to God.</hi> Which queſtionleſs denoteth unto us the converſion of all thoſe people, who belong to <hi>France.</hi> For there is nothing by which God is more eminently glorified, than by the converſion
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:108142:132"/>
of men. And that expreſſion of their <hi>giving glory to the God of Heaven,</hi> deſerveth to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked. Why is it not ſaid, they shall give Glory to God; why <hi>to the God of Heaven?</hi> This beyond all contradiction, ſtrikes at them who put themſelues in the place of God. Every one knoweth the Station, which the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> hold in all parts of the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom. They make a God of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and of the <hi>Church,</hi> both in aſcribing to them the glorious Attribute of being <hi>Infallible,</hi> which appertaineth to none but to the <hi>Deity;</hi> and in making the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But this is a perishable Divinity, a <hi>God of the Earth,</hi> a <hi>falſe God;</hi> from which men shall turn to the <hi>God of Heaven,</hi> the living and true God, whoſe Word shall then be the alone Foundation of Faith. 'Tis well known how they have made the <hi>great Louis</hi> a God, through their compelling <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to change their <hi>Religion,</hi> for this only reaſon, becauſe it was <hi>the Kings Will</hi> to have it ſo. But affairs will alter; and all <hi>France</hi> shall give Glory to the God of Heaven. They shall give to <hi>Ceſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Ceſar's;</hi> but not the things which belong to <hi>God.</hi> Yea <hi>Ceſar</hi> himſelf shall give glory to the <hi>God of Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If what we have ſaid in reference to the Reſurrection of the <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> and of that which is to enſue thereupon, be no more than a Conjecture, as we will give it no other Title; yet it may be affirmed, that it is a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:108142:132"/>
conjecture accompanied with great probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that there is ſome Foundation for it. For if we dare not ſay, that St. <hi>John</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the Event, which is actually come to paſs; we may ſay, that ſuch a thing is fallen out, which may be called both the <hi>death of the two Witneſſes,</hi> and their <hi>lying without being put into Graves.</hi> Seeing what we have ſeen befall the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> does exactly anſwer to the Terms of the prediction. And if the death of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> be what we have explained it; then it cannot be denied, but that all which we have ſaid in reference to their Reſurrection, is a conjecture that hath a Foundation and a probability.</p>
                        <p>As to the Time when we are to ſee their Reſurrection; there is no doubt but that we are to reckon from the period, at which their death fell out. And it may be ſaid with great appearance of truth, that the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Fontain bleau,</hi> which repealed that of <hi>Nantes,</hi> (that was the Foundation of the Liberty of the <hi>Reformed</hi>) was the fatal ſtroke which gave the <hi>Witneſſes their death.</hi> For the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bleau</hi> declareth that of <hi>Nantes</hi> to be now uſeleſs, ſeeing there remain but few <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> to be converted to the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> and they hope theſe will be ſoon reduced as others have been. Foraſmuch then as the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> of <hi>Fontain bleau</hi> was regiſtred towards the end of <hi>October,</hi> 1685. and that it ſpeaks of the extinction of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> (which was that foretold by St. <hi>John</hi> under the death of the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi>)
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:108142:133"/>
as a thing done, and that what remained of them were not to be reckoned upon; we may then very probably ſay, that upon coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>three years and a half</hi> from the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>October,</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> shall again riſe, and the <hi>Reformed</hi> shall be re-eſtablished.</p>

For the pouring out of the ſeven <hi>Vials</hi> is to be followed with the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that is to be followed with the converſion of all <hi>Nations,</hi> and with the Reign of a 1000. years.

                        <p>Nor do the 24.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:108142:134"/>
no way's agreeth to the <hi>laſt Judgment,</hi> when all <hi>Kingdoms</hi> shall come to an End.</p>
                        <p>We muſt therefore by the Term <hi>Dead,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>Church</hi> of God, but as <hi>afflicted</hi> by reaſon of the War which the Beaſt was to make againſt her for the ſpace 1260 years, ere he came to be deſtroyed. For <hi>Afflictions</hi> are in the Scripture ſtiled a <hi>death,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 10. and 2 Cor. 11. 23. And by the Term to <hi>judg,</hi> we are to underſtand to deliver. In which ſenſe <hi>David</hi> ſay's to God, <hi>Pſ. 35. v. 24. Judg me according to thy rightoouſneſs,</hi> that is, deliver me, becauſe he addeth, <hi>and let not mine Enemies rejoice over me.</hi> To which purpoſe there are many other places in the Scripture. Becauſe therefore the <hi>Church</hi> shall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from all her <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> at that time when <hi>Babylon</hi> comes to be deſtroyed, and the Kingdoms of this world brought in to Jeſus Chriſt; it is here ſaid upon the arrival of theſe two great Events, that <hi>the Dead shall be judged.</hi>

                        <p>But if we have a mind to retain the natural ſignification both of the Term <hi>Dead,</hi> and of the Term <hi>judged;</hi> the ſenſe will be, that when <hi>Babylon</hi> shall be deſtroyed, and the Kingdoms of this world converted to Jeſus Chriſt; then the <hi>Martyrs</hi> shall be <hi>judged,</hi> and have juſtice done them through the whole extent of the <hi>Papal</hi> Empire. Whereas they are now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of as damned <hi>Hereticks,</hi> they shall be then reckoned and eſteemed bleſſed, and to have died true <hi>Martyrs.</hi> So that this is exactly the firſt Reſurrection, whereof we have
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:108142:134"/>
ſpoken in the <hi>Illuſtration</hi> about the thouſand years, and of the judgment which is there mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>opening of the Temple,</hi> which this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet promiſeth, accordeth fitly with the Senſe that we have given. Under the Reign of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> when the Apoſtacy was Univerſal, the Temple was shut. But when a Reformation came to be made by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the firſt thing that was done, was the <hi>opening</hi> of the <hi>Temple, 2 Chron.</hi> 29. 3. Thus the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi> Temple, which had been shut up under the Reign of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> shall be <hi>opened,</hi> and the worship of God shall be reſtored. And which is worthy of our obſervation, 'tis not ſaid that a <hi>new</hi> Temple was built, but that the <hi>ancient</hi> Temple was opened. So that the <hi>Church,</hi> which is the <hi>Myſtical</hi> Temple, hath in deſpight of the attempts of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> alway's ſubſiſted. That which we are to ſee in the great and general <hi>Reformation,</hi> which the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet</hi> promiſeth, is not a <hi>new</hi> Church, but a re-eſtablishment of the <hi>old.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Ark,</hi> which was ſeen at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Temple; it may be either conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a <hi>figure of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> or as <hi>containing the two Tables of the Law of God.</hi> With reſpect to the <hi>firſt;</hi> the <hi>ſight</hi> of the <hi>Ark,</hi> ſignifies that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who had been obſcured during the Reign of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> through an addition of copartners with him both in offices and in the work of Redemption, and through the joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning another ſacrifice to that of his death, shall be perfectly revealed to all the world as
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:108142:135"/>
the word repreſents him, when once the Kingdoms of the Earth are converted and brought in. With reſpect to the <hi>ſecond;</hi> the <hi>Sight</hi> of the <hi>Ark</hi> ſignifies, that the Word of God, the reading whereof had been forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as of a Book dangerous and hurtful to Salvation, shall be put into all mens hands, and every one shall be allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, and have full liberty to read it and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon it.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the <hi>Sight</hi> of <hi>this Ark,</hi> does alſo fore-tell and promiſe the <hi>Converſion</hi> of the <hi>Iews.</hi> For the <hi>Ark</hi> having been loſt ſince the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in <hi>Babylon</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees;</hi> the <hi>Sight</hi> of <hi>it</hi> do's promiſe, that when Gods people shall be delivered out of <hi>Antichriſtian Babylon,</hi> that the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be converted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>opening</hi> of the <hi>ſame Temple</hi> is ſpoken of <hi>chap. 15. v.</hi> 5. as we have obſerved in the <hi>20th Illuſtration</hi> of the <hi>1ſt part.</hi> But there are <hi>two</hi> differences between the opening of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that place, and the opening of it in this. <hi>One</hi> is, that the <hi>Ark</hi> doth not appear <hi>there,</hi> as it doth here; becauſe at the <hi>firſt</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the <hi>Iews</hi> were not Converted, as they shall be at the <hi>ſecond</hi> The <hi>other</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Smoke</hi> that proceeded out of the Temple upon the firſt opening of it, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all from coming into it, becauſe the <hi>time</hi> of the converſion of all Nations was not then come; whereas upon the opening of it now, and that <hi>time</hi> being come, there is mention of no <hi>ſmoke</hi> whereby any should be indred to enter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="245" facs="tcp:108142:135"/>Finally, the <hi>Lightnings,</hi> the <hi>Voices,</hi> the <hi>Thundrings,</hi> and the great <hi>Hail,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied this opening of the Temple; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the <hi>third Wo,</hi> which was not to arrive till under the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> and which deſign nothing elſe ſave the judgments that are to be inflicted through the pouring out of the <hi>Vials.</hi>

                           <hi>XXVI. ILLUSTRATION.</hi> Of the Pouring out of the Vials.
<bibl>REV. CHAP. 16.</bibl>
                        </head>
                        <p>THere are ſome who think the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> is poured forth, and conſequently that the <hi>four</hi> firſt are likewiſe poured out; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that conformity which ſeems to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear betwixt the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> that denounceth <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> that is to ſay, ſome great diſaſter to the <hi>Seat of the Beaſt,</hi> and between that which befell the <hi>Papal</hi> Empire, from the time of the great <hi>Schiſm,</hi> till the time of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which put an End to that Schiſm. Seeing the <hi>Seat of the Beaſt</hi> was during that whole time as it were <hi>ſmitten,</hi> and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was become full of <hi>darkneſs,</hi> through the great <hi>decay</hi> of the <hi>Papal Authority,</hi> which Decay of Authority was much increaſed by the <hi>Reformation</hi> that begun under the Popedom of <hi>Leo X.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this Reaſon is not of that ſtrength, as
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:108142:136"/>
to perſwade me, that the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> was at that time poured out. Foraſmuch as the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſignified by <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> which befell the <hi>Papal Empire</hi> through the <hi>Reformation</hi> begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> hath not been ſo great as to anſwer fully the force of the <hi>Terms</hi> uſed in reference to that <hi>Vial,</hi> namely, that the <hi>Kingdom of the Beaſt was full of darkneſs, and they gnawed their tongues for pain, Rev.</hi> 16. 10. Beſides, it was only the <hi>Seat of the Beaſt,</hi> it was the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> which is the <hi>Beaſts Seat,</hi> that was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by <hi>Luthers Reformation;</hi> but the <hi>Papal Kingdom,</hi> was not ſo afflicted; on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, great part of that Empire rejoiced at the <hi>Reformation.</hi> Whereas it is to be obſerved, that it is not ſaid that the <hi>Seat of the Beaſt,</hi> but that <hi>the Kingdom of the Beaſt,</hi> was <hi>full of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> So that the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> doth as once threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten both <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>its Empire</hi> with another Affliction that shall befall them; when the general <hi>Reformation</hi> shall be accomplished; when all the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Nations shall come to be delivered from the <hi>Papal</hi> Tyranny, and to be perfectly inlightned with the Light of the Goſpel. And therefore the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> is not poured out, nor by conſequence the <hi>two laſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Tis expreſly ſaid, <hi>chap. 15. v.</hi> 1. that the <hi>Seven Vials, are the ſeven laſt plagues, and that by them the wrath of God is conſummated.</hi> Now againſt whom is it conſummated? Without doubt, it is againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> againſt <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Papacy,</hi> againſt the Kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> And the wrath of God cannot be ſaid to be
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:108142:136"/>
conſummated, until that prophecy, <hi>chap. 18. v.</hi> 20. be fulfilled; <hi>Rejoice over her, thou Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ye Holy Apoſtles and Prophets; for God hath avenged you on her. And a mighty Angel took up a ſtone like a great milſtone, and caſt it into the Sea, ſaying, thus with violence shall that great City</hi> Babylon <hi>be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</hi> This Oracle is not yet fulfilled. <hi>Babylon</hi> is yet ſtanding. The Kingdom of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> doth yet continue. From whence it does at the leaſt follow, that the laſt <hi>Vial</hi> is ſtill to be poured out, and as I may ſay, that there is not one drop of it yet fallen.</p>
                        <p>But the ſame do's appear as evidently in reference to the <hi>ſour</hi> firſt, as it do's in relation to the <hi>three</hi> laſt. For beſides that, it is ſaid of them all in general, that they are <hi>the laſt plagues, and the conſummation of the wrath of God againſt Babylon; St. John</hi> further tells us. <hi>ch. 8. v.</hi> 13. that he heard an Angel flying thorow the midſt of Heaven, ſaying with a loud voice, <hi>Wo, wo, wo to the Inhabitants of the Earth, by reaſon of the Trumpets that are yet to ſound.</hi> And <hi>chap. 9. v.</hi> 12. after the ſounding of the <hi>fifth</hi> Trumpet, <hi>St. John</hi> adds, <hi>one Wo is paſt, and behold there come two Woes more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One of theſe two <hi>Woes</hi> fell undoubtedly out, under the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> under which <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> and the <hi>Turkish</hi> Armies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the whole <hi>Eaſt.</hi> And therefore the <hi>third Wo</hi> muſt come to paſs under the <hi>ſeventh</hi> and the laſt <hi>Trumpet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>St. Iohn</hi> accordingly declareth expreſly,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108142:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>chap. 11. v.</hi> 14. that <hi>the ſecond Wo is paſt, and behold the third Wo cometh quickly.</hi> And after that, he immediately ſubjoins, <hi>that the ſeventh Angel ſounded, and that there were great voices in heaven, ſaying, the Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt, and he shall Reign for ever and ever.</hi> This is a <hi>wo</hi> for the <hi>Papacy,</hi> but it is a happineſs for the <hi>Church of God.</hi> For it is exactly the general <hi>Reformation,</hi> which shall comprehend in it the converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and the uniting of all <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> into one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and into one Worship, together with the final End of the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom. Whence it uncontroably follows, that all the <hi>Vials</hi> being contained under this <hi>third Wo,</hi> they are yet <hi>to be</hi> poured out. Foraſmuch as we are this year 1687. ſtill under the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> and are groaning under the preſſures of the <hi>ſecond Wo.</hi> Which over and aboye all the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres</hi> that were ſeen in the former ages, hath made us to ſee in this age, the <hi>two Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth Witneſſes</hi> overcome and killed by the Beaſt.</p>
                        <p>So that here we have a new proof that all the <hi>Vials</hi> from the <hi>firſt</hi> to the <hi>laſt,</hi> are yet to be poured out; foraſmuch as the <hi>Vials</hi> are no other thing but the <hi>ſeven Thunders,</hi> which are ſpoken of <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. And indeed the <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> are <hi>ſeven</hi> in number, as well as the <hi>Vials</hi> are. And as the <hi>Thunders</hi> do ſignify the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God againſt the Enemies of the Church; ſo the <hi>Vials</hi> do ſignify the ſame,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:108142:137"/>
in that by them <hi>the Wrath of God is to be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated.</hi> Moreover, the things threatned by the <hi>Thunders,</hi> are delayed from being executed until the ſounding of the <hi>Seventh Trumpet.</hi> For St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap. 10. v.</hi> 4. that being about to write, he heard a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, <hi>Seal up thoſe things which the ſeven Thunders uttered, and write them not.</hi> Why was this? Becauſe they were not to be executed, until the <hi>Myſtery of God should be finished,</hi> which is not to be till under the <hi>Seventh Trumpet.</hi> For the <hi>Myſtery of God,</hi> is the bringing in of all Kingdoms to Jeſus Chriſt, the converſion of all Nations, and the uniting of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; from whence that peace of the <hi>Church</hi> shall ariſe, which is to continue during the <hi>thouſand years</hi> that Satan is to be bound. And if there be any difference betwixt the <hi>Vials</hi> and the <hi>Thunders,</hi> it conſiſteth only in this, that the <hi>Thunders</hi> are the <hi>denunciation</hi> of the Judgments of God; and that the <hi>Vials</hi> are the <hi>execution</hi> of them. For tho the <hi>Thunders</hi> were heard by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> under the <hi>Sixth Trumpet,</hi> yet they were not to be executed till under the <hi>Seventh,</hi> under which it is that all the <hi>Vials</hi> shall be poured out.</p>
                        <p>I do know, that there are famous Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who pretend to demonſtrate the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of moſt of the <hi>Vials,</hi> as already paſt; by that conformity which they obſerve in Events with the Terms that expteſs the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, which each <hi>Vial</hi> doth contain. But that conformity doth not neceſſarily prove that they are all poured forth, nor indeed that any
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:108142:138"/>
part of them is; what hath been now ſaid proves the contrary in a manner that comes near to demonſtration. All that agreement does only prove, that they shall be poured out in their proper times, and that of this we are not to doubt, ſeeing what is already come to paſs, is an aſſurance of what is to enſue. So that what fell out in the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> tho' conformable to the prediction about the ruin of <hi>Babylon,</hi> does not ſerve to prove that <hi>Babylon</hi> is entirely fallen; but is as it were an <hi>Earneſt</hi> put into our hand, whereby the total fall of it is promiſed unto us, and which is to be a <hi>pledg</hi> of the full pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that is promiſed us in reference thereunto.</p>
                        <p>Foraſmuch then as it is certain, that not ſo much as <hi>one of the Vials</hi> is yet poured forth; it becometh us in point of Wiſdom to affirm nothing dogmatically in the expounding of them.</p>
                        <p>That which may be affirmed as certain and indubitable, is, <hi>firſt,</hi> that as the <hi>Trumpets</hi> declared the <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and his <hi>advances</hi> in the eſtablishment of his <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> together with the <hi>riſe</hi> of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, and the <hi>growth</hi> of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; ſo the <hi>Vials</hi> shew the <hi>fall</hi> and <hi>ruin</hi> of theſe <hi>two</hi> Enemies of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That when the <hi>Vials</hi> come to be poured out, there shall be no long diſtance between the pouring nut of one of them, and the effuſion of the reſt. Becauſe it is ſaid in the <hi>10th Chapter v.</hi> 6. that the <hi>Angel ſware
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:108142:138"/>
that there should be time no longer.</hi> That is to ſay, that there should be no more delay; that the Judgments of God shall overtake the Beaſt, without any reſpit betwixt one and another; and that the ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> shall break forth, and fall as it were cloſe and near together. And conſequently, that the <hi>Vials,</hi> which are nothing but the ſeven <hi>Thunders,</hi> shall be ſo poured out, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pouring forth of the <hi>firſt</hi> be ended, the <hi>ſecond</hi> shall begin, and ſo the reſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there shall be ſcarce any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, betwixt the ſounding of the <hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpet, and the ſounding of the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth.</hi> Seeing 'tis ſaid, <hi>chap. 11. v. 14. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wo is paſt, and behold the third Wo cometh quickly.</hi> For we are to obſerve, that this is not ſaid in the prediction of the <hi>two</hi> firſt <hi>Wo's,</hi> under the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>ſixth</hi> Trumpets. All that is there ſaid, is only that they <hi>shall come;</hi> but this <hi>quickly</hi> is not added ſave in the prediction of the <hi>third Wo.</hi> Whence we may conclude, that the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> shall immediately follow the Reſurrection of the <hi>two Witneſſes.</hi> Whoſe Death, as it fell out in 1685. ſo their Reſurrection shall enſue within <hi>three years and a half</hi> from that time, becauſe the <hi>three days and a half,</hi> wherein they are to lie dead, being prophetick days, are equivalent unto ſo many years. And then, in a short time after the Reſurrection of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> whom the Beaſt hath kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, we shall ſee the arrival of the <hi>third Wo,</hi> that is to avenge the <hi>Lambs Wife,</hi> for all the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:108142:139"/>
evils which the <hi>Mother of Harlots</hi> hath made her to ſuffer.</p>
                        <p>Nor ought we to forget, that the Term in the <hi>Original,</hi> which ſignifieth a <hi>Vial,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth alſo a <hi>Cup;</hi> in which ſenſe the Term is undoubtedly here uſed. For beſides, that it is the Judgments of God, which are here treated of, and which are expreſſed in the Scripture by the word <hi>Cup,</hi> as appeareth both <hi>Pſ. 75. v.</hi> 8. and by the prayer of our Saviour, in his Agony, <hi>Let this Cup paſs from me, Matth. 26. v.</hi> 39. I ſay, beſides this, it is evident, that the vengeance wherewith <hi>Babylon</hi> is threatned, is expreſſed by the ſame Term, <hi>Rev. chap. 18. v. 6. Reward her even as she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded you, and double unto her double, according to her works; in the</hi> CUP <hi>which she hath filled, fill to her double.</hi> So that the <hi>Cups</hi> of God's Wrath, are ſet in oppoſition to the <hi>golden Cup</hi> with which <hi>Babylon</hi> made drunk the Nations of the Earth. <hi>Babylon's Cup is full of the furious Wine of her fornications, Rev</hi> 17. 2. Theſe <hi>Cups</hi> which are to be poured out, are <hi>full of the wrath of Almighty God,</hi> by which he will make her deſolate.</p>
                        <p>I will again repeat, that ſeeing theſe <hi>Vials</hi> or <hi>Cups</hi> contain Judgments yet to come, and which cannot be explained from the <hi>Events,</hi> as hath been done in expounding of the <hi>Viſions</hi> of the <hi>Trumpets;</hi> that therefore I deſign not to ſpeak otherway's, than by way of <hi>Conjecture.</hi> This is a deference which should be pay'd to the <hi>Author</hi> of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Howſoever we shall ſee what may be
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:108142:139"/>
beſt alledged, and what carrieth the greateſt probability, by having our eye upon remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the <hi>Explanations</hi> that have been already given.</p>

That is the very ſame which <hi>St. Iohn</hi> fore-tells in this place; <hi>and every Iſland Fled away, and the Mountains were not found.</hi> For by <hi>Iſlands</hi> are underſtood <hi>Commonwealths, &amp; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> are meant by <hi>Mountains.</hi> All which is as if he should have ſaid, that there shall be no more any <hi>State,</hi> neither <hi>Republick,</hi> nor a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but what shall be governed by the holy-<hi>Laws</hi> of the Goſpel, and which shall be a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> as the State of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of the Judges.</p>
                           <p>So that this here is not the laſt and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <hi>Iudgment,</hi> no more than that <hi>chap. 11. v.</hi> 18. but it is the particular Judgment of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> that is the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire, which the peace of the <hi>Church</hi> shall follow.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Hail</hi> of an extraordinary bigneſs, that shall fall at the effuſion of this laſt <hi>Vial</hi>', can no way's agree to the <hi>laſt</hi> judgment, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that being the day of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Dead, no <hi>Hail</hi> shall fall to kill
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:108142:145"/>
men. Whereas it is here ſaid, that the <hi>Hail fell upon men,</hi> that unqueſtionably ſignifieth, the overwhelming them by reaſon of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration. For it will come to paſs, that ſome men upon their ſeeing the vengeance of God againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> and againſt its Empire, will inſtead of being converted, break forth into blaſphemies. Theſe hardned <hi>men,</hi> are ſuch as have no ſenſe of Religion, but are tied to <hi>Babylon</hi> by the bonds of gain, and by the alone chains of intereſt. There are at this time a great number of theſe, who ſavour nothing of the word of God, who have no more knowledg than <hi>Babel</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and yet they paſs in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for great Devoto's. They are the men of this complexion that shall be overwhelmed by the <hi>Hail</hi> of the <hi>ſeventh and laſt Vial.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This <hi>Hail</hi> may be very well ſaid to threaten the rich and innumerable <hi>Benefices</hi> of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Clergy.</hi> For the vaſt riches of the <hi>Prelates</hi> and of the other <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> being the ſtrong Buttreſſes of the <hi>Papacy;</hi> the loſs of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,</hi> may very well be one of the Means, which God in his providence will make uſe of to deſtroy and abolish them. For this is the property of <hi>Hail,</hi> to deſtroy Revenues; and the <hi>Papacy</hi> being adhered unto only for its riches, when it comes to be ſtript, the whole world will abandon it, which will cauſe its ruin.</p>

                           <hi>XXVII. ILLUSTRATION.</hi> Of the Time that the Beaſt's Reign is to continue.</head>
                        <p>THE Holy Spirit marketh the <hi>duration</hi> of the <hi>Reign</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in five ſeveral places. In the 11. <hi>Chap. v.</hi> 2. 'tis ſaid, that <hi>the Gentiles shall tread the Holy City under foot forty and two Mon'ths.</hi> And in the <hi>3d verſe</hi> of the ſame <hi>chapter,</hi> 'tis ſaid, that <hi>the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes shall propheſie a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days clothed in ſackcloth.</hi> And in the 12 <hi>Chap. v.</hi> 6. 'tis ſaid, that <hi>the Woman fled into the Wilderneſs, where she had a place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared of God, to be fed there 1260 days.</hi> And in the <hi>14th verſe</hi> of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> She is ſaid to be there fed, <hi>for a Time, Times, and half a Time.</hi> And <hi>chap. 13. v.</hi> 5. 'tis ſaid, <hi>power is given unto the Beaſt to continue forty and two Mon'ths.</hi> From all which we are to obſerve,</p>
                        <p>(1) That the 42 <hi>Mon'ths,</hi> and 1260 <hi>Day's</hi> are one and the ſame thing. Becauſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whoſe language the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> was written in, every <hi>Mon'th</hi> contained <hi>thirty</hi> day's, and 42 times <hi>thirty</hi> make 1260.</p>
                        <p>(2) That <hi>one Time, Times, and half a Time,</hi> are <hi>one</hi> year, <hi>two</hi> years, and <hi>half</hi> a year, which making three years and a half, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth juſt to <hi>ſorty and two</hi> Months; and to 1260 Day's.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="266" facs="tcp:108142:146"/>(3) That whereas it is expreſly ſaid, that power was given unto the <hi>Beaſt</hi> to continue 42 <hi>Months;</hi> this declareth his Duration, during the Time that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall tread the holy City under foot, and during the Time that the Woman shall be in the Wilderneſs, where she is to be fed, while that the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> propheſie clothed in Sackcloth.</p>
                        <p>(4) That the 1260 <hi>Days,</hi> are not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>literally</hi> for common <hi>Days,</hi> but <hi>Myſtically</hi> for ſo many <hi>years.</hi> This we cannot doubt of, when we have conſidered, that Days are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſo in the Books of the Prophets. In the <hi>4th Chap.</hi> of <hi>Amos v.</hi> 4. the Prophet bids them <hi>bring their Sacrifices and Tyths after three Days,</hi> i. e. after <hi>three years,</hi> as our Tranſlation rendreth it. And in the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>Daniel v.</hi> 24. the <hi>ſeventy weeks</hi> are put for <hi>Weeks</hi> of <hi>years,</hi> which make 490 years. And in <hi>Ezek. chap. 4. v.</hi> 4. 5. God ſaith to the Prophet, <hi>Lie upon thy left ſide, and lay the iniquity of the houſe of Iſrael upon it, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shall bear their Iniquity. For I have laid upon thee the years of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, according to the number of the days. I have appointed thee a day for a year.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>According then to the Style of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> which is that of <hi>St. John</hi> in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,</hi> the <hi>Reign</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is to continue 1260 years. And this is a <hi>definite</hi> Number, becauſe <hi>broken</hi> Numbers are in the Scripture put al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way's for <hi>definite</hi> Numbers, as well as they are ſo uſed among the <hi>Latines</hi> and the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                           <pb n="267" facs="tcp:108142:146"/>
So that it is certain, that the Reign of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> which is the ſame with that of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is to laſt 1260 years, and neither <hi>more</hi> nor <hi>leſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> pretehd that this Reign shall endure only <hi>three years and a half.</hi> And it is their Intereſt to defend that opinion, that they may thereby with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the eyes of men from the <hi>Pope.</hi> But in this they commit two groſs miſtakes. (1) In that they take the 1260. <hi>days</hi> of <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> for <hi>natural</hi> day's; whereas they should underſtand them of <hi>Myſtical</hi> days, according to the cuſtom of the Prophets, which we have proved. (2) In that they ſuppoſe that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> will be only a <hi>ſingle perſon;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he is a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of <hi>perſons</hi> that make <hi>war</hi> againſt the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>This the alone paſſage of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>ſecond Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Theſſal. chap.</hi> 2. is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to demonſtrate. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> are at an accord with <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that the <hi>Son of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who ſitteth in the Temple of God as God, and who exalteth himſelf above all that is called God,</hi> is <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Now this <hi>Son of perdition</hi> is not conſidered by St. <hi>Paul</hi> as a <hi>ſingle</hi> perſon, but as a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of perſons in one and the ſame Seat. This doth evidently appear, by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which the Apoſtle makes betwixt the <hi>Son of perdition,</hi> and <hi>him who hindred him from appearing,</hi> whom he deſigneth by him <hi>who now letteth.</hi> All are likewiſe agreed, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> intends by <hi>him that letteth,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor: but now by that Emperor, he could not deſign <hi>one</hi> Emperor <hi>perſonally,</hi> but
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:108142:147"/>
he underſtood <hi>all</hi> the Emperors <hi>collectively</hi> that were to ſucceed, till the time that they gave their room to the Son of Perdition. And in the ſame manner is the Son of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be taken. He is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>perſonally,</hi> but <hi>collectively,</hi> for all thoſe who should ſucceſſively poſſeſs that Seat.</p>
                        <p>And why should they be unwilling that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> should ſignify the Antichriſtian <hi>Empire</hi> under a Succeſſion of ſo many Heads; ſeeing according to themſelves the Name of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> deſigneth all the <hi>Popes</hi> and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> Empire? That verſe of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. is generally known.

                        </p>
                        <p>And why is it, that ſince the time of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> II. when the cuſtom begun of the <hi>Popes</hi> changing their Names on the day of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, no one <hi>Pope</hi> hath aſſumed the name of <hi>Peter?</hi> There can be no other reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for that conduct, but that all the <hi>Popes,</hi> in the quality of Supream <hi>Bishops,</hi> pretend to be <hi>Peter.</hi> And that therefore it would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a needleſs, but an uſeleſs and an abſurd thing to take upon them the name of <hi>Peter.</hi> For it is to the <hi>Popes,</hi> as that of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, which was a common Name to the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                           <hi>XXVIII. ILLUSTRATION.</hi> Of the time, when the Beaſts Reign, or the Papal Empire began.</head>
                        <p>IT ſeemeth long to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and to a great many others, that they do not ſee the End of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Reign. And they have reaſon to be weary, ſeeing the Tyranny of old <hi>Babylon</hi> was not near ſo ſevere to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as that of new <hi>Babylon</hi> is to them. Therefore they do earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire when the Reign of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> began, that having diſcovered when it commenced, they may know how to mark when it shall end.</p>
                        <p>The Spring of <hi>Nile</hi> was unknown for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages, and furnished occaſion to the warm diſputes of Philoſophers. But it is at laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by Travellers, and all thoſe Diſputes are ceaſed. It is much the ſame, about the beginning of the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire, or the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Reign. <hi>The Learned</hi> are divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Some have placed it in <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi> others in <hi>Boniface</hi> that ſucceeded him; and a third ſort have raiſed it to the <hi>eleventh</hi> Age, and have ſought for it in <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. Yea there are others, who do aſſert it to be as unknown, as the Source of <hi>Nile</hi> was heretofore.</p>
                        <p>But I do think that I have diſcovered it,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:108142:148"/>
by a <hi>Voyage</hi> I have made through the Lands of Antiquity; that is, by means of the light of the Sacred Scriptures, and through the aſſiſtance of Hiſtory. And that I might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this undertaking, I have made the following obſervations.</p>
                        <p>(1.) That the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> or the Reign of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> conſiſteth in <hi>three</hi> things. In <hi>Errors</hi> in Doctrine, in <hi>Idolatry</hi> in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and in <hi>Tyranny</hi> in Government.</p>
                        <p>(2.) Theſe <hi>three</hi> corruptions did not ſteal into the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> together and at once, but ſeparately, and one after another. <hi>Error</hi> was the firſt that crept into Chriſtianity. <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> followed Error. And <hi>Tyranny</hi> thruſt it ſelf in under the favour of Error and Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>(3.) The <hi>Time</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> fore-tels of the falling out of an <hi>Apoſtacy, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 1. is the time of the manifeſtation of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Now that Apoſtacy hath <hi>two</hi> Characters. <hi>One</hi> is the <hi>forbidding of Marriage.</hi> The <hi>other</hi> is the <hi>the commanding to abſtain from meats,</hi> created to be received of them that do believe.</p>
                        <p>(4.) <hi>St. Paul</hi> having drawn the portraiture of Antichriſt, whom he ſtileth the Son of Perdition, 2 <hi>Theſſ. chap.</hi> 2. he addeth, <hi>v. 6. Ye know what withholdeth, that he might be revealed in his time.</hi> Now the Apoſtle could underſtand nothing by that <hi>which withholdeth</hi> but <hi>Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm;</hi> for the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> could not raiſe himſelf to any grandure, ſo long as the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> continued <hi>Pagan.</hi> The Apoſtle ſubjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>For the Myſtery of Iniquity doth already work; only he who now letteth, will let, until he
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:108142:148"/>
be taken out of the way.</hi> By him <hi>who letteth</hi> he plainly intends the <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> who ſo long as he continued <hi>Pagan,</hi> hindred <hi>Antichriſt</hi> from declaring himſelf; but as ſoon as he became <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſuffered him to riſe and advance; partly by the immoderate bounty he exerciſed towards the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by increaſing his Authority, inſtead of leaving it within the bounds which he found it; partly by granting him the Title of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream <hi>Bishop;</hi> and laſtly, by withdrawing from <hi>Rome,</hi> and yielding that place to that <hi>Bishop,</hi> through his retirement to <hi>Ravenna</hi> and <hi>Milan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(5.) From the time that <hi>Conſtantin,</hi> the firſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperor, begun to hold Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, or general <hi>Councils,</hi> which were conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the whole <hi>Empire;</hi> theſe <hi>Councils</hi> contributed to the Exaltation of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that <hi>Gregory</hi> I. ſpake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his intereſt, when he ſaid, that he had the ſame regard for the 4. <hi>Councils,</hi> viz. of <hi>Nice, Conſtantinople, Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Calcedon,</hi> that he had for the <hi>four Goſpels.</hi> Which was a plain Blaſphemy, and very ſuteable to <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(6.) <hi>St. John</hi> delivereth the Explication which the Angel gave of the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>17th Chapter v.</hi> 12. in theſe Words: <hi>The ten Horns which thou ſaweſt, are ten Kings, which have received no Kingdom as yet; but receive power as Kings one hour with the Beaſt.</hi> For we are not to ſeek for theſe <hi>Kings</hi> in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire, that continued until the <hi>Turks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſters of it, which is ſomething more than two hundred years; but we are
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:108142:149"/>
to ſeek for them in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire. And the reaſon of it is, becauſe there were not ſeveral <hi>Kingdoms</hi> formed out of the ruins of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire, as there have according to the Terms of the Viſion been formed out of the <hi>Weſtern.</hi> We are not to confine our ſelves poſitively to the number of <hi>ten;</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that number is taken <hi>indefinitely</hi> in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Thus <hi>chap. 2. v.</hi> 10. the tribulation of <hi>ten</hi> days that is ſpoken of, is to denote a long <hi>perſecution.</hi> All that is eſſential to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked is, that theſe <hi>ten</hi> Kingdoms, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignties are formed out of the ruins of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire. Which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſays poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>chap. 7. v.</hi> 24. as well as St. <hi>John,</hi> who from the Angels Interpretation of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſaith, that <hi>the ten Kings receive their power in the ſame hour with the Beaſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After theſe obſervations from <hi>Scripture,</hi> it will be of advantage to conſider the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters of Fact, which are all expreſly recorded in <hi>Hiſtory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was in the <hi>fourth Age,</hi> that the <hi>Faſts &amp; Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinences</hi> of the <hi>Montemiſts</hi> came to be received in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> And in that Age Pope <hi>Syricius</hi> condemned the <hi>Marriage</hi> of <hi>Prieſts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was in the <hi>fourth Age</hi> that Pope <hi>Mark</hi> wrote Letters to <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> and to the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath always been without afault, and through the grace of God, and the protection of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>for ever shall be ſo.</hi> Which words favour both of <hi>Idolairy</hi> and of <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Twas in the <hi>4th Age,</hi> that the 2. <hi>firſt</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:108142:149"/>
of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were held, as thoſe of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> were kept in the <hi>fifth.</hi> And although as theſe <hi>Councils</hi> did not greatly exalt the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> we may truly ſay, that they opened a way, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a Bridg to the following <hi>Councils,</hi> which have made it their buſineſs to advance the <hi>Pope</hi> to what he is at this day.</p>
                        <p>'Twas in the <hi>fourth Age,</hi> that the <hi>Emperors</hi> embraced the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> that they were ſo liberal to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they ſtript themſelves of the dignity of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream <hi>Pontiff</hi> in favour to him. From the time of <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> they had always retained it, that they might thereby render their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſacred and inviolable. 'Twas the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Gratian</hi> that ſurrendred it, and ſince that time none of his Succeſſors have claimed it.</p>
                        <p>'Twas in the <hi>fifth Age</hi> that the <hi>Emperors</hi> withdrew from <hi>Rome,</hi> and choſe <hi>Ravenna</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> for their reſidence.</p>
                        <p>'Twas in the beginning of the <hi>fifth Age,</hi> that the <hi>Weſtern Empire</hi> was deſtroyed by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and that, out of the ruins of it, they formed ſeveral Soveraignties in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Gaul, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Twas in the <hi>fifth Age,</hi> that in order to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure the <hi>Pagans</hi> to Chriſtianity, the <hi>Church</hi> eſpouſed many of their <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> the <hi>Worship of Images,</hi> the <hi>Veneration of Relicks,</hi> and <hi>Prayers for the dead.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>'Twas in the beginning of the <hi>fifth Age,</hi> that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> I. defended the Right of <hi>Appeals</hi> to the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                           <hi>Finally,</hi> it was in the <hi>fifth Age,</hi> that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between Pope <hi>Leo</hi> 1. and other <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> about the matter of <hi>Appeals,</hi> was in the moſt ſolemn and authentick manner, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> could deſire, ended and determined in his favour. When the two Emperors <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Valentintan</hi> granted unto him, and iſſued out an <hi>Edict</hi> in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing terms: <hi>We by this perpetual Edict, have ordained, that no Bishop, whether they be of</hi> Gaul, <hi>or of any other Provinces, shall contrary to the ancient cuſtoms attempt any thing hereafter, without the Authority of the venerable</hi> Pope <hi>of the Eternal City. But that whatſoever the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Apoſtolick</hi> Sea <hi>shall ordain, shall be ſubmitted to by all others as unto a Law. So that whoſoever of the Bishops having appealed, shall neglect to appear at the Tribunal of the</hi> Roman Bishop, <hi>shall be obliged to appear before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the Province where he lives; provided always, that whatſoever things our Sacred Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors have granted to the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome, <hi>shall be unchangeably and univerſally preſerved.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We need go no farther in order to ſeek for the <hi>birth</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire, or to find the fatal Date where the 1260. <hi>days</hi> or the 42. <hi>Months,</hi> of the continuance of the <hi>Beaſts Reign</hi> doth begin. For in what is already mentioned, we find every thing that goes to the conſtitution of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> namely, <hi>Error in Doctrine, Idolatry in Worship,</hi> and <hi>Tyranny in Government.</hi> Foraſmuch as we find the <hi>Roman</hi> Church at that time guilty of <hi>Forbidding Marriage,</hi> and of Commanding
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:108142:150"/>
                           <hi>to abſtain from Meats,</hi> which are the two cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Apoſtacy fore-told by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And becauſe we find her defiled with <hi>prayers for the dead,</hi> with the <hi>Worshipping of Images,</hi> with the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> with the <hi>venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Relicks,</hi> and brought into a ſubjection to a <hi>Bishop,</hi> who was by an Imperial <hi>Edict</hi> eſtablished Soveraign Judg of all other <hi>Bishops</hi> within the Circle of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Edict</hi> was published <hi>anno</hi> 445. in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Leo I.</hi> and of his <hi>Succeſſors.</hi> It is then in that year at the ſooneſt and at the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt alſo, that we are to fix the fatal <hi>Epoche</hi> of the birth of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> and conſequently may hope to ſee the End of it, in the year 1705. For if unto 445. which was the <hi>year</hi> of the Edict of <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> there be added 1260. the total will be 1705. And if from 1705. there be ſubſtracted 445. the Remain will be 1260. which is the time of the duration of the <hi>Beaſts Reign.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Hiſtorian <hi>Florus</hi> hath conſidered the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> paſſing through the different Ages and periods of human life, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Idea, he hath marked the <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Infancy</hi> of that <hi>Empire</hi> under Kings; its <hi>youth</hi> from <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Collatinus,</hi> who were the firſt <hi>Conſuls</hi> till the time of <hi>Appius Claudius;</hi> its <hi>Manhood</hi> from <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> till the time of the Emperor <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus;</hi> and its <hi>Old Age</hi> from <hi>Auguſtus</hi> till the time of <hi>Trajan,</hi> under whoſe Reign that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:108142:151"/>
Hiſtorian lived, and under which he ſays, that the <hi>Empire,</hi> tho' verging to a decrepitneſs, beſtirred it ſelf as if it had been grown young again.</p>
                        <p>We may very rationally form ſuch an Idea of the <hi>Papal</hi> or <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Empire. But we may according to the Scripture go a little further than the Hiſtorian <hi>Florus</hi> hath done, and aſcend to the very <hi>Conception</hi> of this <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi> Kingdom. For it was conceived in the time of <hi>St. Paul;</hi> becauſe he writes to the <hi>Theſſalonians 2 Ep. chap. 2. v.</hi> 7. that <hi>the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Iniquity did then work.</hi> It was then as an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio</hi> and a <hi>Foetus;</hi> but it began to ſtir in the ſecond <hi>Century,</hi> when <hi>Victor</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon a very frivolous occaſion, namely, about the day on which <hi>Eaſter</hi> should be kept, Excommunicated the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Aſia;</hi> but he was too feeble to continue and juſtify what he had done. After the converſion of the <hi>Emperors,</hi> who choſe to bring <hi>heathenish Superſtitions</hi> into the <hi>Church</hi> in order to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the converſion of the <hi>Pagans; Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> begun to acquire conſiderable ſtrength, and ſtrove to come into the world and to shew its head. Eſpecially when Pope <hi>Mark</hi> in the <hi>4th age</hi> wrote thoſe bold and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous letters which we have mentioned, and when <hi>Innocent</hi> I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made that bold effort in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the matter of <hi>Appeals,</hi> whereof he claimed to be Judg. But yet <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> did not openly appear nor come abroad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had not the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Secular</hi> power to midwife it into the world. It was
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:108142:151"/>
then born and came into the world, when the two Emperors <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> came in to its ſuccour; and when by an <hi>Edict,</hi> wherein theſe two <hi>Emperors</hi> joined and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted their Authority, the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> was eſtablished Soveraign <hi>Judg</hi> of all Bishops.</p>
                        <p>Since that <hi>Edict,</hi> it hath been always grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Its <hi>Infancy</hi> was from <hi>Leo</hi> I. until <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> III, who improving the favour of the Emperor <hi>Phocas,</hi> boldly aſſumed the Title of <hi>Univerſal Bishop,</hi> which his predeceſſor <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> durſt not challenge, becauſe that <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had taken it before him. Its <hi>youth</hi> was from <hi>Boniface</hi> III, until the time of that famous <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> called <hi>Gregory</hi> VII, under whoſe <hi>Popedom</hi> it arrived at its <hi>manly State.</hi> For to this day there was never a <hi>Pope</hi> more haughty, nor a Tyrant more terrible, than he was. He brought <hi>Henry</hi> IV. to come and demand pardon of him in the Caſtle of <hi>Canoſs,</hi> where he made him attend <hi>three</hi> whole days without shewing the leaſt regard to his dignity, and when he had admitted him to audience, treated him with the like haughtineſs, that the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſter would treat the meaneſt dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Servant. Its <hi>Manhood</hi> extended from thence until the time of the great <hi>Schiſm</hi> which endured 50 years, and was at laſt ended by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> in the year 1415. And then began its <hi>Old age,</hi> which is now ſo far advanced, that it may be ſaid to be decrepit, and extreamly feeble, and to have as it were one foot in the Grave.</p>

                        <p>THe deſtruction of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> being not to arrive until after the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Satan</hi> for a thouſand years, and till after the <hi>Millennian</hi> peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> we cannot diſcourſe of it otherway's than by conjecture.</p>
                        <p>This prediction is unqueſtionably the ſame with that of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> For there hath not hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:108142:152"/>
been any Defeat like unto that, which <hi>Ezekiel chap.</hi> 39. relates concerning <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> which he repreſenteth to be ſuch, that they shall be <hi>ſeven Months in burying their dead Bodies;</hi> and that the <hi>fire in which their Arms are burnt, shall laſt ſeven years. v.</hi> 9, 12. Since <hi>Ezekiels</hi> time until this day, there hath been ſeen nothing proportionable unto it, nor any thing in the whole known world that comes near it. This then being a Sealed <hi>Prophecy,</hi> we muſt wait for the ſenſe of it till it come to be accomplished. Nor will it be fulfilled until after <hi>Satans</hi> Impriſonment and the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> reſt for a thouſand years; and until after the ruin of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the falſe <hi>Prophet,</hi> who are in this <hi>Viſion</hi> ſuppoſed to be in the <hi>lake of fire and brimſtone.</hi> So that it is highly probable, that <hi>St. Iohn</hi> doth only repeat the prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth not relate the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> until after he had deſcribed the Reſurrection of the Church of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo <hi>St. Iohn</hi> doth not treat of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, till after the deſcription of the <hi>Church's</hi> re-eſtablishment, and of her peace for a 1000 years.</p>
                        <p>And as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> repreſents the people of God, before they came to be aſſaulted by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> as a People that were in the enjoyment of an entire peace, that dwelt void of fear, and who had neither Walls, nor Gates, nor Barrs, and who without being troubled lookt after their Herds and their fields; ſo <hi>St. Iohn</hi> do's in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:108142:153"/>
repreſent the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> before the breaking out of the War which <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> were to be ingaged in.</p>
                        <p>Finally, As <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> after he had recounted the Defeat of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> deſcribes the <hi>Myſtical Temple,</hi> and with that finisheth his <hi>Propheſie;</hi> ſo <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> after he hath recited the deſtruction of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> deſcribes the ſame <hi>Temple</hi> which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had deſcribed, and which is nothing elſe ſave the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Myſtical Temple</hi> of the Son of God, and with that he finisheth his <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If it be demanded, who theſe <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> are? I anſwer, that it appears by <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> that they are a people on the north of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> as the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Scythians</hi> are. And in all likelihood they and others ſprung from them, are the people, who being deceived by <hi>Satan</hi> looſed out of his priſon, shall raiſe the moſt dangerous <hi>War</hi> againſt the <hi>Church,</hi> that she ever met with; and that therefore God shall deliver her after a more illuſtrious manner, than ever he had done before.</p>

                        <p>SEeing the Angel reproveth <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> for having eaſt himſelf at his feet; it muſt needs be that that <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had therein done amiſs. Otherwiſe the fault were in the <hi>Angel</hi> in rebuking that as a ſin, which was an action that ought not to have been blamed. Which is a thing that we are neither to ſay, nor to think, of an Angel of light.</p>
                        <p>But what was this <hi>fault</hi> of <hi>St. Iohn?</hi> Can we ſay that he failed in reference to the Law and to matter of Right? Certainly this <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was ſanctified to the knowledg of the Truth, by that Spirit which inſpired him in his divine Writings; yet ſanctification being not perfect ſave in heaven, there is no danger in confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to have been liable to infirmities, and the rather becauſe he himſelf ſaith, 1 <hi>Epiſt. chap. 1. v.</hi> 8. that <hi>if we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſs, ſeeing that if <hi>St. Iohn</hi> had failed in matter of Right he muſt have been guilty of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> a thing he was not capable of committing, neither as he was a <hi>Iew</hi> by his birth; and leſs as he was a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who had received a greater meaſure of the light of Grace; and leaſt of all as he was an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> that had preached againſt <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and who had shut up his <hi>firſt Epiſtle</hi> with that Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Little children, keep your ſelves from Idols:</hi>
                           <pb n="282" facs="tcp:108142:154"/>
it is therefore ſafeſt to ſay, that he failed in matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and that being ſtruck with the luſter of the <hi>Angel,</hi> he took him for one of the <hi>Perſons</hi> of the Godhead; for which the <hi>Angel</hi> doth rebuke him.</p>
                        <p>And what the Angel ſaith in his reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of him, do's plainly favour this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>See thou do it not,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>for I am thy fellow ſervant, and of thy Brethren that have the Teſtimony of Ieſus: Worship God.</hi> The Angel ſaw that he took him not for a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but for the <hi>Creator.</hi> For he doth it in the ſame manner, that <hi>St. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> reprehended the <hi>Lycaonians,</hi> Act. 14. 15. when they would have ſacrified to them as unto <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury; why do ye theſe things? we alſo are men of like paſſions with you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Relapſe of <hi>St. Iohn</hi> into the ſame fault <hi>chap. 22. v.</hi> 8. for which he was again rebuked; do's invincibly prove that his ſin was a faileur in matter of <hi>Fact.</hi> For who can with any probability believe, that <hi>St. Iohn</hi> would have worshipped a creature, if he had known him to be ſuch? or who can think but that if the <hi>Angel</hi> had thought ſo of him, he would have rebuked him with greater ſeverity than he did? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as even upon that miſcarriage, he conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelf with producing the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a ſecond time, thar he had alledged unto him before.</p>
                        <p>That which the Angel addeth; <hi>for the Teſtimony of Ieſus is the Spirit of Prophecy;</hi>
                           <pb n="283" facs="tcp:108142:154"/>
is nothing but an Illuſtration of the reaſon which he had aſſigned for not ſuffering <hi>St. Iohn</hi> to worship him; namely, <hi>that I am thy fellow Servant.</hi> For it is all one as if he should have ſaid, the <hi>Teſtimony of Ieſus,</hi> which is in <hi>thee,</hi> as an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> is the ſame thing with the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi> that is in <hi>me.</hi> We are equal, and therefore you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your ſelf, in taking me for an object which ought to be worshipped.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is not ſo Scrupulous as the <hi>Angel</hi> was, nor do's he carry it after that manner; foraſmuch as upon the day of <hi>his Election,</hi> he ſuffereth himſelf to be ſet upon the high <hi>Altar;</hi> where he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by all the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and by all the <hi>people.</hi> By which we come to know, what agreement there is between the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> and an <hi>Angel of light.</hi> And that there is a great deal more betwixt <hi>him</hi> and the <hi>Angel of Darkneſs,</hi> that had the impudence to require of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that he should fall down and Worship him.</p>

                           <hi>XXXI. ILLUSTRATION.</hi> Of Chriſt's directing his Epiſtles, and his Revelation to the ſeven Churches. And why?</head>
                        <p>AFter that we have explained all the <hi>Viſions</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypſe;</hi> we are not to forget to inquire the Reaſon, why Jeſus Chriſt judged it convenient, to direct it together with the Epiſtles, particularly to the <hi>ſeven Churches,</hi> of Aſia, <hi>Epheſus; Smyrna; Pergamus; Thyatira; Sardis; Philadelphia;</hi> and <hi>Laodicea.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is unqueſtionably a Myſtery in it, that Jeſus Chriſt should direct this divine Book to <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> neither to more, nor to fewer. For (1) the number <hi>ſeven</hi> is a Myſterious Number through this whole <hi>Book.</hi> It ſignifieth the univerſality &amp; the fulfilling of all Times; as appeareth by the conſideration of the <hi>ſeven</hi> Seals, the <hi>ſeven</hi> Trumpets, and the <hi>ſeven</hi> Vials. Becauſe that number denoteth the whole Train of things, which the <hi>Seals, Trumpets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and <hi>Vials,</hi> fore-tell are to come to paſs till the very deſtruction of the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(2) Chriſt appeareth having in his hand <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Stars,</hi> which are the <hi>Seven Paſtors</hi> of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> aud walking in the midſt of <hi>Seven Candleſticks,</hi> which are the <hi>Seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> that we have mentioned. But why <hi>Seven?</hi> Doth he not promiſe to be the Protector but
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:108142:157"/>
of theſe <hi>ſeven</hi> Paſtors, and the Overſeer and Defender but of theſe <hi>Churches?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(3) There is a Conformity between <hi>that Viſion</hi> in the <hi>firſt Chapter,</hi> and <hi>thoſe</hi> of the <hi>ſeven Seals,</hi> and of the opened <hi>Book.</hi> For we there find the ſame pomp, the ſound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and the glorious preſence of our Saviour in the midſt of his <hi>Church.</hi> And withal, he appeareth there walking in the midſt of the <hi>ſeven Candleſticks,</hi> and ſitting in the midſt of the <hi>four living Creatures</hi> and the 24. <hi>Elders.</hi> By which conformity we are given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that this <hi>firſt Viſion</hi> is of equal weight, and of an equal extenſion with all the <hi>other.</hi> And that this of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> reached to the End of the world, as all the following together do.</p>
                        <p>(4) Jeſus Chriſt ſaith to <hi>St. John.</hi> v. 19. <hi>Write the things which thou haſt ſeen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.</hi> Which is as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>write,</hi> not only things which concern the <hi>Churches</hi> that are mentioned, and which ought to be inſtructed as theſe are; but which alſo concern <hi>all Churches</hi> to the End of the world, and whereof the <hi>ſeven</hi> that are named are a model and Type.</p>
                        <p>(5) The <hi>Epiſtles</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth to the <hi>ſeven Churches,</hi> do contain Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Reprehenſions, which agree unto and exactly expreſs all the different and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conditions, in which the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> will be found until the end of the world.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="286" facs="tcp:108142:158"/>The State of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> doth lively repreſent the condition of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church,</hi> where Truth prevailed, and where at the laſt, the decay of Charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a diſpoſition and a ſtep to a more dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful State. Whoſoever well conſiders what is ſaid to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> will therein find the condition of the <hi>primitive Church,</hi> pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forth to the life.</p>
                        <p>That of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> repreſents the State of the <hi>Church</hi> during the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth</hi> Ages; wherein <hi>Arianiſm</hi> had the upperhand; and wherein the <hi>Orthodox</hi> were outragiouſly perſecuted. That is the <hi>Tribulation of ten days,</hi> wherewith <hi>Smyrna</hi> is threatned; not the <hi>ten</hi> perſecutions, of which that of <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> was the laſt.</p>
                        <p>That of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> hath a reference to the time when <hi>Antichriſt ſitteth</hi> in the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> and when the <hi>Church of God</hi> is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſible, through her dwelling, as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Pergamus</hi> did, <hi>where Satan had his Throne.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> hath a great conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the condition of the <hi>Church,</hi> when <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> both begun to fall, and begun to raiſe himſelf again. According to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony given by our Saviour to that of <hi>Thyatira, Thou haſt not the Doctrine of</hi> Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, <hi>and thou haſt not known the depths of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That of <hi>Sardis,</hi> hath a reſemblance to the <hi>Reformed Church,</hi> degenerating and falling into corruption of manners. <hi>Thou haſt a name
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:108142:158"/>
that thou liveſt, and art dead. Yet thou haſt a few names, which have not defiled their Garments.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> is a protrature of that of the <hi>Church</hi> when She shall be <hi>perfectly Reformed;</hi> when <hi>Sion</hi> shall be perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtablished; when the alone Key of <hi>David</hi> shall open and shut; when the voice of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> shall be perfectly followed; and that both with reſpect unto manners, and to faith. This is the State wherein the <hi>Church</hi> will be during the time of the <hi>Millennian Reign,</hi> whereof we have before ſpoken.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> is a Mirour wherein we may behold the State of the <hi>Church</hi> towards the <hi>End of the world.</hi> When zeal shall have become cold, Charity ſcarce to be found, and corruption shall abound and be univerſal, and thereby draw upon the world that Deluge of Fire, which shall give a renovation unto it.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Reflections</hi> do shew us the reaſon, why the Lord directed the <hi>ſeven Epiſtles,</hi> and all the <hi>Viſions</hi> of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> of <hi>St. Iohn</hi> preciſely to the <hi>Seven Churches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But it is matter of ſurpriſe, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> hath made no mention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ſpoken one word of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> nor of the <hi>Pope.</hi> How comes it to paſs, that he forgets his <hi>Vicar,</hi> and the <hi>Mother</hi> of all <hi>Churches,</hi> which either have been, or are to be to the end of the world? How comes he to be unmindful of the <hi>Apoſtolick Sea; of the Seat of Infallibility; of the alone Fountain of all lawful Vocation and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and of the Centre of Religion?</hi> For ſeeing
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:108142:159"/>
the Lord, the Son of God, is not man that he should lye, or the Son of man, that he should repent; it is the more remarkable that he should have forgot, (in a <hi>Book</hi> purpoſely writen, to mark out the deſtiny of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to diſtinguish her from <hi>Babylon) points,</hi> which according to the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> are <hi>fundamental,</hi> and ſuch as men cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of without hazarding Salvation. So that now it is not poſſible, that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> should be what She pretends. O that God the Father of Mercy and Light, would remove from the hearts of men, the vail of prejudices and paſſions, that all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> may come to ſee the danger of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> the neceſſity of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the Conformiry of the Worship, which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> render unto God, with the ſacred and inviolable <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>

                  <head>The PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>'TWere to be wished, that all who pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish their <hi>Meditations</hi> upon the <hi>Revelation,</hi> were found to agree in their <hi>Explication</hi> of that <hi>Divine Book,</hi> as much as they do in their <hi>Expoſition</hi> of the other <hi>Sacred Writings.</hi> But how deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſoever this be, it hath not hither to come to paſs. And an uniformity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about the ſenſe of <hi>Propheſies,</hi> whoſe Accomplishment is yet to come, is no leſs impoſſible to <hi>Interpreters,</hi> that are not divinely inſpired, than the knowledg of thoſe future things is which they do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</p>
                  <p>So that it is not ſtrange, that <hi>Mr. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieu</hi> in his <hi>Accompliſhment of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> and the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> in his <hi>Illuſtrations upon the Apocalypſe,</hi> do not univerſally accord; and that in their <hi>Expoſition</hi> of the <hi>16. Chap.</hi> they are found to contradict one another. Nay it would be a kind of miracle, should they
<pb facs="tcp:108142:161"/>
upon the many various ſubjects of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> of <hi>St. John,</hi> be found in all things to have the ſame ſentiments.</p>
                  <p>But poſſibly ſome will be ſurpriſed, that <hi>two Reformed Divines</hi> should write againſt one another. And probably ſome may not only be ſurpriſed, but ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daled, throw their ſeeing two <hi>Brethren</hi> differ, and throw an apprehenſion that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may draw ſome advantage from their diſagreement.</p>
                  <p>And it muſt be acknowledged, that if mens ſurpriſe at their difference should have that effect; it had been a thouſand times better, that both thoſe <hi>Authors</hi> had forever concealed their thoughts, than to give the leaſt matter of ſcandal to their Brethren, by publishing of them.</p>
                  <p>The deſign therefore of this <hi>Preface,</hi> is to obviate theſe two difficulties, and to juſtify not only thoſe two <hi>Antagoniſts,</hi> but all others who may embark in this quarrel by eſpouſing the one ſide or the other.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>firſt</hi> difficulty, I do affirm, that if any are offended at the ſeeing <hi>two</hi> Reformed <hi>Divines</hi> write againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the <hi>Expoſition</hi> of the <hi>16. Chap.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108142:161"/>
about the <hi>Effuſion of the Vials,</hi> the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is <hi>taken,</hi> and not <hi>given.</hi> And I do withal maintain, that 'tis lawful for every one in his Expoſition of <hi>Propheſies,</hi> to purſue that way which ſeems beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. If in his Explication he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict any Article of Faith neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; I do confeſs, that in this caſe all men have reaſon to be offended with him, who shall by his Interpretations over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw any of thoſe Articles; and they have cauſe to treat that <hi>Expoſitor</hi> as an <hi>Innovator,</hi> and to diſclaim his Expoſition as a <hi>Hereſie.</hi> But which Article of Faith is ſubverted, or ſo much as oppoſed, or any ways injured, by the either ſaying, that the <hi>Vials are poured out,</hi> or that they <hi>are not poured out? Mr. Jurieu</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply's all the <hi>Events</hi> ſince the <hi>tenth</hi> Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>Vials,</hi> as if they had been all this while pouring forth; and the <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous Author</hi> of the <hi>Illuſtrations</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth them to the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> which have ſounded; and not to the <hi>Vials,</hi> which he believes to be ſtill to be poured forth. Now what Article of Faith is either gain-ſaid, or wronged, by theſe two different <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108142:162"/>But one may ſay, that it will at leaſt beget a <hi>Diſpute</hi> about the Explication of a <hi>Book,</hi> which all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to pay a deference unto, as a Divine Book; and a Diſpute, which being begun at ſuch a conjuncture as that wherein we are, may in all probability not have a good iſſue.</p>
                  <p>Whereas on the contrary, this <hi>Diſpute</hi> will ſtirr up the Curioſity of divers Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who by coming to read theſe two Works, will from thence learn very important Truths, which they are yet ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of. They will thereby underſtand, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> whom they worship as a Deity, is the Original Picture of the <hi>Son of perdition,</hi> who is <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> that the <hi>Papal Empire</hi> is the Portraiture of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with two Horns; that the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> is the Picture of <hi>Babylon the Great;</hi> that the ſpirit of <hi>perſecution,</hi> that reigneth in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> is that of the <hi>Dragon</hi> and of <hi>Satan;</hi> and that <hi>ſuffering</hi> has been the character of the true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church</hi> for above theſe 1500. years. Moreover, this Diſpute will influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence many to Read and Study the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> who uſually read no more of it but
<pb facs="tcp:108142:162"/>
the <hi>three</hi> firſt Chapters, being afraid to look into the reſt. Finally, this <hi>Diſpute</hi> will beget Emulation, and give occaſion for new diſcoveries, and for the making of new <hi>Syſtemes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant what the Illuſtrious <hi>Moros</hi> heretofore ſaid in his Eloquent <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick</hi> upon <hi>Calvin,</hi> namely, <hi>that that great man had Expounded all the Books of the Scripture except the Revelation, which his not doing of, was an excellent Commentary.</hi> This is a piece of wit, where we may ſee an ingenïous draught of the Eloquence of that admirable <hi>Orator;</hi> but the Theologues of our time ought not to be diſcouraged by the Example of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>Calvin.</hi> We know that <hi>Doctor,</hi> who had written ſo many other learned <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,</hi> was capable to have explained the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as well as he had done other <hi>Propheſies.</hi> And if he did it not, 'twas either becauſe he thought he could employ his time better; or becauſe he had deſigned to do it before he should die; which his dying ſo ſoon, hindred the Execution of, which hapned when he was but <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>5 years old, or a few day's over. 'Tis to be hop'd, that this <hi>Diſpute</hi> will cauſe many through Emulation, to lay out
<pb facs="tcp:108142:163"/>
their labours upon this <hi>Divine Book.</hi> For tho they who have preceded, have for the moſt part been incomparable men, both by reaſon of the profoundneſs of their Learning, and the greatneſs of their wit (except the Author of the <hi>Illuſtrations,</hi> who is and will alway be unworthy to be named) yet there is ground to hope that they who come after, will ſee a great deal farther than the former have done, as a <hi>Pygmee</hi> mounted on the shoulders of a <hi>Giant,</hi> is able to ſee farther than the <hi>Giant</hi> himſelf. And is not all this of more conſiderable advantage, than all the Scandal can be of prejudice, that ſome curious Spirits have taken at the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> and the <hi>Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to the advantage which ſome ſear this <hi>Diſpute</hi> will afford the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> both the <hi>Catholicks</hi> that expect benefit by it, and the <hi>Reformed</hi> that fear it, will find it to be only chymerical, and not real. Therefore I muſt again repeat, that it is not about an Article of Faith that theſe diſagreeing Authors contend. To ſay <hi>the Vials Are poured out,</hi> or that <hi>they are Not poured out,</hi> do's equally leave the <hi>Reformed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> in its perfection and integrity. And
<pb facs="tcp:108142:163"/>
how Learned ſoever he may be, and how much ſoever converſant in the Art of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry,</hi> that attacks the <hi>Reformation</hi> from thence, he will not be able to make the leaſt breach upon it.</p>
                  <p>Would it not be extreamly pleaſant, to ſee a <hi>Doctor</hi> carrying the <hi>Mark</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> libellouſly triumphing by reaſon of this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute</hi> betwixt two <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and in the mean time taking no Notice of all thoſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, where both theſe <hi>Author's</hi> do una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly and demonſtratively prove, that <hi>the Church of Rome is Babylon the great;</hi> that <hi>the Papal Empire is the Beaſt with two horns;</hi> that <hi>the Pope is the Son of Perdition, the Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and the ſeventh Head of the Dragon;</hi> and that <hi>the City of Rome is the Seat of the Beaſt?</hi> Herein both the Authors have juſt matter of glorying; and as for that little difference between them concerning the <hi>Effuſion of the Vials,</hi> they have ground enough for <hi>Repriſals,</hi> and a large field for recrimination upon the account of the difference betwixt the <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> and the <hi>Moliniſts;</hi> and between the <hi>Theologues</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of other places upon the one hand, and thoſe of <hi>France</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108142:164"/>
upon the other, who have made a Sacrifice to <hi>Louis the great, of the Infallibility of the Pope,</hi> of <hi>his Supremacy over Councils,</hi> and of <hi>his power over that Soveraigns Perſon &amp; Temporal Rights.</hi> That I may not ſpeak of an infinite number of differences amongſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> in reference to other <hi>Subjects.</hi> And theſe are all funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points in the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> and in reference to which they cannot differ without one ſide's falling into <hi>Hereſie.</hi> But whether a <hi>Reformed Divine</hi> believe the <hi>Vials to be already poured out,</hi> or believe <hi>that none of them are yet pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out,</hi> he is in both caſes equally Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> is by reaſon of none of them lyable to be impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
                  <p>So that I may conclude, that this <hi>Diſpute,</hi> if it be rightly apprehended, can do no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and that it is of advantage upon many accounts, that the <hi>Anonymous</hi> Author should defend his opinion about the <hi>Non-Effuſion</hi> of the Vials, which <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> hath attack'd in his <hi>Apology.</hi> And this he intends to do as becomes a <hi>Reformed Divine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>MR.

However <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> thought fit to attacque that <hi>Author</hi> in his <hi>Apology,</hi> in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108142:166"/>
which he attempts two things. <hi>1ſt,</hi> He ſtudies to prove, that the <hi>Vials</hi> have for a long time been pouring forth; that the effuſion of the <hi>ſix</hi> firſt is already paſt; and that the <hi>ſeventh</hi> having been a pouring out for theſe hundred and ſixty <hi>years,</hi> will be ſuddenly empty, and iſſue in the total ruin of the <hi>Papal Empire. 2ly,</hi> He endeavours to refute the reaſons by which the <hi>Anonymous</hi> Author pretends to have proved, that there is not ſo much as one of the <hi>Vials</hi> yet poured out; and that they shall not be, untill under the ſounding of the <hi>7th Trumpet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The foundation upon which <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> hath built his <hi>Commentary</hi> on the <hi>16th Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> conſiſts in this, that he conſiders the Seven <hi>Vials</hi> as Seven <hi>Periods</hi> of Time. Which <hi>Periods</hi> he makes to begin in the <hi>tenth Century;</hi> ſo that according to him, the <hi>firſt</hi> of the ſeven <hi>plagues,</hi> which produced the <hi>Noiſome Sore,</hi> fell upon the <hi>tenth Age;</hi> and this <hi>firſt period</hi> laſted above 150 years, and extended a great way into the <hi>eleventh</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. The <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third plagues,</hi> which fell upon the <hi>Sea</hi> and upon the <hi>Rivers,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted them into Blood, and which he will have to be nothing elſe ſave the <hi>Croiſado's,</hi> reached from the <hi>Eleventh</hi> Age to the <hi>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth.</hi> The <hi>fourth plague,</hi> that fell upon the <hi>Sun,</hi> and which ſcorched men with fire; is that which (according to him) befell the <hi>Pope</hi> upon the increaſe of his Authority, when he became a <hi>Tyrant</hi> over the <hi>World,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before he had been a <hi>Tyrant</hi> only over the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108142:166"/>
                     <hi>Church.</hi> And this <hi>Period</hi> (he ſay's) continued from the year 1074. until the End of the <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Age.</hi> The <hi>fifth,</hi> which is that which fell upon the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> he will have to be the tranſlation of the <hi>Papal Seat</hi> and Court to <hi>Avignon,</hi> that rendred the <hi>Papal Kingdom</hi> full of <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and which laſted from 1305. until 1440. The <hi>ſixth Vial,</hi> which was poured forth upon the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> dried up its water, and made way for the Kings of the Eaſt; is according to him the <hi>irruption</hi> of the <hi>Turks</hi> upon the <hi>Eaſtern Roman</hi> Empire; and this <hi>6th period</hi> ſignified by the <hi>ſixth Vial,</hi> he affirms to have continued from the year 1420 till <hi>the</hi> time of <hi>Luther,</hi> which was about a hundred and five and twenty <hi>years;</hi> at which time the <hi>ſeventh Vial</hi> begun to be poured forth, and will end in the deſtruction of the <hi>Papal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the great principle that <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> go's upon; <hi>the ſeven Vials,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>are certainly ſeven Periods of time?</hi> And from this principle, he draws three Concluſions. (1) That there is a difference between the ſeven <hi>Vials,</hi> and the ſeven <hi>plagues.</hi> That the ſeven <hi>plagues</hi> are the judgments of God; and that the ſeven <hi>Vials</hi> denote the ſeven <hi>Periods</hi> of time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe Judgments are to fall upon the Papal Empire. (2) That all the <hi>Plagues</hi> are deſigned againſt the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom, and not ſo much as one of them againſt the Empire of the <hi>Turks. 'Tis certain,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that the ſeven plagues are entirely intended againſt the Empire of the Beaſt.</hi> (3) That there are in all <hi>thirteen
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108142:167"/>
plagues,</hi> whereof the 6 firſt have deſtroyed the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire as <hi>Civil,</hi> and that theſe <hi>ſix plagues</hi> fell under the <hi>five</hi> firſt <hi>Trumpets;</hi> &amp; that the <hi>ſixt Trumpet,</hi> which is ſubdivided into <hi>ſeven Vials,</hi> shall deſtroy the ſame Empire as <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Papal;</hi> and that the <hi>Vials</hi> have been pouring out ſince the <hi>tenth Century;</hi> that the <hi>ſeventh</hi> is not yet wholly poured forth, but that it begun at the time of <hi>Luthers Reformation,</hi> where he placeth the <hi>Harveſt,</hi> and will end at the general <hi>Reformation,</hi> which is repreſented by the <hi>Vintage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have heard it alway's ſaid, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſtiled a <hi>principle</hi> in any Science, ought to be clear, and of ſuch an evidence as to ſet it beyond contradiction. Whereas <hi>Mr. Iurieu's</hi> principle, that the <hi>Seven Vials, are certainly ſeven Periods of time,</hi> hath not this character, being neither certain nor clear to thoſe that are verſed in the reading of the Prophets, in which there is not ſo much as one footſtep of it to be found. <hi>'Tis evident and certain,</hi> ſays <hi>Mr. I. becauſe the Term Vial ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies an hour-Glaſs, and not a Cup. For a Cup is of another form than a Vial, in that this hath a large belly and a narrow Mouth.</hi> But it is not about the <hi>form</hi> of a <hi>Vial</hi> that we treat, but about the <hi>ſignification</hi> of the <hi>Term.</hi> Nor is there any <hi>Greek</hi> Author that aſcribeth to the word <hi>Vial,</hi> the ſignification of an <hi>hourglaſs.</hi> Neither is there one example to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe either in <hi>Henry Stevens Theſauras,</hi> or in <hi>Favorinus,</hi> or in <hi>Suidas,</hi> or in <hi>Heſychius,</hi> or in the <hi>Gloſſary.</hi> But by all <hi>Dictionaries</hi> it do's
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108142:167"/>
appear that the Term <hi>Vial</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Cup,</hi> a <hi>Chalice,</hi> in a word, a Veſſel deſigned to drink in, or any thing rather than a <hi>Glaſs</hi> for the meaſuring of Time. So that <hi>Mr. Iurieu's</hi> great <hi>principle</hi> is more than doubtful; but then the uſe to which <hi>St. Iohn</hi> applyes this Term <hi>Vial,</hi> do's make us plainly ſee its falshood. In the <hi>5th chap.</hi> of the <hi>Revelation v.</hi> 8. the four and twenty Elders fall down before the Throne, having <hi>Golden Vials full of odours, which are the prayers of the Saints.</hi> Now can <hi>Vials</hi> there ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify <hi>hour-glaſses?</hi> Were <hi>Hour-glaſses</hi> uſed to offer incenſe in, and to ſcatter perfumes in the places of worship, as well as to meaſure and deſign time? Surely <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> will grant that <hi>Vials</hi> in the <hi>5th chap.</hi> of the <hi>Revelation</hi> are not <hi>hourglaſſes,</hi> but <hi>Cups;</hi> &amp; the odours whereof they are ſaid to be full, determine their ſignification to be <hi>Cups,</hi> rather than <hi>hourglaſſes.</hi> We may alſo affirm, that the Term <hi>Vial</hi> chap. 16. can have no other ſignification but this, in that the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> whereof they are ſaid <hi>to be full,</hi> adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the meaning of them to <hi>Bowls,</hi> or <hi>Cups,</hi> out of which the Enemies of Gods Church are made to drink; rather than to <hi>hour-glaſſes</hi> for the meaſuring and defining of time. It may be likewiſe told him, that it being ſaid <hi>chap. 18. v.</hi> 3. that <hi>Babylon shall drink of the Wrath of God,</hi> tho the word <hi>Vial</hi> be not in the original, yet it determins the ſignification of <hi>Vials chap.</hi> 16. to be <hi>cups,</hi> becauſe they are the judgments of God, which are ſpoken of in the one place as well as in the other. It may be farther ſaid unto him, that <hi>chap.</hi> 16.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108142:168"/>
ſpeaketh not ſimply of <hi>Vials,</hi> but of <hi>golden Vials;</hi> and thereupon he may be asked, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>hour-glaſses</hi> were anciently made of <hi>gold,</hi> ſo that thereby the Spirit of God might allude unto them? It may alſo be demanded of him, whether an <hi>hour-glaſs</hi> of <hi>gold</hi> would be proper to meaſure time by? Was <hi>Gold</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently tranſparent, that men could ſee throw it how the <hi>Water</hi> run out, as we now ſee throw <hi>glaſs</hi> how the <hi>ſand</hi> drains away?</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> objects, that the <hi>Vials are poured forth</hi> upon the Earth, upon the Sea, upon Fountains and Rivers, upon the Sun, upon the Seat of the Beaſt, upon <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and into the Air, <hi>which cannot be ſaid of drink</hi> or of a potion. But why? Is it more uſual to ſay, that there are <hi>hour-glaſses</hi> caſt into the Air, upon the Sun, upon the Sea, upon the Earth, and upon the Rivers? 'Tis moſt true, that the phraſe, should it be taken in a literal ſignification, is both contrary to cuſtom, and common ſenſe; but yet it ſerves to conduct the Reader to a <hi>Myſtical</hi> ſenſe; and the rather in that it is expreſly ſaid, that <hi>the Vials are full of the wrath of God;</hi> which renders the <hi>Trope</hi> clear and intelligible to all perſons. And if there be any difficulty in the expreſſion, it conſiſts chiefly in knowing the meaning of the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Sea,</hi> the <hi>Fountains,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Seat of the Beaſt,</hi> the <hi>Air,</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which are the Subjects upon which the <hi>Vials</hi> are poured forth. For after we have once attained to the Senſe of the <hi>Subject,</hi> there remains no room for doubt, out that the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108142:168"/>
effuſion of the <hi>Vials,</hi> ſignifies the judgments of God againſt that which is called the Air, the Sun, <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the Seat of the Beaſt, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch then as the <hi>Propheſie</hi> ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that the <hi>Vials are full of the wrath of God, Mr. Iurieu</hi> acts both unreaſonably and wholly againſt the genius and ſpirit of Prophecy, in making them to be <hi>hour-glaſſes</hi> and <hi>Periods</hi> of Time.</p>
                  <p>To give ſome probability to his Notion, and ſome kind of evidence to his <hi>principle,</hi> he ſaith, that the <hi>Seals</hi> and the <hi>Trumpets</hi> denote <hi>periods</hi> of time. The <hi>Seals,</hi> by vertu of an Alluſion to Tables, or Chronological Books, where Times are marked and regiſtred. The <hi>Trumpets,</hi> by an Alluſion to the <hi>Iubile Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> of the old Law, whereby the <hi>Period</hi> of <hi>fifty</hi> years was marked out. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe the <hi>Viſions</hi> of the Seals and Trumpets ſignify <hi>periods</hi> of Times, we are to conclude that the Viſion of the <hi>Vials</hi> doth the ſame. All this is very eaſily ſaid, but 'tis impoſſible to be proved. 'Tis moſt true that <hi>St. Iohn</hi> do's allude to the expreſſions of the Prophets and to their Viſions; but no Prophet hath made mention of a <hi>Sealed Book;</hi> and if he had, yet it would remain ſtill to be proved, that the <hi>Seal</hi> of that Book ſignified a certain <hi>Period</hi> of time, which it is not ſo eaſie to do as to ſay.</p>
                  <p>There is ſomewhat more likelihood in the Alluſion to the <hi>Trumpets</hi> that proclaimed the <hi>Iubilees,</hi> becauſe they recurred upon the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of every <hi>fifty</hi> years. But then in order
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108142:169"/>
to our being convinced that <hi>St. Iohn</hi> made this alluſion, we ought to be firſt ſatisfied, that <hi>Trumpets</hi> were applied to no other uſe, ſave to the publication of the <hi>Iubilees;</hi> which is moſt evidently falſe, ſeeing they were uſed among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as well as in the time of <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> in the <hi>proclaiming of War.</hi> And it is clear, that <hi>St. Iohn</hi> do's rather allude to the <hi>Trumpets</hi> that <hi>proclaimed War,</hi> than to the <hi>Trumpets</hi> whereby the <hi>Iubilees</hi> were publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Becauſe the <hi>Trumpets</hi> of <hi>St. Iohn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the riſe and progreſs of <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> which are <hi>Wars</hi> againſt the Church and Truth of God. Whereas the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilees</hi> were years of Proſperity &amp; bleſſing; for which reaſon <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calls the <hi>year</hi> of Jubilee, the <hi>acceptable year of the Lord, chap. 61. v. 2. Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> are the two wild Bores, that ſpoil the vineyard of the Lord. They are the two great Enemies of the Goſpel; and the <hi>ſound</hi> of each <hi>Trumpet</hi> is a <hi>ſignal</hi> of the Battles, which thoſe two Enemies fought againſt the Church of God; the one of them in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Weſt.</hi> They denote ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>years</hi> of lamentation and tears, than of Jubilation and joy. So that it is not true, that the <hi>Trumpets</hi> of <hi>St. Iohn</hi> intimate <hi>periods</hi> of Time, by an alluſion to the <hi>Trumpets</hi> which published the <hi>Iubilees.</hi> And it is yet leſs true, that the <hi>Vials</hi> are <hi>hour-glaſſes</hi> to mark theſe <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods</hi> by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Iurieu's principle</hi> being falſe, all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions which he draws from it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be falſe alſo. (1) 'Tis falſe, that there
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108142:169"/>
is a difference between the ſeven <hi>plagues,</hi> and the ſeven <hi>Vials.</hi> Seeing they are the ſame Judgments of God againſt the Enemies of his Church; repreſented <hi>chap.</hi> 15. under the name <hi>plagues;</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 16 under that of <hi>Vials.</hi> For as by the <hi>plagues,</hi> the wrath of God is <hi>fulfilled;</hi> ſo the <hi>Vials</hi> are not full of divine wrath, but in order to be accomplished upon his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when they come to be fully poured forth. The ſeven <hi>Angels,</hi> who are ſaid to have the ſeven <hi>Vials,</hi> receive from one of the four Living Creatures ſeven <hi>golden Vials full of the Wrath of God.</hi> In a word, the <hi>Effect</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the <hi>plagues</hi> fore-told chap. 15. is the ſame with the <hi>effect</hi> of the <hi>Vials</hi> when fully poured forth, <hi>chap.</hi> 16. namely, the opening of the Temple of God, that all Nations may enter in. (2) 'Tis falſe, that all the <hi>plagues</hi> are deſigned only againſt the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and that there is not any of them intended againſt the <hi>Mahometan Empire.</hi> For as <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath infected the <hi>Eaſtern Roman</hi> Empire, ſo <hi>St. Iohn</hi> do's nothing, but declare as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, what was to befall the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> therein purſuing the Hiſtory which <hi>Daniel</hi> had begun. And from thence we may conclude, that both the <hi>Vials</hi> and the <hi>Trumpets</hi> have in part for their object the <hi>Turkish Empire</hi> and the <hi>Mahometan Religion.</hi> (3) 'Tis falſe, that the <hi>ſixth Trumpet</hi> is ſubdivided into the <hi>ſeven Vials,</hi> and that the <hi>ſeven Vials</hi> have been pouring out ſince the <hi>tenth Century.</hi> For it is the <hi>7th Trumpet</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſubdivided into the <hi>Seven Vials,</hi> becauſe 'tis under the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:108142:170"/>
that the <hi>Vials</hi> shall be poured out. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever well conſiders what is to arrive under the <hi>ſixth Vial,</hi> according as <hi>St. Iohn</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it, and thereupon compares it with what is to come to paſs under the <hi>Seventh Trumpet;</hi> may from thence prove, that the judgments of God repreſented by <hi>pouring forth of the Vials,</hi> agree admirably with the effect of the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> but do no way's accord with that of the <hi>ſixth,</hi> and may from thence conclude, that the ſubdiviſion which <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> attributes to the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> agrees only to the <hi>Seventh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> might here give over, if he intended no more than to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover how ill <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> hath explained the <hi>16th Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and that the applications which he hath made of <hi>Events</hi> to the <hi>Vials,</hi> are all forced and conſtrained. But becauſe he hath ſo unhandſomly treated the <hi>Anonymous Author's</hi> reaſons againſt the effuſion of the <hi>Vials,</hi> as not to account them worthy of the name of difficulties; it will be convenient before we advance to the examination of <hi>Mr. Iurieu's</hi> application of <hi>Events</hi> to the <hi>Vials,</hi> and to the Defence of the <hi>Anonymous Author's</hi> reaſons, to repreſent to the Reader the principles and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon which the ſaid concealed <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> hath built the <hi>Syſteme</hi> of his <hi>Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>1ſt</hi> foundation upon which he go's, is that the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> is nothing but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the Prophetical Hiſtory of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:108142:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
concerning the <hi>fourth Monarchy,</hi> which is the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> and concerning the Kingdom of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> which is his <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>2d</hi> is, that the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> predicteth <hi>three</hi> Changes that were to befall the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> By the <hi>firſt,</hi> it was to paſs from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> By the <hi>ſecond,</hi> it was to paſs from <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> and <hi>Mahometiſm.</hi> And by the <hi>third,</hi> it is to return from <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> and from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſm</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> purified by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>3d</hi> is, that the <hi>firſt</hi> change fell out under the <hi>Sixth Seal;</hi> that the <hi>2d</hi> came to paſs under the <hi>Trumpets;</hi> and that the <hi>third</hi> shall arrive under the <hi>Vials.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>4th</hi> is, that theſe <hi>three Viſions,</hi> to wit, that of the <hi>Seals,</hi> that of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and that of the <hi>Vials,</hi> are the three principal <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;</hi> and do comprehend the whole Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Hiſtory concerning the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> and the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and that all the <hi>other Viſions</hi> are but Commentaries upon theſe three.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>5th</hi> is, that none of the <hi>Vials</hi> are contemporary with any of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> except with the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Trumpet; and that there is as much difference between the time of the <hi>Trumpets</hi> and that of the <hi>Vials,</hi> as there is between the time of building and the time of deſtroying; and that we are to ſee all that overthrown under the <hi>Vials,</hi> which was eſtablished under the <hi>Trumpets.</hi> This do's

evidently appear, in that the <hi>Trumpets</hi> and the <hi>Vials</hi> diſplay themſelves towards the ſame Subjects, and that the effects of the <hi>Vials,</hi> are different from thoſe of the <hi>Trumpets.</hi> And this difference is ſo great, that whoſoever conſidereth it carefully and without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, will be convinced, that whatſoever was produced and raiſed under the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> shall fall into decay and come to ruin under the <hi>Vials.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For whereas under the <hi>firſt Trumpet</hi> there fell <hi>upon the Earth, hail mingled with fire and blood;</hi> in the ſtead of this under the <hi>firſt Vial</hi> there falls <hi>upon the ſame Earth,</hi> expreſſed by <hi>thoſe who worship the Beaſt and who have his mark, a noiſome and grievous Sore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas under the <hi>ſecond Trumpet,</hi> there was a burning Mountain <hi>caſt into the Sea, ſo that the third part only of all that was in it died:</hi> In like manner the <hi>ſecond Vial</hi> is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth upon the <hi>ſame Sea,</hi> ſo as to render it <hi>wholly and entirely blood, and to cauſe every Soul that is in it to die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>third Trumpet,</hi> made the <hi>Fountains and the Rivers</hi> become <hi>bitter;</hi> but the <hi>third Vial,</hi> repreſents the <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Fountains changed into blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth Trumpet,</hi> lay's before us the <hi>third part</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and of the <hi>Stars Smitten,</hi> i. e. the third part of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> darkned by the Peſtilential doctrine of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and invaded by the Arms of the <hi>Turks:</hi> but the <hi>fourth Vial,</hi> which is poured forth only upon the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſeems to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108142:171"/>
threaten both the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> and the <hi>Mahometan Religion,</hi> with a diſaſter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fifth Trumpet,</hi> fore-tells the <hi>fall of a great Star, to</hi> whom were given the <hi>Keys of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit,</hi> out of which there <hi>aroſe Smoke and Locuſts.</hi> The <hi>Keys</hi> plainly shew <hi>Rome</hi> to be meant, in that She challengeth to have the cuſtody of the Key's committed to her, and pretends to be the Seat of St. <hi>Peter:</hi> and this denoteth the growth of the <hi>Papal</hi> Empire. But the <hi>fifth Vial,</hi> that is poured out upon the <hi>Seat of the Beaſt,</hi> i. e. upon <hi>Rome,</hi> predicts her deſtruction, and therefore repreſents his <hi>Kingdom become full of darkneſs,</hi> and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects <hi>gnawing their tongues through deſpair.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> as alſo the <hi>ſixth Vial,</hi> have the <hi>River Emphrates</hi> for their Subject. But with this difference, that the <hi>Sixth Trumpet looſed the four Angels</hi> that were bound in the <hi>River Euphrates,</hi> which repreſents the growth of the <hi>Turkish Empire,</hi> and of their <hi>Religion;</hi> whereas the <hi>ſixth Vial, dries up</hi> the ſaid <hi>River,</hi> and produceth the End both of their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> denounceth the <hi>third</hi> and laſt <hi>Wo,</hi> and under this, the <hi>Vials</hi> of Gods wrath are to be poured forth upon all the Enemies of his <hi>Church,</hi> in order thereby to manifeſt and fulfil the <hi>Myſtery of God,</hi> which is nothing elſe ſave the reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all <hi>Nations</hi> under the Scepter of Jeſus Chriſt, which will beget the <hi>Millennian</hi> Reign.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the <hi>principles,</hi> upon which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108142:172"/>
the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> hath built the <hi>Syſteme</hi> of his <hi>Explanations,</hi> which as he judgeth to be beyond all poſſibility of being overthrown; ſo it is from this ſource that he will both bring his <hi>Anſwers</hi> to thoſe Reaſons, whereby <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> hath endeavoured to prove, that all the <hi>Vials</hi> are already poured out, and alſo the <hi>Defence</hi> of the Reaſons, by which he hath in his <hi>Illuſtrations</hi> proved that they are not yet poured forth.</p>
                  <p>The proof which <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> grounds upon the <hi>conformity</hi> of the firſt <hi>four Vials</hi> with the <hi>Events</hi> obſervable in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Empire,</hi> is perfectly overthrown by conſidering the Nature of the <hi>Vials</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For they are nothing but the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon the <hi>Papal Empire</hi> in order to deſtroy it. But the <hi>Events</hi> which he will have to anſwer to the <hi>Vials,</hi> produced a quite contrary effect; they raiſed it, they increaſed it, and they brought the <hi>Papal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> to its grandure. The wonderful corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>tenth Age,</hi> ſignified according to <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> by the <hi>noiſome Sore</hi> of the <hi>firſt Vial,</hi> ſerved to diffuſe the darkneſs of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> by which that <hi>Empire</hi> is ſupported. The <hi>Croiſado's,</hi> which he will have to be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Rivers</hi> under the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>third Vials</hi> being turned into Blood; as likewiſe the <hi>Suns ſcorching men</hi> under the <hi>4th Vial,</hi> which he will have to prefigure the <hi>growth</hi> of the <hi>Papal Authority;</hi> did all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the rendring that <hi>Empire</hi> ſtronger and more terrible. How then could theſe <hi>Vials</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:108142:172"/>
which are the judgments of God upon the <hi>Papal Empire,</hi> be poured out for the increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perfecting the grandure of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> having foreſeen this difficulty, hath in the <hi>ſecond part</hi> of his <hi>Accomplishment of Propheſies, Edition ſecond,</hi> returned two Anſwers to it. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that all the plagues do' not fall upon the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi> Empire. <hi>There are,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>ſome of the ſevere judgments of God, whereof the Popes are not the ſubject, but the Inſtruments. Theſe plagues fall upon thoſe who worship the Beaſt, and his Image; and not upon the Beaſt himſelf and upon the falſe Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I reply, that what he ſaith, namely, that all the <hi>Vials</hi> are not to be poured out upon the <hi>Head</hi> of the Antichriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as well as upon his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> hath no better foundation, than his Principles have. Becauſe 'tis impoſſible that an <hi>Empire</hi> should be ſmitten with the plagues and judgments of God, in order to its being weakned and impaired, and that its <hi>Head</hi> and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign should in the mean time no way's ſuffer. The near union that is between the Head and the members, is wholly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with ſuch a notion. Whenſoever the Body is very ſick, the Head is in a very ill condition. And this holds more tru'ly in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to a <hi>Political</hi> Body, than a <hi>Natural.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, whereas 'tis a <hi>Spiritual Empire</hi> that is ſpoken of, namely, <hi>Antichriſtianiſm;</hi> the judgments that are to be executed upon it,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108142:173"/>
are to be phyſical and penal evils, which as punishments are to weaken and ſubvert it. The judgments of God againſt an <hi>Empire,</hi> whoſe criminalneſs from the very nature of it, lyes in its Errors, Idolatries, Tyranny, which comprehend in them the corruption of manners, cannot conſiſt in <hi>Evils</hi> of <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> But the firſt <hi>four Vials,</hi> according to the ſenſe put upon them by <hi>Mr. Iurieu,</hi> import Evils of <hi>Crime</hi> and not of <hi>punishment,</hi> and do ſtrengthen and advance that <hi>Empire</hi> in all that is eſſential unto it, inſtead of depreſſing and enfeebling it. For it never had ſo great power and ſplendor, as it enjoyed from the <hi>tenth Age</hi> to the <hi>14th,</hi> that is, from the effuſion of the <hi>firſt Vial,</hi> till the pouring out of the <hi>4th.</hi> So that <hi>Mr. I.</hi> hath very ill applied the <hi>Events</hi> which he mentioneth to the 4 firſt <hi>Vials.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>2d Anſwer</hi> is, <hi>that the prodigious advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Papal Authority, which raiſed Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm to its height, proved a ſtep to its ruin. If the Popes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>had continued within the bounds wherein they were in foregoing Ages, and had not medled in the affairs of the world, to diſpoſe of them at their pleaſure, the Roman Sea would not have been known to be Antichriſt. But thereupon that Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo palpable, that all mankind grew convinced of it.</hi> This Anſwer indeed is ſubtil, but is not of that force as to deceive thoſe who make a right uſe of their Reaſon. All Earthly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires have their beginning, their progreſs, and their perfection, according as it pleaſeth the providence of God to ſuffer them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; and when they are riſen to ſuch a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108142:173"/>
height that they can advance no farther, they then of themſelves fall into decay and ruin. And therefore the <hi>Antichriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> being Earthly, 'tis not ſtrange if we find the like fate and parallel decay to befal it. But Right Reaſon cannot fathom, how an Empire should be punished and depreſſed by the plagues of divine juſtice, at a time when 'tis advancing and mounting to the higheſt pitch of its grandure. We may as reaſonably ſay, that what the School of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> ſtiles an Athletick health, is a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, becauſe according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Phyſicians, whoſoever poſſeſſeth it, is in danger to loſe it and fall into ſome mortal diſeaſe. This nevertheleſs is what <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> is forced to affirm, becauſe he cannot otherway's maintain that the firſt <hi>four Vials</hi> are already poured out.</p>
                  <p>Let us now come to the <hi>fifth Vial,</hi> which is to be poured forth upon the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt. This Vial,</hi> ſaith <hi>Mr. Iurieu, fell upon</hi> Rome, <hi>which is the Seat of the Beaſt, when she loſt her Sun</hi> (that Sun which is ſpoken of in the fourth Vial) <hi>when she loſt her Pope, and the Papal Court, which as a whirlpool drew unto her all the Riches of</hi> Europe. Clement V. <hi>having left</hi> Rome <hi>in the year 1305, and fixed his Reſidence at</hi> Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>the City which had been the Miſtris of the world remained deſolate, and became a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the ſpace of 74 years: and this transferring of the Papal Seat to</hi> Avignon, <hi>was the cauſe of that Schiſm which laſted till the year</hi> 1415.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> had ſaid, that the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108142:174"/>
tranſlation of the <hi>Popes</hi> Seat from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Avignon;</hi> and what enſued thereupon, was not an Evil of that extent and greatneſs, as to anſwer the whole force of the words of the Prophecy. The contrary whereof <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> should have shewn, which he hath not done. Wherefore that <hi>Author</hi> doth again ſay, that the removing of the <hi>Papal</hi> Court to <hi>Avignon,</hi> with all that followed upon it, beareth no proportion to the greatneſs of the judgment of God, predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to fall upon the Seat of the Beaſt under the <hi>fifth Vial.</hi> For by that <hi>Rome</hi> is to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deſtroyed; and the <hi>18th. Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which deſcribeth her deſtruction, is nothing but a Commentary upon that <hi>Vial:</hi> as the <hi>13th Chap.</hi> is a Commentary upon the <hi>8th</hi> and <hi>9th Chapters,</hi> which are thoſe of the <hi>Trumpets.</hi> When <hi>Rome</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, the <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom will loſe much of its ſplendor and ſtrength; which is the reaſon why 'tis ſaid that his <hi>Kingdom became full of darkneſs,</hi> becauſe a great many of the followers of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> will forſake him upon the ſeeing the deſtruction of his Seat. Upon that they will open their eyes and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and they who continue to adhere to <hi>popery,</hi> will gnaw their tongues through deſpite &amp; grief; &amp; blaſpheme God, by ſaying, that he hath failed in performing his word by which he had promiſed, that <hi>Rome</hi> should forever be the Infallible Rule of Faith, the Centre of Unity, and the Fortreſs of Truth. But we muſt hereafter ſpeak more amply of this <hi>fifth Vial.</hi>

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:108142:174"/>Let us proceed to the <hi>ſixth Vial,</hi> which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth upon the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and which drieth up its waters, that a way may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> following the learned <hi>Mr. Mead,</hi> explaineth it in reference to the <hi>irruption</hi> of the <hi>Turks,</hi> whoſe irruption he will have to be a judgment of God againſt the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdom.</hi> So that he pretends this <hi>ſixth Vial</hi> to be contemporary with the <hi>6th Trumpet</hi> which deſcribed this Invaſion of the <hi>Turks.</hi> I do acknowledg that he hath reaſon to ſay, that the <hi>Turks</hi> are ſpoken of both under the <hi>Sixth Trumpet</hi> &amp; under the <hi>6th Vial:</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Turks</hi> have poſſeſſed themſelves of near one half of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which is <hi>Daniels</hi> 4th <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory is carried on by <hi>St. Iohn.</hi> But he ought not to confound the <hi>6th Trumpet</hi> with the <hi>ſixth Vial,</hi> as if they were only one and the ſame Viſion. For there is as much difference betwixt theſe two, as there is between the time of <hi>building,</hi> and the time of <hi>deſtroying;</hi> between the <hi>Patience</hi> of God, which ſuffereth and permits his Enemies to become great to the prejudice of his own Kingdom, and his <hi>Vengeance</hi> which ruineth, overwhelmeth, and abolisheth his Enemies. Thoſe <hi>two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Empires, namely, that of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> and that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and grew up under the <hi>Trumpets;</hi> whereas the <hi>Vials</hi> threaten to beat down and overthrow them. This the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> lays for a foundation that cannot be shaken, and upon this he defends, againſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108142:175"/>
the learned <hi>Mr. Mead,</hi> that the drying up of <hi>Euphrates</hi> ſignifieth not the <hi>Irruption</hi> of the <hi>Turks</hi> upon the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire,</hi> but on the contrary, the <hi>end</hi> both of the <hi>Turkish Empire</hi> and of the <hi>Mahometan Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis the prophetick way of ſpeaking to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Nations</hi> by thoſe <hi>Rivers</hi> that run through their Countries; and the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of Nations, by the <hi>drying up</hi> of their Rivers. This appeareth by <hi>Iſaiah Chap 19 v.</hi> 4, 5. where the Lord ſaith, he <hi>will deliver</hi> Egypt <hi>into the hands of a fierce King; and the waters shall fail from the Sea, and the Rivers shall be waſted &amp; dried up.</hi> And the ſame prophet predicts the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the like Terms, <hi>Chap. 44. v.</hi> 26, 27, 28. where he tells us, that 'tis <hi>God who confirmeth the word of his Servants, and performeth the Counſel of his Meſſengers, that ſaith to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>thou shalt be inhabited; and to the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>ye shall be built; that ſaith to the deep, be dry, and I will dry up thy Rivers; who ſaith of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>he is my Shepheard, and shall perform all my pleaſure: even ſaying to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>

                        </gap>hou shall be built; and to the Temple, thy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation shall be laid.</hi> 'Tis evident that <hi>St. Iohn</hi> alludeth to this propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> for both the one and the other ſpeak of the <hi>drying up</hi> of the River <hi>Euphrates. Iſaiah</hi> intends by the drying up of this River, the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the <hi>Babylonish Empire;</hi> and <hi>St. Iohn</hi> by the drying up of the ſame River, intends the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the <hi>Turkish Empire,</hi> and of the <hi>Mahometan Religion,</hi> which are eſtablished in thoſe Countries which <hi>Euphrates</hi> runs through.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108142:175"/>
                     <hi>Iſaiah</hi> promiſeth the <hi>ſubverſion</hi> of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Empire, as a means which God would ſerve himſelf of for the <hi>re-eſtablishment</hi> of the <hi>Iews;</hi> and <hi>St. Iohn</hi> promiſeth the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire and of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, as a means which God will make uſe of for the <hi>Recalling</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> of the <hi>Iews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This alluſion of <hi>St. Iohn</hi> to the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> being ſo viſible, one would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> could not perceive it. For if he had obſerved it, he would not have taken the <hi>Kings of the Eaſt</hi> to be the <hi>Turks,</hi> upon a pretence of the <hi>Turks</hi> poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Natolia,</hi> which ſignifies the <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> For the Text in <hi>St. Iohn</hi> ſpeaks not of <hi>one King,</hi> but of <hi>Kings;</hi> whereas there is but <hi>one</hi> King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia</hi> who is the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> all the people that depend upon him being Slaves. And as 'tis to do <hi>Slaves</hi> too great an honor to give them the Title of <hi>Kings;</hi> ſo 'tis moſt natural to underſtand the <hi>Iews</hi> by theſe <hi>Kings of the Eaſt,</hi> and the rather becauſe theſe two things are certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the <hi>Iews</hi> are in greater number beyond <hi>Euphrates,</hi> than in all the other places where they are diſperſed. <hi>2ly,</hi> that as they were before their being <hi>rejected,</hi> ſo they shall after their being <hi>recalled,</hi> be <hi>Kings,</hi> and a <hi>Royal</hi> Prieſthood, no leſs than thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are, to whom <hi>St. Peter</hi> gives that Elogy. So that we ought to conclude the <hi>ſixth Vial</hi> not to be yet poured out, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as we have neither ſeen the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> which are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108142:176"/>
by the <hi>drying up of the River Euphrates;</hi> nor the <hi>Recalling of the Iews,</hi> denoted by the <hi>coming in of the Kings of the Eaſt,</hi> which is promiſed under the Effuſion of the <hi>Sixth Vial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> pretends, that the pouring forth of the ſeventh <hi>Vial,</hi> begun at the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> and that the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of the laſt age is the <hi>Harveſt</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. and that this <hi>Harveſt</hi> is the effect of the <hi>ſeventh Vial,</hi> whoſe effuſion will end upon the <hi>ſounding</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> for the final deſtruction of the <hi>Papal Empire,</hi> and that this shall be the <hi>Vintage,</hi> which ſignifies the General <hi>Converſion</hi> of all Nations.</p>
                  <p>He will alſo have this <hi>Vial</hi> to have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſingular and peculiar belonging to it, namely, that one part of it shall be poured out at <hi>one</hi> time, and the reſt of it at an <hi>other.</hi> And that between thoſe two times of its effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the <hi>Papal Empire</hi> shall be healed of her wound, thro raiſing herſelf to much of her former greatneſs, and that nevertheleſs this <hi>Vial</hi> shall continue to be running out. But that is incredible, becauſe 'tis with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this <hi>laſt Vial,</hi> that the <hi>Voice</hi> coming out of the Temple from the Throne, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims <hi>it is done,</hi> Rev. 16. 17. ſo that the half of it cannot ſtill be to run out. Nor is there the leaſt ground for <hi>dividing</hi> any of the <hi>Vials</hi> into ſeveral parts, ſeeing God hath no way's done it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Tis true, that the <hi>Harveſt</hi> was in the laſt Age, and that in <hi>Luther's</hi> time the <hi>Sickle was put in,</hi> and the <hi>Harveſt</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:108142:176"/>
gathered; but then the <hi>Harveſt</hi> is not an <hi>effect</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Vial,</hi> that being wholly for the <hi>Vintage,</hi> foraſmuch as there remains nothing after that to be done, towards the filling up the wrath of God againſt the <hi>Antichriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid to the <hi>Anonymous Author,</hi> that he ſuppoſeth the <hi>ſix</hi> firſt <hi>Trumpets</hi> to give Birth, Growth, Grandure, and perfection to the <hi>Papal Kingdom;</hi> and that nevertheleſs according to him, the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Luther,</hi> which leſſened the <hi>Pope,</hi> and diminished his <hi>Empire,</hi> begun under the <hi>ſixt Trumpet,</hi> under which we yet are. And that this breaks the Coherence of his <hi>Syſteme,</hi> and defaceth the Harmony of his <hi>Illuſtrations.</hi> To this the <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous Author</hi> Anſwereth, that it is not true, that the <hi>Reformation</hi> made in the fore-going Age, hath produced the effect which they alledg. For we muſt in reference to the <hi>Papal Authority;</hi> diſtinguish between his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Right</hi> and the <hi>actual Exerciſe</hi> of it. For 'tis certain, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> doth not actually exerciſe the <hi>Right</hi> attributed to him, even in all the <hi>Dominions</hi> which pay him an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. He doth not <hi>exerciſe</hi> it in <hi>France,</hi> in that degree and manner, as he doth beyond the <hi>Alp's</hi> and the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> and in ſeveral other places. As for the <hi>Right,</hi> he poſſeſſeth it to this day, as he did before the preaching of <hi>Luther,</hi> and as he claimed it in the time of the famous <hi>Hildebrand</hi> Gregory the <hi>Seventh.</hi> For all who worship the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> who bear his <hi>Image<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

acknowledg <hi>Innocent XI.</hi> for the <hi>Vicar Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Lord of all States and Empires, either directly or indirectly; as the Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter</hi> who hath the Keys of Heaven, Hell and Purgatory; as the Soveraign Judg of Controverſies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe mouth whenſoever he ſpeaketh <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> uttereth Oracles, which are to be received with an obedience of Faith, as if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had pronounced them.

                  </p>
                  <p>But it may further be ſaid to the <hi>Anonymous Author,</hi> can you deny but that the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>laſt Age,</hi> was a <hi>judgment</hi> of God upon the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and upon the <hi>Papal Empire?</hi> And if it be a <hi>Judgment</hi> of God, how can you undertake to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that none of the <hi>Vials</hi> which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that <hi>Empire</hi> are hitherto poured out?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> confeſſeth, that <hi>Luther's Reformation</hi> was a <hi>judgment</hi> of God upon the <hi>Papal Kingdom;</hi> but he withal ſay's, that it was an <hi>effect</hi> of the <hi>ſixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> which continueth as well as the former to repreſent the War of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> againſt the <hi>Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> of God. Till then <hi>Antichriſt</hi> had been alway's victorious; but after a conſtant courſe of Victories againſt the <hi>Church</hi> of God during the War of more than a thouſand years, he came then to receive a diſaſter. Now this misfortune befel the <hi>Papal Empire</hi>

under the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> which being the laſt ſave one, was the ſeaſon that the War was haſtning to an End, and that the <hi>laſt Trumpet</hi> was about to ſound, under which this <hi>War</hi> will both <hi>actually end,</hi> and all the <hi>Vials</hi> come to be poured forth. But the <hi>Dammage</hi> which the <hi>Reformation</hi> hath done the <hi>Papal Empire,</hi> tho it hath conſiderably diſmembred it, is only a beginning of its ſorrows, and is but an effect of the <hi>War,</hi> which was to continue under all the <hi>ſix Trumpets,</hi> and which shall be <hi>finished</hi> thro the <hi>effuſion</hi> of the <hi>Vials.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor hath <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> any reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain againſt thoſe, who do maintain that all the <hi>Vials</hi> are ſtill to be poured out. <hi>I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi> ſay's he in the <hi>2d Edition</hi> of his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of Propheſies, <hi>that ſince the firſt Edition of this Book, there are ſtill ſome, who to put a reputation upon themſelves, undertake to defend, that none of the ſeven plagues are yet come to paſs, which is a ſingularity neither edifying nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</hi> After which he adds by way of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation, <hi>I conjure them to lay aſide their humour of contradicting, and without paſſion to conſider theſe two things;</hi> firſt, <hi>That in the whole Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the</hi> 16th Chap. <hi>there is not any forced and wreſted application; but thas the Ideas which the Prophet hath made uſe of, are all conformable to the Events marked in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hiſtory;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>That in the application of theſe ſeven plagues to the Events, all is coherent and of a piece, and that the Syſteme doth in no part diſagree with its ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon which, I pray them to conſider, whether this can be by chance, and whether any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108142:178"/>
ſuch thing ever was? What is by accident may agree in ſome things, but it cannot do ſo in all!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a ſingular and ſtrange way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Is it Lawful for none but for <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> writers, to meditate and labour upon the <hi>Apocalypſe?</hi> Or is it a crime for them to have <hi>Sentiments</hi> different from thoſe, which <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> hath framed upon this <hi>Divine Book?</hi> Or may they not contradict him, with the ſame liberty, that he do's all thoſe who ſtand in his way, <hi>Troſruiuluſve fuat?</hi> And are his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of others, more edifying and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, than other mens contradictions of him?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> hath without all prejudice, conſidered the <hi>Explication</hi> of the <hi>16th Chap.</hi> according as <hi>Mr Iurieu</hi> hath given it. And was troubled to find that the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> which he hath made of the <hi>Events</hi> to the <hi>Vials,</hi> is wholly forced. In that he confounds by that <hi>Application</hi> the <hi>Vials</hi> with the <hi>Trumpets;</hi> and aſcribeth to the <hi>Vials,</hi> the proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Effects</hi> of the <hi>Trumpets.</hi> So that if his <hi>Syſteme</hi> be coherent, and doth not contradict it ſelf; yet it hath this great fault, that it doth no way accord with the <hi>Syſteme</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What I have already ſaid, doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly make this evident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what I have farther to ſay in Defence of the <hi>Vials not being yet poured out,</hi> will juſtify, that the Reaſons which the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> had ſaid, <hi>approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to demonſtrations,</hi> are at the leaſt <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> which deſerved that <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> should

                  <p>MR. <hi>Iurieu</hi> hath endeavoured <hi>three</hi> things by way of oppoſition to theſe <hi>Reaſons.</hi> (1) He hath confuted them. (2) He ſtudies to shew, that this Opinion which is that of the deceaſed <hi>Mr. de Launoy,</hi> agreeth very well with the <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of <hi>Mr. de Launoy,</hi> but not with theſe of the <hi>Anonymous Author.</hi> (3) That it doth ſo far diminish the comfort of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> by how much it ſets the Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>laſt Vial</hi> backward. And beſides all this, he oppoſeth the Explication which the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> hath given of the fourth <hi>Vial.</hi> Now 'tis neceſſary to give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in reference to all theſe Articles.</p>
                  <p>The firſt proof of the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> concludes, that <hi>the two laſt Vials are ſtill to be poured forth, becauſe the fifth is not yet run out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If this Reaſon,</hi> ſaith Mr. Jurieu, <hi>ſignify any thing, yet it doth not advantage the Author, who will have none of the Vials to be poured forth; ſeeing notwithſtanding this argument, there may be four of them already run out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> being to prove, that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108142:179"/>
all the <hi>Vials</hi> are ſtill to be poured forth; he begun at the End, where he thought beſt. That then which he alledged, was that ſuppoſing the <hi>ſixth Vial</hi> is to be poured forth before the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> the <hi>fifth not being yet poured out, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently follows that the two laſt are ſtill to be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth.</hi> Nor was there any thing to be ſaid againſt this Reaſon of the <hi>Anonymous Author,</hi> but to examin whether he had ſufficiently proved his opinion in reference to the <hi>fifth Vial,</hi> in order to his proceeding to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>four</hi> firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> adds, <hi>that the Author pretends, that the darkneſs mentioned under the fifth Vial, ought to ſignify the total ruin of the City of Rome.</hi> That <hi>Author</hi> begs <hi>Mr. Iurieu's</hi> pardon, if he tell him that he is miſtaken, and that he hath in no way's penetrated into the meaning of that <hi>Author,</hi> who explaineth that darkneſs quite after another manner. He conſidereth the <hi>effuſion</hi> of the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> upon <hi>the Seat of the Beaſt,</hi> as a judgment that should deſtroy <hi>Rome</hi> beyond recovery, &amp; he conſiders the <hi>darkneſs</hi> as an effect of the ruin of the Seat of the Beaſt. Theſe were his very words, <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the Seat of the Beaſt, <hi>being deſtroyed,</hi> the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Beaſt becomes full of darkneſs; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as darkneſs ſignifieth in the Scripture ſorrow and affliction, 'tis eaſie to underſtand thereby the depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Papal Empire, and the affliction of thoſe who carry the mark of the Beaſt, his Name, and the Number of his Name.</hi> This was the Explication, which the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> gave of the <hi>fifth Vial.</hi> He diſtinguished with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108142:179"/>
                     <hi>St. John</hi> between the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Beaſt and the Beaſt <hi>himſelf,</hi> or his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> The <hi>fifth Vial</hi> falleth directly and ſingly upon <hi>the Seat of the Beaſt:</hi> for what End? to overthrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it forever. <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> himſelf appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this diſtinction. He very pertinently <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth,</hi> ſay's Mr. Jurieu, <hi>that the Prophecy ſaith not, that the Seat of the Beaſt, but that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Beaſt, became full of darkneſs. That is well;</hi> but then he adds, <hi>this is directly againſt the Anonymous Author; ſeeing if it be not the City of Rome to which the plague of darkneſs is to be applied, it is not then to be ruined by that plague.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis ſtrange, that <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the diſtinction which the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> hath obſerved in the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and that he should not make the due improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it: We are ſacredly to adhere to the Terms of the <hi>Propheſie,</hi> which doth not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the <hi>darkneſs</hi> to the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Beaſt, but to his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> For it doth not ſay, that the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Beaſt <hi>became full of darkneſs,</hi> but that his <hi>Kingdom</hi> was filled with darkneſs. So that the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> being deſtroyed by the <hi>fifth Vial;</hi> the effect of that judgment will be, that his <hi>Kingdom</hi> which ſtill continueth, shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>dark,</hi> shall be afflicted, and filled with ſorrow, upon the having loſt its <hi>capital Seat.</hi> This is that which <hi>darkneſs</hi> doth ſignify, being a Term often applied in the Scripture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a great and ſore affliction. This is what the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> would have ſaid, and which he really did ſay in his <hi>Illuſtrations.</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:108142:180"/>
And not that which <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> imputeth unto him, of ſaying that theſe words, <hi>and his Kingdom became full of darkneſs,</hi> ſignifie a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal deſtruction of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> or of the <hi>Papal Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis all therefore impertinent, which he oppoſeth to this Notion; <hi>By what Rule,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>and in what language, doth darkneſs neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſignify a total ruin?</hi> But herein he fighteth againſt his own shadow, and not againſt the <hi>Anonymous Author,</hi> who never ſaid nor thought that the <hi>darkneſs</hi> under the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> ſignifieth the univerſal deſtruction of the <hi>Papal Empire;</hi> for this he acknowledgeth is not to arrive till under the <hi>ſeventh Vial.</hi> 'Tis true, that being ſpeaking of the effuſion of the <hi>Vials</hi> in general, he had ſaid, that the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> threatneth both <hi>Rome</hi> and its <hi>Empire</hi> with a much other kind of affliction, than that which aroſe from the great <hi>Schiſm;</hi> but upon explaining the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> in particular, he had at the ſame time expounded this threatning, namely, that <hi>Rome</hi> shall be then utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but that its <hi>Empire</hi> shall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed till under the <hi>ſeventh Vial.</hi> He had withal ſaid in the ſame place, that what fell out from the time of the great <hi>Schiſm</hi> till the time of <hi>Luther's Reformation,</hi> was not an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of that dreadfulneſs, as to come up to the whole force of that expreſſion, that <hi>they gnawed their tongues for pain. Mr. Iurieu</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, that <hi>darkneſs</hi> in that place doth not ſignify the <hi>being afflicted,</hi> but that it ſignifieth <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Superſtition.</hi> Surely he did not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108142:180"/>
mind theſe words, <hi>and they gnawed their tongues for pain.</hi> For as theſe words do explain the Term <hi>darkneſs;</hi> ſo they determine the ſenſe of it to that of <hi>affliction, rage, deſpite,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,</hi> which the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> will be filled with <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> upon the deſtruction of the <hi>Beaſts Seat.</hi> Which came not to paſs during the <hi>Schiſm</hi> of the <hi>Anti-popes.</hi> For to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, it was only the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>popes</hi> that were then enraged one againſt another, curſing, Anathematizing, and treating each other as the <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> but in the mean time the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> the <hi>Bishops,</hi> the <hi>Monks,</hi> were never more careſſed, and in greater credit with the one ſide and the other. In a word, all under the <hi>Romish</hi> Juriſdiction, were then contented, and pleaſed that they could fish in troubled waters. It was not then, that the <hi>Beaſts Kingdom</hi> was <hi>full of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> nor then that the Citizens of it <hi>gnawed their tongues for pain;</hi> ſo that we are ſtill to expect the effuſion of the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> upon the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Beaſt; in order to the beholding the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> covered with <hi>darkneſs</hi> as the night; and in order to the ſeeing the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> the <hi>Prelates,</hi> the <hi>Friers,</hi> and all thoſe whom the ruin of <hi>Rome</hi> shall not be a means to convert, but who remain bigotted with the <hi>Infallibility</hi> and the other priviledges of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> overwhelmed with ſorrow, and gnawen with inconſolable deſpair, thro ſeeing their Idol abolished. Seeing the deſtruction of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108142:181"/>
Seat of the <hi>Papal Empire,</hi> ought to precede that of its <hi>Empire;</hi> even as <hi>Rome</hi> the Seat of the <hi>Civil Empire,</hi> was ruined before that <hi>Empire;</hi> it is therefore the more probable, both that this deſtruction is predicted in theſe words, <hi>the fifth Vial was poured out upon the Seat of the Beaſt;</hi> and that its Deſtruction will afflict all its <hi>Empire,</hi> which is the thing ſignified by theſe words, <hi>and his Kingdom became full of darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Expoſition is as natural, as that of <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> appeareth forced and ſtrained. For it maketh that the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> leaveth the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Beaſt untouched with the <hi>darkneſs</hi> of his Kingdom, whereas the <hi>darkneſs</hi> should be alone adjudged to the Beaſts <hi>Seat.</hi> For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, the <hi>darkneſs</hi> denoteth the great Eclipſe, which the <hi>Papal Authority</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent during the <hi>Schiſm</hi> of the <hi>Anti-popes.</hi> But according to the Text, it is not the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Beaſt, but only his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes full of darkneſs thro the pouring forth of the <hi>fifth Vial.</hi> And indeed, during that great Eclipſe, the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Beaſt enjoy'd an extraordinary luſtre, and was like unto the Countrey of <hi>Goshen,</hi> while darkneſs covered all the reſt of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Which is a thing too abſurd not to cauſe us to obſerve, how forced the application is, which <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> maketh of <hi>Events</hi> to the <hi>fifth Vial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anonymous</hi> Author's <hi>ſecond</hi> proof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that the <hi>Vials</hi> are ſtiled the <hi>laſt plagues,</hi> and that by them the wrath of God is accomplished againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> againſt <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:108142:181"/>
her <hi>Pope,</hi> and her <hi>Empire.</hi> Whence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that nothing of all this being yet come to paſs, but <hi>Rome</hi> being hitherto ſtanding, her <hi>Pope,</hi> and her <hi>Empire</hi> ſtill ſubſiſting, the <hi>laſt Vial</hi> muſt be yet to be poured out, and as I may ſay, that not one drop is hitherto fallen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> confeſſeth, that this proof is a difficulty, and the only one which meriteth that name 'Tis a great honor that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it ſo, but a greater that he hath left it in its full ſtrength. The <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> in urging the Terms of the <hi>laſt plagues</hi> by which the wrath of God is accomplished, had conſidered the <hi>Vials</hi> under the reſpect that they bear to the <hi>Trumpets.</hi> For the wrath of God under them comes to finish the trial of the <hi>Churches</hi> patience; He having ſuffered the birth and progreſs of <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the <hi>Papacy</hi> to form it ſelf, and to grow, advance and riſe to an inſupportable Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in order thereby to exerciſe the Faith and Patience of Believers. This is done, when the Meaſure of the <hi>Churches</hi> afflictions shall be come to their height, and when God with reference to her shall have accomplished his anger, which will be upon the <hi>ſixth Trumpets</hi> ceaſing to ſound; and then the <hi>ſeven Vials,</hi> which are the <hi>ſeven Plagues,</hi> shall arrive and begin to take place againſt the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and againſt <hi>Mahometiſm.</hi> 'Tis for this reaſon that 'tis ſaid, that <hi>by the ſeven plagues, which are the Vials, the wrath of God is finished.</hi> From whence it followeth, that the <hi>Vials</hi> are not <hi>contemporary</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:108142:182"/>
with the <hi>6th Trumpet,</hi> and that it is not the <hi>6th Trumpet</hi> which is ſubdivided into the <hi>ſeven Vials;</hi> but that this ſubdiviſion is to be aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet;</hi> even as it is not the <hi>6th Seal</hi> but the <hi>Seventh</hi> which ſubdivideth it ſelf into the ſeven <hi>Trumpets.</hi> The <hi>ſixth Trumpet</hi> no leſs than the preceding <hi>five,</hi> ſpeaketh of nothing ſave of War againſt the Church of God. So long as it laſts, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> abates nothing of his fury, but conſtantly makes the ſame efforts, for the oppreſſing of the Truth and ſuch as do profeſs it; and while it endureth, all things go' on at the ſame rate againſt the Church of God. But as ſoon as the ſeventh <hi>Trumpet</hi> comes to be ſounded by the ſeventh <hi>Angel,</hi> the caſe will quite alter, the wrath of God will break forth, and the <hi>Vials</hi> empty themſelves. And this is the true Reaſon why the <hi>Vials</hi> are called the <hi>laſt plagues,</hi> by which the wrath of God is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. So that all which <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> hath ſaid upon the Term <hi>laſt,</hi> tho in it ſelf very good and very ingenious; yet it is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.

                  <p>The <hi>3d</hi> Argument which the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> made uſe of was this; that <hi>St. Iohn
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108142:182"/>
Rev. chap. 8. v.</hi> 13. declareth how <hi>he heard an Angel flying thorow the midſt of heaven, ſaying with a loud voice,</hi> Wo, wo, wo, <hi>to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth, by reaſon of the Trumpets that are yet to ſound;</hi> and that he adds <hi>chap. 9. v.</hi> 12. after the ſounding of the <hi>fifth</hi> Trumpet, <hi>one Wo is paſt, and behold there come two Woes more hereafter.</hi> For as <hi>one</hi> of theſe <hi>two</hi> laſt <hi>woes</hi> did undoubtedly arrive under the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> under which <hi>Mahometiſm</hi> and the Arms of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſubverted <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> ſo it muſt needs be that the <hi>third Wo</hi> is to arrive under the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet.</hi> This alſo St. <hi>Iohn</hi> expreſly declares <hi>chap. 11. v. 14. the ſecond Wo,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>is paſt, and behold the third cometh quickly;</hi> after which he immediately ſubjoins, <hi>the ſeventh Angel ſounded, and there were great voices in heaven, ſaying, the Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall Reign forever.</hi> This is a <hi>Wo</hi> for the <hi>Papacy</hi> and for <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> but a great happineſs here in this life for the <hi>Church</hi> of God. For 'tis plainly the <hi>general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> which shall comprehend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of all <hi>Nations,</hi> by giving them to ſee the total deſtruction of the <hi>Papal Empire.</hi> From whence it clearly followeth, that all the <hi>Vials</hi> are contained under the <hi>third Wo,</hi> and conſequently, <hi>that they are yet all to be poured out;</hi> foraſmuch as we are ſtill under the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> &amp; groaning under the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the <hi>ſecond Wo.</hi>

                     <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> ſay's, <hi>he doth not apprehend how theſe can be ſtiled invincible Proofs;</hi> and he do's.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108142:183"/>
withal add, <hi>that it is not true, that the third Wo is confined to the ſeventh Trumpet.</hi> To which I <hi>anſwer,</hi> that it is as clear that the <hi>third Wo</hi> is contained under the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> as 'tis evident that the <hi>ſecond Wo</hi> is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the <hi>ſixth,</hi> and the <hi>firſt Wo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The weakneſs of this proof,</hi> ſaith Mr. Jurieu, <hi>which is given us for invincible, is that it ſuppoſeth a thing which is not true, and which the Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author cannot evince by any ſort of reaſon, viz. that the plagues and the Vials are all compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108142:183"/>
under the third Wo.</hi> To whom that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> Anſwereth, that he hath proved the <hi>third Wo</hi> to be contained under the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> as the <hi>2d</hi> is comprehended in the <hi>ſixth,</hi> and the <hi>firſt</hi> in the <hi>fifth.</hi> And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> comprehendeth all the <hi>Vials,</hi> becauſe they are not poured out till after it hath ſounded, it invincibly follows, that the <hi>third Wo</hi> is comprehended in the <hi>ſeven Vials,</hi> and that the <hi>ſeven Vials</hi> do execute the <hi>third Wo.</hi> Nor is it to be helped, if <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> will not ſee what <hi>St. Iohn</hi> ſo plainly declareth unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To demonſtrate,</hi> ſaith Mr. Jurieu, <hi>that the ſeven Vials are not comprehended in the 3d Wo, 'tis ſufficient to prove, as we have done, that the ſeven Vials are ſeven Periods of time, which run along, as water runneth out of an hour-glaſs.</hi> This principle of <hi>Mr. Iurieu,</hi> that the <hi>Vials</hi> are <hi>ſeven Periods</hi> of time, we have fully refuted; &amp; have made it appear, that both his <hi>principle,</hi> and the reaſons by which he endeavours to maintain it, are worth nothing. So that if he hath nothing elſe to alledg, whereby to make it appear, that the <hi>Third Wo</hi> is not contained in the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous Author's</hi> argument may be ſtill cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led invincible.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>Mr. Iurieu's</hi> ſuppoſition, that the <hi>ſixth Trumpet</hi> under which we are, hath been exerting its Influences for almoſt eight hundred <hi>years,</hi> and that its ſubdivided into <hi>ſeven Vials,</hi> is a moſt falſe principle, and unto which we have oppoſed that which is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108142:184"/>
Namely, that all the 1ſt 6 <hi>Trumpets</hi> do ſound before the effuſion of any <hi>Vial;</hi> becauſe according to <hi>St. Iohn,</hi> there is not one of them poured out till under the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> which hath not yet begun to ſound. For as none of the <hi>Trumpets</hi> ſound, till after the opening of the <hi>ſeventh Seal;</hi> ſo none of the <hi>Vials</hi> are to be poured forth, till under the ſounding of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet.</hi> Mr. Jurieu confeſſeth, that the H. Spirit hath not evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, that the <hi>ſixth Trumpet</hi> is ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 7 <hi>Vials,</hi> but he ſay's, <hi>it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from this, that whereas the ſeventh Trumpet was ſounding when the Turks invaded the Grecian Empire, which was about the tenth Century, and that we find the firſt Vial to have fallen about that time upon the Empire of the Beaſt, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the courſe of the Vials muſt be contained under the ſixth Trumpet.</hi> To which I anſwer, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this ariſeth from the words of the <hi>Propheſie;</hi> unleſs in the vertu' of his principle, that <hi>the Vials are periods of times, and hour-glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which run along with the ſixth Trumpet,</hi> all which we have shew'd to be falſe. And have made it appear, that the irruption of the <hi>Turks</hi> upon the <hi>Grecian Empire,</hi> is an effect of the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> but not of the <hi>ſixth Vial,</hi> this being yet to be poured out, as alſo the <hi>five</hi> firſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anonymous Author's</hi> fourth argument againſt the Effuſion of the <hi>Vials,</hi> was, that the <hi>Vials</hi> are nothing elſe but the <hi>ſeven Thunders</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. Now the ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> are adjourned till the ſounding of the <hi>ſeventh
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108142:184"/>
Trumpet;</hi> becauſe <hi>St. Iohn</hi> being about to write, 'twas ſaid to him, <hi>ſeal the things which the ſeven Thunders uttered, and write them not.</hi> Why ſo? becauſe they were not to be executed <hi>till the Myſtery of God should be finished,</hi> which is not to be till under the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> in that the Myſtery of God is nothing but the ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of all the Kingdoms of this world to Jeſus Chriſt. And if there be any difference between the <hi>Vials</hi> and the <hi>Thunders,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in this, that the <hi>Thunders</hi> are the <hi>denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations</hi> of Gods Judgments, and the <hi>Vials</hi> the <hi>Execution</hi> of them. For tho the <hi>Thunders</hi> were heard by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> under the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> yet it was only in order to their being Executed under the <hi>7th,</hi> under which all the <hi>Vials</hi> shall be poured out.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſee, how <hi>Mr. Iurieu,</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelf from this Argument. I <hi>crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of the Anonymous Author, if I tell him that this Ratiocination of his is attended with two conſiderable faults. (1) That it ſuppoſeth a thing which is more than doubtful, namely, that the ſeven Thunders and the ſeven Vials are the ſame. I'm at a loſs upon what ground he builds an opinion ſo extraordinary, and which is ſo little agreeable to his own principles. For as to the number of 7, which is found equally in the Thunders and in the Vials<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the world knows it can be no proof: otherway's the ſeven Spirits, the ſeven Candleſticks, and the ſeven Trumpets, would all be the ſame thing that the ſeven Vials are.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Mr. Jurieu would have freed himſelf from the <hi>Anonymous Author's</hi> argument, he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108142:185"/>
ought to have overthrown the whole foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it, and not have left the principal part of it as he hath done. For the foundation upon which the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> raiſed his argument, conſiſteth not only in this, that the Number <hi>ſeven</hi> belongeth equally to the <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> as to the <hi>Vials,</hi> as he groundleſly ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; but upon this, that the <hi>Thunders</hi> ſignify the judgments of God againſt the Enemies of his Church, as well as the <hi>Vials</hi> do. And upon this, that the things uttered by the <hi>ſeven Thunders,</hi> are delayed till the ſounding of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> as appears by the Anſwer given to St. <hi>Iohn</hi> when he was about to write. This being the whole foundation of that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's</hi> argument, and <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> having no way's overthrown it, becauſe indeed it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that it should be skaken, being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that Author's proof remaineth in all its force.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> fault which Mr. Jurieu finds with that argument, is this; <hi>the foundation of it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>accordeth not with the Author's Principles; ſeeing if the Thunders &amp; the ſeven Vials are not to take up above the ſpace of twelve or fifteen years, and this towards the End of Antichriſts Reign, how comes an affair; which is to poſſeſs ſo ſmall a Space during the Antichriſtian Empire, to be ſpoken of, before there is any thing ſaid of the birth and progreſs of that Empire? And why doth the Holy Spirit ſpeak to</hi> St. John <hi>of the ſeven Thunders, which are to ſubvert an Empire, of whoſe riſe and grandure he had not yet ſpoken one word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:108142:185"/>If Mr. Jurieu would have underſtood the Author's <hi>principles,</hi> he would have ſeen that the <hi>Author's</hi> opinion about the ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> do's perfectly agree with them. For one of the moſt ſolid principles of that Author is, that the <hi>Trumpets</hi> shew us the eſtablishment and grandure of the <hi>Papcy</hi> &amp; of <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> and that the ſeven <hi>Vials,</hi> when they come to be poured out, will deſtroy them. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſeeing <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> acknowledgeth, that the <hi>Thunders</hi> ſignify the <hi>judgments</hi> of God, and that the number <hi>Seven</hi> ſignifieth the <hi>perfection</hi> of his Judgments; what can be more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, than to conclude as that <hi>Author</hi> do's, that the <hi>Thunders</hi> are the denunciation of that dreadful ſtorm that will fall upon the Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Vials? Mr. Jurieu,</hi> cannot but confeſs, that the <hi>Thunders</hi> repreſenting the judgments of God againſt the Enemies of his Church, cannot without violence be placed under the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> becauſe theſe give both birth unto the Churches Enemies, and ſuffer them to grow and ſubſiſt.</p>
                  <p>I do not know why <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> should place in the numher of the Author's Arguments againſt the effuſion of the <hi>Vials,</hi> that which he had not ſaid, ſave only to prove that they shall be poured out without the interpoſure of any conſiderable time between the one and the other. And that becauſe 'tis ſaid <hi>chap. 10. v.</hi> 6. that <hi>the Angel ſware there should be time no longer.</hi> For 'tis evident, that the Author did not alledg this, ſave only to make it appear, that the <hi>Vials</hi> shall be poured forth, the one
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108142:186"/>
immediately after the other; for the proof whereof he had brought the Angels Oath, ſwearing, that <hi>time should be no longer.</hi> Which is as much as if he had expreſly ſaid, there should be no longer delay, no longer forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that the Patience of God should no longer reſtrain his wrath againſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Now this <hi>Oath</hi> being ſworn after the ſounding of the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> and before the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> under which the <hi>Thunders</hi> were to manifeſt themſelves, and the <hi>Vials</hi> to be poured out; it can have reference to nothing, but to the ſeven <hi>Thunders</hi> and the ſeven <hi>Vials,</hi> which are to accomplish the wrath of God againſt his Enemies, and at the ſame time to conſummate the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennian</hi> Reign.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> hath put this conſideration into the number of that <hi>Author's</hi> proofs againſt the effuſion of the <hi>Vials,</hi> becauſe he ſaw that the ſaid Author could have Reaſoned thus; <hi>All the Vials are to be poured out immediately after one another, and in a very short ſpace of time, as appeareth by the Angels Oath; and therefore 'tis not true that they have been running out for theſe 800 years; nor is it true that the</hi> ſeventh <hi>hath been a pouring out all along ſince</hi> Luther <hi>began to preach.</hi> And whereas the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> had further remarked towards the proof of the ſame thing, that when the <hi>3d Wo</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, 'tis ſaid, <hi>behold the 3d Wo cometh quickly;</hi> which word <hi>quickly</hi> had not been made uſe of in the denunciation of the <hi>two</hi> firſt <hi>Woes.</hi> Then, I ſay, <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108142:186"/>
no Anſwer, which giveth ground to believe, that he had nothing ſolid to Reply.</p>
                  <p>But poſſibly <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> may ſay, that this <hi>quickly</hi> ought to be underſtood with reference to the <hi>two</hi> firſt <hi>Woes,</hi> namely, that the <hi>3d Wo</hi> shall more cloſly follow the <hi>2d,</hi> than the <hi>2d</hi> followed the <hi>1ſt;</hi> and that this doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the <hi>Vials</hi> are to be poured out ſo near one to another, nor with ſo great cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I Anſwer unto him, that this cannot be the meaning of it, becauſe the <hi>three Woes</hi> are confined to the <hi>three laſt Trumpets;</hi> the <hi>1ſt</hi> to the <hi>fifth,</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> to the <hi>ſixth,</hi> and the <hi>third</hi> to the <hi>ſeventh.</hi> For according to <hi>Mr. Iurieu,</hi> the <hi>ſixth</hi> hath been exerting its Influences for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt theſe 800 years, and the <hi>3d Wo</hi> is not yet come, nor shall come till under the ſound of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet.</hi> So that the whole courſe of the <hi>fifth Trumpet</hi> was not ſo far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> to which the <hi>2d Wo</hi> is attributed; as the whole Courſe of the <hi>6th</hi> is diſtant from the beginning of the <hi>7th;</hi> under which the <hi>3d Wo</hi> is to arrive. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be owned, that the word <hi>quickly</hi> being uſed only in reference to the <hi>3d Wo,</hi> ſignifieth that all the <hi>plagues,</hi> or which is the ſame thing, that all the <hi>Vials</hi> shall be poured out cloſe upon one another; and that it doth as much as import; that there shall not be ſo much time employed for deſtroying the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as there was for the raiſing of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> had obliged the <hi>Anonymous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:108142:187"/>
if he had anſwered that which occurs in the Preface to his <hi>Illuſtrations,</hi> and which is layd down in theſe Terms. 'Tis evident that there are in the <hi>Revelation three principal Viſions,</hi> in which are contained all the great <hi>Events</hi> that relate to the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> and to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, i. e. which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the <hi>True</hi> Church and the <hi>Falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Theſe <hi>Viſions,</hi> are thoſe of the <hi>Seals,</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Vials.</hi> All the other are but <hi>Draughts,</hi> in which what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Viſions of the <hi>Seals, Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> and <hi>Vials,</hi> is reaſſumed, enlarged, and more circumſtantially explained. For the name <hi>Seven,</hi> which is <hi>Myſtical,</hi> and which implies <hi>perfection,</hi> do's inform us, that theſe <hi>three Viſions</hi> comprehend all. For 'tis found in that of the <hi>Seals,</hi> in that of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and in that of the <hi>Vials,</hi> and alſo in that of the <hi>Thunders,</hi> which are the Forerunners of the <hi>Vials.</hi> Moreover, theſe <hi>three Viſions,</hi> are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately link'd one to another; ſo that the <hi>ſecond,</hi> which is that of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> beginneth under the <hi>7th Seal;</hi> and the <hi>3d,</hi> which is that of the <hi>Vials,</hi> beginneth under the <hi>7th Trumpet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As this is the foundation of the <hi>Anonymous</hi> Author's <hi>Syſteme,</hi> and as he hath there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the <hi>Key of the Revelation; Mr. Iurieu,</hi> who knows the art of Reaſoning, might have obſerved in that <hi>Preface</hi> a chain of Ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation able to dazle the Eyes of the Reader. For if it be true, that the <hi>Vials</hi> are not poured out till under the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> as the <hi>Trumpets</hi> ſound not till upon the opening of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108142:187"/>
the <hi>Seventh Seal;</hi> then it is moſt certain, that all the <hi>Vials</hi> remain ſtill to be poured out, foraſmuch as the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> hath not yet ſounded, and that we are hitherto under the <hi>Sixth.</hi> Even as it might be juſtly ſaid, that none of the <hi>Trumpets</hi> had ſounded; provided it were true that we were yet under the <hi>Sixth Seal,</hi> and, that the <hi>Seventh</hi> were not until this time opened. This Reaſon doth neceſſarily &amp; naturally follow from that which the <hi>Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author</hi> had layd down in his Preface, and which is the foundation of his Syſteme. And if <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> hath vouchſafed no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, doubtleſs it is becauſe he could find no difficulty in it.</p>
                  <p>To the foregoing Arguments, the <hi>Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author</hi> will add two more, which whether he shall call proofs or difficulties, is to him indifferent. The <hi>firſt</hi> ariſeth from the comparing <hi>Rev. chap. 11. v.</hi> 19. with <hi>chap. 15. v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. In <hi>chap.</hi> 11. we read, that <hi>the Temple of God was opened in Heaven, and that there was ſeen in his Temple the Ark of his Teſtament, and that there were lightnings, and voices, and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, and an Earthquake, and great haile.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 15. we read that <hi>St. Iohn looked, &amp; behold the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Teſtimony in Heaven was opened; and the ſeven Angels who had the ſeven plagues came out of the Temple, and one of the four Living Creatures gave to the ſeven Angels ſeven golden Vials full of the Wrath of the Living God.</hi> 'Tis evident that theſe two <hi>Viſions</hi> are parralel; and that they both tend to one and the ſame End. For in each of them we find
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108142:188"/>
the opening of the Temple of God, which had been shut againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> but is now opened to receive them. In the one we ſee the Ark of the Covenant, in the other the Tabernacle of Teſtimony. This <hi>Ark</hi> and this <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> are <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> whom the <hi>Iews</hi> shall come to Adore. <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Mahometiſm</hi> are the two great obſtacles, which hinder the converſion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and which confirm them in their obſtinacy; but behold ſeven <hi>Angels,</hi> who receive ſeven <hi>Vials,</hi> for the deſtruction of the <hi>Papacy</hi> and <hi>Mahometiſm.</hi> Now the <hi>Temple</hi> of God not being <hi>opened</hi> till under the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> which hath not yet ſounded, it invincibly followeth, that none of all the <hi>Vials</hi> are hitherto poured out.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anonymous Author's</hi> other new Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he addeth to the former, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from that which <hi>St. Iohn</hi> ſays, <hi>chap. 15. v. 1.

                     </hi> For the <hi>12th chap.</hi> is a commentary upon the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets;</hi> becauſe we find in that <hi>chap.</hi> the ſame thing that we find in the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Trumpets;</hi> namely, the <hi>War</hi> of the <hi>Dragon</hi> againſt the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and againſt <hi>thoſe</hi> that are of her <hi>Seed.</hi> So that <hi>St. Iohn</hi> coming to ſay <hi>chap.</hi> 15. with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108142:188"/>
reſpect to the Subject of the <hi>ſeven Plagues,</hi> which are the <hi>Seven Vials, I ſaw another great Sign in Heaven;</hi> 'tis plain that this <hi>Sign</hi> is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the <hi>firſt,</hi> and repreſents quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing. So that if the Holy Spirit do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in <hi>this</hi> the ruin of the <hi>Papal Empire,</hi> as he had predicted in <hi>that</hi> the birth and growth of the ſaid <hi>Empire;</hi> we cannot make the <hi>Vials</hi> to be poured forth under the <hi>Sixth Trumpet,</hi> without mixing what the Spirit of God would ſeparate, and without <hi>confounding</hi> two <hi>different Signs,</hi> and the <hi>different things</hi> which are repreſented by thoſe Signs.</p>
                  <p>To which Arguments there may be yet a <hi>third</hi> ſubjoined, grounded upon <hi>chap. 15. v.</hi> 8. For 'tis there ſaid, that after one of the <hi>four</hi> living Creatures had given to the ſeven <hi>Angels</hi> ſeven <hi>Vials</hi> full of the wrath of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, <hi>the Temple was filled with ſmoke from the glory of God, and from his Power, and no man was able to enter into the Temple, till the 7 plagues of the ſeven Angels were fulfilled.</hi> From thence there clearly reſult two Truths. <hi>One,</hi> that the <hi>ſeven plagues</hi> and the <hi>ſeven Vials</hi> are one and the ſame thing, and that they ſignify the ſame Judgments of God: Which is againſt the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Mr. Iurieu,</hi> who pretendeth, <hi>that the plagues are a different thing from the Vials; that the plagues are the judgments of God, and the Vials periods of Time.</hi> The <hi>other,</hi> that the Prophecy doth not ſay, <hi>no man could enter into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, until the ſeventh Vial of the ſeventh Angel was fulfilled, but untill the ſeven Vials of the ſeven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were fulfilled.</hi> Which sheweth us, that none
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108142:189"/>
of them are yet poured out; becauſe it is only under the <hi>Seventh Trumpet,</hi> which hath not yet ſounded, that the <hi>Seven Angels</hi> receive the <hi>ſeven Vials</hi> to pour them out. And that it is not until then, <hi>that the Temple is to be filled with Smoke from the glory of God and his power;</hi> which as it denotes an extraordinary mark of the Gracious preſence of God in the midſt of his <hi>Church,</hi> ſo 'tis that which we have not yet ſeen. This <hi>prophecy</hi> doth manifeſtly allude to the <hi>Cloud</hi> that filled the Tabernacle of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Temple of <hi>Solomon. Exod. 40. 34, 35. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Kings</hi> 8. 10.</p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> had eſſay'd, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Reaſons by which the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> had proved, that all the <hi>Vials</hi> are ſtill to be poured out; he in the next place endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to confute the ſignification of a <hi>Cup</hi> or <hi>Boul,</hi> which that <hi>Author</hi> had aſcribed to the <hi>Vials. How is it,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that he doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the figure of Vials is not borrowed from the cups of Gods wrath, but from hour-glaſſes?</hi> This we have already refuted, and made it appear, that tho the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Term <hi>Vial</hi> should ſometimes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify an <hi>hourglaſs,</hi> yet it cannot have that ſenſe here. Becauſe <hi>Hour-glaſſes of Gold</hi> are no way's fit to indicate Time, which is meaſured by the running of <hi>Water</hi> or <hi>Sand.</hi> And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe the term <hi>Golden Vial,</hi> is uſed <hi>Chap 5. v.</hi> 8. to import a <hi>Cup,</hi> and not an <hi>hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us ſee whether what <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> adds next, be more to the purpoſe. <hi>The form of Cups,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is altogether different from that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108142:189"/>
of Vials. For theſe have a large belly and a narrow mouth, whereas Cups on the contrary are wide above and narrow below, which make ſome ſay, that the Vials are poured into Cups, that ſo men may drink what was in the Vial, as I have obſerved in reporting the common opinion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There can be nothing more impertinent than this ſpeculation. For whatſoever oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition he ſuppoſeth between the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Vials</hi> and of <hi>Cups;</hi> yet 'tis certain, that all the beſt <hi>Greek Author's,</hi> call that which we drink in by the name of <hi>Vial.</hi> And whoſoever hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Labourers at their refreshment, muſt needs know, that they carry nothing into the fields with them ſave <hi>Bottles,</hi> which have a large belly, and a narrow mouth, and that by the ſtrait mouth, they are ſo able to drink the liquor out of the Bottle, as to empty it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But this,</hi> ſaith Mr. Jurieu, <hi>after I have better thought upon it, is not the point; for I affirm, that the figure of a drinking Cup hath no room in any part of this Viſion. Becauſe the Vial falls alway's on the Earth or on the Sea, but never into a Cup.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how could he forget that both the <hi>Term</hi> to <hi>drink,</hi> and the <hi>Term Cup,</hi> are uſed <hi>chap.</hi> 18. 3, 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which <hi>chapter</hi> is at leaſt a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the <hi>fifth Vial;</hi> ſeeing we find nothing in it, ſave a deſcription of the ruin of <hi>Babylon?</hi> Doth he not know, that <hi>Vials</hi> being uſed in this Viſion in a <hi>Myſtical</hi> ſenſe, do ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify nothing but the judgments of God, by which the Enemies of his <hi>Church</hi> are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed?
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108142:190"/>
And that unleſs it be in a <hi>Myſtical</hi> ſenſe, neither the Term <hi>Vial,</hi> nor that of a <hi>Cup,</hi> nor that of <hi>drinking,</hi> are any way to the purpoſe?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> had ſaid in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the <hi>fourth Vial,</hi> that the <hi>Sun</hi> upon which it falleth, is in all probability the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Roman Empire,</hi> and that as the <hi>fourth Trumpet</hi> raiſed the <hi>Turkish Empire,</hi> ſo the <hi>4th Vial</hi> shall shake and afflict it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I may obſerve,</hi> ſaith Mr. Jurieu, <hi>that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is contrary to all kind of principles. For whereas the ſeven Vials are alone deſigned againſt the Empire of the Beaſt, i. e. for Antichriſtianiſm, behold one of the Vials is ſaid to fall upon the Empire of the Turks, which is no part of the Antichriſtian Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Interpretation</hi> is not therefore contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all ſort of <hi>Principles,</hi> becauſe 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Mr. Jurieu.</hi> For 'tis according to this Principle, that the <hi>Revelation</hi> continueth the Hiſtory of the <hi>fourth Monarchy,</hi> which <hi>Daniel</hi> had begun. And that this <hi>Monarchy</hi> being the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> as it was in the time of <hi>St. Iohn;</hi> the Holy Spirit doth in the <hi>Viſions</hi> of the <hi>Seals,</hi> of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and of the <hi>Vials,</hi> repreſent unto us every thing of importance that was to befal it. Now whereas the <hi>Turks</hi> invading the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> part of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and their eſtablishing there both an <hi>Empire</hi> and the <hi>Mahometan Religion,</hi> was foretold in the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Trumpets;</hi> 'tis but reaſonable to affirm, that the <hi>Vials</hi> shall <hi>deſtroy</hi> that which the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> had raiſed in the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> as well as that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108142:190"/>
they shall <hi>deſtroy</hi> that which the ſame <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> have built in the <hi>Weſtern Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> had ſaid, that the Subjects of the Turkish Empire, shall be mortally afflicted by the Effuſion of that <hi>Vial;</hi> but that inſtead of being converted, they shall blaſpheme the name of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In oppoſition to this,</hi> Mr. Jurieu ſaith, <hi>that the Prophets give us to underſtand, that upon</hi> Babylons <hi>falling, all the Infidels, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Mahometans, shall be converted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do acknowledg, that after <hi>Babylon</hi> shall be fallen, the <hi>Mahometans</hi> shall be converted; but then it is not the <hi>fourth Vial</hi> which falleth upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſeeing it ſubſiſteth after that is poured out; and 'tis only the <hi>fifth Vial</hi> that deſtroyed the <hi>Antichriſtian Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I may add,</hi> ſaith Mr. Jurieu, <hi>that it being the Papal Empire which is intended in this Viſion, the Sun therefore of the fourth Vial can ſignify nothing but the Soveraign of that Empire which is ſpoken of, and ſo can only ſignify the Pope, and not the Turkish Emperor.</hi> But the falſity of this Principle we have made appear, by the Evidence we have given to a principle oppoſite unto it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> farther adds, I <hi>may alſo obſerve,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>that this is ſo far from ſignifying the ruin of the Turks, that granting them to be here ſpoken of, it would import their Exaltation. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as 'tis ſaid of the Sun mentioned in the fourth Vial, that power was given unto him to ſcorch men with fire; which implies their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108142:191"/>
others, rather than the being themſelves deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Anonymous Author,</hi> before his entring upon the Expoſition of the <hi>Vials,</hi> had made a declaration which should not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; namely, <hi>that ſeeing the Vials contain Iudgments to come, and which cannot be cleared up by Events, as the Viſion of the Trumpets may, that therefore he propoſed to ſpeak no otherway of them than in way of conjecture, which is a deference that we owe to the Author of Prophecy. However, that what he was to ſay would appear very probable, if the preceding Illuſtrations which he had delivered were du'ly thought upon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> do's believe, that the <hi>fourth Vial</hi> is to be poured out upon the <hi>Eaſtern Roman Empire,</hi> which is now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the <hi>Turks;</hi> and this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the relation that is between the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> and the <hi>Vials,</hi> the latter whereof shall overthrow what the former had built. But whether the <hi>Sun</hi> here ſignify preciſely the <hi>Turkish Emperor,</hi> or the <hi>Muſti,</hi> who is the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of Mahomet,</hi> is that which he can only conjecture at, but doth not certainly know. And tho he had ſaid, that this <hi>Vial</hi> shall <hi>shake</hi> and <hi>diſtreſs</hi> that <hi>Empire,</hi> yet he had not ſaid that it shall <hi>deſtroy</hi> it, as <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> chargeth upon him. There is a difference between thoſe two Expreſſions. The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> is shaken and brought very low in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what it was under <hi>Charles</hi> V. but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it is not ruined. The <hi>Papal Empire</hi> is brought low in reſpect of what it was under
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108142:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Leo</hi> X. but yet it remains undeſtroyed under <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. 'Tis the drying up the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> foretold to be under the <hi>Sixth Vial,</hi> which ſignifieth the total ruin of the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> and of <hi>Mahometiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But to paſs all this by,</hi> ſaith Mr. Jurieu, <hi>and only to obſerve, that if the fourth Vial anſwereth the fourth Trumpet, there is then no probability, that the fourth Trumpet having laſted ſeveral Ages, during which time the Turkish Empire was eſtablished, that the 4th Vial should in ſo short a ſpace ruin it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is yet another fancy which <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> fathers upon the <hi>Anonymous Author,</hi> namely, that the <hi>fourth Vial</hi> is wholly to deſtroy the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Whereas he expreſly ſaid, that that was not to be till under the <hi>ſixth Vial.</hi> And who knoweth what will be the courſe of Gods juſtice, when he once begins to execute his judgments? And when the Creator shall go about the making of a new world, can we think that his Arm is ſo shortned, that he needs more time for this ſecond world, than he did for the firſt?</p>
                  <p>Whereas the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> had in his Expoſition of the <hi>Vials</hi> followed <hi>Mr. de Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay; Mr. Iurieu</hi> ſayth, <hi>the ſaid Author might have perceived, that tho' the Explanation he hath given, agree with the hypotheſis of</hi> Mr. de Launay, <hi>yet it doth no way's accord with his own. And that becauſe</hi> Mr. de Launay <hi>placeth the End of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Empire many ages hence, while that Author will not allow above eighteen years for its ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:108142:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>Surely <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> would not have made this Reflection, if he had minded what that Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Expoſitor</hi> had ſaid upon the <hi>2d verſe</hi> of the <hi>Eleventh Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Where he makes this Remark, <hi>that the Scripture in the pointing out a thing of great moment, do's not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way's fix the beginning of it to a day or to a year, ſo that it may appear when it shall terminate or when it commenced; but takes notice of it ſometimes long before, and as it were from the firſt moment of its conception and peeping forth.</hi> And after he had alledged two examples out of the <hi>Old</hi> Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and one out of the <hi>New</hi> to this purpoſe, he adds, <hi>I am willing to make this obſervation, that it may thereby appear, that it is poſſible we are not ſo far from the End of 1260 years, as many do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</hi> Now we are to obſerve, that it is 36 years ſince <hi>Mr. de Launays Book</hi> was published, and that it had been written 16 years before it was ſent to <hi>Geneva</hi> where it was printed. What may we then think that holy man would have ſaid, had he lived until our time? And if 52 <hi>years</hi> after he had made that ingenious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> he had beheld this extraordinary <hi>revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which within theſe <hi>two years</hi> is fallen out in <hi>France,</hi> and whereof he had never thought, Doubtleſs he would have look't upon this <hi>judgment</hi> of God that is fallen upon the <hi>Church</hi> with a ſwiftneſs reſembling Lightning, and which like a fire from heaven hath ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly conſumed it, as a forerunner of a <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that shall come alike expeditiouſly, and fall with more ſwiftneſs upon <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and his <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi> who are the Cruel Enemies of his <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:108142:192"/>Finally, whereas the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> had ſtated the <hi>Epoche</hi> of the Birth of the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Empire</hi> to be the year 445. and had fixed its End to be in the year 1705 ſo that all the <hi>Vials</hi> muſt be poured out within the compaſs of <hi>eighteen</hi> years at moſt. <hi>Mr. Iurieu</hi> cries out againſt this, and ſays, <hi>he wonders how ſuch a thought could fall into the mind of a rational man, and how any perſon that had carefully ſtudied the Propheſies, as he confeſſeth the Anonymous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to have ſuccesfully done, should in this point ſo forget himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſaid <hi>Author</hi> hath neither forgotten himſelf here nor elſewhere. He conſidered his <hi>Illuſtrations</hi> oftner than once, and his aſſigning ſo short a time for the Effuſion of the <hi>Vials,</hi> is ſo far from being ſtrange or abſurd, that it is moſt natural &amp; rational. The 7 <hi>Thunders</hi> do naturally raiſe an <hi>Idea</hi> of a ſtorm that shall be extraordinary terrible, and that there shall be nothing wanting to make its horror per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, foraſmuch as the number <hi>ſeven</hi> notes perfection. Now a Storm or <hi>Hurrican</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with theſe two qualities, one that 'tis <hi>rapid,</hi> and the other that it doth not <hi>endure.</hi> From whence it followeth, that if the <hi>Thunders</hi> are to manifeſt themſelves in the Effuſion of the <hi>Vials,</hi> or that they are the <hi>Vials,</hi> as the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> thinks he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that then the ſpace of 18 or of 15 years, may be time enough for the pouring them out.</p>
                  <p>In a word, this Storm will in its riſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble <hi>Elijah's Cloud,</hi> which at firſt was but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108142:193"/>
as the <hi>Palm of a mans hand mounting out of she Sea,</hi> but whoſe growth was ſo ſwift and rapid, <hi>that</hi> Ahab <hi>was forced to get haſtily into his charriot, that he might not be overtaken by the abundance of rain that fell, 2 Kings</hi> 18. 44, 45.</p>
                  <p>But if the <hi>ſeven Vials</hi> should have no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>ſeven Thunders,</hi> as <hi>Mr. Jurieu</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines they have not; yet it cannot be denied, but that they manifeſtly allude to the <hi>Plagues</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe they are called <hi>plagues</hi> as well as they are ſtiled <hi>Vials.</hi> And this will ſuffice to shew the <hi>Anonymous Author's</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to be extreamly natural. Seeing the <hi>plagues</hi> with which God ſmote <hi>Egypt,</hi> did not take up <hi>fifteen years.</hi> 'Tis true, the ſacred <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> doth not expreſs the time that elapſed from the <hi>firſt</hi> plague until the <hi>laſt;</hi> all that it doth being to note that there paſt one <hi>Month</hi> from the death of the <hi>firſt born,</hi> till the time of paſſing through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> where the whole power of <hi>Egypt</hi> was ſwallowed up and buried. And ſeeing we are not to allot <hi>years,</hi> and may be need not to allow <hi>Months</hi> for the Execution of all the <hi>Egyptian Plagues;</hi> doth it ſeem ſtrange that the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> should conceive, that all the <hi>Vials</hi> will be poured <hi>forth</hi> within the ſpace of 18 or 15 years.</p>
                  <p>Let us alſo remember, that as there is no natural Agent which acteth with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity that <hi>Fire</hi> doth; ſo <hi>our God is a conſuming Fire, and 'tis a terrible thing to fall into his hands.</hi> This <hi>Fire</hi> devoured in leſs than <hi>three Months</hi> all the <hi>Churches</hi> of a great <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And if the divine Vengeance hath taken ſo little time
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108142:193"/>
to deſtroy his own houſe; what offence can it be to conceive that he will take but 15 or 18 <hi>years</hi> to deſtroy <hi>Babylon</hi> and her <hi>Empire?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid, that there were more than 18 years required to the <hi>firſt Reformation.</hi> And how then is it probable that there shall not be more required for the <hi>laſt,</hi> for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral one, which shall extend it ſelf univerſally, as well over all <hi>Infidels,</hi> as over the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Pagans?</hi> It may not be amiſs to hear what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſpeaketh of the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Luther,</hi> in the Preface to his Controverſies. <hi>Who is there,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that doth not know, how the Lutheran Hereſie being born a little while ſince in</hi> Saxony, <hi>like a peſtilence overran all</hi> Germany <hi>in a little time, and how having ſpread it ſelf into the North and Eaſt, it infected</hi> Denmark, Norway, Swedland, Gothland <hi>and</hi> Hungary? <hi>And having extended it ſelf with the like ſwiftneſs into the Weſt &amp; South, how it there deſolated</hi> France, England, Scotland, <hi>and how at laſt it croſſed the Alps, &amp; even entred into</hi> Italy? Now the <hi>Anonymous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> is fully perſwaded, that the <hi>general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> which will comprehend the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishment of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> will proceed more ſwiftly and be diſpatched with a great deal more rapidity. Foraſmuch as it is ſaid of the <hi>third Wo,</hi> that contains the Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Vials;</hi> behold the <hi>3d Wo cometh quickly;</hi> which is not ſaid in reference to the <hi>two</hi> former, and where this word <hi>quickly</hi> doth not appear. He is alſo perſwaded, that there is no man who will not eaſily be brought to be of his mind, that do's but reflect upon
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108142:194"/>
the power, upon the Juſtice, and upon the Jealouſy of him, who is to be the Admirable <hi>Author</hi> of this wonderful <hi>Reformation,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of his beloved <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable Judg of <hi>Babylon,</hi> againſt whom he hath himſelf denounced <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 8. that the plagues wherewith she is threatned shall come in <hi>one day,</hi> or in <hi>one hour,</hi> as the Original hath it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, should we grant to <hi>Mr. Iurieu,</hi> that the 7. <hi>plagues</hi> are a thing diſtinct from the 7. <hi>Vials,</hi> and that the 7. <hi>Vials</hi> are <hi>hour-glaſses;</hi> it would nevertheleſs appear that 15 or 18 years is a time long enough for thoſe <hi>Glaſſes</hi> to run out in; nor was it hitherto heard, that there was a <hi>Glaſs</hi> for the meaſuring of <hi>Time,</hi> which required a <hi>year,</hi> or a <hi>Month,</hi> or ſo much as a <hi>day</hi> to run out in.</p>
                  <p>This is what the <hi>Anonymous Author</hi> hath to Anſwer in Defence of his <hi>Illuſtrations,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the illuſtrious <hi>Author,</hi> who hath taken the pains to attack them. And he is fully perſwaded, that the <hi>ſeven Vials</hi> are the 7 <hi>Plagues,</hi> and that the <hi>ſeven Plagues</hi> are the future judgments of God, of which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to ſee the Execution about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>next Age.</hi> If any one can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of the contrary, by Reaſons which he cannot ſolidly Reply unto, he is not ſo fond of his opinion as to make it his <hi>Idol,</hi> but is immediately ready both to renounce it, and to publish to the world that he was mistaken. For having the Example of the great <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> in his <hi>Retractations</hi> before him, he will account it no shame to make
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108142:194"/>
ſuch a confeſſion, becauſe he ſeeks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Diſpute, but the clearing up of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the Edification of the <hi>Publick.</hi>
