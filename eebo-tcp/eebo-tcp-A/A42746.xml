         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Honour'd Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I am so far from being Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of the Censure of any <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Man, for Dedicating a Book of this Nature to a Man of your <hi>Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that I'm satisfyed I shou'd have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd your Merit in choosing any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:59793:3"/>
Patron for That, in which the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ENGLISH NATION is in some Degree defended: for tho' I confess the <hi>States Man</hi> (according to our Modern Notion) has little to do with the ensuing Discourses; yet I'm very sure the TRUE ENGLISH MAN (a Name I know you far more value) must extreamly interest you in them; for the <hi>Patriots</hi> Zeal ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the <hi>Glory,</hi> as well as <hi>Happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of his Country: so that you must be <hi>pleas'd</hi> to shelter with your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, a Piece that aims at a Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our known RIGHT and HONOUR, which are impiously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, and as <hi>weakly,</hi> as <hi>ignobly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd to a <hi>Foreign People,</hi> by a <hi>big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted</hi> Veneration for a former Age. But <hi>Poetry,</hi> Sir, will appear from the following <hi>Essays,</hi> to be a Prize we ought no more to surrender to <hi>Foreign</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59793:3"/>
Nations than our <hi>Courage</hi> or <hi>Liberty.</hi> For <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> who have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us the noblest Examples of the Latter, have been the most famous for the Former. And as we are not inferior to either of those <hi>Common-Wealths,</hi> in the Honor of <hi>Arms,</hi> or the Wisdom of our Laws, so I can never yield them the precedence in <hi>Poetry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this <hi>Glory</hi> I plead for, a meer <hi>Noitionary Fantout,</hi> which affords no Benefit to the <hi>Public,</hi> as is evident from its very <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Design,</hi> as well as the Authority of the Wisest Nations, who have Esteem'd POETS very necessary, as well as very Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable Members of the <hi>Common-Wealth.</hi> This <hi>Athens</hi> thought, when on the loss of <hi>Eupolis</hi> in a Sea Fight, she decreed that no <hi>Poet</hi> shou'd for the future, ever venture himself in the
<pb facs="tcp:59793:4"/>
War, least by one Fatal Blow, a Treasure should be lost, an Age cou'd not repair, for POETS <hi>were not born ev'ry Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Veneration which <hi>Greece</hi> paid the Poets, is built on the innate Excellence of their Art. <hi>Pleasure</hi> is the Sovereign Aim of all Men, 'tis that which the <hi>Soul</hi> naturally and justly desires, and for which 'tis made, and what the greatest <hi>Stoic</hi> persues; for 'tis impossible for any Man to desire <hi>Pain.</hi> Now <hi>Poetry</hi> do's not only make <hi>Pleasure,</hi> its <hi>Medium</hi> but its <hi>Aim,</hi> and so employs the surest Means to obtain the noblest <hi>End.</hi> Majestic and delightful Numbers, surprizing and noble Thoughts, and Charming Expressions, awake all the Faculties of the Soul, to receive the <hi>Mighty Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> it imparts, which all terminate in the most <hi>Solid,</hi> and <hi>Rational Pleasure.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59793:4"/>
For they either establish some Virtue by a great <hi>Example,</hi> or by the same, punish some <hi>Vice,</hi> or redicule, and lash some <hi>Folly,</hi> that may be injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to our <hi>Happyness;</hi> the Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which on the Basis of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> fixes us in the sweet <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of the <hi>Greatest</hi> and most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of <hi>Pleasures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a farther <hi>Proof</hi> of <hi>Poetry</hi>'s, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Friend to, and promoter of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;</hi> and an Enemy to <hi>Vice,</hi> 'tis obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that all the <hi>Heroes</hi> and Men of <hi>Virtue</hi> of Antiquity lov'd and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd <hi>Poetry,</hi> and that the worst of <hi>Princes,</hi> and greatest TYRANTS al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways persecuted, and hated the <hi>Poets,</hi> as their known and most dangerous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, for they wou'd spare no <hi>Vice</hi> in the most powerful Offenders. <hi>Lucan</hi> fear'd not in the time of the greatest Tyrant of the <hi>Caesars,</hi> to extoll <hi>Cato</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59793:5"/>
the most obstinate Stickler for his Countrys Liberty against the first of 'em; and he chooses rather to condemn <hi>Providence</hi> for the success, the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Liberty of <hi>Rome</hi> met with, than not praise <hi>Cato</hi> for dying with his falling Country. <hi>Victrix causa dijs placuit, sed Victa Catoni.</hi> The POETS indeed have been the bold Persecutors of <hi>Vice</hi> in all Ages, and have ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded <hi>Virtue</hi> with <hi>Immortality.</hi> They are beneficial to <hi>Posterity,</hi> by conveying to it the most prevailing Motives Illustrious Examples, so that he that is a generous Patron of the MUSES, is a Benefactor to Ages to come, as well as to the Present.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carmen amat quisquis, Carmine Digna gerit.</hi> is a certain Truth; For the very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for performing Vertuous Actions, hold for the care of those that make them eternal, <hi>viz. the good of Others,</hi>

the <hi>public Benefit.</hi> To which Sir, your whole Life and Endeavours ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been zealously applyed, I cannot doubt but you will by your patronizing <hi>Poetry,</hi> compleat the noble end of your <hi>Honourable Ambition.</hi> Then may Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity see in YOU, Sir, such a pattern of <hi>Fortitude, Temperance, Wisdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Bounty,</hi> and all other Virtues that make a Man truly Great, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying You alone, wou'd make e'm all <hi>Happy</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi> I'm too unskilful a Dawber to dare to venture on drawing so noble an Image, as both your private and public Life compose.

            <p>
               <hi>THere is no Man, I think, doubts but that 'tis</hi> Variety <hi>that composes the</hi> Regale <hi>of the</hi> Mind, <hi>as well as that of the</hi> Body, <hi>which has made me have a regard to that in the following Book; for I have intermixt things</hi> Historical, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Amorous <hi>and</hi> Gallant, <hi>with the rougher Critical Discourses. Some will gratifie the</hi> Fancy, <hi>others the</hi> Judgment, <hi>or at least I design'd they shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>In the hurry of writing I forgot one very good Defence of a Passage in the</hi> Othello <hi>of</hi> Shakespear, <hi>which Mr.</hi> Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>has loudly exclaim'd against, and which a very good Friend of mine advis'd me to insert in the</hi> Preface; <hi>'tis this,</hi>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Rymer <hi>will have it, that a rap at the Door wou'd better express</hi> Jago<hi>'s Meaning, than all that noise; but if Mr.</hi> Rymer <hi>wou'd consult the Reason of the thing he'll find, that the noise</hi> Roderigo <hi>and</hi> Jago <hi>made, contributed very much to their design of surpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and alarming</hi> Brabantio, <hi>by that, to transport him from Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a violent Passion.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am sorry, that a Man of Mr.</hi> Rymer<hi>'s Learning shou'd be so bigotted to the</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, <hi>as to become an Enemy to the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59793:8"/>
               <hi>Honor of his own Country in that thing, which is perhaps the only we can truly pretend to excel all others in,</hi> viz. Poetry. Courage, Virtue <hi>and</hi> Wisdom, Greece <hi>and</hi> ROME <hi>will never be out-Rival'd in, but I am apt to think they have both been out-done in</hi> Poetry <hi>by the English; and tho' the latter once subdu'd this Island, yet were she now in all her Glory, with all the Encouragements she gave her</hi> Poets, <hi>she wou'd confess her self conquer'd in</hi> Poetry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For notwithstanding all those Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements</hi> Poets <hi>met with there, and the want of 'em here in</hi> England, <hi>we have the Honor to have more and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Poets <hi>than ever</hi> Greece <hi>or</hi> Rome <hi>saw. So that Poetry like a Tree, Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted to a foreign Clime, grew not, with all their Care and Cultivation, so kindly, as here without any. Poetry, being therefore our Native Right, I hope the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59793:9"/>
               <hi>moderate Reader will excuse the Heat I sometimes run into in the Defence of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I hope too the Graver Gentlemen, the Precisians, will not be scandaliz'd at my Zeal for the Promotion of Poetry, because the Reason of it is, that 'tis observable from History, that the Decay and Neglect of that, always was a fatal Symptom of the Loss of Antient Virtue, Power and Glory.</hi>

All the Wonders, Mercies, and Favours of the highest God, can in nothing be more gloriously express'd than in Verse: Who can describe the Beauty of his Providence, the Bounty of his Gifts, the Sacredness of his Mysteries, with such Charms, such Force, such Excellence, as the Poet in his Melodious Numbers, Majestic Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and Divine Thoughts.

Without doubt by this time 'tis sufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. That if any Art merits Esteem, either for the Antiquity of its Origine, or the Nobility of its Subject, Poetry must be granted the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Precedence in Honor. Wherefore I shall say no more for a Proof of these two points of its Original and Subject, but now turn our Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the third Branch of my Division, <hi>viz.</hi> The End and Profit, or advantage of <hi>Poetry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Philosophers lay down two principal kinds of Studies, which are indeed different, but not opposite; that is, the <hi>Contemplative</hi> and the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical,</hi> and they give the preference to the former, because Contemplation is pleasant for and in its self, and therefore more Noble; but the Practical <hi>quatenus</hi> practical is so only in regard of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, and therefore less Noble than Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. But 'tis sufficiently evident, that the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Poetry is for the most part Contemplative: Since no Poet is capable of forming any Noble Poem, with elaborateness and perfection, unless he first <hi>dispose</hi> his Speculations, and before consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and weigh the Materials, and the peculiar Artifice that must be us'd in setting them off to their best advantage, and in the true Ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>nd Colours. And one thing is here to be ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d, That a Poet through his whole performance, both whil'd he contrives, invents, and puts his Thoughts in Metre, is still at the same time contemplating, so that he's compos'd of Speculation and Action, whereas other Studies either only contemplate, or only precisely put in Execution the destin'd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59793:22"/>
First therefore, in that way <hi>Poetry</hi> is <hi>Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> in its self, and therefore admitting the former Axiom of the Philosophers, to be valu'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd, because Speculative. And Secondly, 'Tis Useful in regard of something else, because the Poetical Writings chiefly contain, the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and inviting Doctrines, and Instructions, the best of Precepts for the happy and laudable directing of our Lives; Noble Sayings, and Deeds, Virtues, Rights and Manners of Nations. From all which, that may be chosen for the common benefit of Mankind, that is most justly imitable, and worthy in Virtue, that avoided, that is most abominable and detested in Vice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contemplation</hi> and <hi>Thinking</hi> is peculiarly the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et's Business, on this Depends all the Beauties of Thought, and Expression. By using much to <hi>Think,</hi> they come to a justness and trueness of <hi>Thought,</hi> they run not away by halves, with imperfect Appearances that please the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; they are not taken with all that gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, but by much <hi>Thinking</hi> dive into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things, and fix the Judgment to decide the Truth, or falsity of what is Charming, and Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e proceed Justness, Proportion and Uarmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, without all which a Poet loses half his Glory, and Reputation with good Judges. From hence 'tis evident, That the End of Poetry is Noble, since it reaches the greatest Pleasure and the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Profit, of our Minds, and of our Life. Since 'tis directed to the Praise, of the Omnipotent, the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59793:23"/>
Celebration of Virtues, the Rewards and Glory of Noble Acts, the Punishment and Infamy of Evil: Since to it we owe all the increases of our Knowledge; and finally, since it effects all these nobler l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But methinks, Sir, I hear you say, What needs all this to prove the Excellence of a Science, that carries a Natural Worth with it, and that so clearly, that like an innate Principle 'tis confess'd by all self-evident? for there is none, however dull, but does, or has attempted Poetry, with more or less success, whil'st other Artts, and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are not so universally caress'd. All pretend not to Philosophy, Mathematics, Law, Physic, or desire to be thought Proficients in those Arts; but ev'ry one wou'd be thought a Poet, as if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being so, he cou'd not be thought a Man, so essential to Mankind does the universal and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Ambition and Aim at it of ev'ry Man make it. I grant you, Sir, this is a sufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to any sensible Man, that considers it. But how few reflect on this, when they run down what they cou'd not obtain on their Endeavour; the greatest Railer against this divine Art, wou'd be proud to Father an excellent Poem. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Before I conclude this Essay, I shall obviate two or three Objections, made by some old morose Sparks, that have out-liv'd that little Sense their more sprightly years afforded them, and some Precisians, that build Piety and Godliness in Spiritual Railings, and a mortify'd Phiz, which are but <hi>Feints,</hi> or Blinds to Observers.</p>
               <p>The first is, that 'tis a very useless and unprofitable Study, no Estates to be got by it, at least in this Age: That it contributes meerly to Pleasure, not to our knowledge. To the first I answer, that 'tis very true, that there is no hopes of rising to be an Alderman by Poetry; but then I must tell them, 'tis not for those to apply themselves t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

thus far I shall grant it an unprofitable Study, as <hi>Petronius Arbiter</hi> has witness'd long ago:</p>

SIR,</p>
               <p>I have pitch'd upon <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and Viceregent of <hi>England,</hi> for this <hi>Man of Ten Thousand:</hi> A Man, who by his Merit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone rais'd himself from the meanest Condition, to the highest Honour: A Man in nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, so much as to have liv'd in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. of whom it was truly said, <q>That he never spar'd Woman in his Lust, or his best Favourite in the Wrath.</q> In whose chiefest Esteem our <hi>Cromwell</hi> did yet a long time remain: Admir'd by his Friends, dreaded by his Enemies, carest by all, and in one Word, invested with a more Extensive Power, than any Subject of <hi>England</hi> was ever before, or since possess'd of. He was born at <hi>Putney,</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> where his Father liv'd, an honest <hi>Blacksmith.</hi> In all the little Passages of his Youth, he discover'd an Active Tow'ring Disposition, fond of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and covetous of Employments, much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than his Descent, or Education could pretend to; tho' Nature, the better to qualifie him for the <hi>Grandeur,</hi> to which he was design'd, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd him with an apprehensive Wit, a discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgment, a prodigious Memory, a Florid Elocution, and a resolute Soul, not to be discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the greatest Dangers.</p>
               <p>By what helps he crost the Seas, I know not; but there I find him in the Year 1510. perfect in many Languages. and after a while associating himself to some Persons, deputed by the Town of <hi>Boston,</hi> to procure them two Pardons, for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59793:32"/>
which they had been long Solliciting in vain at <hi>Rome. Cromwell</hi> observing that the Delays caus'd by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Ministers, proceeded only from their Griping Disposition, resolv'd by a <hi>Witty</hi> Stratagem to effect that, which by Reason and Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he could not: having one day prepar'd some delicious Jellies after the <hi>English</hi> manner, as the <hi>Pope</hi> was returning from Hunting, he approach'd him with these, and a Song, wherewith the <hi>Old Father Julius</hi> being extreamly delighted; upon Enquiry after their Business and Country, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately stamp'd their Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And this little Contrivance is the more remarkable; for that the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which goes beyond all others in <hi>Intriguing,</hi> were hereby fairly Outwitted: He served afterwards in the Duke of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>w Testament</hi> by Heart, he began to be be ter acquainted with the Principles of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Upon his Return into <hi>England,</hi> finding Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> the only Man in Favour, he enter'd into his Service, and advanced himself therein consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, by acquitting himself faithfully of all things, wherewith he was intrusted; here he discover'd such forwardness in the suppressing of several <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,</hi> given by the <hi>King</hi> to the <hi>Cardinal</hi> his Master for building <hi>Christ's Colledge, Oxon;</hi> as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59793:32"/>
that thereby he procur'd himself such abundance of ill Will from the <hi>Superstitious,</hi> as that after the <hi>Cardinals</hi> Fall, he was represented to the <hi>King,</hi> as the worst of Men; and the <hi>King,</hi> the more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly credited, reports against him, because with much Zeal, and as much Ingenuity he pleaded the <hi>Cardinals</hi> Cause in the House of Commons, (of which he was then a Member) and this his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, to his declining Master, is the more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Praise, for that 'tis rare indeed to see any one stand by a <hi>Falling Favourite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Cromwell</hi> felt the Dissolution of <hi>Wolsey</hi>'s Family, he endeavour'd to get into the King's Service; which Sir <hi>Christopher Hales,</hi> Master of the Rolls, and my Lord. <hi>Russell</hi> happily brought about, tho' the <hi>King</hi> (as has been said) was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest exceedingly to his disadvantage: My Lord (with a Goodness inseparable from his Family) earnestly sollicited his Promotion, not only out of Gratitude <hi>(Cromwell</hi> having sav'd his Life at <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Lysander</hi> will have it, That <hi>Learning</hi> in common Prudence ought by the Men to be deny'd us; since it wou'd not only make us proud, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious, and aspire to the command over Men; which, as we might by such Auxiliary force easily obtain, the Charms of the Body alone giving us too great an Ascendant over Men; so we shou'd not want the desire of obtaining it, having got the means. Secondly, That since, as he will have it, we were design'd by God for Obedience, not Rule; to be instructed by our Husbands, and to study only Houshold Affairs, it wou'd be Impious to raise us from the Office Nature had allotted us, to a Nobler Station. Thirdly, That Learned Women are seldom Chast, Learning dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing 'em to Inconstancy, and Infidelity to their Husbands in longing for foreign Embraces, and that betwixt a Womans Desire and Act, there is nothing but Opportunity.</p>

               <p>I Receiv'd yours; my Charming <hi>Cloe,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the last Week, but the Niceness of the Subject, wou'd not permit me to send you an immediate Answer, being too much, at that time, taken up with other Affairs; but having now got an Hour to my self, I shall cursorily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the weight of <hi>Lysander</hi>'s Objections.</p>

                  <hi>Lysander,</hi> I must confess, is a Man of a great d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And I'm confident,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59793:38"/>
your Love for <hi>Lysander,</hi> brib'd your Judgment to his side, which you have too much of to submit to such feeble Reasonings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Learning, he tells you, will add fresh Pride to our Sex, and kindle an Ambition in us of Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding over that of Man, which we shou'd certainly persue, assisted with so powerful an Auxiliary, since with these Charms Nature has bestow'd on our Bodies, we go so far already, and discover a desire of an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Mastery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is so Cobweb, and Vulgar a Sophism, that I'm amaz'd to hear it from the Mouth of <hi>Lysan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Is he Ignorant of the Nature of Learning? or, is he not very sensible that it teaches <hi>one to know ones self?</hi> the consequence of which must certainly, in any Woman of sense, produce Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, not Pride. It furnishes us with Masculine, nay, Divine Thoughts, that are equally service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our selves, and Husbands. It makes us contemn the designing Flatteries of Men, when they deifie that Beauty, which vanishes in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which Fools preserve with so much Care, for a Bair, and Snare to both their own and their Admirers Ruin. Learning teaches <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which can never render us so opposite t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Besides, Nature has form'd us too weak, to effect a Revolution that depends on the Force, and Strength of Body, as well as Mind; since Politics are meer useless The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59793:38"/>
without Able Hands to put 'em in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if we must needs suppose this mighty Revolution effected, who wou'd not be willing to be Subject to so agreeable a Power, in which <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> join'd. But, my <hi>Cloe,</hi> does <hi>Lysander</hi> forget that a great many Women with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Learning direct their Husbands, and have a very awful influence over them; but I ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ing wou'd qualifie that extraordinary Ascendant, by making that <hi>Rational,</hi> which was before only the blind Effect of Passion and Fondness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lysander</hi>'s Second Objection, That <hi>Women were by their Creator design'd for <hi>Obedience</hi> not <hi>Rule;</hi> to be instructed by their Husbands not to instruct them; and to Study nothing but their Houshold Affairs.—</hi>Partly depends of what has been said to the first. Tho', by the way, <hi>Lysander</hi> makes a little bold with the Secrets of the Almighty in that Affe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tion, tho' I confess, the Curse that was laid on <hi>Eve</hi> for her Transgression, might give him occasion to say so, tho' it prove directly the contrary, as my <hi>Viridomar,</hi> has formerly observ'd; for if Woman was created the Subject, and Vassal of Man, it had been no Punishment to've inflicted that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection on her.</p>
               <p>But, my <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> I think 'tis evident, that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not lessen that Obedience it teaches them; which will therefore make them practice it as a Duty of Reason, not Custom, and Imposition, two weighty and provoking Motives of Opposition. As to the Second Branch of this Objection, <hi>viz. That we are to be instructed by our Husbands,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59793:39"/>
Learning save's a Husband that's capable, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor; and the Husband that is not, the <hi>Shame</hi> of attempting what he's not able to perform; And by giving him an Emulation of his Wives Virtues, make him endeavour not to be out-done by a <hi>Woman,</hi> in <hi>Masculine,</hi> and <hi>Rational</hi> Excellencies, by improving his Mind with Nobler Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and not wholly devote himself to such fordid Employments, and Diversions, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the whole Business and Entertainment of too many Gentlemen; I mean, the <hi>Bottle,</hi> the <hi>Whore,</hi> the <hi>Dice,</hi> with <hi>Hunting, Hawking, Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> and the rest of that wretched Train, as if they were born never to think.</p>
               <p>I come now to <hi>Lysander</hi>'s last Objection, which is indeed the most infamous of all the Scandals he endeavours to throw on Learned Women, <hi>viz. that their Knowledge makes 'em seldom Chast, and breeds in 'em wand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ing Desires.—</hi>Were this true, I must own it a very Substantial Argument, and I shou'd yield that all my Sex shou'd be kept from the use of Books as cautiously, as Madmen from Edge-Tools. But, my <hi>Cloe,</hi> the Assertion is too general to be true, to which I my self cou'd bring not a few Exceptions. The instances he produc'd, tho' you doubt, yet to please him I'll admit, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing therefore that such and such Learned Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have been Whores, it still remains, that he prove this was the effect of their Learning, not Nature, and that if they had not been Learned, they wou'd not a' been Whores. <hi>A Task, not so easily perform'd.</hi> But since a bold Assertion is no
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59793:39"/>
proof of any thing, it may be justly confronted with an opposite. I shall therefore affirm, That those Women, who, tho' Learn'd, are Whores, wou'd be much more prostitute without it; for tho' those Inclinations, Nature and Constitution have given 'em, are not always entirely overcome by Learning, yet are the violence of them regulated, and reduc'd to a greater Moderation. 'Tis not to be deny'd, That Learning being very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Woman, when 'tis found in one, it draws a more Numerous Train of Addresses from the Men; but were it more common, they wou'd by being divided, be more easily resisted: Nay, the very Motive wou'd be taken away, by the commonness of Learned Women, the rarity of which, is the chief bait on these occasions.</p>
               <p>Having thus run through <hi>Lysander</hi>'s formidable Troop of Arguments, I shall add a pleasant Fancy of my own, which is, That the Practice of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Women to the Arts and Sciences, wou'd convince the Infidels of the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Turkish</hi> Perswasion, that Women have Souls, since they were not wholly taken up with the Ornament, and care of the Body only, and then we might hope an equal Share in the Paradice of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> with the Men, and not be shut out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue by the Rabbi's.</p>
               <p>But that I may wholly obviate all your Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I shall say one word now to that celebrated Book of the <hi>Advice to a Daughter,</hi> designing at a better opportunity to give a fuller Answer to a Book I have very little Esteem for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59793:40"/>
I can never admit that an implicit Faith is more excusable in our Sex, than in his; because I can by no means discover, that what he advances ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>But expecting thus long, without hearing any farther of it; I concluded some other more <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,</hi> or at least more agreeable business, had diverted him from it; or that he thought it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> all the Friends of <hi>Shakespear,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi>'s Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are unanswerable; I resolv'd to besto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>I indeed, like the most <hi>indifferent</hi> Counsel make the <hi>Motion,</hi> but leave more able Heads to <hi>Plead</hi> the Cause. One great Satisfaction, I have (however I succeed) is, that I speak before a Judge that is the best Qualify'd to decide a Controversie of this Nature, that ever <hi>England</hi> produc'd; for in you, Sir, The <hi>Poet,</hi> and The <hi>Critic meet</hi> in their highest Perfection; and, if the <hi>Critic</hi> discover the Faults of <hi>Shakespear,</hi> The <hi>Poet</hi> will also see, and admire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Method I shall observe in these <hi>Reflections</hi> (for my time will not permit me to bring so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd a Chaos into a more regular Form) will be first to run over the Pages of his Book as they lye, and give you some Animadversions in part of those Absurdities they contain: for to examine all, wou'd swell my Letter into a Volume, and be five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times as big as the Text, like a certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Dr. on <hi>Job.</hi> Next, I shall attempt a Vindication of <hi>Shakespear,</hi> where he more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly attaques him.</p>
               <p>In the first, I hope you'll forgive me, if I use him with no more Respect, than he does <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spear</hi> or <hi>You:</hi> And in the latter, I hope you will admit <hi>Recriminations</hi> on those Patterns, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And that we may from thence conclude with Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> (as he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Critics,</hi> that <hi>like Wasps rather annoy the</hi> Bee's, <hi>than terrifie the</hi> Drones.</p>
               <p>But, indeed, the Lovers of <hi>Shakespear</hi> may well forgive the Author of <hi>Edgar,</hi> and this <hi>Short view of Tragedy,</hi> whatever he can say against his <hi>Excellence</hi> and <hi>Genius;</hi> since being his Opposité, 'tis no wonder his Mind's not capacious enough to Comprehend, nor his Tast Poetical enough to relish the Noble Thoughts which the Ingenious have admir'd in <hi>Shakespear</hi> ever since he Writ.</p>
               <p>It has been the Fate of most Critics on Poetry, to Err in those Things they Condemn in others, or to discover by their Writing, how ill quality'd they are to judge of any thing, but the Regularity of the Structure of a Poem, which the <hi>Known</hi> Rules of Art furnish them with, the chief forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Poet being wanting; Nature denying them the <hi>Divitem Venam. <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi>
                  </hi> so severe on <hi>Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> (for on them he reflects in his <hi>Satyricen)</hi> kept not clear of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Affectation he condemn'd in them. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> and <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> (as <hi>Rapin</hi> observes) had the Art, but wanted the supply of Nature when they attempted Poetry.

               <p>Some of my Friends, whose Authority was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great with me, wou'd needs have me examine <hi>Edgar;</hi> but there were two things that obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted my complyance with them—The First, That it was so abominably stor'd with Opium, that I cou'd not possibly keep my Eyes open to read it attentively; The other, That 'twas such a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it self on Poetry and sense, that all the pains I cou'd take about it, wou'd be only to give him the vanity of imagining it worth any Man's taking Notice of.</p>
               <p>The Piece now under our Consideration is in a Vein something more merry, and uncommon; for tho' 'tis frequent enough to meet with a dull Poetaster for a <hi>Poet,</hi> yet 'tis something more rare to encounter a jolly Droll for a <hi>Critic.</hi> Tho', that with the abundance of <hi>Ill Nature, Conceit,</hi> and <hi>Affectation</hi> of appearing a Scholar, is the <hi>Vehicle that carries off his Nonsence,</hi> with as ill Judges of that, as he is of <hi>Poetry,</hi> and makes them take it for an extraordinary Thing: and this will make the better excuse for my examining how very Monstrous a <hi>Fantom</hi> 'tis, that is set out in so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable an Equipage.</p>

Book as this, nay—and for any other Lord too, as well as the Noble Lord 'tis address'd to (whose generous Patronage of all that have any Merit in the Republic of letters, ought to have secur'd him from such a Prophanation) And what's more, will do e'ery jot as well, for an <hi>Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to the Courteous Reader, as for an <hi>Epistle Dedicatory,</hi> it being a <hi>Medly</hi> of Stuff without <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, Design,</hi> or <hi>English.</hi> But to examine all that's <hi>Unintelligible, false English,</hi> and <hi>absurd,</hi> wou'd be an <hi>Herculean</hi> Labor, and extend my Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to e'ery Line.

               <p>He begins with the Necessity of a <hi>Chorus,</hi> urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That, as 'twas the the Original, so 'tis the most Essential part of a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> because it keeps the Poet, to the Unities of time, and place: But 'tis evident, from the <hi>Suppliants</hi> of <hi>Euripides</hi> (as you, Sir, have formerly observ'd) and from <hi>Raci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> having evidently clear'd this Point, I shall say no more of it; but that if, as our <hi>Critic</hi> contends, 'tis the Poet's incumbent Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to gratifie the Eyes, as well as Ears; this must be done without offending against <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Probability,</hi> as the <hi>Chorus</hi> does.

               <p>To shew he had read <hi>Plato,</hi> he quotes him <hi>P.</hi> 18. to prove what no body yet ever deny'd that knew any thing of the Original of <hi>Tragedy.</hi> Nor has any one, that I ever met with, pretended that there was no Poem, that had the Name of <hi>Tragedy</hi> before the time of <hi>Thespis.</hi> But if from hence he wou'd inferr that Tragedy was Acted before his time, he proceeds farther, than the words of <hi>Plato,</hi> or any other Authority will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him, for till <hi>Thespis,</hi> it was only a Hymn to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> Sung and Perform'd in <hi>Dances,</hi> and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fticulations by the <hi>Chorus.</hi> But then it had no <hi>Episode</hi> or <hi>Actor;</hi> and therefore <hi>Thespis</hi> was the Original of the <hi>Tragedies,</hi> that are Acted, tho' lie built it on the Foundation of the <hi>religious <hi>Goat-Song;</hi>
                  </hi> this, not only <hi>Horace,</hi> but all the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic's, I have met with, affirm. And himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, <hi>P.</hi> 19. that when it came to be an Image of the World, it then had a <hi>secular</hi> Alloy, and was by Consequence alter'd from what it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that is, from a <hi>Religious Hymn,</hi> to a <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of Humane Life.</hi> The End therefore and Aim of it being thus alter'd, the Mediums to that <hi>End,</hi> must of Consequence, be alter'd too.

an Image of Humane Life, than the Praise of <hi>Hercules,</hi> or any other of the Gods. Now, if the <hi>Chorus</hi> be necessary, because 'twas the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> 'tis equally necessary the <hi>Chorus</hi> shou'd celebrate the Praise of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> as it origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally did; but if Tragedy by the Alteration of its end were set on a new bottom, we are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger oblig'd to regulate it according to its first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. So that I can see no reason, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Sophocles</hi> retain'd the <hi>Chorus,</hi> it was therefore a necessary part of Tragedy, or if it be, why the Dancing and Music that was continu'd with it, was any more meer Religion, than the <hi>Chorus</hi> its self, or a less necessary part of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> since both were of equal date, as to their Rise, and End. But this only <hi>en passant.</hi>

If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cou'd produce no Argument against him in particular, yet must, a bare denial, be granted equivalent to a bare Assertion: but the matter is not so barren of Reason, as to be destitute of a very convincing proof of the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> or <hi>Feet</hi> distinguish the Latin Verse, and the <hi>Numbers</hi> of <hi>Hexameters</hi> are very different from those of <hi>Jambics,</hi> which is the Verse most us'd,

I can see no Reason why we shou'd be so very fond of imitating them here, without better proofs than the Critical Historiographer has produc'd. 'Tis certain, the <hi>Grecians</hi> had not the advantage of us in <hi>Physics,</hi> or any other part of Philosophy, which with them chiefly consisted in words; they were a Talkative People; and being fond of the Opinion of Learning, more than the thing it self, as the most speedy way to gain that, stop'd their Enquiries on Terms, as is evident from their <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry</hi> and <hi>Dialectic's.</hi> There can be no dispute among the Learned, but that we excel them in these Points. Since the time of <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> when the Dictates of <hi>Greece</hi> began to be laid aside, what a Progress has been made in the discovery of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? and what Absurdities laid open in the School Precepts, and Terms of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Ethics is a Study not so abstruse as the search of Natural Causes and Effects; a nice Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind will furnish a sensible Man with them; which makes me unable to ghess how the <hi>Greeks</hi> shou'd have so monstrous an advantage over us in this particular, as some wou'd give them, who are so far behind us in things of greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; but it can't be otherways whilst we make that Age and Nation the Standard of Excellence without regard to the difference of Custom, Age, Climate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I question not to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear hereafter, that we much surpass the Greeks and Latins, at least in Dramatick Poetry. As for <hi>Expression</hi> (the difference of Language consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd) the Merits of which is proportion'd to the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59793:53"/>
Idea it presents to the Mind, and for <hi>Thought,</hi> as well as for Design. And had you, Sir, but given us an <hi>Heroic Poem,</hi> you had put the Controversie out of doubt as to the <hi>Epic</hi> too, as your <hi>Oedipus</hi> (for all the <hi>Quantum mutatus,</hi> of which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time) your <hi>All for Love,</hi> and some other of your Plays have in the <hi>Dramatic,</hi> in the esteem of impartial Judges.</p>
               <p>Had our <hi>Critic</hi> entertain'd but common Justice for the <hi>Heroes</hi> of his <hi>Own Country,</hi> he wou'd have set <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s Faults in their true Light, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd betwixt his, and the Vices of the Age; for as <hi>Rapin</hi> (a much <hi>juster</hi> and more Candid <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic)</hi> observes, the Poet often falls into Vices by complying with the Palate of the Age he lives in; and to this may we truly and justly refer a great many of these Faults <hi>Shakespear</hi> is guilty of. For, He not having that advantage the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets had, of a proper Subsistence, or to be provided for at the Public Charge, what Fruit he was to expect of his Labors, was from the Applause of the Audience; so that his chief aim was to please them; who not being so Skilful in <hi>Criticisms,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Rymer,</hi> wou'd not be pleas'd without some Extravagances mingl'd in (tho' contrary to) the Characters such, and such a Player was to Act. This is the Reason that most of his <hi>Tragedies</hi> have a mixture of something Comical; the <hi>Dalilab,</hi> of the Age must be brought in, the Clown, and the Valet jesting with their Betters, if he resolv'd not to disoblige the Auditors. And I'm assur'd from very good hands, that the Person that Acted
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59793:53"/>
                  <hi>Jago</hi> was in much esteem for a Comoedian, which made <hi>Shakespear</hi> put several words, and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions into his part (perhaps not so agreeable to his Character) to make the Audience laugh, who had not yet learnt to endure to be serious a whole Play. This was the occasion of that particular place so much houted at by our <hi>Historiographer Royal,</hi>

               <l>Awake, what ho, <hi>Brabantio,</hi> &amp;c.</l>

               </l>
               <p>This Vice of the Age it was that perverted many of his Characters in his other Plays: Nor cou'd it be avoided if he wou'd have his Audience sit the Play out, and receive that Profit, that is the chief End of all Poets. To this same Cause may be attributed all those Quibbles, and playing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on words, so frequent in some part of him, as well as that Language that may seem too rough, and forc'd to the Ear, up, and down in some of the best of his Plays.</p>
               <p>After all, the Head of his Accusation is, That 'tis not improbable, that <hi>Shakespear</hi> was ignorant of the Rules of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Poetics;</hi> and was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the three Unities of Time, Place, and Action, which <hi>Horace</hi> in his <hi>Art of Poetry</hi> gives no Rules about: for that which I have heard quoted from him, has no relation to the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Unities,</hi>

               <p>But as I do not think that to be a <hi>Great Man,</hi> one must necessarily be wholly, exempt from Rules, so I must grant, That <hi>Virgil, Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>Your Self</hi> are very <hi>Great,</hi> tho' generally very Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; But these are Rarities so uncommon, that Nature has produc'd very few of them, and like the Phoenixes of Honesty, that live up to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Morality, ought to have public Statues erected to them. But yet the less perfect ought not to be Rob'd of their Merits, because they have defects, especially when the Number of those exceed these, as in <hi>Shakespear,</hi> all whose Faults have not been able to frustrate his obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of All just Poems, <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Profit.</hi> To deny this, wou'd be to fly in the Face of the known experience of so many Years. He has (I say) in most, if not all, of his Plays attain'd the full end of Poetry <hi>Delight,</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Terror and Pity for the Changes of Fortune, which Humane Life is subject to, by giving us a lively and just Image of them (the best Definition of a Play) for the Motion of these Passions afford us <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and their Purgation <hi>Profit.</hi> Besides, there are few or none of those many he has writ, but have their Just Moral, not only of more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Use and Advantage, but also more naturally the Effect of them, than that of the <hi>Oedipus</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles,</hi> as may be soon perceiv'd by any one that will give himself the trouble of a little Thought,

merry out of Season, as he always is; but as I have laid it down, else we shou'd do <hi>Shakespear</hi> a great deal of Injustice.</p>
               <p>I suppose none will deny that it is <hi>Admirable:</hi> that is, compos'd of Incidents that happen not e'ery day, his Antagonist confesses as much; there is therefore nothing but the <hi>Probability</hi> of it attaqu'd by him, which I question not either wholly to prove, or at least to set it on the same bottom with the best of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> that of his <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dipus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, to see whether he have sinn'd against Probability, let us consider what our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viller objects, all which may be reduc'd to two Points. First, That 'tis not probable that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Venice</hi> (tho' it usually employ Strangers) should employ a <hi>Moor</hi> against the <hi>Turk:</hi> neither is it in the next place <hi>probable,</hi> that <hi>Desdemona</hi> shou'd be in Love with him. On this turns all the Accusation, this is the very Head of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending.</p>
               <p>All the Reason he gives, or rather implies, for the first Improbability is, That 'tis not likely the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> wou'd employ a <hi>Moor,</hi> (taking him for a <hi>Mahometan)</hi> against the <hi>Turk,</hi> because of the mutual Bond of Religion. He, indeed says not so, but takes it for granted that <hi>Othello</hi> must be rather for the <hi>Turkish</hi> interest than the <hi>Venetian,</hi> because a <hi>Moor.</hi> But, I think (nor does he oppose it with any reason) the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the <hi>Venetian State</hi> being to employ Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in their Wars, it gives sufficient ground to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59793:57"/>
our Poet, to suppose a <hi>Moor</hi> employ'd by 'em as well as a <hi>German;</hi> that is a <hi>Christian Moor,</hi> as <hi>Othello</hi> is represented by our Poet, for from such a <hi>Moor,</hi> there cou'd be no just fear of treachery in favour of the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> He tells us—</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>I fetch my Life and Being from Men of Royal Siege.</hi>
               </l>
               <p>Supposing him therefore the Son or Nephew of the Emperor of <hi>Monomotopa, Aethiopia</hi> or <hi>Congo,</hi> forc'd to leave his Country for Religion, or any other occasion, coming to <hi>Europe</hi> by the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Ships, might after seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fortunes, serve first as a Voluntier till he had signaliz'd himself, and prov'd himself worthy of Command; part of this may very reasonably be drawn from what the Poet makes him say. Now upon this Supposition, it appears more rational, and probable, the <hi>Venetians</hi> shou'd employ a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who wholly depended on themselves, and whose Country was too remote, to influence him to their prejudice, than other Strangers, whose Princes may in some m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ure direct their Actions for their own Advantage. But that <hi>Othello</hi> is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be a Christian is evident from the Second Act, and from these words of <hi>Jago;—And then for her to Win the</hi> Moor, <hi>were't to renounce his</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why therefore an <hi>African</hi> Christian may not by the <hi>Venetians</hi> be suppos'd to be as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous against the <hi>Turks,</hi> as an <hi>European</hi> Christian, I cannot imagine. So that this Bustle of <hi>Littora littoribus Contraria,</hi> &amp;c. is only an inconsiderate
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59793:57"/>
Amusement, to shew how little the Gentleman was troubled with thought when he wrote it.</p>
               <p>No more to the purpose, is that Heat he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses against <hi>Shakspears</hi> giving a Name to his <hi>Moor,</hi> though <hi>Cinthio</hi> did not, though History did not warrant it. For this can be no more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to our Poet, then the perverting the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Dido,</hi> and confounding the Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to bring her to the time of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> is to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil;</hi> the first as 'tis not mention'd in History, so it does not contradict it; but the last is a plain opposition to express History, and Chronology. If <hi>Virgil</hi> be allow'd his Reason for doing that, <hi>Shakespear</hi> is not to seek for one for what he has done. 'Twas necessary to give his <hi>Moor</hi> a place of some Figure in the World, to give him the greater Authority, and to make his Actions the more Considerable, and what place more likely to fix on, than <hi>Venice,</hi> where Strangers are admitted to the highest Commands in Military Affairs.</p>
               <p>'Tis granted, a <hi>Negro</hi> here does seldom rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Trumpeter, nor often perhaps higher at <hi>Venice.</hi> But then that proceeds f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> equal bottom, with a <hi>German, Hollander, French-man,</hi> &amp;c. The Poet, therefore ought to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>stice to Nations, as well as Persons, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59793:58"/>
set them to rights, which the common course of things confounds. The same reason stands in force for this, as for punishing the Wicked, and making the Virtuous fortunate, which as <hi>Rapin,</hi> and all the Critics agree, the Poet, ought to do, though it generally happens otherways. The Poet has therefore well chosen a polite People, to cast off this customary Barbarity, of confining Nations, without regard to their Virtue, and Merits, to slavery, and contempt for the meer Accident of their Complexion.</p>
               <p>I hope I have brought by this time as convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing proofs for the probability in this particular, as Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> has against it, if I have not wholly gain'd my Point. Now therefore I shall proceed to the probability of <hi>Desdemona</hi>'s Love for the <hi>Moor,</hi> which I think is somthing more evident against him.</p>
               <p>Whatever he aims at in his inconsistant Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble against this, may be reduc'd to the <hi>Person</hi> and the <hi>Manner.</hi> Against the <hi>Person</hi> he quotes you two Verses out of <hi>Horace,</hi> that have no more reference to this, than—<hi>in the Beginning God made the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> has to the proof of the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of lay Bishops, the Verses are these,</p>

fondness of our Selves, to allow nothing of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to any but our own Acquaintance of the fairer hew; that I wonder a Man, that pretends to be at all remov'd from the very Dreggs of the thoughtless Mob, should espouse it in so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic a manner a Critic too, who puts the Poet: in mind of correcting the common corruptions of Custom. Any Man that has convers'd with the best Travels, or read any thing of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of those parts, on the continent of <hi>Africa,</hi> discover'd by the <hi>Portugueze,</hi> must be so far from robbing the <hi>Negroes</hi> of some Countrys there of <hi>Humanity,</hi> that they must grant them not only greater Heroes, nicer observers of Honour, and and all the Moral Virtues that distinguish'd the old <hi>Romans,</hi> but also much better Christians (where Christianity is profess'd) than we of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> generally are. They move by a nobler Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, more open, free and generous, and not such slaves to sordid Interest.</p>
               <p>After all this, <hi>Othello</hi> being of <hi>Royal Blood,</hi> and a Christian, where is the disparity of the Match? If either side is advanc'd, 'tis <hi>Desdemona.</hi> And why must this Prince though a Christian, and of known and experienc'd <hi>Virtue, Courage,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</hi> be made such a Monster, that the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Lady can't love him without perverting Nature? Experience tells us, that there's nothing more common than Marches of this kind, where the Whites, and Blacks cohabit, as in both the <hi>Indies:</hi> and Even here at home, Ladys that have not wanted white Adorers, have indulg'd their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59793:59"/>
Dalliances, with their Sable Lovers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of <hi>Othellos</hi>'s Qualifications, which is proof enough, that Nature and Custom, have not put any such unpassable bar betwixt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the same kind, because of different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, which I hope will remove the improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Person, especially when the powerful Auxilarys of extraordinary Merit and Vertues come to plead with a generous Mind.</p>
               <p>The probability of the <hi>Person</hi> being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, I shall now consider that of the <hi>Manner</hi> of his obtaining her <hi>Love.</hi> To this end we must still keep in mind the known and experienc'd Virtue of the <hi>Moor</hi> which gave Credit, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to what he said; and then we may easily suppose the story of his Fortunes, and Dangers, would make an impression of Pity, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at least on the bosom of a Woman, of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and generous Nature. No <hi>Man</hi> of any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Principle, but must be touch'd at suff'ring Virtue, and value the noble sufferer, whose Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Bravery, bears him through uncommon Trials and extraordinary Dangers. Nor would it have less force on a Woman of any principle of Honour and tenderness; she must be mov'd and pleas'd with the Narration, she must admire his constant Virtue, and Admiration is the first step to Love, which will easily gain upon those who have once entertain'd it.</p>

But as for the <hi>Cannibals,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the Men whose Heads grow beneath their Shoulders.</hi> I have heard it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by Men whose tast I generally approve, yet must they give me leave to dissent from them here, and permit me either wholly to justifie <hi>Shakespear,</hi> even here, or at least to put him on an equal bottom with <hi>Virgil,</hi> in his most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful part. For the fault lyes either in the <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi> of those things, or their <hi>Impertinence</hi> to the business in Hand. First Probability we know is built on common Opinion; but 'tis certain the <hi>Canibals</hi> have been generally believed, and that with very good grounds of Truth; so that there can be no doubt of the probability of that.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59793:60"/>
Next for the <hi>Men whose Heads grow beneath their Shoulders,</hi> though that is not establish'd on so good a Foundation as Truth; yet the general Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary belief of it in those days, is sufficient to give it a poetical probability. As this was not <hi>Improbable,</hi> so neither was it <hi>Impertinent;</hi> for 'tis certain, that whatever contributed to the raising her Idea of his Dangers and Escapes, must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to his aim, but to fall into the Hands of those, whom not only the fury of War, but that of Custom makes Cruel, heightens the danger, and by consequence the Concern, especially in a young Lady possess'd with the legend of the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, whence she must have amazing Ideas of the Danger of the brave <hi>Moor</hi> from them.</p>
               <p>But at worst, <hi>Shakespear</hi> is on as good a bottom as <hi>Virgil,</hi> in this particular; the Narrative of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> that won the Heart of <hi>Dido,</hi> has many things full as trifling and absurd as this, if not far more? For is there not as much likelyhood that there shou'd be a People that have their Heads grow beneath their Shoulders, as the Race of the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> that have but one Eye, just beneath their Forheads, and that <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemus</hi> his Eye was as big as a <hi>Grecian</hi> Shield, or the Sun; or that he cou'd wade through the Sea, without being up to his middle. Can there be invented any thing so unnatural; as the Harpys in the third Book, who had the Faces of Virgins, Wings, Feathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of Birds, and a human Voice, as is evident from <hi>the infaelix vates,</hi> that foretold 'em they shou'd not build their destin'd

The Parallel is so exact, that I am apt to think, <hi>Shakespear</hi> took the Copy from <hi>Virgil.</hi> Nor can it justly be urg'd, that these things were believ'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> since they were so far from believing these trifles, that <hi>Seneca</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, laughs at those Fables, that constituted their Hell, which was of much greater conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But supposing they were believ'd, the same will hold good for <hi>Shakespear,</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I vindicate him in: for 'tis built on as vulgar and general a tradition, as these Fables of old were, so that the advantage is equal betwixt these two great Poets in this particular.</p>
               <p>By this time, I hope our <hi>Drolling Caviller,</hi> will grant it no such monstrous absurdity for the <hi>Doge</hi> to say,</p>

               <p>since without doubt, that short summing up of what was only the subject of his tale to <hi>Desdemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> with only the supposition of the particulars, must move any generous Brest.</p>
               <p>But should all I have said fall of clearing the <hi>Probability</hi> of the <hi>Fable</hi> from Mr. <hi>Rymers</hi> Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet ought not that to rob <hi>Shakespear</hi> of his due Character of being a <hi>Poet,</hi> and a great <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius:</hi> unless he will for the same reason deny those prerogatives to <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Sophocles.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer has often lost the <hi>Probable,</hi> in the <hi>Admirable,</hi> as any Book of the <hi>Iliads</hi> and <hi>Odysses</hi> will prove; and the latter, as <hi>Rapin</hi> justly observes, has not kept to probability, ev'n in his best performance, I mean in his <hi>Oedipus Tyrannus;</hi> for (as <hi>Rapin</hi> has it) Oedipus <hi>ought not to have been ignorant of the assassinate of Laius, the ignorance he's in of the Murder, which makes all the Beauty of the intrigue, is not probable;</hi> and if a Man wou'd play the Droll with this <hi>Fable</hi> of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> it would furnish full as ridiculous a Comment, as witty Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> has done from this of <hi>Othello;</hi> and sure I can't err in imitating so great a Critic.</p>
               <p>First, then let all Men before they defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the High-way, think well of what they do, lest not being Mathematically sure he's at home, he kill his own Father, which perhaps is something dangerous in this Age, where such boon Blades frequent the Road, and such good-natur'd Ladies have the disposing of our fate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:59793:62"/>
Next, let e'ry Younger Brother, that ventures to ride in another Man's Boots, be very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, lest he marries his own Mother.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and Lastly, This may be a caution to the few Fools that doat on Virtue, that they trustto a rotten Reed that will be of little use to 'em, since all is whirl'd about by an unavoidable necessity.</p>
               <p>These are much more the consequence of this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> than those wond'rous Truths, he draws from that of <hi>Othello.</hi> Nay, the moral <hi>Sophocles</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his <hi>Oedipus</hi> with, will serve as justly for <hi>Othello,</hi> viz. <hi>That no Man can be call'd happy before his Death.</hi> But the whole <hi>Fable</hi> of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> tho' so much admir'd, is so very <hi>singular</hi> and <hi>improbable,</hi> that 'tis scarce pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, it ever cou'd have happen'd; on the other hand, the fatal Jealousie of <hi>Othello,</hi> and the Revenge of <hi>Jago,</hi> are the natural Consequences of our ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd Passions, which by a prospect of such Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal effects of their being indulg'd, may be the better regulated and govern'd by us. So that tho' <hi>Othello</hi> ends not so formally with a moral Sentence, as <hi>Oedipus</hi> does, yet it sets out one of much greater Value. If it be a fault in <hi>Shakespear,</hi> that it end not with such a sentence, <hi>Sophocles</hi> is guilty of no less in his <hi>Philoctetes,</hi> which not only concludes without any Moral, but is also incapable of being reduc'd to any, at least of any moment. Whereas the Morals of <hi>Hamlet, Macheth,</hi> and most of <hi>Shakespear</hi>'s Plays, prove a lesson of mightier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence than any in <hi>Sophocles,</hi> except the <hi>Electr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>First, That we never send Boys of our Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, unless we have a God at command to make up the business he has spoil'd; if we mean our business shall be thoroughly done, and not the fate of a Nation sacrific'd to a pain in the Foot.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Not to trust Strangers we never saw before, for a fair Tale, with our Safety and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, without a Mathematical Demonstration of their Fidelity and Trust.</p>
               <p>Lastly, That all Men with fore Feet shou'd not despair of a Cure.</p>
               <p>But I have dwelt so long on the Fable, that I have not time enough to discuss the other parts, as the <hi>Characters, Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Expressions,</hi> so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I ought; especially, the <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>

               <p>What I have said in the beginning of my Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of <hi>Shakespear,</hi> must here be recollected on <hi>Jago</hi>'s behalf; besides which, I have some other considerations to offer, which I hope will ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the insupportable load of Contempt, and Ridicule cast on him by our Caviller.</p>
               <p>First, Therefore in our Judgment of <hi>Jago,</hi> we must follow the Rule of <hi>Horace,</hi> so much stood upon by Mr. <hi>Rymer.</hi>

We are not only to respect the profession of the Man in our Judgment of the Character, but we must also have an Eye to his Nation, the Country he was born in, and the prevailing temper of the People, with their National Vices; by this Rule we shall find <hi>Jago,</hi> an <hi>Italian;</hi> by Nature <hi>Selfish, Jealous, Reserv'd, Revengeful</hi> and <hi>Proud,</hi> nor can I see any reason to suppose his Military Profession shou'd to powerfully influence him to purge away all these Qualities, and establish contrary in their room.

Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi>'s Friend <hi>Rapin</hi> tells us, that the Thoughts are the expression of the Manners, as Words are of Thoughts, that is the natural result of the Manners, which being already clear'd from his Accusations, the vindication of the Thoughts are included in them, as well as their Condemnation in his Charge against the other, for he disda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

well the sense of his Words, you'l seldom find him guilty of Bombast, (tho' laid to his charge by Mr. <hi>Rymer,)</hi> that is Words and Thoughts ill match'd. On the contrary, they are generally so well sorted, that they present us with so lively and sensible an Image of what they import, that it fixes it self in our Minds, with an extream satisfaction; and the more we view it, the more it gains upon us.</p>
               <p>I shall hereafter step into the Scenes with Mr. <hi>Rymer,</hi> and also examine his Narrations, Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Didactic and Pathetic Discourses, which are all that are made use of in Tragedy, in which if he sometimes err, he has yet perform'd well; and amidst his faults you shall find some thoughts of a great Genius. I shall only now observe <hi>en passant,</hi> in defence of that Scene, betwixt <hi>Jago</hi> and <hi>Othello,</hi> that we ought not to be imposed on by positive assertions, or think because Mr. <hi>Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> tells us so, that half words, and ambiguous Reflexions, do not naturally work up Jealousie, or that 'tis not natural, for <hi>Othello to catch at e'ry blown surmise.</hi> These Assertions of our Critic shew him to be very ignorant of the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Passion, for as 'tis reduc'd to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Desire</hi> by the Moralists, so 'tis thus by them defin'd,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jealousie is a fear of loosing a good we very much value and esteem, arising from the</hi> least <hi>causes of Suspicion.</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:59793:67"/>
now 'tis evident even from the trifling, and false Objections of his enemies that <hi>Shakespear</hi> had this very notion of this passion. For this reason 'tis, he makes <hi>Othello</hi> swallow the very first bait laid by <hi>Jago</hi> for him. <hi>Cassio</hi> is found with <hi>Desdemona,</hi> and on <hi>Othello</hi>'s approach, consciously retires, which tho' he did to avoid his Anger not Jealousie; yet <hi>Jago</hi> improves the opportunity to his purpose, with an—<hi>I like not that;</hi> then to awake the <hi>Moors</hi> Jealousie by degrees, he takes occasion from <hi>Cassio's</hi> departure to question him—<hi>did <hi>Cassio</hi> when you woo'd my Lady know of your Love?</hi> Which he pursues with <hi>half-words,</hi> and ambiguous <hi>Reflexions,</hi> that plainly imply more than they barely express, in which he discover'd, fear to speak out what he desir'd <hi>Othello</hi> shou'd know, the natural consequence of which is the touching a jealous Nature, with curiosity in a thing, that so nearly related to his Happiness.

That is so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a piece of good Nature, that 'tis to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd wherever 'tis found; and in return, I wou'd if I cou'd forbear tormenting you any more with my Grief. But Ah! How can I cease my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to one, who so tenderly apprehends 'em, and so excellently applys the Cordial of unequal'd Advices. This makes you often troubl'd with my Melancholly Life; for I declare I had rather read your obliging Expressions for our dead Friend, than all the finest things the greatest of Mankind can say on any other Subject, but not to tire you all at once; I shall here conclude, that I am</p>

               <p>I Ought not in Prudence (Madam) to let you know the unreasonable extent of your Charms, for fear it destroy the Happiness I aim at in your <hi>Pitty;</hi> Cruelty and Pride being generally the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of so <hi>Unlimited</hi> a Power. Yet, since you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pity, without knowing the Sufferer, I must inform you, Divine Maid, that I have increas'd the number of your Slaves, without so much as the pleasure of seeing you for all the Sighs you have cost me.</p>
               <p>Love indeed is an Off'ring that ought to be laid on the soft Altars of Beauty; But, Madam, sure never was by any, but my self, on that of an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Deity.</hi> We keep the <hi>Bleeding Victims</hi> of our Hearts, as long as we can, and only yield 'em up to the <hi>Irresistible Force</hi> of the <hi>present Fair One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, Madam, is the common Condition of Lovers; but as my Passion has an extraordinary Object in you, so have your Beauties an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Influence on me: for Charm'd by I know not what <hi>Divine Witchery,</hi> I Sacrifice my poor Heart to your very Name, without putting you to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of one killing Look, to oblige me to't; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port has often engag'd the <hi>Curiosity,</hi> but never till now won the <hi>Affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first mention of you inspir'd me with all the tender Thoughts of Love; and being oblig'd to personate the Lover in Print, I had Recourse to the <hi>Divine Idea,</hi> I had form'd of you, Madam, to

qualifie me for it; you were the only <hi>Heavenly Muse</hi> that I invok'd, which abundantly furnish'd me with all the Transporting Ruptures of Love. But alass! Madam, while I too much gave way to Imagination, it carry'd me to a View of those Joys, none but you can impart, at left too charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fair one, so much justice is due to the most uncommon of <hi>Lovers,</hi> as to permit him the Blessing of your Conversion.</p>
               <p>Ah! Madam, excel the rest of your Sex in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Mind, as much as you do in those of Body, and let not <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>WHat ever Doubts you were pleas'd to make of my passion before I saw you, Madam, because so uncommon; yet since I have now seen you, I hope you can no longer suspect the Reality of my love, for sure you must know 'tis impossible to behold that Face with an unwounded Heart.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59793:71"/>
'Twas not at least possible for me (who came preingag'd with strong desires) to see you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the extremity of Love.</p>
               <p>I sigh'd and languish'd for you before, without the pleasure of feasting my greedy Eyes with the delicious banquet of your Looks. How often did I envy those your Eyes made slaves, whilst I fell a victim to your very Name, without a sight of that Heav'n I dy'd for? How often have I said,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>How blest, how more then happy must be Prove</l>
                  <l>Who from her looks drinks in full draughts of Love,</l>
                  <l>For after Pain he meets with present Joys;</l>
                  <l>With a too envy'd Fate, dissolves and Dyes,</l>
                  <l>In the vast Beatific Vision of her Eyes.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>these were my thoughts then Madam, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination fell short of Reality; for I wou'd not for a thousand greater torments, than the vast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of my passion has brought me, have been without that too too fleeting pleasure of seeing you last Sunday. 'Tis true, that was not sufficient to calm all my Griefs and Sighs. An empty view of Heaven, was not the utmost bounds of my Longing: and Love took it only as an earnest of greater Satisfaction, and now makes use of it, but to aggravate my suff'rings, which nothing but your Pitty can lessen.</p>
               <p>I wou'd not Madam, put you to too great an expence of Pitty at once, I only desire your leave to adore you, and a reviving look now and then to support my languishing Soul. I wish
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59793:71"/>
I must confess your welcome Pitty shou'd extend so far, as to admit the humblest and most loving of your Slaves sometimes to your Conversation; I wish too—but shou'd I trouble you with all my Wishes, it wou'd be endless, and thought perhaps presumptuous, for they are extravagant, and have no limits but in you, soaring as my <hi>Love,</hi> and Boundless as <hi>your</hi> Charms:</p>
               <p>And cannot a Wreath thus toss'd, thus distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such hopeless Wishes, merit your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion? Can nothing but Death attone for my loving you? And oh too charming <hi>Acme!</hi> I wish I were but as sure of your Pity. as I am of being the most miserable of Men whilst I live, and soon a Ghost without it.</p>
               <p>Give me leave Madam, to hope you will not always deny it me—mistake me not. This hope is not built on an over-weening Confidence in my own Merits, (yet if Love be so I have the greatest) but on that noble Idea, I form of your Mind from the Beauty of your Body, for sure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be so proposterous in the most <hi>Solemn</hi> of her Works, as to leave such outward perfection unfinish'd within. And pitty Madam, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and most consummate attribute of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Mind, as Beauty is of the Body.</p>
               <p>Nay, Beauty is of no use nor Advantage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pitty, and the cruellest of your Sex must at last have recourse to it, after they have foolishly sacrific'd many of the precious hours of flying, and irrecoverable Youth to a barbarous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Custom; if they resolve not, still more foolishly to fling away the greatest, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59793:72"/>
most valuable of Heav'ns Blessings Beauty, and Youth without making use of 'em.</p>
               <p>The Misers of Money have more Reason', than those of Beauty: for the former have the store they spare still by them, to gratifie their Ambition or Pleasure of viewing it; but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deny themselves the enjoyment of that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that has no other use, and which they can't preserve with all their care; and 'tis the heighth of folly to spare that, which tho' we use not, flys swiftly fromus without any Advantage and which can never be recover'd.</p>
               <p>Be not therefore, my adorable <hi>Acme,</hi> so <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently Provident,</hi> of the fleeting Store, as o complement a senseless and customary Barbarity, at the expence of your <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Reason;</hi> they both demand your Pitty and your Love. For <hi>Retaliation</hi> is the Law of Justice, Love for Love, and Heart for Heart, as well as Eye for Eye, and Hand for Hand.

               <p>'Tis true Madam, I am not form'd with all that nice proportion, and that curious shape, that Fops are so proud of, and Women so much cover; hut yet my Mind (nor is it a boast to say so) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells them. I dress not like a <hi>Bian,</hi> nor do I

                  <p>I Was extreamly uneasie, Madam, to be on such unequal Terms with you, whilst you know where to direct to me, tho I don't to you; and I confess, I thought it as great a Grievance as Vizor Masks, by which Women have the unreasonable Advantage of walking invisibly, when Men are forc'd e'ry where to go bare-fac'd: Yet as those would be more tolerable, if none but the Ugly and Indifferent wore 'em, so should I with the greater Ease dispense with my Ignorance of a Direction to you, had you either none, or else less Wit than your Letters prove you have: For 'tis that Divine Charm that makes me desire to settle a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with <hi>Urania.</hi> Nor is this Desire op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to your Resolution of remaining unknown: For there shall, upon Honour, be no further Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made after you than you shall allow; tho <hi>G—</hi>persists in his Opinion, that you sacrifice your Wit and Sense to the Reputation of that trifling Sex you are not of; this not only the Wit of your former, but the polite Accuracy of all your Letters persuade him, since you are not only free from the false Spelling of most Women, but are so entirely exempt from false

English and Grammar, that you discover a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Acquaintance with <hi>Lilly,</hi> than to've pass'd no further, than that Caution you quote from his <hi>Accidens;</hi> besides some Beauties in the meer Writing down your Thoughts, which few Men Practise or Know.</p>
                  <p>I am of the same Opinion of you, Madam, I declared in my former; and because I would fain have you a Woman, believe you firmly to be so: And though <hi>G—</hi>be so positive, that the Diffidence you pretend of your self, is nothing but a cunning Subterfuge from the surest Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your Sex, your Conversation, yet am I (taking you still for a very Woman) both pleas'd and dissatisfy'd with it; for tho' I am pleas'd, because it seems the Child of Modesty and Discretion, which seldom join with Wit, especially in a Woman; Yet am I dissatisfy'd with it, since I find 'twould deprive you of what it qualifies you for; Conversation, I mean, with Mankind, since that, not only secures you from the Fate which the Imprudent of your Sex, have for want of it, incurr; but also because it renders you more desirable to Men of Sense.</p>
                  <p>But Madam, were we such formidable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as you seem to make us, that you cou'd not Converse with us but you must be Ruin'd, yet is there no Danger from me, who have none of those engaging Accomplishments, that are the wondrous and bewitching Engines of your Sex's Destruction; as Wit, Shape, Dressing, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and Singing; with the rest of the gay

Train that take with the Fair: For I assure you I'm Ugly enough, and Dress ill enough to be a Wit, and yet am Dull enough to be Handsome, and a Beau.

                  <p>HAving at last recovered your Letter, Madam, I send this Answer to prevent your Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Transcribing another Copy. First there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Madam, I must tell you, I'm infinitely Proud that you do me the Honor to six your Correspondence with me; nor wou'd I for the World have the Happiness of this entercourse of Letters broke off on any Account, much less on one so trivial as you mention: For there's not a Line you send, but I esteem it more than the whole Revenue of the <hi>Post-Office.</hi> Though I must confess I could wish (and that with all my Heart) that you were not leaving the Town, because I find by this Letter, that there is no Danger of your Heart, if I shou'd be admitted to your Conversation: For I assure you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I am far from a Phoenix; though I may perhaps, have some Pretence to those your dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Qualities: And I hope the Ambition I shall always avow to be the Friend of <hi>Urania,</hi> will excuse the Vanity of being more Particular.</p>
                  <p>I hate Ingratitude where ever 'tis, and can't therefore think them Hero's, who espouse the Quarrel of the Ingratefull, let their Personal Bravery or Courage be never so great. Then, Madam, for Dissimulation, I can say this, that I'm far from loving it, and only practise it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59793:75"/>
on Compulsion, as a necessary Evil; and to say Truth, the evident Necessity of it, has made it lose the Infamy of a Vice, with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all, and gain'd it the Reputation of a Vertue, with the Politick and Wise: Nor can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any Man be free from it, unless he design to purchase the Name of a Mad-man, and frighten all he knows from his Company. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it a little, Madam, and I'm confident you'll allow a little Dissimulation necessary to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum of good Breeding; for you can't think it proper to tell this super annuated Matron, that all the Paint on her Face will not hide the tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale Marks of Old Age; or that pretty pratling Virgin in all the gay Bloom of her Youth, that she's a Fool, and that she should be silent if she ha'n't a mind to sacrifice all the Trophies of her Eyes, to the Impertinence of her Tongue: Or that Beau of Sixty, that all his Charms are borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Dress and Garniture; or that he's more the Creature of his Vallet, than of God Almighty, since the Vallet, has so extravagantly Transformed him from what God made him. And so on, to the rest of the Follies and Vices of Mankind. This wou'd be to make one's self more unacceptable than a <hi>Memento Mori</hi> in the midst of Joy and Pleasure. But to proceed, Madam, I'm free from Hypocrisie: Nor can I think any one an Hypocrite but an Athiest; nor any one an Athiest but a Fool. As for the Two next Endowments you require, <hi>viz.</hi> a Great Soul, and a true Nobleness of Mind, the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice

and different Opinions of the World, have rendred the Terms so ambiguous, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of Philosophy are of small Use: I must therefore desire you to explain in your next, what you mean by them, that so I may find how far I can pretend to 'em; for I'd fain be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the incomparable <hi>Urania</hi>'s Friend. Generosity (if I mistake not your Sense of the Word) has been my <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Punishment.</hi> In short, Madam, if by Good Humour you mean <hi>Good Nature,</hi> I can put in some Claim to't; but if by't you understand a brisk Jest and jovial Air, much Talk and more Laugh; Faith, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I must own I'm not fond of making any Pretence to't.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the Qualities both Negative and Affirmative you require in a Friend: Then as for the Follies and Vices you Abominate, I thank my Stars: I'm not very guilty of 'em, and think Affectation equally criminal in Gayety, as well as Gravity.</p>
                  <p>And now, Madam, since you have describ'd the Phoenix that must win your Heart, give me Leave to present you with a rough Sketch of her (that's almost as rare) that must make an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Conquest of mine, (for as for transient <hi>Amorets,</hi> one indifferently qualified may do.) She must be moderately Fair but no Beauty; (and that's the reason I hinted at in my last, that I was sorry you told me you were no Beauty) or at least, if possible, only so in my Eye: She must be neither Proud, nor Affected; as Witty as <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:59793:76"/>
yet as free from Opiniature and Obstinacy as I think her. I mean not by Wit, those noisie Repartees of the Cocquets of the Town, which you with justice Condemn, but a sensible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of things, which I'm confident you can't mean, when you term Wit a Scandal. In fine, Madam, she must be Easie and Free in her Conversation, very Gratefull, very Generous, and very Loving in her Nature: And when I find one so qualified, I'm entirely her Slave.</p>
                  <p>But whilst I pursue my Thoughts, I find my Letter grow too long, which is one Fault of a whining Lover, who being much your Aversion, I'll here conclude with an humble Request that I may have Leave to hope I shall one Day be so Happy, as to be admitted to your Conversation: For that, Madam, I must own is the greatest Ambition of</p>

                  <p>YOur Raillery, Madam, on my Loss of your Letter, is as Just, as Witty; and I confess with a great deal of Confusion, I can make no Apology for't, unless an Assurance that I'll never trust your Letters in my Pocket again, at least with any other Papers.</p>

I think my self extreamly Happy that I can please <hi>Urania</hi> in any thing; and truly, Madam, 'twas the real Value I have for you, that made me alter the Medium of our Correspondence, because my Brother had the Assurance not only to reflect upon the Direction you sent me, but also to shew your Letter to more than I desir'd shou'd have that Pleasure without your Permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. This Dealing with his Brethren of—might be Pardonable, because they have some Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him; but the Respect that's due to your Merit, and the Justice that's due to me, might have curb'd his Curiosity within the Bounds of Good Manners.</p>
                  <p>I hope, Madam, you'll forgive me this Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Heat, for your Letter has made me an irreconcileable Enemy to Dissimulation, who before was never any Friend to it. You have Madam, new Molded me to your own Desire; and that Vice appears now so very Ugly and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly, that I'm extreamly asham'd I ever said a word in its Vindication: But above all, I shall think it a crying Sin, to dissemble with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Urania,</hi> and for that reason, Madam, I must tell you, that my Conversation with both Sexes, has given me some reason to think I'm pretty well acquainted with the general Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mankind; this, when I read your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your self, makes you seem to me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe an Angel, not a Woman: The glorious Image you give me of <hi>Urania,</hi> by the Vertues she doats on, and the Vices she abhors, is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59793:77"/>
uncommon, that it looks like the divine Draught of some Inspired Poets Fancy, when he informs us, by a great Example of his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, what we shou'd be, and not like a Reality. And your Prose has the effect of his Numbers, conveying Instruction in its most grateful Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle Pleasure, and so fixes the noble Idea in my Soul, and makes me in love with your Mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I see your Person: And you shall never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me, that Conversing with you, can ever lessen my Esteem for you: For tho the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of some of the most Ingenious afford a more agreeable Entertainment, than their Company, yet we may lose a great deal of their Excellency by not taking their Thoughts right; which made <hi>Martial</hi> tell <hi>Fidentinus,</hi> that by ill repeating his Verses, he made 'em his own: Besides, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, there are a thousand Graces in the delivery that abundantly improve the Sense, a fair Lady speaks, which must encrease her Esteem, and which we lose when Absent. And, Divine <hi>Urania,</hi> since your Heart is secure in very good hands already, I can see no reason, (forgive my Freedom) why you shou'd deny this Favour, since I leave to your self the management of the Interview, and give you my Word, that you shall have the entire government of my Discourse and Actions.</p>
                  <p>But, Madam, tho I have a more earnest long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Converse with <hi>Urania,</hi> than Slaves for Liberty, the sick for Health, the poor for Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the Ambitious for Honours; yet Divine,

unknown, such a respect I have, such a profound Veneration for you, that I would Sacrifice even this Content (which perhaps is not of less value than even Life it self) to your least Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if I was sure it cou'd not be obtain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to <hi>Urania.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have a great deal to say about the Greatness and Nobleness of Mind you describe, but that wou'd be too long for a Letter that has already exceeded its just Bounds; and I hope, I may have the liberty to deliver my Sentiments by word of Mouth; only I must say that reason, not Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, general or particular, ought to decide so weighty a Point. But upon the whole, Madam, by the Vices you lay down as its Opposites I may presume to make some small pretention to it.</p>
                  <p>I wou'd fain know what more than good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture goes to the composing good Humour, since <hi>Urania</hi> says there is more; I take not good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that general sence you hint at, but for a freedom from Malice, Envy, Moroseness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if any part of Gaity be required, I'm at a loss, for I'm naturally of a Melancholy dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and dull heavy Conversation, as I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told you; and perhaps this want of an Airy Temper, with a little foolish Modesty I've al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been troubled with, is that, that has made me still so Unsuccessful with the Fair, that none cou'd ever be in Love with me, whilst others with as few Brains, more Vanity, and if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, less agreeable Persons have prevail'd. <hi>Waller</hi> says, <hi>Women stoop to the Forward and the Bold,</hi>

which are no ingredients in my Character, at least in Love, and my Converse with your Sex. So that, Madam, I hope you'll scruple no more to give me leave to wait on you, and as I prove, admit me into your Esteem, at least as far as cold Friendship will allow; or discard me for ever, a greater Curse than which cannot fall on the Head of,</p>

My first Letter had been sufficient to have gain'd me admission to any <hi>Man,</hi> nay, to <hi>Hobbs</hi> himself; and where our Esteem for a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59793:80"/>
Lady is of the same nature, <hi>viz.</hi> a Love of her Mind, bounded with a just Friendship, all delays are but needless Cautions. I only urge this, Madam, to shew you how far I'm from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any ill thoughts of the dear Favour you bestowed on me in your Last; and I'm abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly assured, that the satisfaction of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation will answer my Expectation; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may think of dull Terrestrial Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation (true in reference to what my Alloy will give it) 'tis my opinion it cannot be dash'd with much of Earthly Dulness where <hi>Urania</hi> is to give it Life and Spirit.</p>
                  <p>You have reason I must confess to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing cautious in making a new Friendship with one you know not, since you have been Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; so much deceived in one you thought you might so well depend on as <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> whose Name was well suited to his Nature, and if of his own choice, certainly his <hi>Punick</hi> Faith made him so fond of a <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Name. But since Experience can't secure you in a Friend, I fansie Madam, 'twould not be Impolitick to try what Chance will do; throw your self entirely on that, and be absolutely my Friend without any more Caution.

will really be so, we must a little contribute to the cheating our selves into an opinion of it; for Happiness is nothing but Opinion; and tho this sometimes end too soon, yet it makes some amends, by the Pleasure it gave us whilst we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd the dear Amusement; whereas, the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious are always in pain to avoid Pain, which is like dying for fear of Death. Let not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the perfidious Ingratitude of the faithless <hi>Carthaginian</hi> influence your Judgment of <hi>Virido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> who is not only an irreconcileable Enemy to Ingratitude and Insincerity, but a hater of all Common Wealths, because they have always signaliz'd their Ingratitude, and indeed lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a necessity of always being so: So that the thing you dislike in me, ought to be your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est satisfaction and assurance of my Fidelity and Honour, in chusing rather to Suffer, than Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; for I have a Soul ambitious as any Man; but, <hi>Urania</hi> 'tis a brave Ambition governs me; I wou'd be Great and Just, but rather Just than Great. I wou'd be Great, to have it in my power to do Good, to destroy those Villains that Influence the Best of Princes, and make them act contrary to their Natures; for I cou'd shew a Path Princes might tread to Power, Wealth and Honour, consistent with the Love, the Interest, and the Glory of their Countries: But cou'd I make my Country the Envy of <hi>Europe</hi> and Mistress of both the <hi>Indies,</hi> and of a lasting Unity at Home, I wou'd not part with my Faith, my Honour, nor my Sincerity to effect

it.

               <p>The chief Arguments indeed which these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen bring, are from the Practice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, (the cause of which, you have given in the above quoted Epistle) whose Authority they are of opinion shou'd out-weigh Reason. But since the <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> has been so long laid aside in Philosophy, as an enemy to our Enquiries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Nature, I can see no reason why it shou'd be of so much greater force in Poetry; since 'tis perhaps almost as prejudicial to our imitation of Nature in <hi>This,</hi> as to our discovery of it in the Other. As far as the Ancients and the Rules <hi>Aristotle</hi> draws from them, agree with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter you give these, of being <hi>nothing but good sense and Nature reduc'd to Method,</hi> I shall close with them; but when they either deviate from this, or reach not up to what may be done, I must think it but just to withdraw my self from the subjection of the <hi>Stagyrite,</hi> who has had a Reign long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough o'er the Minds of Mankind, and an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire that far exceeded the Extent and Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Royal Pupil <hi>Alexander.</hi>

Modern Tragedy <hi>turns on other Principles: the</hi> Genius <hi>of our (the French) Nation is not Strong enough to sustain an Action on the Theatre, by moving only</hi> Terror and Pity. <hi>These are</hi> Machines <hi>that will not</hi> play <hi>as they ought, but by great Thoughts and noble Expressions, of which we are not indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together so capable as the</hi> Greeks. <hi>Perhaps our Nation which is naturally</hi> Gallant, <hi>has been oblig'd to the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Character, to frame for our selves a new</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem <hi>of</hi> Tragedy, <hi>to suit with our humor.

               <p>These are the Pillars and Supports of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of this Opinion; so that I hope, if I can but obviate these Objections they bring, I have gained the End propos'd to my self in the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Practice of the best of our Poets, in presenting us with the tenderest Scenes of Love in Tragedies. 'Tis true, the Charge of both these Critics, is directed against the <hi>French</hi> Poets, but in the excluding Love, as derogatory to the Majesty of Tragedy, it reaches our Poets, who do the same. I have Quoted <hi>Rapin</hi> at large, because one part of the Reflection seems to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the other to my Hand; for the ground of his Accusation is the deviating from the Practice of the Ancients; for which he gives so good Reasons, that 'twould have been a madness not to have form'd a new System, since the Genius, the Character, Humour and Manners of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, required as much. He says, that, <hi>In effect the Passions represented become deform'd and insipid, unless they are founded on Sentiments conformable to those of the Spectator.</hi> But before I proceed to any particular Reply, I shall draw the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59793:84"/>
both contain, into short and positive Heads, to make their Confutation the more Evident.</p>
               <p>The whole Charge therefore, may be reduc'd to these three Heads, the 1. Motives the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns (particularly the <hi>French)</hi> had to Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Love into Tragedy. 2. The Objections against it: And, 3. The Effects of it. <hi>First,</hi> As to the Motives, <hi>Rapin</hi> tells us, they were the <hi>Necessity</hi> of the Character, Manners, and Temperament of the People, (which, without doubt, was the Poet's Duty to regard.) <hi>Next,</hi> to gratify the Women Judges, (which is the Poet's Duty as a Man, both in Regard of his Profit and Sex, especially when the Interest and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Women strike in with the Character, Manners, and Temperament of the People.) <hi>Lastly,</hi> To excuse the Feebleness of their own <hi>Wit.</hi> These are the Motives <hi>Rapin</hi> sums up of this Innovation on the Stage; which, as I have before observed, are a sufficient Justification of it, even according to himself: But for the last, 'tis only a morose Caprice of his own Fancy, for certainly there is as much Wit required to the Just, and artificial Management of the Passion of Love; as those of Fear and Terror, and those other Species of Passions that are subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the moving of them.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore pass to the Objections, which are four in Number, the First and Chief (in some Mens Opinion) is, That it deviates from the Practice of the Ancients; who, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of Tragedy, challenge our Imitation.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59793:85"/>
'Tis they must be our Model, and as we make more or less Approaches to that in the Fabrics of our Plays, we are in a greater or lesser De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfection. I grant indeed, that the Ancients were the Inventors of Tragedy; nay, and of Comedy too; 'tis their due Glory. Nor will I pretend to rob 'em of it. I will also grant, that there is some Regard to be had to their Performances, as to their Model; but then I deny that by the Rules of Reason, we are oblig'd to a servile Observation of their Precepts, or Practice, without all Addition, or Improvement. Had the Practice of the First Inventors been of such <hi>Inviolable</hi> Authority, <hi>Thespis</hi> had brought <hi>Tragedy</hi> to its Perfection, and one <hi>Actor,</hi> and a deal of <hi>Chorus</hi> (more ridiculous than an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Opera) had been the <hi>non plus ultra</hi> of the Stage. But if it were lawful for <hi>Aeschylus, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides, Sophocles</hi> and others, to improve upon the Model <hi>Thespis</hi> had left them, why should other Poets, great as those in Genius, be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the same Liberty, provided it be for the Advancement of the Profit, and Glory of <hi>Tragedy?</hi> Upon this Condition I do suppose, none will deny the Moderns this Liberty to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Steps of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But that our Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are for the better, will appear from the After-proofs, as well as from what I shall here say on this Particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Then 'tis evident from what you, Sir, have urged in the <hi>Impartial Critic,</hi> That the leaving off the <hi>Chorus</hi> is for the better, since it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59793:85"/>
frees it from an unnatural Part, which took up so large a Share of the ancient <hi>Tragedies;</hi> and in that, delivers it from the absurdest Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities in Nature, which are as destructive to the End of Tragedy as any thing that can be introduced. Next, it has enlarged the Bottom on which the ancient <hi>Tragedy</hi> stood, and by Consequence extended its Use and Advantage further. It has made it a more perfect Image of Humane Life, in taking in that which has so great a Share in it, LOVE; which whether it be derogatory to the <hi>supposed</hi> Majesty of Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I shall next examine; if not, my Assertion is evident.</p>
               <p>This indeed is the next Objection of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, who tell us, <hi>That the</hi> Lightness <hi>of</hi> Love <hi>degrades the</hi> Majesty <hi>and</hi> Gravity <hi>of Tragedy, diverting it from</hi> Great, <hi>and</hi> Noble Thoughts, <hi>and</hi> Sublime Expressions, <hi>to whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about frivolous Kindnesses.</hi> This I confess is the heaviest Charge in Reality, if true, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall take the greatest Pains to remove it; for if <hi>Love</hi> be not guilty of this, 'tis evidently an <hi>Improvement,</hi> and therefore to be continued in that Possession of the Stage, it has gain'd with so universal an Approbation.</p>
               <p>All the Arguments I shall bring to prove that it is not derogatory to the Majesty of <hi>Tragedy</hi> shall be drawn from—<hi>the Consideration of their Beloved Ancients; the very Meaning of the Word</hi> Majesty; <hi>and the Nature of the Passion of</hi> Love, <hi>and its Place in Regard to the others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:59793:86"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> 'Tis evident from the very Concessions of <hi>Rapin,</hi> the Agreement of all Critics, and the very Nature of the Thing, That <hi>Tragedy</hi> is not of greater <hi>Majesty,</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> than an <hi>Epic Poem.</hi> In his Fourth General Reflection, he tells us, That from <hi>Homer's</hi> Epic Poems, Sophocles and Euripides <hi>took the Haughty Air of the Theatre, and</hi> Idea's <hi>of</hi> Tragedy; and begins the second Particular Reflection thus: <hi>The</hi> Epic Poem <hi>is that which is the Greatest, and most Noble in</hi> Poesie. To prove which he spends all that Reflection, and the magnifying of it takes up the Third and Fourth, and at the End of the Tenth particular Reflection he tells us, <hi>That</hi> All <hi>ought to be</hi> Majestic <hi>in an Heroic Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em.</hi> This also seems to be confess'd by Mr. <hi>Rymer,</hi> when he, speaking of Love's effeminating the <hi>Majesty</hi> of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> Instances an <hi>Heroic Poem, viz.</hi> the <hi>Iliads</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> foreseeing perhaps that that might be objected against his Assertion, which is still in full force notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his saying, That 'twas not the <hi>Love' of</hi> Achilles <hi>for</hi> Brifeis, <hi>that made him so wroth, but the Indignity received in the Face of the Confederate Army.</hi> But besides this Concession of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers (which is indeed Argument good enough <hi>ad Hominem)</hi> the very Nature of the thing proves the same. <hi>Hero's</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of both, and the principal Character of an <hi>Epic Poem,</hi> consists in the <hi>Narration</hi> (as <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> truly observes) in which it is only opposed to Tragedy, which consists altogether in <hi>Action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59793:86"/>
The <hi>Majesty</hi> of an <hi>Epic Poem</hi> being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated equal, if not superiour to that of Tragedy. If I can prove by the Practice of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> (the greatest of Heroic Poets) that they esteem'd not Love derogatory to the Majesty of their <hi>Poems,</hi> 'tis Proof-sufficient that it cannot degrade the Majesty of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> which is not greater than the other.</p>
               <p>But this is evident from the <hi>Iliads</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> and the <hi>Aeneids</hi> of <hi>Virgil. Homer</hi> in his <hi>Iliads</hi> makes <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in <hi>Love,</hi> one with his Captive <hi>Briseis,</hi> the other with <hi>Chryseis:</hi> For <hi>Agamemnon</hi> tells <hi>Achilles</hi> and the Council of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> that he preferrs <hi>Chryseis</hi> to <hi>Clytemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra</hi> the Wife of his Youth; and that she is not inferiour to her in any of her Qualities or Beauties. He often calls her Beautiful <hi>Chryseis,</hi> and always speaks very feelingly when he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions her. And <hi>Achilles</hi> his Anger had not rose to that Degree, but that he was depriv'd of his Rosie-Cheek'd <hi>Briseis. Horace</hi> was of my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in his Second Epistle Book 1.

                  </gap>his Book is not arraign'd by our Criticks for any Defect in this, and by others allow'd as noble a Piece as any of that Poet, so that <hi>Love</hi> is not such an Enemy to Noble Thoughts, but that 'tis consistent with them; nor to the Majesty of Expression, as this Fourth Book of <hi>Virgil</hi> evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

But if Love be not incapable of this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then is our Point gain'd in this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular too, which will be evinc'd from the next Proof, drawn from the <hi>Nature of the Passion of</hi> Love, <hi>and its Place in regard to the others.</hi>

               <p>If the First, 'tis evident that <hi>Love</hi> has much the Preheminence above <hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Pity. Des Cartes</hi> reduces all the Passions to Six principal Heads, <hi>Admiration, Love, Desire,</hi> (or rather <hi>Concupiscence, Joy</hi> and <hi>Grief.)</hi> Dr. <hi>Moor</hi> reduces them to Three Heads only, <hi>Admiration, Love</hi> and <hi>Hate.</hi> The first of which being plac'd in the Brain, and being but the Step to the other, he with the School-men reduces them yet to Two, the <hi>Concupiscible</hi> and the <hi>Irascible;</hi> which <hi>Des Cartes</hi> terms in other Words, properly <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hate.</hi> So that we see <hi>Love</hi> on all Hands, appears to be a Primitive Passion, out of several Degrees of which, and its Opposite, are the rest compounded and deriv'd. <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Terror</hi> is deriv'd from <hi>Desire, Desire</hi> from <hi>Love, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration</hi> is deriv'd from <hi>Grief, Grief</hi> from <hi>Hate;</hi> and is compounded of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Grief.</hi> So that if we respect the Degrees of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, <hi>Love</hi> is the more Excellent, as being a Primitive Passion; but <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Pity,</hi> only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Species

But these are so different, that we must run through the several Conditions of Lovers to make any Judgment of 'em: For those Thoughts that proceed from <hi>Anger, Fear, Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, Hope, Despair;</hi> nay, and <hi>Hate,</hi> with the rest of the Passions, are to be look't for in a Lover, according to his several Circumstances.

Those of a Shepherd might be too low, those of a <hi>Beau</hi> too Gay and Light, but those of a <hi>Hero</hi> must retain something of his Character, and must be Noble as the Object that inspires, or the Person that receives the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration. The Two First indeed may be below the Dignity of Tragedy, but the latter can no more derogate from that, than from the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Person.

               <p>There is a time therefore when the <hi>Hero</hi> not only may, but ought to quit his Grandeur, in <hi>Horace</hi>'s Judgment; and that is when he's in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress and in Exile. And why is it less lawfull to depart from this Majesty (that is, supposing Love requires it) on the Account of the tendrest Hours of Love? This is more natural in my poor Opinion, than in the Case justified by <hi>Horace.</hi> For to Love, is natural to all Great Souls, and I think, as Noble and Essential to their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, as any that make it up: But it may be doubted whether a <hi>Hero,</hi> that is, a Man of Invincible Courage, can suffer all his noble and towring Thoughts, all his <hi>Elation of Mind,</hi> to be so depress'd by Adversity, as to submit to sordid and mean Grief and Sorrow: This may be the Reason why some Critics have reflected on the <hi>Oedipus Coloneus</hi> of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> as too low and mean for the Dignity of a <hi>Hero</hi> furnish'd with Resolution, Courage and Virtue in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Play of him. 'Tis true, 'tis the general Frailty of Mankind to be dejected in Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; but Tragedy, as our Critics contend, shou'd be something better than the Life, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Philosophical, affording a Draught of what Man shou'd be: Now 'tis certain that Philosophy will not allow Fortune any Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the Thoughts and Mind, at least so far as to make 'em degenerate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59793:89"/>
Thus we see if Love were what our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries wou'd have it, yet is it as reasonable to be allow'd, as what their Masters hold necessary in <hi>Tragedy.</hi> But this is a Concession I am by no means oblig'd to make; for I am not of Opinion that there is any Necessity that the most tender Scenes of Love, shou'd be void of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>evation of Thought and Expression, that constitutes <hi>Majesty.</hi> or that they shou'd be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in that <hi>Sermone pedestri, Horace</hi> judges so requisite to the Expression of Grief. This is evident from <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Fourth Book, and the <hi>All for Love</hi> of Mr. <hi>Dryden:</hi> Both which abound with noble Thoughts and Language.</p>
               <p>But the tender Scenes are the least Advantages Love brings to <hi>Tragedy.</hi> There are a great many beautifull Occasions offer'd to the Poet by it; from the Effects of it; the other Passions concerned in it, of Descriptions; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as we may find in all the best of our Plays, particularly in that admirable Piece of the best of Poets, which I mentioned but now, <hi>viz. All for Love.</hi> 'Tis the Love of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopaira,</hi> that furnishes the Occasion of all the admirable Scenes of that Play: The same is to be said of the Fourth Book of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Aeneids.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this Point, it must be granted that Love in its Nature, must inspire Noble and more August. Thoughts or Sentiments, than <hi>Grief</hi> or <hi>Terror.</hi> For the Soul is more dilated, and exerts its noblest Faculties more in Love, than in <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> or <hi>Fear;</hi> which both contract the Soul and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59793:90"/>
its Operations. Love pushes a Generous Mind on to Great Actions, to render it self more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and taking to the Object of his Desires than others. Whereas <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> are Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites to all that's Great and Noble. All the Steps to Love are Great, and much a-kin to that Glory <hi>Rapin</hi> will have the only Object of an Hero's Passion; for <hi>Admiration</hi> is the first Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Step by which a Man mounts to Love: And to acquire Admiration, a Man must perform something extraordinary: For 'tis not the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Manly Fabrick of the Body, that are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd capable alone of making that Impression on an <hi>Heroine,</hi> (for such must the Mistress of a Hero be) 'tis his Acts that render him Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Charming in her Eye. And indeed, common Experience will convince us, that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Quality that has Signaliz'd himself by any Noble Deeds, shall gain the Fair much easier than a Son of the Earth unknown to Fame, and yet not born to Reputation. Love therefore, being the Spur to Noble Actions, cannot but inspire Noble Thoughts or Sentiments, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thoughts being agreeable to the Majesty of Tragedy, Love in respect of the Sentiments it inspires, cannot derogate from that Majesty; which is the Second Proof I propos'd in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Nobleness of this Passion. From whence I shall pass to the Third and Fourth, which have an immediate Dependance on these, and are pretty well cleared, by what I have produc'd toward the latter end of this Second Particular.</p>

                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:59793:90"/>
In the next Place, Love is either opposite, or agreeable to the Majesty of Tragedy, by <hi>its Effects,</hi> or <hi>Actions that depend upon it.</hi> If the Noblest Actions, and the most Tragical Events be agreeable to the Majesty of Tragedy, the Effects of Love are. Witness the Performances of the Hero's in some of the best of our Modern Plays; and the <hi>Catastrophe's</hi> of many that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the Effects of Love, as that of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable, and so often mention'd <hi>All for Love,</hi> &amp;c. Besides, 'tis already prov'd, that Love provokes to Noble Actions, in the foregoing Paragraph; and Noble Actions are properly dignify'd for Tragedy; therefore the Actions that depend on Love, are not derogatory to the Majesty of Tragedy. Nor do the other Effects of it afford <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59793:91"/>
chief Distinction betwixt <hi>Majesty,</hi> and the <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> For he supposes the Influence Love has on Mankind, is of that light Nature, that it can produce nothing but soft whining about trifling Kindnesses; whereas <hi>Ambition,</hi> which is a Love of Glory, furnishes the Poet with Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents as well as Thoughts, that are Noble and Surprizing; which, with the Augustness of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, compose what he understands by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. But 'tis evident from what has been said, and Experience, that there are as many Noble Actions, as many extraordinary Events, and as many surprizing Thoughts, the Effects of <hi>Love</hi> of Woman, as of the Love of Glory, both which are the Ingredients that <hi>Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi> and the other Great Poets of Antiquity compos'd their Hero's of. <hi>Achilles</hi> had his <hi>Briseis,</hi> his <hi>

and Safety. And Dr. <hi>Burnes</hi> in his Answer to <hi>Varillas,</hi> observes very truely against that Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, that Interest or Ambition, are not the only Motives of the Actions of Mankind, there is much to be attributed to the Passions, and of them, none more Violent and Sovereign, than this of Love. Tragedy t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>erefore wou'd not be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Image of Humane Life, if it left so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Share of it untouch'd, as Love Commands or Influences.</p>
               <p>Having thus prov'd (as I think at least) that Love does not degrade the Majesty of Tragedy, and that it therefore ought not, for that, to be discarded by our Tragic Poets, I shall now prove by the very end and design of this Poem, that 'tis necessary to be preserv'd by them; and by consequence, that the Possession of the Stage the Moderns have given it, is an Improvement of Tragedy and not a Deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The end of Tragedy is, as <hi>Rapin</hi> more than once assures us, <hi>the rectifying the Passions by the Passions themselves, in calming, by their Emotion, the Troubles they wou'd excite in the Heart.</hi> From hence 'tis evident, that unless Love betaken in, the most predominant and violent of Passions, Tragedy cannot perfect its Cure, since it must leave the most considerable Distemper (for so are all the Passions that are not regulated by Reason) without any Remedy. But in his 17<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> particular Reflection, where he mentions the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nd of Tragedy, he seems to contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, when he first says, <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Hardness</hi> of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59793:92"/>
Heart, were the most important Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lts (not most important to be cur'd if not general, by so public a Cure) to be regulated, and yet a little after he tells us, that Man is naturally timorous and compassionate: Now he that is naturally compassionate, can never be accus'd of Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Heart, with any Shew of Reason and Justice. But something must be said to reduce the end of Tragedy to their Notions; whereas 'tis indeed the regulating all the most important Passions and Vices of Mankind, which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Disturbance of his Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and obstruct his Progress in Vertue. Now it must be granted that Love, as well as other Passions, when it has past the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of Reason, becomes destructive to our Happiness and Vertue, and ought therefore as much to be Purg'd as Fear or Pity. In short, if the chief Aim of Tragedy be the moving of <hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Compassion,</hi> 'tis evident, Love is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely conducive to that end, and therefore not ill made use of by our Poets.</p>
               <p>The next Objection that is made against Love in our Tragedy, is, that it discovers a Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Genius.</hi> For <hi>Rapin</hi> tells us that it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers a Weakness of Genius not to be able to sustain an Action on the Theatre, with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Pity</hi> only. But he here sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses that Love does not contribute to the same end, as I have made evident already. He must be extremely out of Humor with the Moderns, else he wou'd never make this an Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Nor can I discover the mighty <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Terror</hi> that can be mov'd by the bringing in a Madman on the Stage, and a company of dead Sheep about him. I'm sure 'twou'd make an Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here laugh.

As a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the truth of this, hear the Account <hi>Coelius, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. (as I find it Quoted) gives of it.</p>

                  <hi>'Tis reported, that the</hi> Abderites <hi>in the time of</hi> Lysimachus, <hi>were Infected with a new and strange kind of Distemper, the progress of which was in this manner: First of all, an extream violent burning Fever seiz'd them, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ag'd through the whole Town; on the Seventh day, the Blood in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, burst out at their Noses; and some of them were affected with violent Sweatings, after which the Fever ended; but still a very ridiculous Distemper possess'd all their Minds, they all ran Mad after Tragedies, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the</hi> Iambics <hi>about as loud as they could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bawl, but what they chiefly Sung, was the</hi> Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meda <hi>of</hi> Euripides, <hi>and the Words of</hi> Perseus. <hi>This strange and uncommon Madness diffus'd it self very far, till the Winter and the severe Cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, put an end to this Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he:—And can there be any thing more unfair, and absurd, than this condemning our Plays, for not making such Impressions on the Audience as the <hi>Andromeda</hi> of <hi>Euripides</hi> did on the <hi>Abderites,</hi> who were Distracted with a Fever, that made them Ravish'd with any Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for we find, that it was not the <hi>Andromeda</hi> of <hi>Euripides</hi> only, but chiefly That they Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>But were it true, that these Plays of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents made these wondrous Impressions on People in their Wits, I'm sure it is not our Poets fault, that ours are less Efficacious; the Passions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more finely touch'd than in <hi>All <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59793:94"/>
another Cause. The Audience, at least the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of it, was compos'd of People not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the dismal <hi>Catastrophe's</hi> of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which History now so abundantly furnishes us with, and so the uncommon Miseries of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on their Stage, influenc'd them; as I have seen a Ballad of some Tragical Story, without any Poetry in it, draw Tears from some of the Female Mobb, and make the Male shake their Heads, and go very sorrowfully away. But our Audience that is generally compos'd of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort, are not so easily mov'd with these Events, they being made familiar to 'em by History and Observation; with these the nice touching of the Passions chiefly move; and I my self, dull as I am, have often experienced those effects in me, for which the Critics boast so much of the power of the Ancient Poets.</p>
               <p>The other Effect is Ridiculous, <hi>viz.</hi> That it causes the decay of a Tradegy's Reputation in a Year or two. I know not indeed how far this may hold good against the <hi>French</hi> Poets; but I'm very sure 'tis evidently false as to our Plays.

But after all, Madam, I shall be very little concern'd if you put the worst Construction you can upon my Demeanour in this Business, since 'tis pardonable in me, who, you know own'd my self for a little necessary Dissimulation, till you made me a Convert to universal Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which I'll always preserve for the future. But I never pretended my Life exempt from Faults or Follies—No, on the contrary, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I have been more guilty of both, than most; and among that Number, I reckon this and some other foolish Trifles that shall be Nameless: But I design to set a stricter Guard on my Words and Actions for the future, and not let any Bye Respect betray me to say or do any thing I may repent of without the Power of retrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. This Change I partly owe to some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences I have drawn on my self by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration; tho I own to you, even now, that I chiefly owe it to your well-acted Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. You drew I confess, Madam, the aimable Picture of a fine Woman (I wrong the Noble Idea you gave me of your self, by giving it the Title of Woman) And oh! that the Lovely Piece had charm'd your Heart as it did mine; it won me so entirely, that I hope I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver act contrary any more to the divine Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Sincerity; from which, Madam, I must tell you, with a great deal of Distraction, that you extreamly, deviate, who could in your last assure me, that you made no Enquiry about me, when to my certain Knowledge, you could not

Woman indeed, was so well known to me, that 'twas my Fault to be so monstrously impos'd on, as to believe there could be any one of the Sex qualified with a Vertue so opposite to a Woman's Nature as Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. That indeed, was the golden Work, the Chymistry of my Conversation has been so long in Chase of; and oh! you made me fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe I'd found the mighty Treasure in you because you glitter'd: But alas! the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fantom vanish'd like those deluding Hopes, and I find a Woman of Wit and Sense exalted with Sincerity, is as meer a Fancy as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's Stone.

These admirable Arches out braved Ages, Earthquakes and Ruins, from the time of <hi>Tarquinius Priscus,</hi> to the Destruction of <hi>Rome;</hi> for that King it was that Built them; who when he undertook to perform a Work of that difficulty both for Length and Danger, by the Hands of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, put to Death all
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59793:102"/>
those that fled from the Fatigue of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; for the pursuance and perfecting of which, he made use of a Remedy unheard of before or after; which was, That all the Bodies of the Citizens that were executed on this account, shou'd some be fix'd on Crosses and expos'd to the view of the People, and others in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence given for Food to the Wild Beasts and Ravenous Birds; which produc'd this effect, that they that beheld 'em, struck with a shame to be daunted at any Undertaking, with a bold Zeal for the Honour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name, which had often preserv'd them at the lowest ebb of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in Battles, push'd on the Work with all the fervour imaginable; which the King observing, took hold of the opportunity to enlarge his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions upon them, making them extend those subterraneal Passages to that bigness and height, that a Cart very much loaden with Hay might easily pass through them. But all I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy said, is inconsiderable, if we compare it to one Miracle, which is this, When <hi>Marcus Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus</hi> and <hi>Quintus Catulus</hi> were <hi>Consuls,</hi> there was no Nobler Structure in <hi>Rome</hi> than the House of <hi>Lepidus</hi> himself; but within Thirty five Years after, that was not the hundredth part as big as innumerable Palaces that were then Raz'd. <hi>Marcus Scaurus,</hi> when he was <hi>Aidile,</hi> with his private Wealth and Abilities perform'd a Work beyond all that ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To this I may add a greater Prodigy, effected by <hi>Caius Curto,</hi> who follow'd the part of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> in the Civil War; for when at the Funeral of his Father he saw he cou'd not surpass <hi>Scaurus</hi> in Pomp, Wealth, Beauty, and Nobleness of the Structure, Magnificence of the Furniture and Decorations, resolved to out-do him in Ingenuity: Therefore he caus'd two most spacious Theatres of Wood to be made near to one another, and hung them on a Versatile Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance or Hinge; so in the Morning when the Plays were perform'd, they were Back to Back, (as I may say) but in the Evening after all the People were in them, they were whirl'd about on their Hinges, the Scenes of both descending as they met together, and Compos'd in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment an Amphitheatre, in which immediately were presented the Fights of the <hi>Gladiators.</hi> What can we most admire in this, the Invention; or the Inventor? The Artificer, or Designer? Him that durst imagin such a bold Effort, or him that could reduce it to Practice? But that which seems most strange to me, is, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should be so mad to venture themselves in so ticklish and uncertain a Seat. Behold, (says <hi>Pliny)</hi>

Behold all the</hi> Roman <hi>People aboard two Vessels as it were, which were only sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Destruction by two Hinges that supported them, gazing at the Combates of the</hi> Gladiators, <hi>with Pleasure, tho they were so near Perishing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves if the Machine fail'd.</hi> What might not he have perswaded the <hi>Roman</hi> People to, who cou'd so easily prevail with them to venture into a hanging Theatre, as if he intended to Sacrifice the whole Nation, at the Funerals of his Father, or at least bid fair for it. Had <hi>Caligula</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared such an Engine, he need not have been at the expence of so fruitless a Wish, as that all the <hi>Romans</hi> had but one Neck, that at one Blow he might Dispatch 'em. But after the Hinges were so worn by Use that they wou'd no longer turn, he vary'd it and left it in the form of an <hi>Amphitheatre.</hi> After this, what need I tell you of the Golden Palaces of <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Caius,</hi> or the Aquaducts of the King <hi>Quintus Martius,</hi> or those Additions which <hi>Agrippa</hi> made to them when he was <hi>Aedile,</hi> who besides the Reparations of the Old, made Seven Hundred Lakes, and an Hundred and Five Fountains. Built a Hundred and Thirty Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Hostels, and Adorn'd these Buildings with Three Hundred Statues of Brass and Marble
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59793:103"/>
and Four Hundred Marble Pillars, and all this in the space of One Year. And for the eternal Fame of his Aedileship, he gave Shews to the People for near Threescore Days, besides an Hundred and Seventy <hi>Bagnio's,</hi> as a free Gift; which Places were afterward increased in <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>,</hi> to an infinite Number. But the <hi>Aquaeducts</hi> that were begun by <hi>Julius Casar,</hi> and finish'd by <hi>Claudius,</hi> far surpass'd the former. But if we shou'd nearly consider the abundance of Water that was us'd in public, in Baths, Fish-Ponds, Houses, Conduits and Gardens, in the Suburbs, and <hi>Villa's</hi> as well as City, the Arches that were built to convey it, the Mountains that were cut through, the Valleys that were level'd, we must grant that there cou'd be nothing more Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the whole World. Next let me pass to the Rareties of Art, as the Statues and Obelisc's which were brought to <hi>Rome</hi> from abroad: First the <hi>Thebane</hi> Obelisc, was made and erected by the Labour of Twenty Thousand Men: The King himself when it was set up, fearing that the <hi>Machines</hi> wou'd not be of sufficient Strength to support the vastness of the Weight, without an extraordinary Caution of the Workmen, to make them take the more care in erecting it, caus'd his Son to be fastn'd to the very top of it, that their Endeavours for his Safety, shou'd conduce to the happy placing the Stone. The Prodigious Wonders of this Work made <hi>Cambyses</hi> when he took this City of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and came almost to the Pedestal of this Obelisc with Fire and Sword,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59793:104"/>
to command the Flames to be extinguish'd, he being struck with Astonishment at so awfull a Pile, who had no Compassion for the City its self. In <hi>Alexandria, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Some say 'twas carried a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board by the Famous Architect <hi>Satyrus.</hi> Others, that a Channel was cut from beyond the place where the Obelisc lay, under it, to the River <hi>Nilus;</hi> and then Two very broad Vessels joyn'd together, and so deeply laden, that they might when they came up the Channel, go under the Obelisc, (it reaching like a Bridge, from one side of this <hi>Cut</hi> to the other) And being come exactly under it, they unloading them, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the Vessels rose out of the Water, and so lifted up the Obelisc from the Ground, and thus bore it down into the <hi>Nile.</hi> Out of this same Mountain there is a Tradition, that Six were cut of the same Magnitude, and that the Master Work-man had Fifty Talents given him for a Reward. But this Obelisc was set up in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinoe</hi> by the forementioned King, in Honour of his Wife <hi>Arsinoe,</hi> who was also his Sister; and from thence <hi>Maximus</hi> when he was Prefect in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Transported it, tho such a vast and unwieldy Cargo for a Ship; and plac'd it in the <hi>Forum,</hi> having cut off the Top of it, designing to put one of Gold in its Room, which afterwards not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he neglected.

The chief Difficulty was to Transport them cross the Sea to <hi>Rome,</hi> in Ships of the First Rate. Nor must I omit that <hi>Obelisc</hi> which was plac'd in the <hi>Grand Circo</hi> by <hi>Augustus,</hi> which was made by King <hi>Semnesertes,</hi> in whose Reign <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was in <hi>Egypt:</hi> It was One Hundred Twenty Five Foot, and Three Quarters high, besides the Basis of the same Stone. But that which was in the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> was made by <hi>Sesostris:</hi> Both contain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Interpretations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, by their Philosophy. This last <hi>Augustus</hi> apply'd to a wonderfull Use, turning it to the Gnome of a Dial, receiving the Shadow of the Sun, and by it distinguish'd the Length of the Days, Nights and Hours, on the Pavement, which he had made to the Proportion of the Obelisc, and divided with Lines and Marks of inlaid Brass, on which the Shadow decreas'd and increas'd by degrees, and so artificially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted the Motions of time. A thing says <hi>Pliny,</hi> in my Opinion, worthy the Knowledge of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity. There was another Obelisc in the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican Circo</hi> of <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Nero:</hi> And this alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them all, wat broken in the making. The Son of <hi>Sesostris</hi> made this, as well as another of an Hundred Cubits in height, and Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Sun by the Order of the Oracle for the Restoration of his Sight, after he had been Blind. There was a Statue of <hi>Hercules</hi> in the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59793:105"/>
Beast-Market, which was for nothing so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, as its Antiquity and Title; for 'tis said to be Consecrated by <hi>Evander</hi> to him: And it obtain'd the Name of Triumphal, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Habited in Triumphal Garments, as often as there is any Triumph. The Statue of <hi>Janus</hi> with his Double Face, must not be forgot, consecrated to him by King <hi>Numa,</hi> which was Ador'd and Sacrific'd to, both for War and Peace; his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers being so contriv'd, that they denoted in Three Hundred Sixty Five Days the Year and Age. <hi>Mum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Before the Burning of the <hi>Capitol</hi> by the Faction of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> there was in the Fane of <hi>Juno,</hi> a Dog carv'd in Brass licking of his Wounds, which was of such a noble Boldness, that the Value of it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Purchase; and therefore Consecrated to the Goddess. In the <hi>Capitol</hi> was a Statue of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> of that prodigious Height, that it was called a <hi>Colossus;</hi> and this was brought from <hi>Apollonia,</hi> a City in <hi>Pontus,</hi> by <hi>Marcus Lucullus:</hi> It was Thirty Cubits high, and cost One Hundred and Twenty Talents. Like this is that <hi>Colossus</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Consecrated by <hi>Claudius Caesar.</hi> Besides, these in <hi>Rome,</hi> were an Hundred other <hi>Colossuses</hi> of a lesser Magnitude.</p>
               <p>To say nothing of the admirable Pictures that <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions, all far beyond <hi>Raphael, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo, Titian,</hi> and our Modern Artists, we may in short, Reflect, That <hi>Rome</hi> must indeed be a

Divine Sight, whence all the Noblest pieces of Art that the Conquer'd World afforded, were Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported by the Conquerors to <hi>Rome,</hi> to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to its Majesty and Glory. Add to this the Politeness of the People <hi>Ovid</hi> left, and the Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of those he went to; and we may well cease to admire at his Impatience, and Flattery of his Persecutor <hi>Augustus,</hi> for a Return.

the common Offspring of <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Offices;</hi> I'm sensibly pleas'd, that I can with assurance of Pity, tell my Charming Friend my Pain. This is the occasion of this Letter; for, tho I have no <hi>Villainy</hi> to complain of at this time, having had no <hi>Trust</hi> Betray'd; nor any <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to Resent, because I have not been in a Capacity of Obliging the Person I address'd to; yet have I still abundant reason to Sigh for the continual <hi>ill Luck</hi> that attends my Endeavours.</p>
               <p>I know <hi>Urania,</hi> you have often told me, that 'tis a very false Measure to judge of others by my own Inclinations; and your Advice, I must grant, carries a great deal of Reason; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Inclinations are just or unjust, I'm ten to one in the wrong, when I judge of another by them; since Mankind differ not only in their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the <hi>same thing,</hi> by the different Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59793:106"/>
of the Person that affords us so agreeable an Entertainment. And this perhaps has misled <hi>Pollio,</hi> who has met with Ingratitude enough from some of that Character, whom he has high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Oblig'd; for perhaps, even I could almost grant were not unpleasant, if not witty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. But Alas! one of <hi>Pollio</hi>'s Experience shou'd know, that Men of that Faculty, have seldom any just Notion of things, at least of <hi>Uertuae</hi> and <hi>Honour:</hi> They are their <hi>own Gods,</hi> and Sacrifice all to themselves; their very loosest and gayest Hours, that one wou'd think free from Design, are like the Miser's Presents to a young heir Apparent, only to draw some Advantage to themselves in <hi>Vanity</hi> or <hi>Interest.</hi> And I must say, I never knew one of these <hi>Witty</hi> Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ever abounded much with <hi>Sincerity.</hi> Not that I wou'd extend this Observation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Exceptions: But I'm sure Prudence shou'd chuse where there's less probability of Deceit. On the contrary I have courted his <hi>Friendship</hi> as well as <hi>Generosity; That</hi> with a real Desire, and <hi>This</hi> on no very great Matter, but have scarce met with a Return answerable to my Expectation. In short, <hi>Urania,</hi> 'twou'd be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to tell you all my thoughts of <hi>Pollio</hi> now; what they were when I wrote the following Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, these will let you see; the effect they had, I shall conclude this Letter with.</p>

               <p>By this last Stanza, my dear <hi>Urania,</hi> you find what I then thought of <hi>Pollio,</hi> but I must tell you, my opinion is much alter'd by his Carriage since.

If Oftentation be the Motive of his great Actions, and a present <hi>Vain-Glory</hi> be the mover of his Liberality, he has a great many of his Rank, that carry a mighty Name in the World; for few have learned this noble Maxim, that <hi>Vertue is its own Reward.</hi> And yet methinks the <hi>present</hi> Applause of <hi>Fools</hi> should not be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a Man of Sense. But if <hi>Pollio</hi> had not that Nobleness of Spirit to do a <hi>private</hi> Good, yet methinks he should not submit to do a <hi>little thing,</hi> as you know some of his Demeano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>I Have lately been looking over again Bishop <hi>Wilkins</hi> his <hi>World in the Moon,</hi> and cannot but agree with him, as I formerly did, that 'tis most reasonable to think that Planet capable of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, since we know 'tis a Solid Opacous Body; that the Light it has, is only Borrow'd; and since the Discoveries made by the Telescope of <hi>Galileus,</hi> shew that 'tis e'ery way qualify'd for an Inhabitable World. But whether the Inhabitants be so much Wiser than us, as <hi>Cyrano Bergerai</hi> makes'em, I can't tell, neither am I willing to allow them that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59793:110"/>
since their Planet has such a dependance on our Earth, as to be oblig'd to move round us, as its Centre. I should rather agree with <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osto,</hi> that makes it the <hi>Lumber House,</hi> or <hi>Repository</hi> of all things that are lost in this Earth of ours, even to the <hi>Wits</hi> of his <hi>Hero <hi>Orlando,</hi>
                  </hi> Bottl'd up in Bottles, like the Virtuoso's Air: But then you will answer, if I allow the <hi>Moon</hi> the <hi>Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle</hi> of all that is lost on our Earth, that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence it must be the <hi>Juster, Honester,</hi> as well as <hi>Wiser</hi> Abode, since <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> have long been lost here, as well as <hi>Wisdo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>However 'tis, methinks we have a greater I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of this friendly moving Light of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, than the Primitive Poetical Philosophers: They made it but a <hi>Woman,</hi> but we a <hi>World,</hi> that contains perhaps some Millions of finer Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than <hi>Diana:</hi> Tho 'tis probable not all so Chast, if they are not made of a much different Matter from that of our Earthly Ladies.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59793:114"/>
be call'd in Question by this Attempt, yet my generous Ambition will merit a <hi>Magnis tamen excidit Ausis.</hi> One thing I must possess you of in my favour, that my unhappy Circumstances allow me not time to use all the Caution I ought, or search all the Reasons might be urg'd in this noble Cause; so that I am not only <hi>Viribus,</hi> but <hi>Opibus impar:</hi> However, I hope the Design will gain me the Opinion of a <hi>Good English Man,</hi> if my Performance shou'd not attain that of a <hi>good Critic,</hi> which will sufficiently compensate my trouble; for I shou'd be prouder to be thought a Zealot for the Glory as well as Interest of my Country, than the greatest Wit, and most Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Arguer.</p>
               <p>I shall never deny the Ancients their just Praise of the Invention of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences;</hi> but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without contradicting my own Reason, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them the Perfecters of 'em so far that they must be our uncontroverted Patterns and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard: For our Physicians have found the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> very Defective: And as in Physic, so in Poetry, there must be a regard had to the Clime, Nature, and Customs of the People; for the Habits of the Mind as well as those of the Body, are influenc'd by them; and <hi>Love</hi> with the other Passions vary in their <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> as well as <hi>Causes,</hi> according to each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Age; nay, according to the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of each Person affected. This makes me hope, that the Ingenious Author of the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Verses Amorous and Gallant,</hi> guides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by a fallacious Rule, when he makes the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients the Standard of the Excellence of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59793:114"/>
(or indeed when by exalting <hi>those,</hi> he wholly deprives <hi>these</hi> of all Honour) in <hi>Love-Uerses.</hi> His Charge is reducible to these two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Occasions</hi> and the <hi>Performances.</hi> He will have it, that <hi>the Occasions on which their Poems are written are sought out, and that none meet with 'em but themselves, whilst those of the Ancients are such as happen almost to e'ry Man in Love.</hi> Next, <hi>That the Verses of the Moderns, are fill'd with Thoughts that are indeed <hi>Surprizing</hi> and <hi>Glittering,</hi> but not <hi>Tender, Passionate,</hi> or <hi>Natural</hi> for e'ry Man in <hi>Love</hi> to think.</hi> This is the sum of his Charge against 'em; of which in the Order I've plac'd 'em. First, As for the <hi>Occasions;</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remember any Subject chosen by either <hi>Cowly</hi> or <hi>Waller,</hi> (for we've nothing to do here with <hi>Petrarch</hi> a Foreigner) that seems to be sought out, or unnatural for a Man in Love to choose; and if some of 'em do not happen to e'ry Man in Love, they are yet on an equal Bottom with the Ancients, many of whose <hi>Subjects</hi> or <hi>Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> are far from happening to all Lovers, as none who can pretend to any knowledge of their Writings can deny. <hi>Corinna</hi>'s Parrot dy'd, and <hi>Ovid</hi> writes its Funeral Elegy; but sure none will contend that this is an Accident common to all Ladies who have Lovers, and those Poets too. <hi>Catullus</hi> addresses one Copy of Verses to the very Sparrow of <hi>Lesbia,</hi> and in another deplores its Death. A great many Lovers may have Mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses who never take a Voyage during their Amour, and yet <hi>Ovid</hi> has an Elegy <hi>ad Amicam Navigantem;</hi> and so may ten thousand true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, especially such as are Poets, never venture on
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59793:115"/>
any other Billows, but the Frown of their Fair ones; and yet <hi>Propertius</hi> toss'd in another Storm, Writes to <hi>Cynthia</hi> upon it. And indeed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Subjects</hi> or <hi>Occasions</hi> of <hi>Love-Uerses</hi> to any particular Standard, is highly Irrational, and must only be the effect of want of Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for the various Circumstances and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the Lovers must diversifie and alter the <hi>Occasions</hi> of writing to their Mistresses: So that there is no Occasion that is General, and that can reach all Men in Love, but the Cruelty of their Mistresses on their first Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, (that is, their not immediate Compliance) for Jealousie is not Universal, or at least to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Beating of her a Man Loves; yet <hi>Ovid</hi> Writes <hi>ad Amicam quam verberaverat.</hi> I must confess, I can't see the least Reason why the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Gloves</hi> of a Mistress, with <hi>the Place of her Birth,</hi> are not as just <hi>Occasions</hi> to Write on as the Ring given to a Mistress, or her Parrot or Sparrow; or a great many more I might enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate out of the Ancients. A true Lover thinks e'ry thing that belongs to her he Loves, worthy his Thoughts; and the more our Modern Poets extend their Reflections beyond the Ancients in this, so much the greater Lovers they shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But the <hi>Place of one's Mistress's Birth</hi> is not only worthy a Lover's Thoughts, but even an <hi>Universal Occasion,</hi> since no Lover but must meet with that Occurrence in whatever fair one he adores, among all the beauteous Daughters of <hi>Eve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what has been said, Sir, 'tis evident that our Moderns are not inferiour to the Ancients,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59793:115"/>
in their Judgment in chusing <hi>Occasions</hi> on which they write to their Mistresses: Or, That this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Gentleman has either through Want of Advertence, or out of Design expressed himself <hi>ambiguously,</hi> or at least not with that <hi>Clearness</hi> that is requisite to a conclusive Argument; which cannot be excused when the Honour and Merit of such great Men as <hi>Cowley</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> is concerned; nay, the Honour of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Second Accusation, which is, that <hi>the Moderns fill their Verses with Thoughts</hi> surprising <hi>and</hi> glittering, <hi>but not natural for e'ry Man in Love to think.</hi> This lies under the same Fault as the other does, of being too general to be of any Force, it either condemns all that the Moderns have wrote, it casts off e'ry Thought in their Love-Verses as not tender and passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or does nothing at all, for it instances no particular. I'm confident the ingenious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman will have so much Candor, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that there are a great many very tender and soft Thoughts, and passionate Expressions in <hi>Cowley</hi>'s <hi>Mistress,</hi> as in this one, that now oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currs to my Mind: <hi>Then like some wealthy Island thou shalt lie,</hi> &amp;c. but if there be some, nay, a great many tender, soft, and passionate thoughts in our Moderns, then is this general charge not at all conclusive against 'em. Besides, <hi>Thoughts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to a Man in</hi> Love, is an obscure Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it conveys no clear Idea of any thing to the Mind; or, what is fully as erroneous, it seems to level the Thoughts of all Mankind, but it cannot be doubted, but that in the very same
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59793:116"/>
Circumstances the Thoughts of different Men will be various, and more or less Excellent and Noble, as the Wit, Judgment, Fancy, and the other Qualities of the Mind of the Person af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, are more or less Excellent and perfect: And I am confident your ingenious Friend (whom I honour for his Wit, tho I differ from his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) will allow me, That one of Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi>'s Genius wou'd no more have the Thoughts of a Fop, a Beau, a Tinker, a Shepherd, or any other ignorant and <hi>unelevated</hi> Mechanic, in Love, than out of it. <hi>Again,</hi> Thoughts <hi>surprizing,</hi> and <hi>glittering</hi> without particular Instances of 'em, as they prove nothing, so can they not be well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, for an Instance would have made us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what he takes for <hi>surprizing</hi> and <hi>glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> but without that, or any Definition, we wander in the dark, and I can at best but only ghess at his meaning. If by <hi>Thoughts surprizing,</hi> and <hi>glittering</hi> he means <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> I'm apt to think he will allow them very natural to Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> or Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> in any Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance. A Man that is us'd to a good Habit of thinking, cannot be without extraordinary Thoughts, on what concerns him so near as the Heart of his Mistress. <hi>Lastly,</hi> As to <hi>far-fetch'd Similes,</hi> 'tis an Expression very <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous;</hi> and I must acknowledge my self wholly to seek in his Meaning, if a <hi>Simile</hi> be just, and hold an exact Analogy to the thing 'tis applied to, and of the thing 'tis designed to heighten, I presume it cannot come into the Number of the <hi>far-fetch'd,</hi> and when-ever the Gentleman will please to instance in Particulars in either <hi>Cowley</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:59793:116"/>
or <hi>Waller,</hi> I engage to fellow them with those that are full as faulty, even according to his own Definition, let that be what it will, (for I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it can't be much amiss from so accurate a Pen.) And till then I may supersede any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Defence in this. Besides, 'tis not to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that the Verses written by Lovers are the <hi>Extempore</hi> Result of a sudden Gust of Passion, like the Inspirations of the <hi>Delphic</hi> Prophetess; for I'm confident he'll agree with me that the Excuse of Love will not free a Poet, that lets them pass so from the Censure of <hi>Boileau</hi>

               <p>A Poetizing Lover, must be allow'd not to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely out of his Wits, and that 'tis possible for him to study, and consider what he says in so solemn a Manner to his Mistress.</p>
               <p>After this bold Assertion without Proof, he advances to examine which are in the right, the Ancients or the Moderns; the Rule of our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this, he justly makes the End the Poet aims at, <hi>viz. The obtaining the Love of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,</hi> tho I cannot see why he should suppose that contrary to, or inconsistent with getting <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Admiration,</hi> since Admiration is a certain Step to Love. When I read Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Works, I cannot help Loving him. If I should not love and respect him and any other Poet that thinks well, and expresses his Thoughts nobly, I should sin against my Reason. <hi>Ovid</hi> urges his Fame and Reputation as a Motive for his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress's Love, and if that can move a Man of Sense, why should we think the Effect wou'd
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59793:117"/>
not be the same on a Woman of Sense, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity? And indeed, in e'ry one but an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dull, insipid Fool, which no Lover can think his Mistress.</p>
               <p>The End of Love-Verses being the gaining the fair ones Heart, he proceeds to the best means of obtaining that End, <hi>viz. The convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her that you love her.</hi> I must deny this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion too, for tho <hi>Love</hi> in the Severity of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice require <hi>Love;</hi> yet is that an Argument that ought not always to prevail, since 'tis a Plea that's common to a great many, for so the fair one ought to surrender to 'em all; a Liberty no Lover would willingly allow his Mistriss on any Consideration whatever. But how often does Experience tell us, that this <hi>best Way</hi> fails? Or indeed, how seldom does it hit? <hi>Admiration</hi> is the only just, and unquestioneable Parent of Love; for the Senses or the Mind must be first won with some Perfection, either real or imaginary. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore can ravish Fame from the envious censorious World, may justly be suppos'd able to give <hi>Admiration</hi> to a Mistress. Nor is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the <hi>true and lively Representation of the Pains, and Thoughts attending the Passion of Love;</hi> for sure the Advantage of <hi>Art</hi> in Poems cannot destroy the <hi>End</hi> which is not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in Painting without it, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>lively Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of Nature.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59793:117"/>
magnifies and enlarges it: <hi>This</hi> gives it you as the reverse end of a Prospective Glass does Objects, <hi>That</hi> as the right end of it; so that if a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of our Pain be the Path to Success, <hi>Art</hi> will be no ill Help and guide in it; unless we'll suppose that our Mistress would be more sensibly touched with a <hi>Grubstreet</hi> Ballad, than a Copy of Verses by a <hi>Cowley</hi> or a <hi>Waller.</hi> But indeed, the Pain a Lover feels cannot be truely, and with Life represented without <hi>Similes,</hi> as is evident from the very Nature of the Mind, when in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ain: For 'tis an universal Measure of our Judgment of things to compare them with something else; and the Mind in expressing its Pains endeavours to make it known in its full Greatness: to give therefore the greater Image of it, it generally seeks out something by a Comparison of which it hopes to obtain that End; Comparison being the only Distinction of Degrees of things. This makes it narrowly in these Circumstances, regard and observe that Train of <hi>Ideas</hi> that continually pass before it, to call out such as are most proper for its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: For <hi>'tis evident,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> remarks) <hi>to any one that will but observe what passes in his own Mind, that there is a Train of Ideas constantly suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one another in his Understanding, as long as he's awake.</hi> An Assertion therefore of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Friend of mine, to the Prejudice of the Moderns, against <hi>Similes</hi> in the Expression of the Passions of Love and Grief, is contrary to the very Nature of the Mind. For let any Man endeavour to retain any particular Idea firmly and without Alteration, he will sind it not in his Power to do it any considerable time,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59793:118"/>
such a necessary Succession and Variation of Ideas (the Origin of Similes) is there in the human Mind. But because 'tis said that <hi>'tis the nature of Grief to confine the Soul, straiten the Imagination, and extremely lessen the Number of its Objects,</hi> I shall only oppose the Assertion of this Gentleman (whom I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways allow'd a Man of great Wit and Sense) with an Observation of Mr. <hi>Le Clerk,</hi> (whom I'm sure no Man that knows his Works, will deny to be one of the best Philosophers of the Age) in the <hi>6th. Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Ontologie</hi> and the <hi>4th. Paragraph,</hi> he has to this purpose—<q>This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, we observe that the time seems short to those who spend it in Mirth, or any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment they perform with Pleasure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; but on the contrary, Tedious and Irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the Unfortunate, and those that are in Pain, or to those that are against their Wills, oblig'd to some troublesome Business. For we keep the Idea that is Gratefull and Pleasant to us, as long without Variation as we are able, and thus by the viewing of the fewer Ideas, the time we spend in Pleasure and Content, seems the shorter; whilst on the contrary, our Minds endeavour to drive away a troublesome Idea, and strive to substitute some others in its room; Turning, Winding, Changing, Adding and Diminishing it, as the uncasie inquietude Prompts. Thus the time seems longer than it wou'd do else, by that vast and numerous Train of Ideas, which, as I may say, shew themselves <hi>en passant</hi> to the Mind, with an incredible Rapidity and Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</q> From this just and rational Observation
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59793:118"/>
of Mr. <hi>Le Clerk</hi> 'tis evident, That Similes are not so unnatural in expression of Grief or Pain, as some Ingenious Gentlemen contend: For the Mind (especially that which is us'd to an Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of its self in Allegory and Similes) will easily in this Number of Ideas, meet with some that will answer the End, the Mind is born to with so much Impatience and Desire: For 'tis here also evident, That Grief multiplies nor lessens the Number of the Objects of the Mind.</p>
               <p>From what has been said 'twill appear, That <hi>Similes</hi> cannot be an unnatural Expression of this Passion, or any Effects of it. I shall therefore proceed to those few particular Instances the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Preface</hi> gives, by which he draws a short Parallel betwixt the Ancients and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns. <hi>I am pleas'd,</hi> says he, <hi>with</hi> Tibullus, <hi>when he says, he cou'd live in a Desart with his Mistress, where never any Humane Foot-steps appear'd, because I doubt not but he really thinks what he says: But I confess, I can hardly forbear Laughing, when</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch <hi>tells us he cou'd live without any other Sust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance than his Mistresses Looks.</hi> I confess, I must ev'n here dissent from him too; for if you go to the Rigor or Severity of the Reason of both Expressions, they are equally impossible, and in Impossibilities as well as Infinites, there are no Degrees. For I can see no greater Probability of Living in a Desart where there were no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Foot-steps, than on the Looks of a Mistress only; unless like <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

it impossible, is there any Necessity of a Lovers saying nothing that exceeds the Bounds of <hi>Possibility?</hi> especially in Poetry, where Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole's are justifiable almost to Extravagance. That certainly wou'd be most unnatural of all, for the Thoughts of a Man really in Love, are naturally Extravagant ev'n to Impossibilities; tho <hi>poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But we may in favour of <hi>Petrarch</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> (who make use of the same Thought) say that they mean the Dyet of their Love, is a Look of their Mistress.</p>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59793:119"/>
qualify you for a Judge of the present Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie betwixt the Moderns and the Ancients, for the Prize of Glory in Learning and Poetry. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Perault</hi> (whom I have not yet had the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to Read) has given it to the Moderns, <hi>Rapin</hi> to the Ancients: Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> has with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Indignation appear'd on <hi>Rapin</hi>'s side. I cannot determine whether Mr. <hi>Perault</hi> has been too partial to his own Country-men, (an Error on the right side) but I'm sure Mr <hi>Rymer</hi> has been extremely injurious to his; which has made me perhaps, too angry with him in my former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses. But I assure my self that you are too good an <hi>Englishman,</hi> to let Friendship to any Man, bribe you to condemn those rough Effects of my Zeal for the <hi>English Nation.</hi> I will be more just than my Adversary, I will yield that <hi>Greece</hi> had Great Poets, notwithstanding all those monstrous Faults and Absurdities they abound with; tho he will not allow the <hi>English</hi> any Honour, because they have been guilty of Errors. Nay, I'll say more, that the Poetry of <hi>Greece</hi> was her most valuable Learning, for that still maintains its Share of Glory and Esteem, whilst her Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy is now exploded by the Universal Reason of Mankind. <hi>Homer, Pindar, Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi> will, as long as they are understood, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their Characters of Excellent Poets, tho the <hi>Stagyrite</hi> with all his Volumes, is now shrunk from his Ostentatious Title of the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> to that of a good <hi>Critic,</hi> or <hi>Grammarian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho I grant the <hi>Gracians</hi> this, yet I cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to the rest of the Hyperbolicall raises some of our Modern Critics give them. For I confess,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59793:120"/>
I can discover no such <hi>Universal Genius</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> as they contend for, as that all Arts and Siences may be learn't from him: <hi>Virgil</hi> seems to me, more generally Learned by far; and Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> among our <hi>English</hi> Poets, may without Partiality, be put up for his Rival in the Glory of Learning. As for the <hi>Numbers</hi> of <hi>Homer, Rapin</hi> vastly extols their Variety, and yet confesses that to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, which makes it the easier Task for <hi>Homer</hi> to perform, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, lessens his Merit on that Account. But it cannot be deny'd that <hi>Virgil</hi> has as much Variety in this as the <hi>Roman</hi> Language wou'd allow; and as was necessary for the Beauty of his Poem; and they are in his Descriptions especially, so well chosen, that they extremely contribute to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the thing describ'd; as <hi>Gemitus dedere Caverna: praruptus aqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and the <hi>Moderns,</hi> and shall only cursorily runover the Heads. I have touch'd the <hi>Universality of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and the <hi>variety of Numbers</hi> (this last being the Prerogative of the Language more than of the Poets.) <hi>Judgment</hi> I think is apparently the due of the <hi>Moderns,</hi> who I'm confident wou'd ne'er have been guilty of those Absurdities the Ancients abound with. Thuy seem to have been Masters of but little Reason, when they made their Gods such <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>criminal Beings-Homer</hi> often digresses from the <hi>Hero,</hi> that is the Subject of his Poem, to entertain us with other Objects too remote from <hi>Achilles.</hi> You may, Sir, easily perceive that I press not so hard as I might on the <hi>Ancients;</hi> that I omit abundance of <hi>Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties,</hi> and <hi>Absurdities,</hi> ridiculous even to <hi>Childishness,</hi> because I wou'd not be thought to rob the <hi>Fathers</hi> of Poetry of their just Value and Esteem; tho I confess I am of Mr. St. <hi>Euremont</hi>'s Opinion, that no Name can Privilege Nonsense or ill Conduct.</p>
               <p>The Enemies of the Moderns will not deal so Civilly with them. They deny them to be Poets because they have not strictly observed the Rules laid down by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> but by that they discover themselves either ignorant or negligent of the most chief and important end of Poetry, that is, Pleasure. Now, it cannot be deny'd but he is the best Poet who takes the surest means to obtain the end he aims at; in which, regard must be had to tho <hi>Humour, Custom,</hi> and <hi>Inclination</hi> of the Auditory; but an <hi>English</hi> Audience will never be pleas'd with a dry, Jejune and formal Method, that excludes Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety as the Religious observation of the Rules of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> does. And all those that exclaim against the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59793:121"/>

Besides, the Confiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Universe is as I may say a voluminous Introduction to the Contemplation of that <hi>Being:</hi> we are forc'd there to run through objects distinct, and various in their Forms and Beauty, as well as vastly distant in their situation, which all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the Confusion and Imperfection of the Image they present of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God; and the Administration of Humane Affairs is a too tedious, as well as a too controverted ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his Goodness.

and our <hi>loose Desires,</hi> and directs them all to one Object, which like the Sun-beams contracted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a burning Glass, must be of far greater Force, and by consequence, give a greater and more exalted Relish of <hi>Delight,</hi> than when scatter'd and dissipated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ethics</hi> only informs the Mind with a bare knowledge of Vertue, without having power to influence us to the embracing of it, for there are a great many that with <hi>Medea</hi> in <hi>Ovid</hi> may say,</p>
