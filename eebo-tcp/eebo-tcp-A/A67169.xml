            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O shame on that <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> darkness which clouds our Reason! O shame on that Infidelity that poysons our Souls! <hi>He</hi> liv'd a Divine Heathen, while we live and die professed Christians, but in Practice more wretched and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable than <hi>Pagans</hi>; witness the Avarice and Rapine of some, the Malice and Ambition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; in a word, to name no more, the frequent <hi>Murders of the Street,</hi> and the more close <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of the Chamber;</hi> the bloody Revenge of the enraged <hi>Bravo,</hi> and the wanton Embraces of the lustful <hi>Paramour.</hi> Of these two last, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> I shall more particularly treat, which as they are sins of the first Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, so hath their punishment been the most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and their Guilt always prosecuted with the

most fatal consequence of Divine Vengeance, as the <hi>Reader</hi> may plainly see in the several following <hi>Histories;</hi> of which some are extracted out of that excellent Piece of Mr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> his <hi>Murthers,</hi> and others altogether New, all re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Murther</hi> has been always look'd upon as a most detestable sin in the sight of God and Man, and punished as a Capital Offence; nor is <hi>Adultery</hi> to be less abhorr'd. The Commands of God, the Laws of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and other Nations at this day, inflict death on the miserable Criminal;
<pb facs="tcp:93450:6"/>
however it has obtained more favour amongst the debauch'd Sparks of our Age, who esteem it but a slight Peccadillo, a piece of Gallantry, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it rather the <hi>Glory</hi> than the <hi>Shame</hi> of their youthful heat, and vigorous Extravagance: But let such know, that God has promised by a severe threat, <hi>That he will judge the Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger and Adulterer;</hi> nor will they find the punishment so light as they imagine. This it was that brought a Deluge upon the old World, and this it is which hath since overturn'd Kingdoms, and laid wast the most flourishing States. And as there is no Place, nor hath been any Age, free from notorious Examples of this Crime, so also are there no degrees of Persons exempted from the commission of it: Princes of the highest Dignity being as well guilty, as those of more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Rank and Quality: But let such know, that they shall both tast the bitterness of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for God will as soon fling his Thunderbolt on the one as the other; the Princes Purple shall no more excuse him, than the poor mans Rags can defend him.</p>
                  <p>If our Body is the Temple of God, let us then keep it undefiled, and not make it a Sanctuary for <hi>Murthers</hi> and <hi>Adulteries</hi>; for that Holy Spirit will not endure the impurity of our thoughts, much less our polluted actions; our hands must not only be free from the stain of Blood, but our hearts from the guilt and the very desire of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:93450:7"/>
can draw us into those Ambuscades of more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Enemies he has laid to entrap us, and then charges us with his desperate Train of <hi>Adulteries</hi> and <hi>Murthers,</hi> and the whole body of <hi>succeeding Villainies.</hi> In <hi>Adultery</hi> he baits his Hook with the honey and sweets of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, paints the hidden Thorns, and sticks them with Flowers; guilds the Chains, and studs them with Diamonds; makes every curling Tress (the Witchcraft of the <hi>Fair</hi>) of the most soft and shining Silk, which he ties up in <hi>True-Love-knots</hi> for garniture: but when once we have swallowed the deceitful Potion, we quickly lose the relish of those mistaken sweets, and find that bitterness and sorrow were the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients in the fatal Composition, and a speedy <hi>Repentance</hi> our best and only <hi>Antidote.</hi>

Historian has transmitted to us, that by the Obliquity of their lives, we may be perswaded to amend our own, since we see that Sin always proves fatall to the Offender, and an Ignominious Death is the certain consequence of a Corrupt and Vicious Life. If perfect Innocence was the beauty of our Creation and that happy Dowry which God Almighty gave, when at his Command the Soul and Body first espoused each other, which the more Wily Serpent stole from us; Oh let us not be again Cheated by the same Deceiver, and sell our Integrity for the guilded Shows of Sin and Misery, exchange our Glory for Shame, and to satisfie one burning Lust, endure the Torment of Everlasting Flames.</p>
                     <p>The following Histories are all Tragical, and the parts of the chifest Actors writ in Characters of Blood; which are not so much designed to divert the Reader with the Variety of surprising Circumstances, as to afright him by the sad Examples from the Commission of that horrid Sin of Murther, of which sincerely to repent, is highly difficult, but to make Satisfaction for Impossible. When once the <hi>Golden Bowl</hi> is broke (which the wise man speaks of, <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> the 12<hi>th.</hi>) by the Impious hand of some bold Assassin, he fills full the Cup of Gods Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against him, which will be a draught more bitter than all the glozing pleasures Life or Fortune can sweeten with their greatest advantages. Humane Laws have provided Shackles and Dungeons, Racks and Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, not only to punish, but deter such sanguinary Bravo's, who, if they chance (which but rarely happens) to escape the latest hand of Justice, yet are they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly haunted with the horror of the Crime, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedate the Torments of a future, by the present Hell of an evil Conscience.</p>
                     <p>But I proceed to the History which is thus.</p>
                     <p>NEer <hi>Auxone,</hi> upon the Frontiers of <hi>Burgduny,</hi> dwelt an Antient Gentleman nobly descended, whose name was Monsieur <hi>De Grandmont,</hi> his vertuous Lady was Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyselle
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93450:8"/>
                        <hi>De Carny,</hi> this happy pair were bless'd with a plentiful Offspring and a fair Estate to support the Honour and Grandeur of the Family. They had three Sons and two Daughters, of which <hi>Grand Pre</hi> (who was the first and chiefest Pillar of the House) applyd himself wholly to Arms, and obtain'd leave to serve his Apprenticeship in the Wars under the Command of that Incomperable Captain <hi>Grave Maurice,</hi> then Earl of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> and since Prince of <hi>Orange. Vileneufe</hi> who altogether delighted in Books was sent to <hi>Pont au Mousson,</hi> and <hi>Masseron</hi> was for his Beauty beg'd a Page by that great Marshal of <hi>France</hi> who unfortunately lost his Head in the <hi>Bastile</hi> of <hi>Paris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hautefelia</hi> the Eldest of the two Daughters liv'd at home with her Parents, and <hi>de Cressy</hi> the youngest had the honour to attend a great Lady of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where she receiv'd all the advantages of a Noble and Vertuous Education. But see here how soon the Pleasure of Heaven can overthrow our most Establish'd fortunes, and sink all our present Joys and Ripening hopes into the botom of Despair. Within the Compass of a Year <hi>Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neufe</hi> was Drown'd as he bath'd himself in the River at <hi>Pont au Mousson, Masseron</hi> was kill'd in a Duell at <hi>Fontain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau</hi> by <hi>Rossat</hi> Page to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and <hi>Haute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felia</hi> dyed at home of a Feaver. <hi>Grandmont</hi> and <hi>de Carnye</hi> being thus made unfortunate by the death of three of their Children, resolv'd to call home the other two, which were now the only Comforts and Props of their declining Age. First from the Baroness of <hi>Lux</hi> came <hi>de Cressy</hi> who Succeeded her Sister and we shall now term by the name and title of <hi>Hautefelia</hi>; After her very short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came <hi>Grand Pre</hi> from <hi>Holland,</hi> where he left many Honourable marks of his Courage and Bravery. Upon his arrival, the Flower of all the Nobility and Gentry came to Condole with him for the Death of his Brothers and Sister, and Congratulate his happy return, whom they all admire as a most compleat Gentleman in whose mien shone all the Graces and Accomplishments of a brave and generous Cavalier. <hi>Grandmont</hi> observing the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93450:9"/>
Martial disposition of his Son, and fearing least the thirst of honour would again Transport him to the Wars, and that his towring Spirit would not long endure the lazy retirement of the Country, resolves to try if the softer Charms of Love and Beauty could not assail that Breast which seemed wholly devoted to the God of War; For which end he proffers <hi>Grand Pre</hi> the Choice of several young Ladyes and Gentlewomen for his Wife, of the richest and most Ancient families near <hi>Auxone</hi>; But <hi>Grand Pre</hi> appeared wholly averse to all proposals of this Nature, and thought it a high Blemish and disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Valour, to be made a slave and Captive to any Beauteous she, who knew no way to conquer but by smiles and the weak Artillery of her Eyes. <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> perceiving this design would not take effect, resolves to leave the Country and reside at <hi>Dijon</hi> (formerly the antient Seat of the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and now famous for the Present Court of <hi>Parliament</hi>) where he hoped amongst the great confluence of Ladyes and Gentlewomen, <hi>Grand Pre</hi> might at last Espye that Paragon of nature whose Excellencyes would subdue his stubborn heart, and Captivate his affections, which accordingly answered his Expectation.</p>
                     <p>On a Sunday Morning in Lent, <hi>Grand Pre</hi> went to the Royal Chappel to hear Father <hi>Iustinian</hi> Preach, and over against him saw a most delicate and beautiful young Lady, infinitely rich in apparel, but far more glorious in the perfections and Excellencyes of her mind; in a word being not used to encounter with such Beautyes, he was ravish'd with the Sweetness of her Angelic form, and she alone the Subject of his present Devotion and future Contemplation. Nor was <hi>Grand Pre</hi> less observ'd by the Lady, who seeing him a proper young Gallant well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, would sometimes feast her Eyes with a Stol'n glance, which presently her modesty and discretion would check her for, and paint her Cheeks with those grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful blushes, that <hi>Grand Pre</hi> was forc'd to do homage to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93450:9"/>
her Beauty and ask pardon of that God of Love against whose power and dignity he had so long offended.</p>
                     <p>Sermon being ended, <hi>Grand Pre</hi> took a turn or two in the Church, and ordered his Page to make private enquiry who the Lady was; he speedily inform'd him that she is Madamoyselle <hi>Mermanda,</hi> eldest Daughter to Monsieur <hi>de Cressonville,</hi> one of the chiefest Presidents of the Court of Parliament. <hi>Grand Pre</hi> was extremely pleased in knowing who she was, and the more, in that it was no disparagement to his Quality or Family to marry with her. Wherefore, bidding farewell to all the bloody conflicts of the Camp, he resolves his future Engagements into amorous Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which often prove no less fatal and dangerous: and accordingly, the next day, with two intimate Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, under pretence of other business, made a visit to Monsieur <hi>de Cressonville</hi>; who being abroad, his two Friends entertained the Mother, whil'st he made his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to the young Lady, whose conversation was so obliging and agreeable, that he now own'd no other hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness but what centred in the sole enjoyment of the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Mermanda. Grand Pre</hi> having received so respectful entertainment in his first visit, resolv'd to acquaint the old President with his affection to his Daughter, which he did, and having thus begun his Sute, left his Father <hi>Grandmont</hi> to finish it, whil'st he pay'd his daily Orisons to his beautiful Mistress.</p>
                     <p>Monsieur <hi>de Cressonville</hi> approv'd the Match; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Grandmont</hi> had likewise one only Daughter, and himself one only Son, desired it might be double, thereby to contract a more firm and stricter League between their two Houses; which, after some debates and conferences, was resolv'd upon. I do here on purpose omit the several Letters of Courtship between <hi>Grand Pre</hi> and <hi>Mermanda,</hi> and from <hi>de Malleray (Cressonville</hi>'s Son) to <hi>Hautefelia,</hi> both because they would swell this brief History beyond its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended bounds, and expressed nothing more of moment, than the common Raptures of endearing Lovers in their first Addresses. These Marriages, to the joy of the Parents,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93450:10"/>
and the great content of their Children, were pompously solemnized in <hi>Dijon,</hi> and the Interest and Honour of both Families (in the eyes of all) fix'd on the firm foundations of a lasting felicity. But, oh the strange and sudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of all worldly happiness! Our best fortune is chequer'd, &amp; our greatest joys seem only given us to usher in more dreadful sorrows. Some few months had passed, in which the Lovers reap'd the full Harvest of their short-liv'd Pleasures, when <hi>Hautefelia,</hi> whose temper was impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and revengeful, began to envy the advancement of her Sister-in-law <hi>Mermanda,</hi> and contemn her own: Her haughty humour could by no means submit to give place to her after marriage, who was her inferiour before. <hi>Mermanda,</hi> who was of a most gracious and mild nature, liv'd happy in the affections of <hi>Grand Pre:</hi> their virtuous behaviour, and loving respects to each other, was highly prais'd and applauded by all, but the sullen and envious <hi>Hautifelia.</hi> Mischief and revenge had now wholly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her thoughts, when she resolved to change the Scene; and make <hi>Mermanda</hi> as miserable in her Husband's Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, as formerly she had been happy in his Love; and considering how to accomplish her black designs under the fairest pretences, she remembred that the Baron of <hi>Betanford</hi> frequently visited <hi>Grand Pre</hi> and <hi>Mermanda,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which she might with easie arguments lay the surest foundations of jealousie and revenge. In pursuit hereof, the next day she sent a private Letter to <hi>Grand Pre</hi> by her Page, intreating him to come immediately over to her, to consult upon a point in which his Honour and future happiness were equally concern'd: He accordingly came, and supper being ended, <hi>de Malleray</hi> (after some discourse) complemented him to his Chamber, and took his leave; when <hi>Hautefelia</hi> coming up with tears in her eyes, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, That (to her great sorrow) she was assur'd that the Baron of <hi>Betanford,</hi> without respect to the sacred rules of Honour, Friendship, and Hospitality, had too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abus'd him, in his familiarity with <hi>Mermanda. Grand Pre,</hi> fir'd with this discourse, resolves a revenge upon both,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93450:10"/>
without considering the truth of circumstances, (so far does Jealousie infatuate!) that the next day riding home in the evening, he desired <hi>Mermanda</hi> to walk into the Garden, where in express terms he charged her with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty to him, and dishonesty with the Baron: all which with floods of tears she utterly deny'd, and so far prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon him, that he declared himself satisfied with those assurances of her fidelity, and was perfectly reconciled. <hi>Mermanda</hi> fearing that if the Baron should still continue his visits as formerly, they might awaken the sleeping Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie of her Husband, and to take off all grounds of a future suspicion, writ this following Letter to him.</p>

                     <p>Upon the receipt of this Letter, the Baron was highly incensed against <hi>Grand Pre,</hi> for entertaining such unjust and dishonourable thoughts of him: But to remove all jealousies, he immediately left his house, and took Coach for <hi>Paris. Grand Pre</hi> understanding the Barons sudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, grew more suspicious, imagining it to be a plot between him and his Wife; which so enraged him, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93450:11"/>
he refused her bed, and resolved that a quick and severe revenge upon them both should only attone for those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries he had received.

                     <p>The Baron having received this Letter, caused the Page to dine with him, and after dinner sent him away with this answer; <hi>Tell thy Master, that I will not fail to meet him on horse-back, without a Second, at the hour and place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> On <hi>Thursday</hi> morning they met accordingly, having only their Surgeons with them, and after a sharp and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute fight on horse-back, and the exchange of several wounds, <hi>Grand Pre</hi> receiv'd a desperate thrust in the belly, upon which he fell from his Horse, and <hi>Betanford</hi> remain'd Victor, who like a Noble Cavalier assisted him to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Village, where his Surgeons took care of his wounds. The next morning, having something recover'd his senses, the Baron satisfied him of the odiousness of the scandal raised against his own Honour, and <hi>Mermanda</hi>'s Virtue. These solemn protestations prevail'd upon <hi>Grand
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93450:11"/>
Pre,</hi> who now repented his groundless Jealousie, promis'd to renew his love to his Wife, and live and die his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Friend. Some few days after they took leave of one another, and <hi>Grand Pre</hi> returning home, related to his Wife the occasion and event of the Combat, begg'd her pardon for his jealous and credulous humour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised for the future that nothing should ever divide his heart from his virtuous and faithful <hi>Mermanda.</hi> Thus were all discontents buried in <hi>Oblivion,</hi> and their kind endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments sealed a perfect reconciliation.</p>
                     <p>But now must I return to <hi>Hautefelia,</hi> who seeing her wicked design thus disappointed, resolved rather to sell her Soul to the Devil, than not purchase her revenge on <hi>Mermanda</hi>; and accordingly struck a bargain with <hi>le Fresnay</hi> an Apothecary, for the reward of 200 Crowns to poyson her, which he promised, and effected in less than two months time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hautefelia,</hi> who had been thus succesful in her first Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy, instantly begins to teem with a second; and as she hated <hi>Mermanda</hi> the Sister, so did she never love <hi>de Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery</hi> the Brother, though her own Husband, and therefore resolves by a safe and speedy death to dispatch him to another world. To this end she set <hi>de Mallery</hi> at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>Grand Pre,</hi> by telling him, that her Brother had been jealous of <hi>Mermanda,</hi> call'd her the Baron of <hi>Betan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s Strumpet, upon which they fought; and that since by her sudden death it was shrewdly suspected he had poyson'd her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>De Mallery,</hi> infinitely grieved at this News, acquaints his Father <hi>de Cressonville</hi> therewith, expecting that by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Law he would question him for it; but <hi>de Cresson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> thought it more prudence to forgive those injuries, than publish his Daughters Infamy by an unseasonable and uncertain Vindication. But <hi>de Mallery</hi>'s fiery temper could not admit those sober considerations, but hastily resolves a revenge for his Sisters death, and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that <hi>Grand Pre</hi> was lately come to <hi>Dijon,</hi> sent him by a Confident of his own this following Challenge.</p>

                     <p>The next evening <hi>Grand Pre</hi> met him, and making choice of single Rapier, they stript, and without further ceremony fell to it, commanding their Surgeons to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw into the next Field till the death of one of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd the other Victor. After the third breathing, <hi>de Mallery</hi> receiv'd a mortal wound under the left Pap, upon which he instantly dropt down dead, without speaking a word. <hi>Grand Pre</hi> mounted his Horse, and fled to <hi>Dole,</hi> a Parliament free City, where he stay'd till he had obtain'd his pardon, which at last he gain'd, notwithstanding all the opposition de <hi>Cressonville</hi> and his Friends could make to prevent it.</p>

                        <hi>Hautefelia</hi> hearing of her Husband's death, (which was welcom News to her) presently pack'd up her Jewels and other Goods of value, and went home to her Father at <hi>Auxone,</hi> where with an imperious hand, and more wicked heart, she controll'd at pleasure, till the return of her Brother, who in this time had discover'd her malice to <hi>Mermanda</hi> and himself, and that she had been the only
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93450:12"/>
cause of his fighting with the Baron of <hi>Betanford,</hi> and killing <hi>de Mallery</hi>; all which created in him so great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and hatred to her, that he either wholly declin'd her company, or treated her with the most publick ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of scorn and indignation. <hi>Hautefelia</hi> was now as resolv'd in her revenge against him, as she was formerly against <hi>Mermanda</hi> and <hi>de Mallery,</hi> and accordingly made a new contract with <hi>le Fresnay</hi> for 300 Crowns more to poyson him, which within a short time after he effected. She now domineer'd at will, without the least sense of her Crimes, or dread of that Vengeance which so closely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd her. Scarce was <hi>Grand Pre</hi> laid in his Grave, and his Funeral solemniz'd, but <hi>le Fresnay</hi> revelling at a Tavern in <hi>Dijon,</hi> where every drop of Wine he drank was the price of innocent blood, growing now wanton in his Cups, commits a Rape upon <hi>Margaret Pivot,</hi> a Girl of twelve years old, and Daughter to the Master of the house, upon which he was apprehended; but denying the fact, was put to the Rack, and at the second torment confessed it, upon which he was condemn'd to be hang'd. Two Fryars who were sent to prepare him for his death, by their pious exhortations so wrought upon his conscience, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to them, That at the instigation of <hi>Hautefelia</hi> he had poyson'd <hi>Mermanda</hi> and her Husband <hi>Grand Pre,</hi> and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved 500 Crowns for a Reward. Upon this Confession his first Sentence was alter'd, and for these bloody Villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies he was condemn'd to be broken alive on the Wheel, and there to languish till he died; which was executed accordingly.</p>
                     <p>A Provost was immediately dispatch'd to apprehend <hi>Hautefelia,</hi> who found her at her Fathers house, dancing in the Garden with several Gentlemen and Ladies, who seiz'd her, and carried her before a President and two Councellors appointed to examine her. At first she im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently deny'd all, and said that <hi>le Fresnay</hi> had basely bely'd her Innocence; upon which being adjudg'd to the Rack, at the first torment she confessed all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Criminal Judges pronounc'd sentence upon her,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93450:13"/>
That she should be carried to the place of Execution, have her Breasts sear'd and torn off with red-hot Pincers, be afterwards hang'd, her Body burnt, and the ashes thrown into the Air, which was accordingly executed.</p>
                     <q>Thus we see by the sad example of <hi>Hautefelia,</hi> that they who sow wickedness shall reap misery, and he that sheds his Brothers blood, stains his own Soul, which nothing can wash away, but <hi>that Fountain of living Waters</hi> which cleanseth from all unrighteousness. The Iudgments of Heaven may seem to follow the impenitent sinner with Leaden Feet, yet they strike at last with Hands of Iron.</q>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Pisani</hi> robs <hi>Gasparino</hi> of the affections of his Mistress <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta. Gasparino</hi> challenges him for the injury, and kills him in the field. He afterwards renews his Sute to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stineta,</hi> who dissembling her revenge, by the assistance of two Bravo's, <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli,</hi> murder him in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and are all three taken and executed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the City of <hi>Pavia</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Milain</hi> liv'd Seignior <hi>Thomaso Vituri,</hi> a Noble Gentleman, who had one only Daughter call'd <hi>Christineta,</hi> a Lady no less emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in all perfections of the Mind, than glorious in the outward excellencies of an admired Beauty. Amongst other Gentlemen who made their Courtship to this Lady, Seignior <hi>Emanuel Gasparino</hi> of <hi>Cremona</hi> was one; who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting his intimate Friend Seignior <hi>Pisani</hi> with his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he intreated his company to <hi>Pavia,</hi> and his friendly assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in this great affair. Being arriv'd at <hi>Pavia,</hi> they were respectfully entertain'd by <hi>Vituri,</hi> to whom <hi>Gaspa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino</hi> motion'd his Sute to marry <hi>Christineta,</hi> which he cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously receiv'd, and like a prudent Father desired some time to advise upon it. During this interval <hi>Gasparino</hi> found <hi>Christineta</hi> very cool in her affections towards him,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93450:13"/>
whil'st he doted on her Beauty, and endeavour'd by all those courtly entertainments, which often please the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Sex, to gain her love: But still finding her averse, and not knowing what further to offer, he resolves to make use of the intercession of his friend <hi>Pisani</hi> to mediate for him, who readily accepted of it, and promis'd to discharge himself in this trust with all diligence and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Pisani</hi> presently after finding an opportunity, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed himself to <hi>Christineta</hi> in behalf of his Friend; with all the Charms of Wit and Eloquence that the most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Lover could express his Passion in. <hi>Christineta</hi> seem'd strangely perplex'd at his discourse, which he carelesly observing, begg'd she would please to make him for once happy in a pleasing answer to his Friend and her Servant <hi>Gasparino.</hi> After a serious pause, and deep sigh, she told him she must needs confess the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter he had given his Friend was both honourable and true, but she had already fix'd her affection upon another person, who at least in her own esteem was more deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. <hi>Pisani</hi> earnestly press'd her to nominate the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman so happy in her love, which she deny'd, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd if he would meet her next day at eight in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the <hi>Nuns Garden</hi> at St. <hi>Clare,</hi> she would acquaint him both with his name and person; which he readily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to, and took his leave. When finding out his friend <hi>Gasparino,</hi> he related to him the truth of the former pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, but conceal'd the intended meeting; whereupon <hi>Gasparino</hi> despairing of success in this amour, civilly took his leave, and return'd to <hi>Cremona.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The appointed hour being come, <hi>Christineta,</hi> with her Prayer-book in her hand, went to the Nunnery, and so to the Garden, where having taken a turn, <hi>Pisani</hi> entred, and having saluted her with the common Complements of the day, told her he was now come to wait the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of her promise: <hi>Sir,</hi> (says she, with blushes in her cheeks) <hi>the person I love much resembles your self, (pray inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret my words with honour) and be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Pisani</hi> strangely surpriz'd at this answer, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that to reject the Ladies Love was discourteous, but to betray his Friend base and dishonourable; after a little stop thus replied, <hi>As I must needs own the greatness of my obligation to you, without any merit of mine; so I must humbly beg your excuse, in that I cannot be your Servant, but I must be a Traytor to Friendship, Iustice and Honour.</hi> Upon which he abruptly took his leave, and the next day return'd to <hi>Cremona.</hi>

                     <p>Come we now to speak of <hi>Gasparino,</hi> who notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the secret management of this affair, had notice of it; and considering the nature of <hi>Pisani</hi>'s treachery, was extremely incens'd at him, and vow'd a sudden and sharp revenge. His judgment being thus overwhelm'd with passion, he thought not only himself, but his whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dishonour'd in this affront; and understanding <hi>Pisani</hi> was in <hi>Pavia,</hi> taking a resolute Gentleman along with him, and his Lacquey, he rode over to him, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himself in his Inn till the next morning, he sent this Challenge to him by his confident Friend <hi>Sebastiano,</hi> who deliver'd it accordingly.</p>

                        <hi>Pisani</hi> having read the Letter, return'd this answer; <hi>Pray tell</hi> Gasparino <hi>from me, that I will meet him with my Second at the hour and place appointed. Sebastiano</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, <hi>Pisani</hi> found out a Gentleman of his acquaintance call'd <hi>Sfondrato,</hi> (to whom he related the whole business) who readily engag'd himself.

                     <p>No less doubtful than bloody was the engagement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Gasparino</hi> and <hi>Pisani,</hi> when at the third encounter <hi>Gasparino</hi> run <hi>Pisani</hi> through the heart, at which he fell stark dead to the ground. <hi>Sebastiano</hi> running to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate <hi>Gasparino</hi> for his Victory, <hi>Sfondrato</hi> call'd to him to prepare himself, which he did, and so with various fortune they fought, till providence resolving to make both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties equal losers, after they had breath'd three several times, <hi>Sfondrato</hi> run his enemy <hi>Sebastiano</hi> through the small of the belly, and so nail'd him to the ground, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring away his life on the point of his Rapier; which done, their wounds were dress'd; <hi>Gasparino</hi> fled to <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Sfondrato</hi> to <hi>Florence.

                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:93450:16"/>Some time after <hi>Gasparino</hi> having obtain'd his Pardon, returns home, from whence he began presently to renew his love to <hi>Christineta,</hi> first by Letters, then by his Friends, and at last in person. She dissembling her malice, thought this a fit opportunity to be reveng'd on him for the death of <hi>Pisani</hi>; and finding him very earnest in his Sute, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points to meet him in the <hi>Nuns Garden</hi> at six next morning. No sooner was <hi>Gasparino</hi> gone, but she agreed with two Ruffians, <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli,</hi> for 100 Duckats to murther him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gasparino</hi> and <hi>Christineta</hi> are both early up, but with different intents, and so are <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi>: They all meet, she walks in publick, they hide themselves in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, when immediately in came <hi>Gasparino,</hi> and approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Christineta</hi> with his Hat in his hand to salute her, she utter'd these words, <hi>Gasparino, this place I first had conference in with</hi> Pisani, <hi>and here I purpose to have my last with You:</hi> At which words the Ruffians issued out and killed him, but with some noise and resistance. <hi>Christineta</hi> thinking him not dead enough, runs to him, thrusts her Handkerchief in his mouth, and with a Stilletto stabs him many times into the body, with this bloody Speech; <hi>This I sacrifice to the memory of my dear Love</hi> Pisani. Then throwing the body into the Well of the Garden, the Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians fled at a Postern, and <hi>Christineta</hi> went to the Nuns Church.</p>
                     <p>The Nuns in their Cells having heard the clashing of Swords, acquaint the Abbess with it, who with other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany coming into the Garden, found the Postern o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, saw the Alleys bloody, and suspected Murther; whereupon she order'd the Garden to be search'd, but forgot the Well. The Magistrates being advertis'd of it, caused enquiry to be made among all the Chyrurgeons, who (having fresh-wounds) came lately to be cur'd? <hi>Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutio,</hi> a principal Chyrurgeon, informed them of <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli,</hi> who being both sent for, and examin'd how they came by their wounds, they said they had a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the morning in the <hi>Nuns Garden</hi> at St. <hi>Clare</hi>; which a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>greeing with the relation of the Nuns, all was ended.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Gasparino</hi> having been now missing from his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings two whole nights, which his Lacquey confirm'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination, with some other circumstances of suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, the Judges order'd <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd, examin'd, and tortur'd, which they stoutly bore, without confessing any thing. The Garden was again search'd, and the Well which was neglected before, when letting down their hooks, they brought up some pieces of wrought black Taffata, which <hi>Gasparino</hi>'s Lacquey did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Master wore when he last saw him; and sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching more narrowly, they brought up the dead body with thirteen several wounds, whereupon all concluded <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi> guilty. A little Boy standing by, ask'd what cloth that was in his mouth? which being pull'd out, was found to be a Cambrick Handkerchief with <hi>Christineta</hi>'s Name upon it. Upon this she was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the midst of her pleasures; but upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deny'd she knew any thing of his death, until she was adjudg'd to the Rack, when she confessed the fact, and that in revenge of <hi>Pisani</hi>'s death she had hired <hi>Bianco</hi> and <hi>Brindoli</hi> to murder him for 100 Crowns.</p>
                     <p>The Ruffians were condemn'd to have their right hands cut off, and then to be hang'd, and their bodies thrown into the River <hi>Po. Christineta</hi> was first hang'd, and then burnt, and her ashes thrown into the Air, which Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were perform'd, to the great satisfaction of Justice, and all the spectators.</p>
                     <q>May all Christians read this History with a holy dread, and remember it with horror and detestation. If thou wilt shun the Punishment, be sure to avoid the Crime; for if the wages of sin is Death, sure none but a Madman will lay out his pains to be so rewarded.</q>

                           <hi>Mortaign</hi> deluding <hi>Josselina</hi> with promise of marriage, gets her with child, and then causes his Lacquey <hi>Le Verdure,</hi> and <hi>Le Palma</hi> her Host, to murder her and her Son. <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella, Le Palma</hi>'s Wife, by her jealousie of her Husband discovers the murther, upon which they are all taken and executed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOt far from the City of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> near <hi>Darency</hi> a small Countrey Village, dwelt an honest Farmer call'd <hi>Andrew Mollard,</hi> who being a Widower had one only Daughter named <hi>Iosselina,</hi> whom he intended for his Heir, a Maid of that blooming Beauty, that she was justly call'd <hi>Iosselina the Fair.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Within a league of <hi>Mollard</hi>'s house dwelt a rich Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who had several Children, of which the eldest was <hi>Mortaign,</hi> but young in years, though of great hopes, and nobly educated in the Families of several Persons of Honour. <hi>Mortaign</hi> having now liv'd some years in <hi>Paris,</hi> was desirous to see his Father <hi>De Coucye,</hi> who was both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and sickly, as also to be present at the Nuptials of one of his Sisters, who was to be married to a Gentleman of <hi>Avergne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Wedding being over, and <hi>Mortaign</hi> weary of the diversions of the Countrey, resolves upon his return to <hi>Paris</hi>; but the night before his departure <hi>De Coucy</hi> fell dangerously sick of a burning Feaver, which for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent put a stop to his journey. During his stay in the Countrey, as he was walking one day in the Fields he sprung a Pheasant, which flying to the next Woods, he sent for his Hawk; but having rang'd far and near for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hours in quest of his Game, which he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, he grew very thirsty, and 'spying <hi>Mollard</hi>'s house at a distance, made up to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93450:17"/>
                        <hi>Mortaign</hi> seeing a man in the Vineyard, demanded if he might have any Wine there; <hi>Mollard</hi> answer'd, Yes; and (guessing by his face who he was) courteously invited him into his house, where being set down, he sent his Daughter <hi>Iosselina</hi> for Wine, and what other homely Dainties his house afforded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mortaign</hi> admiring to see so fair a Maid in so obscure a place, and curiously observing each grace and feature, to which was added a natural modesty, and simplicity of behaviour, was wholly ravish'd in the contemplation of her Beauty, and vow'd to himself he would be Master of her affections, how dear soever it cost him. No sooner had <hi>Mortaign</hi> entertain'd these thoughts, but a lucky oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity (and most favourable to his designs) offer'd it self; for <hi>Mollard</hi> told him, that he rented a small Tenement of <hi>De Coucy,</hi> who now su'd him for two Heriots, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intreated his good word to his Father in his behalf, which he promis'd, and with thanks for his kind reception, departed.</p>
                     <p>Under pretence of discourse and business with <hi>Mollard, Mortaign</hi> made frequent visits to <hi>Iosselina,</hi> whose Chastity he attempted with variety of Gifts and Presents, which she modestly refus'd to accept upon so dishonourable terms; and assur'd him, that as a chast and virtuous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation was the greatest part of her Fortune, so she would never exchange it for the infamous portion of shame and misery. <hi>Mortaign</hi> was now out of all hopes of success; but rather than miss his aim, was resolv'd to play his last stake, and promise Marriage; and accordingly told her, that notwithstanding the inequality of their Birth and Fortunes, he would condescend to marry her, provided she would first permit him to enjoy his desire. <hi>Iosselina</hi> flattering her self with the hopes of advancement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to it; and now finding her self with child, (which her Father likewise discover'd, to his great grief and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row) advertis'd <hi>Mortaign</hi> of it, who one night stole her away from her Father's, and sent her ten leagues off from <hi>Durency,</hi> to a poor Kinswomans house of his, where she was deliver'd of a fair lusty Boy.</p>

                        <hi>Calintha, Mortaign</hi>'s Mother, who knew nothing of these passages, advised him to marry, and proposes a match to Monsieur <hi>De Vassey,</hi> the Seneschal of <hi>La Palisse,</hi> between his only Daughter Madamoyselle <hi>La Varina,</hi> and her eldest Son <hi>Mortaign:</hi> The Parents readily concluded, and upon sight the young Couple agreed, so that it was now generally reported the Marriage would be suddenly solemniz'd. This News startl'd <hi>Iosselina,</hi> who considering she must look to her self, being now dis-inherited by her Father, and having no Friend left to assist or advise her, she resolves to write <hi>Mortaign</hi> a Letter, to re-mind him of his promise, and desire some relief for her self and her Son.</p>

                     <p>With this to <hi>Mortaign,</hi> she sent another of the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to his Mother <hi>Calintha,</hi> which they receiv'd, when he, as an unworthy Gentleman, triumphs in his sin, and mocks at her poverty, and will neither relieve her or the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93450:18"/>
Child, but burns the Letter without any further concern at it. <hi>Calintha</hi>'s malice was so great, that she not only refus'd to assist them her self, but commands him that he should not supply them with any conveniencies, and heartily wishes them both in another world. At the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this cruel News, <hi>Iosselina</hi> fell into a swoon, and had not some accidental assistance came in, she had then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her life and misery together. Barbarous <hi>Calintha</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in this interim poor <hi>Iosselina</hi>'s residence, was so devilishly bent against her, that she persuaded her Landlady in a dark and cold night to turn her and the Child out of doors, and suffer her to have no other shelter but the ground for her bed, and the Heavens for her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering. In this distressed condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the unfortunate Babe in her arms, she wander'd all night through the fields and places unknown, when by the morning light she discovered a Village which she knew, where she sold her cloaths from her back to relieve her self and her Child. Here she continued some time in great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, when at last, forc'd by meer want and necessity, she acquainted some persons with her sad and deplorable condition, who advis'd to send <hi>Mortaign</hi> his Son home, and provide for her self.</p>
                     <p>This was not so secretly discours'd, but it came to the ears of <hi>La Varina, Mortaign</hi>'s Mistress at <hi>La Plaisse,</hi> who presently withdrew her affection from him, and her Father his respect; which <hi>Mortaign</hi> perceiving, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was upon the account of <hi>Iosselina,</hi> swore he would destroy both her and her Son, and the better to dissemble his design, he gave orders that she should be lodg'd in a better Inn, where she was furnish'd with all necessaries; and further sent her word, that he had provided a Nurse for his Son, and would shortly send his Lacquey for him, and take more particular care for her support and maintenance, if she would keep things private to her self. <hi>Iosselina</hi> was much rejoyced hereat, and within three days <hi>Mortaign</hi> sent his Lacquey <hi>Le Verdure</hi> for the Babe, which with many tears and kisses she delivered to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93450:19"/>
him. <hi>Le Verdure</hi> following his Masters command, and being now four leagues from <hi>Villepont,</hi> strangles the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Infant whil'st it smil'd in his face, and wrapping it in a linen cloth, threw it into the River <hi>Lignon.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Mortaign</hi> being thus rid of the Son, makes a bargain with <hi>Le Palma (Iosselina</hi>'s Host) and his Lacquey <hi>Le Verdure,</hi> for 200 Franks to stifle the Mother in her bed, which they perform'd, and buried her body in the Garden. As soon as these Villains had perpetrated this cruel murther, they went over to <hi>Durency</hi> to give <hi>Mortaign</hi> an account, and receive their reward; which having done, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued several days together frolicking and drinking; when at last <hi>Le Palma</hi> went home to <hi>Villepont</hi> to his Wife <hi>Isabella</hi>; who being an old woman, and he a young man, she was jealous of his stay, supposing he went out in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with <hi>Iosselina,</hi> whereupon she entertain'd him with this salutation, <hi>Le Palma</hi> (quoth she) <hi>you are very unkind so soon to forsake your Where</hi> Josselina. For which he gave her the lye, call'd her Whore, and exprest himself highly passionate and angry. She continued her railing, and provok'd him to that degree of impatience, that he struck her a box on the ear, which fell'd her dead to the ground, upon this noise the Neighbours came in, and supposing his Wife dead, apprehended <hi>Le Palma,</hi> and carried him before the Procurer <hi>Fiscal</hi> of <hi>La Palisse,</hi> who committed him to Prison. <hi>Isabella</hi> being recover'd, complains to the Fiscal of her Husbands cruelty towards her, gives a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the occasion of the quarrel; adding, <hi>that if</hi> Josselina <hi>is not her Husbands Strumpet, she believes he is her Murtherer, of which her Maid can say more.

                     <p>NOt many years since, at the City of <hi>Valentia</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> lived Don <hi>Pedro de Alsemero,</hi> a young and Noble Cavalier, who wholly applying himself to the Wars, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his own plentiful Estate as large a share of Honour and Reputation. This Gentleman, whose temper altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclin'd to Martial affairs, resolv'd to leave his own Countrey, (now in peace) and enter himself into the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the Valiant Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> and accordingly went to <hi>Alicant,</hi> where he stay'd in expectation of a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93450:20"/>
wind. During his abode here, going one morning to Church, he observ'd a young Lady kneeling over-against him, with whose Beauty he was so surpriz'd, that it was difficult to determine whether Love or Devotion more inflam'd his heart, and inspir'd his thoughts. Mass being ended, he enquir'd of the Priest who this Lady was, her Name and Quality: The Priest told him, She is Daughter to Don <hi>Diego de Vermandero,</hi> Captain of the Castle, and her Name Donna <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna.</hi> The next morning <hi>Alsemero</hi> rose early, and went to the same Church, in hopes fortune would bless him with a second sight of her whose charming Graces had already so far prevail'd upon him: when entring the Quire, he saw her upon her knees at prayers in the same place. <hi>Alsemero,</hi> who thought himself extremely blest with so lucky an opportuity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to improve it to the best advantage; and kneeling down by her, (not having the patience to wait till Mass was ended) whisper'd his affections in her ear, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Devotions with his amorous Complements, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to live and die her affectionate Servant. The Lady check'd his bold Address with a modest reprehension, which (Prayers being ended) <hi>Alsemero</hi> renew'd with all the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate expressions of a vigorous Lover, and after several refusals, at last prevail'd to wait upon her to the Castle, where the Captain her Father received him with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable respect, and in return for his civilities to his Daughter, shew'd him the rarities and strength of the Fort. <hi>Alsemero</hi> continued his addresses to the Lady by frequent visits, which the Captain her Father seem'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage by a generous and courtly reception. In <hi>Alicant</hi> liv'd a young Gentleman of Noble Extract and plentiful Estate, whose name was <hi>Alonso Piracquo,</hi> a compleat Courtier, and passionately in love with <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Piracquo,</hi> who had a long time conceal'd his affection, resolves now to make a visit to <hi>Vermandero,</hi> and acquaint him with his passion for his Daughter, which he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly did: <hi>Vermandero</hi> receiv'd him with all the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of respect and kindness, thank'd him for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93450:20"/>
he did him in his honourable proposals, which he highly approved of, and was of nothing more ambitious, than an alliance with a person of so great worth and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Thus we see <hi>Alsemero</hi> rivall'd in his pretensions to his Mistress, by an unknown Cavalier; but however, though <hi>Piracquo</hi> had gain'd the Father, <hi>Alsemero</hi> had already won the Daughter, who carried her self with that prudence and respect to <hi>Piracquo,</hi> that he liv'd in hopes, whil'st <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semero</hi> had the assurance of her love and affection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vermandero</hi> after some time understanding the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna,</hi> which more respected <hi>Alseme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> than <hi>Piracquo,</hi> now declared himself in behalf of <hi>Pirac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo,</hi> and with an austere look commanded her to direct her affections accordingly; which she not observing, he withdrew himself to his Countrey-house at <hi>Briamata,</hi> and took her privately along with him. <hi>Piracquo</hi> had here the opportunity of courting his Mistress, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd <hi>Alsemero,</hi> who had already gain'd the Fort, which <hi>Piracquo</hi> in vain endeavoured to storm. <hi>Piracquo</hi> made his constant visits, whil'st <hi>Alsemero</hi> could only sollicite by Letters, which were powerful enough to preserve the heart he had already obtained. Several Letters had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed between <hi>Alsemero</hi> and <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna</hi> without the privity of <hi>Vermandero,</hi> when the last told him, <hi>That as he was sole master of her affections, so she earnestly coveted his company, which she desired that evening at eleven, when she would acquaint him with a secret which concern'd them both.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alsemero</hi> upon this advice took post, and arriv'd at the hour appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when going privately into <hi>Vermandero</hi>'s house, he found <hi>Diaphanta</hi> her waiting Gentlewoman at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his coming, who directed him to <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna's</hi> Chamber. And here, with the Readers leave, I'll draw the Curtain before those amorous Complements and more familiar Dalliances with which the Lovers entertained themselves. In discourse <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna</hi> cast out some doubtful expressions to this purpose, <hi>That before</hi> Piracquo <hi>was in another world, there was no hopes for him to enjoy her for his Wife in this. Alsemero</hi> presently understood the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93450:21"/>
sense of it, and offer'd to send him a Challenge, and fight him, which she would by no means admit of, and desired him to leave <hi>Alicant</hi> for a short time, and return to <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, and for the rest</hi> (says she) <hi>repose your self upon my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and affection.</hi> The morning now growing upon them, <hi>Alsemero</hi> took his leave, and promised a full obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of her commands, and accordingly within four days left <hi>Alicant,</hi> and went back to <hi>Valentia.</hi> This mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (though private) was not so closely carried, but <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandero</hi> had notice of it, whereat he was very angry, but however assured <hi>Piracquo,</hi> that in a short time she should accomplish his desires, and that if his paternal admonitions could not, his authority should prevail over his Daughters perverseness. Thus was <hi>Piracquo</hi> encouraged by <hi>Verman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dero,</hi> though he had private intelligence sent him that <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice-Ioanna</hi> was already contracted to <hi>Alsemero,</hi> and it would now more nearly concern him to consult his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by an honourable retreat, than to advance his Sute with so much zeal and violence, which it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible he should ever obtain. But <hi>Piracquo</hi> press'd on more eagerly, which gave <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna</hi> great trouble and disquiet. <hi>Vermandero</hi> understanding that <hi>Alsemero</hi> was gone back to <hi>Valentia,</hi> return'd to <hi>Alicant,</hi> where <hi>Piracquo</hi> made his daily visits. There was a gallant young Gentleman of the Castle whose name was Don <hi>Antonio de Flores,</hi> a person who dearly affected <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna,</hi> and one whom she thought might be a fit instrument to execute her barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and bloody design. She sent for <hi>De Flores</hi> accordingly, (who was now besotted with her Beauty) and acquainted him with her intentions, and by the powerful arguments of her more particular kindness and respect, won him to promise, that within few days he would answer her desires. <hi>De Flores</hi> insinuates himself into <hi>Piracquo</hi>'s company, and waiting for an opportunity, he heard <hi>Piracquo</hi> one day commend the strength of the <hi>Castle,</hi> when <hi>De Flores</hi> told him he had not yet seen that which consisted in the <hi>Case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,</hi> which were stored with good Ordnance to scour the Ditches: These <hi>Piracquo</hi> desired to see, but <hi>De Flores</hi>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:93450:21"/>
told him it was now noon, and if he pleased he would meet him after dinner, and wait upon him himself. After Dinner they met accordingly, went to the Ravelins, Sconces and Bulwarks, and from thence by a Postern to the Ditches and to the <hi>Casemates:</hi> Three of them they had view'd, and coming to the last, <hi>De Flores</hi> laid off his Rapier, telling <hi>Piracquo</hi> that the descent was narrow and craggy, upon which <hi>Piracquo</hi> put off his. Being entred into the Vault of the <hi>Casemate,</hi> as <hi>Piracquo</hi> was looking through a Port-hole <hi>De Flores</hi> (who had hid a Sword and Ponyard behind the door, stabb'd him into the back, so swiftly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling his blows, that he killed him dead, and buried him under the ruines of an old wall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>De Flores</hi> having committed this murther, acquaints <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna</hi> with it, who was over-joy'd at it, and the better to blind the world caused it to be reported, that <hi>Piracquo</hi> was seen to go forth the Castle-gate, and take boat in the City, as was supposed for a little Sea-air. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racquo</hi> being thus miss'd, after several days search in vain, was suppos'd to be drown'd at Sea; and three months being now past, <hi>Alsemero</hi> was solemnly married to <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna</hi> at <hi>Alicant</hi> in much state and bravery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alsemero</hi> had not been long married, but he grew jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his Wife, and so far restrain'd her former liberty, that she complain'd to the Captain her Father of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous usage, upon which <hi>Alsemero</hi> provided a Coach, and carried her away to <hi>Valentia. Vermandero</hi> willing to know how matters stood between his Daughter and her Husband, sent <hi>De Flores</hi> to <hi>Valentia</hi> with Letters to them both. <hi>Alsemero</hi> being abroad, she told him of her Husbands unkindness, of which he taking the advantage, reviv'd his old sute: she willingly complies with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and prays him to see her more often. <hi>Alsemero</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming home, understands by his Wife that <hi>De Flores</hi> had been there with Letters from her Father, and by <hi>Diaphan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> her Waiting-woman (who was one of his spies) that there passed many amorous kisses between <hi>De Flores</hi> and her Mistress, and relates to him whatever she either heard
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93450:22"/>
or saw. <hi>Alsemero</hi> in a great fury flies to his Wife, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges her with too much familiarity with <hi>De Flores,</hi> and as his passion rises into a greater rage, calls her Whore, Strumpet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon which, to palliate her own Crimes, she was forced to discover <hi>Piracquo</hi>'s murther. <hi>Know</hi> (says she) Alsemero, <hi>since you will enforce me to shew the true cause of my chast familiarity with</hi> De Flores, <hi>that he it was who at my request dispatch'd</hi> Piracquo, <hi>without which I could never have enjoy'd you for my Husband</hi>; and so told him all the circumstances of that cruel Murther, and conjur'd him to conceal the same; vowing to die a thousand deaths rather than defile his Bed. <hi>Alsemero</hi> wondred at this discourse, and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged his Wife to admit <hi>De Flores</hi> no more to her company; but she continuing a correspondence with him, which <hi>Diaphanta</hi> informed her Master of, he pretended one day a Journey into the Countrey; but with a Case of Pistols in his Pocket, and his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier and Ponyard privately withdrew into his Closet, which was within his Bed-chamber.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>De Flores</hi> had presently notice that <hi>Alsemero</hi> was gone into the Countrey, and immediately came over to visit <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna</hi>; and as they were in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of their pleasures upon the Bed, <hi>Alsemero</hi> rushed in, and discharged his Pistols on them, and afterwards stabb'd them with his Sword and Ponyard, of which wounds they instantly died. This being done, he went and acquainted the Criminal Judges with the death of his Wife and <hi>De Flores,</hi> whom he had killed in the very act of Adultery. <hi>Diaphanta</hi> appeared a Witness for him, who declared upon Oath, That she had several times seen her Mistress and <hi>De Flores</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery, and had acquainted her Master with it. Upon mature deliberation <hi>Alsemero</hi> was acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Fact, and the dead Bodies ordered to be buried.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:93450:22"/>But now let us speak of Don <hi>Thomaso Piracquo,</hi> who had formerly advised his Brother <hi>Alonso Piracquo</hi> to give over his sute to <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna</hi>: He hearing of all these occurrences afresh, remembers his dead Brother, and confidently supposes that <hi>Alsemero</hi> and <hi>Beatrice-Ioanna</hi> had a hand in the loss of him; wherefore he now resolves to call <hi>Alsemero</hi> to account for him, and accordingly sent him this Challenge to <hi>Allicant,</hi> where he now resided.</p>

his Rapier being broke, he was forced to yield himself their Prisoner.</p>
                     <p>Thus was he brought a pitied spectacle to <hi>Alicant,</hi> where he was condemned to lose his head; and being upon the Scaffold, and seeing no hopes of life, he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Don <hi>Alonso Piracquo</hi>'s murther by <hi>De Flores</hi> in all its circumstances, protesting his own innocency, only in the concealment of it: Of which the Judges being advised, they caused his head to be taken off for <hi>Thomaso,</hi> and his body to be thrown into the Sea for concealing <hi>Alonso</hi>'s murther, and the bodies of <hi>De Flores</hi> and <hi>Beatrice-Ioan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to be taken out of their Graves, and burnt at the common place of execution, and their ashes thrown into the Air.</p>

                     <p>IN the Reign of <hi>Leonardo Donato</hi> Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> there lived a worthy Gentleman called Seignior <hi>Iacomo Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldi,</hi> who had one Daughter named Donna <hi>Victorina,</hi> a young Gentlewoman rich, noble, and fair, and courted by several persons of the first rank and quality in <hi>Venice.</hi> Amongst other sutors, Seignior <hi>Sypontus</hi> was most estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Lady; but having lately suffered great losses by the <hi>Turks,</hi> her Father recommended Seignior <hi>Souranza</hi> to her affections, who as he was of a far greater Estate, so was he now in his declining age, and wanted those warmer Charms which the youthful <hi>Sypontus</hi> was blest withal, and the sprightly <hi>Victorina</hi> most affected. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, her Parents forc'd her affections to submit to their will, and within few days she was married to <hi>Souranza</hi>; but <hi>Sypontus</hi> (to use the <hi>Venetian</hi> phrase) was her <hi>Enamorato</hi> and she his <hi>Courtizana.

it was the body of his Uncle Seignior <hi>Baptista Souranza.</hi> The body was decently interred, and <hi>Victorina</hi> remained the most disconsolate Widow in the World. <hi>Souranza</hi> the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, who had formerly made some observations on the carriage and behaviour of <hi>Victorina,</hi> vehemently suspected her of this Murther; and for the more effectual discovery, enquires of <hi>Felicia, Victorina</hi>'s waiting Gentlewoman, what persons most frequently visited her Lady, when she nam'd <hi>Sypontus,</hi> that he sent her many Letters, and that there was much love and familiarity between them. <hi>Souranza</hi> conjur'd her to intercept some of their Letters, which she promised to do; and in a short time after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent to fetch her Lady a pair of Romish Gloves, she opened an Ivory Box, where she found the Letter which <hi>Sypontus</hi> sent to her. <hi>Souranza</hi> having read the Letter, accused <hi>Sypontus</hi> and <hi>Victorina</hi> of this murther before the Criminal Judges. They were examined, but deny'd the Fact, and disown'd the Letter, upon which they were separately committed to Prison. <hi>Sypontus</hi> suspecting the discovery of this Letter was by the treachery of <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> sent a Letter privately to her, in which he charged her with it; but she in her answer to him so well cleared her Innocency to his great satisfaction, that he now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved no torments should force him to accuse her. The next day he was put to the Rack, where he endur'd the torments with admirable constancy; but the next day the torments being redoubled upon him, he confessed the Letter his, and himself guilty of the murther, and totally clear'd <hi>Victorina.</hi> Upon this he was condemn'd to lose his head between the two Columns at St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s <hi>Place</hi>; and being brought upon the Scaffold, confessed the murther to all the spectators, but took it upon his death that <hi>Victorina</hi> was absolutely innocent, and no ways privy to it. <hi>Victorina</hi> was afterwards sent for into Court, and threatned with the Rack; but she boldly denied all, and was in open Court acquitted and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>

                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:93450:25"/>Six months were scarcely past, since these tragical revolutions happened, but <hi>Victorina</hi> throwing off her mourning, adorned her self with her richest Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, and resolves to have a second Husband; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the crowd of Suters which her great Wealth and Beauty brought her, she fix'd on Seignior <hi>Ludovico Fassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> a handsom young Gentleman, rich and nobly born, but extremely vitious and debauch'd. A month was hardly past since the Nuptials, but he left her, to follow his old course of Whoring, so that now she is become a married Widow; and understanding that the Lady <hi>Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare</hi> was the Loadstone that attracted him from her, she first endeavoured by all the endearments of Love and Respect to recover his stragling heart; but this not affecting him at all, she storms, and in most sharp and severe terms reproaches him for his unkindness and disrespect to her, who must now be slighted for the company of an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and common <hi>Courtizana.</hi> Seignior <hi>Fassino</hi> took no heed to her words, but pursued the same lewd courses, upon which <hi>Victorina</hi> vows a revenge, and that his life shall pay dearly for abusing her, and so concludes secretly to poyson him, and to that purpose sent for <hi>Augustino</hi> an Apothecary, to whom she offer'd 300 Checchines to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it; but he very honestly refused it, and persuaded her to better thoughts; but she persisting in her bloody design, was resolv'd to do it her self, and to that purpose procur'd Poyson from a strange Emperick, and now only waited an opportunity to administer it.</p>
                     <p>Not long after <hi>Fassino</hi> complain'd he was very sick, which was occasion'd by his dissolute life, and desired his Wife to make him some comfortable Broth; which she glad of, commands her Maid <hi>Felicia</hi> to make it, and going up to her Closet, fetch'd down the Poyson, and (having sent <hi>Felicia</hi> from the fire) put two parts of it into the Broth, and kept the third by her. <hi>Victorina</hi> (who no less intended a revenge on <hi>Felicia</hi> too, for discovering <hi>Sypontus</hi>'s Letter) orders her to carry the Broth up to <hi>Fassino,</hi> which he supt off, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> she went and laid the other part of the Poyson
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93450:25"/>
in <hi>Felicia</hi>'s Trunk, and came down undiscovered. About an hour after the poyson began to operate with <hi>Fassino,</hi> who call'd for his Wife, and told her that he fear'd <hi>Felicia</hi> had poyson'd him in the Broth she gave him, and desir'd she would send for his Friends and Relations, who found him ready to expire, and cry'd out with one consent, <hi>he was poyson'd. Victorina</hi> accuses her Maid <hi>Felicia,</hi> which dying <hi>Fassino</hi> confirms, that she had that morning poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd him in the Broth, upon which she was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and carried before the Criminal Judges, where with tears and cries she justified her innocence: But <hi>Fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sino</hi> being now dead, and there appearing all probabilities of <hi>Felicia</hi>'s guilt, she was hurried away to Prison.</p>
                     <p>Three days after being brought upon her tryal, she confessed she gave him the Broth, but knew nothing of any poyson it; when being asked if any body else med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with the Broth, she answer'd, <hi>No, not to her knowledge, but she was afraid it was a device of her Ladies to be reveng'd upon her for a former grudge.</hi> Upon this they went to <hi>Fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sino</hi>'s house, and secur'd <hi>Victorina,</hi> and search'd all the Boxes, Trunks, and Caskets, but found nothing; when going into <hi>Felicia</hi>'s Chamber, they in search of her Trunk found the remaining part of the Poyson, upon which she was condemn'd to be hang'd next morning at St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Victorina</hi> discharg'd. Being now brought to the place, she ascended the Ladder, and protested to the world she knew nothing of the matter, but imagin'd her Lady <hi>Victorina</hi> was not innocent, and so prepared her self to die; when <hi>Augustino</hi> the Apothecary landed at St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s stairs, and seeing a young Gentlewoman ready to be executed, demanded who she was, and her Crime, and being told the whole circumstance, remembred that <hi>Victorina</hi> had formerly tempted him to the same murther, and did believe the Maid was innocent, and the Mistress guilty: wherefore hasting to the Officer, he requested him to stay Execution, for he had something material to discover in relation to <hi>Fassino</hi>'s murther. <hi>Augustino</hi> then in discreet manner informs the Judges of the manner,

time, and place where <hi>Victorina</hi> seduced him to poyson <hi>Fassino.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Felicia</hi> was presently remanded to Prison, and <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi> apprehended, and confronted with <hi>Augustino,</hi> who now made good his former allegation. At first she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd every thing; but being adjudg'd to the Rack, she acquitted <hi>Felicia,</hi> and acknowledged her self guilty both of her first and second Husbands murther. Upon this Confession innocent <hi>Felicia</hi> was freed, and <hi>Victorina</hi> condemn'd the next morning to be hang'd and burnt at St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s <hi>Place,</hi> which was perform'd accordingly. She died very penitent, and desired that her example might be a caveat to forewarn others from commission of the like Crimes, which would certainly bring them to the same punishments.</p>

                        <p>Could the Power of sin defend us from the Punishment, or the fading Pleasures of it comfort us in our Sufferings for it, we had some encouragement to be wicked: But when our utmost Reward is to be compleatly miserable, he that is guilty of it sins against the light of his own reason, and to be sure not to be happy, purchases his own Damnation at the price of his immortal Soul.</p>
                        <p>Let us therefore praise the Providence and Iustice of God; the first by protecting the Innocent after an extraordinary manner from the brink of destruction, in the example of <hi>Felicia</hi>: and the latter by punishing the detestable sins of Murther and Adultery, in the sad example of <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AT <hi>Tholouse</hi> in <hi>France</hi> liv'd a Counsellor whose name was Monsieur <hi>de Argentier</hi> a Widower, who had one only Son called <hi>De Salez,</hi> of two and twenty years old, whose martial temper, (which wholly inclin'd him to the Wars) being unpleasing to his Fathers quiet disposition, he endeavour'd to divert him, by offering to his choice seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Noble, Rich and Virtuous Ladies, out of whom he desir'd him to choose a Wife, and more particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him <hi>La Frange,</hi> the only Daughter of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Clugny,</hi> very young, and of most compleat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of mind, though of a mishapen body. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had already agreed upon the Match, and appointed a solemn meeting for their Children, which produced dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent effects: <hi>La Frange</hi> highly approved, and passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately lov'd <hi>De Salez,</hi> whil'st he on the contrary could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain no thoughts but what show'd his slight and dise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of her.</p>
                     <p>At the same time there was a Nobleman called the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Vaumartin,</hi> who to repair the Debaucheries of his youth, courted <hi>La Frange</hi> in marriage, but more out of respect to her Fortune, than affection to her Person; and being put off with only verbal complements by <hi>De Clugny</hi> the Father and <hi>La Frange</hi> the Daughter, was at last ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted that his sute would be but vain and fruitless, for <hi>De Salez</hi> was that happy person she lov'd and admir'd. <hi>De Salez</hi> was in this interim grown acquainted with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93450:27"/>
                        <hi>de Soulange,</hi> a Gentleman of 'small Estate, but blest with three Daughters fam'd for their Beauties thro' the whole City, of which the Phaenix was <hi>La Hay,</hi> the youngest. <hi>De Salez,</hi> who had contracted a friendship with Monsieur <hi>de Soulange,</hi> that he might have the better colour to visit his Daughters as other young Sparks of the Town did, grew passionately in love with <hi>La Hay,</hi> who as she was exceeding beautiful, so did she in her mien and behaviour appear with all the graces of modesty and goodness: But though in publick she seem'd an unspotted Virgin, yet was she in private a professed Courtezan; nor was she so secret in her lascivious delights, however she obliged her Gallants to conceal her favours, but she was suspected of dishonesty by all chast and virtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Amongst others of her Enamorato's, <hi>De Salez</hi> was one, who doting on her delicate Complexion, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Modesty, spent all his hours in visits to <hi>La Hay,</hi> and with his best art and policy laid siege to her chastity: but such was her subtilty, that knowing he lov'd her, and was the only Son of a rich Councellor, she resolved to decoy him in for her Husband, and would not by all his costly Treats and constant sollicitations be won to his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces and consent to his lustful desires.</p>
                     <p>This folly of <hi>De Salez,</hi> and subtilty of <hi>La Hay,</hi> was not manag'd with that privacy, but <hi>Argentier</hi> his Father took notice of it, and considering <hi>De Soulange</hi>'s mean Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Poverty, and his own Nobility and Wealth, was high incensed with <hi>De Salez</hi> for his courtship to <hi>La Hay,</hi> told him she was a Strumpet, and swore if he did not leave her, and marry <hi>La Frange,</hi> he would disinherit him, and never repute him for his Son. But <hi>De Salez</hi> is reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in his folly, and contemning his Fathers advice, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately contracts himself to <hi>La Hay,</hi> and promises as soon as providence shall be so kind to him to call his Father into another World, he would consummate the Espousals. In the mean time the Baron of <hi>Vaumartin</hi> seeing all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to <hi>La Frange</hi> was unsuccesful, and his Debts and Creditors growing clamorous upon him, resolves with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93450:27"/>
himself that so long as <hi>De Salez</hi> lives, to whom <hi>La Frange</hi> had entirely devoted her self, he must never expect to be happy in her arms; and therefore, to remove this obstacle, concludes to send him a Challenge, since it would appear more noble and generous to kill him in the field, than privately murder him by Poyson or Ponyard. The next day by his Page he sent him this Letter.</p>

To this end, watching an opportunity when most of the Servants were abroad at the Vintage, she stole into her Husbands Chamber, and finding him soundly sleeping, she drew out a Razor from her sleeve, stept to him, and cut his throat; when throwing the Razor and her Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fata-gown (which was all bloody) into the house of Office, she secretly got out to Church. <hi>De Salez,</hi> whose throat was not cut so fully through, but he could cry and groan, was over-heard by two of his Servants, who hastily co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up, heard him utter these fearful speeches; <hi>That Strumpet my Wife hath kill'd me!

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the fam'd City of <hi>Barcelona</hi> dwelt an ancient Lady named Donna <hi>Felicia Maracalla,</hi> who by her late Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had two Children, a Son called Don <hi>Floria,</hi> and a Daughter nam'd Donna <hi>Doranta: Maracalla</hi> (though not rich) educated her Children very genteely, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd them exceeding rich in Apparel. The Beauty and courteous behaviour of <hi>Doranta</hi> invited an old rich Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman term'd Don <hi>Francisco Geronto</hi> to make his court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to her: The Mother approved of <hi>Geronto</hi>'s Riches, but <hi>Doranta</hi> despis'd his Age, (being near threescore and ten) at whose request Don <hi>Floria</hi> soon prevailed with his Mother to change her good opinion of <hi>Geronto,</hi> upon which they all three gave him the repulse and denial; but such was his obstinacy, that he would receive no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, though by frequent disobligations they endeavour'd to tire his patience, and often either refused his visits, or left him to converse with the bare walls.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Doranta</hi> was so urgent with her Mother for a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that she was asham'd of her unchast desires, and to prevent future mischief promis'd her at large to get her one; but she impatient of delay, urges her Brother <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> both to remind her Mother of her promise, and that he would recommend some Gentleman of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to her love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:93450:31"/>It chanced not long after, going with her Mother to the <hi>Benedictine Monks</hi> Church, she saw a proper young Gentleman not far from her, and ordering her Lacquey privately to enquire who the young Cavalier was, he brought her word his name was Don <hi>Mertillus,</hi> Son and Heir of Don <hi>Richardo de Mantez: Doranta</hi> at first sight was so enamour'd with the comliness of his person, that she vow'd neither her Mother or Brother should have any truce before they had made a motion of Marriage for her to Don <hi>Mertillus,</hi> and so prevail'd with her importunity, that some few days after Don <hi>Floria</hi> invited him home to his Lady-Mother <hi>Maracalla's</hi> house, where after a noble entertainment, <hi>Maracalla</hi> with the greatest complements and commendations of him she presents her Daughters motion to him. He saw <hi>Doranta,</hi> and very respectfully told her he thought himself extremely happy that a Lady of her Perfections was pleas'd to have an esteem for him, and that he would advise with his Father, whose consent he was oblig'd to receive, and hop'd to obtain. <hi>Mertillus</hi> at his return acquaints his Father with this proposal, who by all means endeavours to divert him from it, alledging as the most considerable argument, that the poverty of the Mother could never raise a Fortune for the Daughter answerable to his Estate and Quality, and therefore char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to think no more of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Geronto,</hi> who upon all occasions still prest on his Sute, understanding that <hi>Mertillus</hi> had gain'd <hi>Doranta's</hi> affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and (as the report went) would shortly marry her, (which he thought made him slighted) he vow'd his death; and hearing that the following evening <hi>Mertillus</hi> supt at <hi>Maracalla's</hi> house, (which he yet secretly visited, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Fathers commands to the contrary) charg'd his Pistol with a brace of Bullets, and waited his coming forth; but Don <hi>Floria</hi> accidentally coming out upon some particular business, <hi>Geronto</hi> lets fly at him, (supposing he had been <hi>Mertillus</hi>) and shot him through the head, at which he fell down to the ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:93450:31"/>The report of the Pistol was heard, and Don <hi>Floria</hi> found reeking in his blood; upon this noise in the street the house was alarm'd, and <hi>Mertillus</hi> coming hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out, saw his friend Don <hi>Floria</hi> murder'd at his gate. <hi>Mertillus,</hi> who was diligent in the search and pursuit of the murtherers, found <hi>Geronto</hi> limping in the street with his Dark-lanthorn in his hand; and laying hold of him, caused him to be committed to prison. Next day <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racalla</hi> went to the Criminal Judges of the City, and accus'd <hi>Geronto</hi> of the murther of her Son, for that he was found near the house with a Pistol in his pocket which had been lately discharged. <hi>Geronto</hi> boldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd the Fact, and justified his own innocency; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order'd to the Rack, upon sight thereof he confessed the murther, and the reasons which prompted him to it; upon which he was condemn'd to be hang'd, which the next day he suffered at the common place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; where by a foolish Speech he endeavoured to excuse himself, and that it was by the darkness of the night he mistook <hi>Floria</hi> for <hi>Mertillus,</hi> against whom only his Pistol and Revenge was levell'd, whil'st <hi>Floria</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd by mistake.</p>
                     <p>Don <hi>Richardo</hi> knowing his Son <hi>Mertillus</hi> yet continu'd his visits to <hi>Doranta,</hi> as this accident publish'd to the whole City, was infinitely troubl'd at it, and to prevent his marriage sent him to <hi>Marina,</hi> (a Mannour-house of his some ten leagues off in the Countrey) with charge to continue there till he receiv'd his positive order to return. <hi>Mertillus</hi> was extremely troubl'd at the rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous commands of his Father, and <hi>Doranta</hi> in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance griev'd no less; but being of a wanton disposition, and thinking <hi>Mertillus</hi> stay'd too long as she conceiv'd, began to entertain lascivious thoughts, and could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther live chast nor constant; but utterly forgetful of her respects and profess'd affection to <hi>Mertillus,</hi> received new impressions from other Gallants, whose courtship found a welcom reception, and easie conquest, to whom <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranta</hi>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:93450:32"/>
prodigally dispens'd her favours, which at last grew so publick, that her Mother both sharply repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended her, and by strict confinement endeavoured to reform her looser conversation. At this she pines, grows sick, and keeps her bed, at which her Mother was very much troubled, and sent a messenger to <hi>Mertillus,</hi> to inform him of <hi>Doranta's</hi> indisposition, which he credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously supposed was occasion'd by his absence, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kindly sent word he would certainly wait upon her the next day, which he performed accordingly; when <hi>Doranta</hi> dissembling her affection to him, told him, <hi>It was for him alone she thus languished, and must certainly die, if she could not be for ever so happy both in his company and affection. Mertillus,</hi> whose love was sincere as his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, with much difficulty obtain'd his Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and married in state and bravery.</p>
                     <p>Never did Husband love a Wife more dearly, who deserv'd so ill; for three months after marriage she not only slighted his conversation, but refused his bed, which unkindness of hers brought him into a deep Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereof being ready to die, she was so far from sorrowing for him, that in her heart she wish'd him dead; and for fear his skilful Physicians should recover him, resolved to poyson him, and with her own wicked hands administer the fatal Boll. To this end she ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her Chamber-maid <hi>Salvia</hi> with her design, who for the reward of 50 Duckats consented to it, and promised her assistance. After her Mistress had sworn her to secrecy, she sent her to procure a strong poyson, and advising <hi>Mertillus</hi> to drink some comfortable Broth she had made him, infused the poyson in it, of which before night he died, and by his Wife was privately and suddenly buried, his long illness taking off all suspicion of a violent death.</p>
                     <p>This Tragedy being thus acted, <hi>Doranta</hi> (tho'a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow) was very jovial, and merry, and now breaks Pale, ranging beyond all bounds of Chastity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93450:32"/>
insomuch that her Mother and all her Relations were asham'd of her infamous behaviour. Two months were scarce expir'd since <hi>Mertillus</hi> was laid in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Grave, when (contrary to the minds of all her friends) she married with Don <hi>Renardo de Polez,</hi> one of her former Paramours, altogether as vitious as her self, who though he well knew her to be dishonest, yet for the advantage of her present fortune was induced to be her Husband; but that not answering his expectation, he thought it high time to be wise, and (contrary to <hi>Mertillus</hi> his humour) was very strict to her, and after a little time confin'd her Prisoner to her Chamber, where (like a Scholar) she conversed only with her Book and Needle; and to make an absolute conquest over her haughty temper, he despoiled her of her best Apparel, her Rings, Chains and Jewels, allowing her little or no money.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doranta,</hi> tho' grievously perplex'd at this change of her fortune, yet still continued in her unchast pleasures as often as opportunity gave her leave; and no sooner was her Husband abroad, but she had a Ruffian at home. And her Maid <hi>Salvia</hi> following the example of her Mistress, with the 50 Duckats given her for the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning of <hi>Mertillus</hi> bought her new Cloaths, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured her a Sweet-heart named <hi>Blanco,</hi> with whom she wantonis'd so often, that at last she had a great Belly, which she conceal'd from all persons but <hi>Blanco,</hi> who advis'd thereof, fled into <hi>France. Salvia</hi> now considering her former folly, and present misery, and seeing her self deserted by <hi>Blanco,</hi> and no friend she could rely upon, in the midst of these distressed thoughts fell into labour, and was delivered of a fair Son, which she strangl'd as soon as born, to hide her own shame, and the same e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening wrapt it up in a linen cloth, and with a pack-threed ty'd a stone to it, and carried it to a Pond with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, and threw it in without being observ'd by a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93450:33"/>
her to go home to her Masters house that night, but lodg'd at an Inn whose Sign was the St. <hi>Iohns head,</hi> where (pretending lameness which she had got by a fall) she was kindly entertained.</p>
                     <p>But within an hour after a Groom watering his Horse there, so sported and plung'd the water with his feet, still pawing and snuffling and thrusting his head therein, that at last the pack-threed broke, and the linen cloth appear'd floating, in which was found the Infant lately murder'd. This brought a great concourse of spectators, who all concluded it to be the Bastard of some Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and murder'd by her; upon which a search was made in the adjacent parts, and <hi>Salvia</hi> apprehended by the Officers of Justice, who upon search appeared to be the Mother of the Infant. Upon this she was imprison'd, and threatned with the Rack, and for fear of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments confessed she had strangl'd and thrown it into the Pond, for which she was condemn'd to be hang'd. Being brought to the place of execution, and now upon the Ladder, she confessed there was one sin which she had not discover'd, or repented of; which was, that she with her Lady <hi>Doranta</hi> had poyson'd <hi>Mertillus</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Doranta</hi> was immediately apprehended, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the fact which <hi>Salvia</hi> accus'd her of, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to be hang'd, which was executed accordingly; and to <hi>Salvia's</hi> sentence was added, that after she was hang'd her body should be burnt to ashes.</p>
                     <q>Hence may every lascivious Dame learn the practice of Virtue and Chastity by the sad examples of <hi>Doranta</hi> and <hi>Salvia,</hi> and take warning by <hi>Geronto</hi> not to stain their gray hairs with the scarlet dye of Murther, which will bring them with sorrow and shame to the Grave.</q>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the Noble City of <hi>Orleance</hi> in <hi>France</hi> there lately dwelt a rich Canon of a Cathedral named <hi>Cortesius Romeo,</hi> who had a young Gentlewoman to his Niece of excellent Beauty and Disposition, whose deceased Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left her very rich: her Uncle <hi>Romeo</hi> being nearest in blood, took her into his protection, giving her all manner of Breeding and Education requisite for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of her Rank and Quality; and the better to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish her in all virtuous perfections, carefully sent her in his Coach to <hi>Morlieu,</hi> to the Lady <hi>Margareta Ursina,</hi> a Widow-gentlewoman, eminent both in Virtue and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Donna <hi>Carolla</hi> (for so was she called) with her waiting Maid and one Man-servant, arrives there, where she is kindly receiv'd by <hi>Ursina,</hi> highly applauding <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meo</hi>'s honourable care of his Niece, who she hopes in few years will be a most compleat Gentlewoman.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Romeo</hi> did well to place his young Niece with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Ursina,</hi> but ill forgot that she had a young man to her Son named Monsieur <hi>Bernardo,</hi> a most debauch'd person, and one whose vitious life made him the scorn and pity of all <hi>Morlieu.</hi> This young Spark seeing so sweet a Beauty, and so great an Heiress (as <hi>Carolla</hi> was) fallen into his Mothers hands, secretly courts her, but she received him with contempt and indignation, upon which he grew more importunate, and she no less a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse; when <hi>Bernardo</hi> hoping no success from these vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent courses, acquaints his Mother with his passion for

                        <hi>Carolla,</hi> who forbids him to proceed any further, unless he would svvear to reform himself, which he vow'd on his knees to do, and perform'd accordingly. <hi>Romeo</hi> came three several times over to <hi>Morlieu</hi> to see his Niece, whom <hi>Ursina</hi> entertained with all imaginable respect, charging her Son during his stay not to mention one word to <hi>Romeo</hi> of his affection to his Niece. But <hi>Ursina</hi> now secretly understanding by Letter from <hi>Orleance,</hi> that the following Autumn <hi>Romeo</hi> design'd to send for his Niece home, thought it convenient to motion it to him, which she did in a fair and honourable manner. But <hi>Romeo</hi> displeas'd with her ambition in desiring his Niece for a Wife for her Son, well knowing the small Estate of the Mother, and corrupt conversation of the Son; yet taking no notice thereof, he excus'd himself that he had already disposed his Niece, and could not with Honour or Justice recede from his promise.</p>
                     <p>Three weeks after this answer, not thinking his Niece to be safe at <hi>Morlieu,</hi> he sent over his Coach and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to bring her home, writing a gratulatory Letter to the Lady <hi>Ursina,</hi> for her great Care, honourable Education, and Entertainment.</p>

                     <p>Breakfast being now ended, and the Coach ready, <hi>Carolla</hi> departs to <hi>Orleance</hi> to her Uncle <hi>Romeo</hi>; but <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina</hi> would not be thus repulsed, but writes a second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Romeo</hi> to the same purpose; who very angry that she should so disrespect him as not to credit what he had said, and believe him that she was prae-contracted, very sharply returned her the same answer as before, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing withal for the future either not to receive her Letters, or to answer them with silence. <hi>Bernardo</hi> was so incens'd to see all his great expectations utterly defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he returns to his former Vices, and lives more dissolute than ever, upon which <hi>Ursina</hi> vow'd she would never speak in his behalf any more. This resolution of the Mother breeds bad blood in the Son, so that he now determines with himself to work his revenge on his Mother, and his own advantage by the same villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous act; for was she but dispatch'd, he should then be sole Lord of all her Wealth and Fortune, which might induce <hi>Romea</hi> and <hi>Carolla</hi> to accept of his affection: To which purpose he provides himself with Poyson, which he still carries about him, waiting an opportunity to administer it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bernardo</hi>'s return to his former lewd courses so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers his Mother, that she falls sick of a burning Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to allay the heat whereof she caused some Almond-milk to be made her, in which were infus'd several coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Herbs, and drinks thereof three times a day. On the fourth day of her sickness, walking in the afternoon in her Garden, she was suddenly surprized with the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome of her Feaver; when sitting down, she caused her Maid to hold her head, and pray'd her Son to fetch her a Bottle of Almond-milk, which de did, and in the way pour'd the poyson into it, which he gave her, who
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93450:35"/>
drank plentifully of it; but on a sudden a cold sweat over-spread her face, she look'd pale, and ready to faint away call'd for a Chair, in which they carried her to her Chamber, and laid her on the Bed, where few hours after she died in great torture, and is by her Son and Servants coffin'd up, and (with all the counterfeit signs of immoderate grief) buried by her ungracious Son.</p>
                     <p>The News of <hi>Ursina's</hi> death was soon known at <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> where <hi>Romeo</hi> and <hi>Carolla</hi> hearing of it, exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lamented and sorrowed for her. <hi>Carolla</hi> being now grown marriageable, in regard of her excellent Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and great Estate, (for she was now declared sole Heir to her Uncle <hi>Romeo</hi>) was courted by many Noble Gentlemen; but her Uncle at last privately married her to Monsieur <hi>Le Berdu,</hi> a rich young Gentleman who was Nephew and Heir to the Bishop of <hi>Orleance</hi>·</p>
                     <p>Let us now return to <hi>Bernardo,</hi> who desperately gave himself over to all Vices, consuming all his time in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Riots, in the midst of which follies he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>Carolla</hi>: wherefore putting himself and Servants into very rich Equipage, he rode over to <hi>Orleance,</hi> where he became an importunate Suter to <hi>Romeo</hi> and <hi>Carolla,</hi> but all in vain; yet he obstinately persists, which made <hi>Romeo</hi> tell him in plain terms, <hi>That his Niece was married, and that in consideration thereof he forbid him his house and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus resolv'd, he went in disguise at six in the evening to a small Tavern, where the Chamber-windows look'd into <hi>Romeo</hi>'s Garden, and pretending to stay for a friend, call'd for some Wine: then bolting the Chamber-door, he opens the Casement, and sees <hi>Romeo</hi> walking in his Garden; he lets flie at him, and shot him into the breast with a brace of Bullets, and <hi>Romeo</hi> after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The noise of that and his Gun caused the people below to come up, who finding the Chamber-door bolted, imagined he had shot himself; when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing open the door, they found him grovling on the ground, upon which they took him and pull'd off his Cloaths to search for his wounds, but found none. After an hour he opened his eyes, and with a distracted look and amazed countenance, rather raving than speaking, in the heat of his madness he cried out, <hi>I have murder'd</hi> Romeo! <hi>I have murder'd</hi> Romeo! which he often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. By this time the dead body of <hi>Romeo</hi> was found in the Garden; and search being made for the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and seeing his Horse at the door of the Tavern, they went up stairs, where they found <hi>Bernardo</hi> in bed. The people of the house being examined, they reported what they knew, as also his confession that he had murder'd <hi>Romeo</hi>; whereupon he was apprehended, and the next morning arraigned, when he forswore his former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: but the Judges, to extort the truth, condemn him to the Rack, where at the first torments he again confesses all, for which he was sentenced the next day to be beheaded; and being brought to the Scaffold, there confessed the murther of his Mother <hi>Ursina</hi> by poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: His first sentence was executed upon him, and (as an addition of punishment for his Mothers death) his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was burnt, and the ashes thrown into the River <hi>Arno.</hi>

Brother <hi>Pharamond</hi> to bear him company, and in his name to treat with <hi>De Moulin. Pharamond</hi> and <hi>De Bushie</hi> nobly attended, with a Letter from their Father to <hi>De Moulin,</hi> took horse and rid to <hi>Curant,</hi> where being arriv'd, <hi>Pharamond</hi> delivered his Fathers Letter; and after a short conference with <hi>De Moulin,</hi> in which he discovered his Brothers affection to <hi>Valere</hi>: he addressed himself to her, whil'st <hi>De Moulin</hi> and <hi>De Bushie</hi> took a walk in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Having this opportunity of a private discourse, after he had oblig'd her to secrecy, told her, <hi>That tho' he came over to</hi> Curant <hi>his Brothers Advocate, yet her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful Charms had already captivated his heart, and his passion for her now obliged him to make use of all his Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his own behalf; and tho' his Brother had the honour to see her first, yet his love (he hoped) deserved not least regard, or the last place in her affections. La Valere</hi> incens'd with this unexpected discourse, with a frown told him, <hi>That this was not only an ignoble Ingratitude, but a base Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore know</hi> (says she) <hi>that I undervalue you, as much as I highly prize your Brother:</hi> and so with a countenance which shew'd both anger and disdain, left him alone, who presently went to her Father, and in fair terms informed him of his love to his Daughter, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Old <hi>De Moulin</hi> approves <hi>Pharamond</hi>'s motion, but was unwilling to displease <hi>De Bushie,</hi> yet over-sway'd with ambition, calls his Daughter into his Closet, and bids her leave <hi>De Bushie</hi> to love <hi>Pharamond</hi>; but she posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively refus'd it, telling him that she had already made her choice, which she would not alter for any worldly advantage. <hi>Pharamond</hi> contriving how to deceive his Brother, told him, that tho' he found <hi>La Valere</hi> inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>De Moulin</hi> was altogether averse, nor could he ever hope to gain his consent; <hi>and therefore</hi> (says he) <hi>let us go home to morrow,</hi> which was agreed to.

(who had well considered the base treachery of <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>) resolves to give her <hi>De Bushie</hi> a private meeting, and at night sent for him to her Chamber, bid him be chearful, and that in life and death she will be his, and only his, and that she would send him a Letter to <hi>Roan,</hi> which should acquaint him with a business her tongue was obliged to conceal. So after all the promises of constancy and fidelity, they parted, and as a pledge of their mutual kindness, he presented her with a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond-Ring, and she gave him a pair of Pearl Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</p>
                     <p>The next morning <hi>De Moulin</hi> took <hi>De Bushie</hi> aside, and in short terms pray'd him to forbear his house, and refrain his Daughters company, for he had provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Husband for her.

Her year of mourning being out, she had many Suters, amongst whom she made choice of Monsieur <hi>Moreni</hi> for her second Husband, and was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly married to him. <hi>Pharamond</hi> seeing himself thus slighted, turns his love into hatred, and gives himself over to the company of Whores and Strumpets, and leaves no sin unpractis'd that his wicked heart desires, or his lustful eyes can see.</p>

to tempt her to his obscene desires, and riding over saw and lik'd her, and laid close siege to her Chastity; which her Mother observing in his frequent visits, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the worst, forbids him her house, saying, <hi>that if he persisted, she would acquaint his Father with it</hi>; at which he was much troubl'd, but remembring an old Fryar nam'd <hi>Simplician,</hi> he thought him a fit instrument to gain <hi>Lucia</hi> (for so was she call'd;) to consent to his lewd embraces, which for a reward he undertook, and accomplished. It was agreed between them, that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramond</hi> should fetch her away in the night to his old Nurses house, where he secretly kept her till he had surfeited his lustful desires with repeated pleasures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lucia's</hi> Father and Mother very much griev'd for the loss of their only Child; and suspecting <hi>Pharamond</hi> to have stole her, complain'd to his Father and Mother, who sent for, and very strictly examin'd him; but he deny'd all, and call'd the old Woman Hag, to charge him with stealing of her Daughter: Thus without any redress did they return home, and <hi>Pharamond</hi> to <hi>Lucia's</hi> arms, where we shall leave him to speak of <hi>Prochier.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Pharamond</hi> (as was formerly said) hating <hi>La Valere,</hi> hir'd <hi>Prochier</hi> likewise for 300 Crowns more to poyson her, which he speedily promised to perform. About two months after her second marriage, she fell sick of a pestilential Feaver: <hi>Moreni</hi> her Husband sent for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier</hi> the Apothecary, who having drawn six ounces of blood from her, intended next morning to give her Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, wherein should be infused the Poyson; but as he was taking his leave on the top of the stairs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementing with <hi>Moreni,</hi> his foot tript, and he fell down headlong, and broke his neck. <hi>Pharamond</hi> hearing thereof, was neither glad nor sorry, but spent all his time in revelling with <hi>Lucia,</hi> so that it was now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly known he kept her, whereof her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being inform'd, they went again to <hi>Pharamond</hi>'s Father, beseeching him to restore them their Daughter;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93450:39"/>
He promis'd his assistance, and gave them leave to search all his Tenants houses; which <hi>Pharamond</hi> hearing of about midnight he order'd <hi>Mercot</hi> his Fathers Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to fetch <hi>Lucia</hi> from her Nurses to the Mill-house, where at length she proved with child, when seeing her sad condition, she repented of her folly; especially since she saw her Lover <hi>Pharamond</hi> made not those frequent visits he was accustomed, and in his respects to her see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more strange and reserv'd than usual. But alas! poor wretch, she knew no way to remedy it, but by the common cure of <hi>Patience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pharamond</hi> now deals with the Miller to marry <hi>Lucia,</hi> but he down-right refus'd it, and poor <hi>Lucia</hi> besought him either to provide her a Husband, or permit her to go home. <hi>Pharamond</hi> (who now loath'd her more than ever he lov'd her) first absented himself from her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and afterwards plainly refus'd to see her. She exclaims at his ingratitude, prays <hi>Mercot</hi> to speak to his young Master in her behalf. <hi>Mercot</hi> finds him out, but instead of comfort, they conclude to murther her, which <hi>Mercot</hi> undertakes for the Fee-simple of his Mill, and within three days with a small Cord steals into her Chamber, and strangles her; when carrying her to the Mill-boat in the Pond, he fastned a piece of a Mill-stone with a strong new Rope to her middle, and sunk the body in the deepest part of the Pond. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away goes the Miller to tell his young Master what he had done, who were both over-joy'd at the success of their Villainy.</p>
                     <p>A month was scarce past, when <hi>Moreni (La Valere's</hi> second Husband) with some other Gentlemen his Friends had a mind to hunt a Duck, and made choice of this very Mill-pond for their sport; where the Duck and two Dogs are no sooner in, but coming to the place where <hi>Lucia</hi> was sunk and tied, they le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

presently imagined that some body was drown'd there; but before they proceed to search, they intend to make a second tryal after dinner, and for that time call'd off their Spaniels. At their return the Dogs do as they did in the morning, which confirms their jealousie, so they desired to draw up the Sluce, and let the water out of the Pond, which the guilty Miller refused to do, upon which the Gentlemen seem'd to desist, and went into the Mill to play at Cards for Wine, which the Miller offer'd to fetch from the Town, (there being none nearer) and when he was gone, they drew up the Sluce, and by that time the water was half out, they saw the dead body float, but the face was so mangl'd and disfigur'd by the Fish, it was impossible to know the person. They all concluded the Miller guilty, whom they apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at his return, and shut him up in his Mill till the body was own'd, which not long after happened by her Father and Mother, who knew her cloaths, and affirm'd it to be their Daughter <hi>Lucia.</hi>

and upon hearing his Indictment read, and <hi>Mercot</hi>'s Confession, presently acknowledged the Fact, for which he was condemned the next day to be beheaded; when mounting the Scaffold, he first publickly own'd the murther of <hi>Lucia,</hi> and then confessed he hir'd <hi>Prochier</hi> to poyson his Brother <hi>De Bushie,</hi> and had contracted with him for three hundred Crowns more to poyson <hi>La Valere</hi> which he had effected, had not Providence preserved her by punishing him with so sudden a death.

                           <hi>Almira</hi> twice attempts to poyson her own Sister <hi>Corinna,</hi> by the means of her waiting woman <hi>Doria</hi>: but being both times disappointed, she hires <hi>Nicon</hi> an Emperick to poyson <hi>Doria.

                     </argument>
                     <p>AT <hi>Lisbon</hi> (the chief City in <hi>Portugal</hi>) liv'd Don <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Florenzo</hi> a Nobleman, great both by Blood and Revenues; he married the virtuous Donna <hi>Andra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> (a Lady of eminent Quality and Perfections) by whom he had one Son called Don <hi>Puteoli,</hi> and two Daughters, Donna <hi>Almira,</hi> and Donna <hi>Corinna.</hi> Don <hi>Puteoli</hi> (whose Education was abroad) in his travels ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints himself with Don <hi>Formoso de Castello,</hi> a Gentleman of refin'd conversation and courtly behaviour. <hi>Puteoli,</hi> that he might perpetuate the friendship which was thus happily begun with <hi>Formoso,</hi> invites him to <hi>Lisbon</hi> to his Fathers house, proposing a marriage with his eldest Sister <hi>Almira. Formoso</hi> very courteously embraced his offer, and went with him, where he was generously receiv'd by Don <hi>Sebastian</hi> his Father, and saw his two Daughters, the stately <hi>Almira,</hi> and matchless <hi>Corinna,</hi> but with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent sentiments, for <hi>Corinna</hi> the youngest had already taken possession of his heart, where the other had not made the least impression; whereupon <hi>Formoso</hi> made his court to <hi>Corinna,</hi> and desires her in marriage of her Father; which he refuses, but offers him the eldest, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that he would give her the same preference that Nature had done, who as she was his eldest, should be first disposed of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:93450:41"/>However <hi>Formoso</hi> persists in his love to <hi>Corinna,</hi> and continues his sute to her Father, which <hi>Puteoli</hi> earnestly (but in vain) sollicits for him; so obstinately resolved was Don <hi>Sebastian</hi> in behalf of <hi>Almira,</hi> that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take leave of his beloved <hi>Corinna</hi>; when the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lovers mutually express'd their kind endearments to each other, and vow'd eternal constancy. <hi>Formoso</hi> civilly took his leave of <hi>Sebastian</hi> and <hi>Puteoli,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to his Castle ten leagues from <hi>Lisbon</hi> at <hi>Villamont,</hi> and in this recess made it his only comfort to converse with <hi>Corinna</hi> by Letters, which were secretly convey'd to her, and hers to him, by his faithful Page <hi>Honorio,</hi> who making love to <hi>Doria, Almira</hi>'s Woman, passd unsuspected.</p>
                     <p>The frequent visits of <hi>Honorio</hi> at last raised jealousie and mistrust in <hi>Almira,</hi> who suspected they were only pretended to <hi>Doria,</hi> whil'st in reality they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to <hi>Corinna,</hi> whereupon she order'd <hi>Doria</hi> to sound him, but <hi>Honorio</hi> would not make any discovery; but at last an unhappy accident did that for her which all her artifice and cunning could not attain: for one <hi>Sunday</hi>-morning, when <hi>Corinna</hi> was walking in the Garden, <hi>Almira</hi> went into her Chamber to see for a little Book, which not finding where she expected, she put her hand into her Sisters pocket of the Gown she wore the day before, and instead of that pulls out <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moso</hi>'s last Letter to <hi>Corinna,</hi> which she shews to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was very much concern'd at it, and severely checkt <hi>Corinna</hi> for entertaining a private correspondence with <hi>Formoso</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to prevent it for the future, strictly confin'd her to her Chamber.</p>
                     <p>But this was not satisfaction enough to <hi>Almira,</hi> who (rather than lose <hi>Formoso</hi>) resolves to poyson her Sister; to which end she hires <hi>Doria</hi> with 100 Duckats, and the promise of as many more, to undertake it: <hi>Doria</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to it, and accordingly sent an unknown messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for it, who presently return'd with it in a small Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-pot,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93450:42"/>
                        <hi>Doria</hi> intending to make use of it that very night, but <hi>Honorio</hi>'s visit prevented her, who finding her in the Garden, they sate down in the Arbor, and in the midst of their discourse <hi>Honorio</hi>'s nose fell a bleeding, and not readily pulling out his handkerchief, she hastily pulls out hers, and with it the Gally-pot of Poyson, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon a stone, immediately broke, and the baneful Dose was lickt up by <hi>Honorio</hi>'s Spaniel, who presently swell'd and dy'd before them. At this they were both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, but especially <hi>Doria,</hi> who knew not what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse to make, or how to palliate her wicked Design; for <hi>Honorio</hi> press'd to know for whom this Poyson was prepar'd, she gave him uncertain answers, which made him the more inquisitive, so that at last he prevail'd with her to discover the naked truth, <hi>that her Mistress</hi> Almira <hi>had hired her therewith to poyson</hi> Corinna.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Honorio</hi> no sooner saw this, but he informed <hi>Corinna</hi> privately of it, praying her to be careful of her self, for fear they might be more succesful in a second attempt, which no doubt the malice and wickedness of <hi>Almira</hi> would prompt her to. <hi>Honorio</hi> pretending his Father had suddenly sent for him, (who lay dangerously ill) took his leave of <hi>Doria,</hi> promising in a short time to see her again, who confidently trusting to the counterfeit love of <hi>Honorio,</hi> believ'd her design was no ways disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to <hi>Corinna. Honorio</hi> having privately receiv'd a Letter from <hi>Corinna,</hi> (which in part acquainted <hi>Formoso</hi> with the villainous mischief of <hi>Almira</hi> to her, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him for the rest to his Page, who would give a fuller account) went hastily back, and gave his Master the Letter, and a large relation of the whole matter. <hi>Formoso</hi> reading the Letter over again, and pondering upon it, (especially that part where she told him she could be no longer safe in her Fathers house, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desired him to protect her Life and Honour, which she hop'd to secure by his favourable assistance) assur'd her of it in another by <hi>Honorio,</hi> and that he would be

ready at the Garden door the next night at twelve, and the signal to be a lighted Candle in her window to him, and the discharge of his Pistol to her.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Almira</hi> urg'd <hi>Doria</hi> to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of her promise, which she assur'd her of in three days, and to that end a second potion of Poyson is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: in the mean while <hi>Honorio</hi> return'd, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Masters Letter to <hi>Corinna,</hi> who is now busie in packing up her Jewels and richest Apparel; when <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira</hi> pretending to go to bed ill, sent <hi>Doria</hi> with a sweet Posset to <hi>Corinna,</hi> desiring her to eat the rest, of which she had already taken her share. <hi>Corinna</hi> very kindly received it, and intreating <hi>Doria</hi> to fetch her Prayer-book and Gloves out of her Sisters Chamber, pour'd out the Posset into a Bason in her Closet, and washing the Cup put Almond-milk into it, which at <hi>Doria's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn she drank up, and dismiss'd her.

They laid the dead Parrot upon the Table, and upon the report of <hi>Formoso</hi>'s Pistol, (which they soon after heard) <hi>Honorio</hi> took up her Trunk, and they went softly down the stairs to the Garden-door, where (to her great joy) she found <hi>Formoso</hi> with a Coach and six ready to attend her to his Castle at <hi>Villam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Criminal Judges had presently notice of this Combate, whereupon <hi>Puteoli</hi> and <hi>Morellos</hi> were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, but by the great interest of their Friends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their pardon. <hi>Puteoli</hi> being now at liberty, went again to the Castle and demanded his Sister, which was utterly denied him, upon which he apply'd himself to the Judges, who granted him an armed Power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he forced the Castle, and took his Sister away (all in tears and mourning for her dear <hi>Formoso</hi>) and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her to his Father, for which and the death of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moso,</hi> she vow'd a severe revenge upon him. At her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn her Sister <hi>Almira</hi> earnestly desired to be reconciled to her, and privately confest her former malice, for which she was now heartily sorry, and begg'd her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>

The day being come, <hi>Almira</hi> went in her Fathers Coach very splendid and rich in Jewels: but whil'st they were on their way a sudden Tempest arose, with loud peals of Thunder, when after a terrible crack the fatal bolt pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through her breast, and almost kill'd her in her Coach: at the fright whereof her waiting Maids and

Coach-man return'd home with her, who was put to bed, and finding she could not live, confess'd that she had twice attempted to poyson her Sister <hi>Corinna</hi> by her Woman <hi>Doria,</hi> and had afterwards hired <hi>Nicon</hi> for 200 Duckats to poyson <hi>Doria,</hi> which he perform'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of she heartily repented, and so dy'd.</p>
                     <p>The Criminal Judges being acquainted with this, they sent their Officers to apprehend <hi>Nicon,</hi> whom they found very merry at the Wedding-house, and (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all his endeavours to escape) took him coming out, and committed him close Prisoner. In the afternoon being put to the Rack, he confessed all the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the murther, for which next morning he was hang'd over-against Don <hi>Sebastian</hi>'s house, on a Gibbet erected on purpose.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while <hi>Corinna's</hi> desire of revenge had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her with a large sharp knife, which hiding under her sleeve, with her Lute in her hand (about ten days after her Sisters death) early in the morning she went into her Brothers Chamber, and finding him fast asleep, with her Knife cut his throat so suddenly, that he could neither cry nor speak, and stabbing him seven times in the body, retir'd to her Chamber. As she went out, she was met by her Brothers Page, who went directly into his Masters Chamber, where he found him murder'd in his bed, at which, with his loud out-cries he raised the house, who seeing this bloody spectacle, went in search of the murtherer; but finding none to suspect, the Page said he met <hi>Corinna</hi> coming out, as he entred his Masters Chamber, who was easily apprehended, but perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily deny'd it. The next morning she was brought to the Rack, but seem'd not at all daunted. In this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim the Servants having search'd every corner of the Room, and <hi>Corinna</hi>'s Chamber; in the Close-stool they found the murdering Knife wrapt in her bloody Gown, which being brought before the Judges, at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>A Rich Merchant of <hi>Tours</hi> in <hi>France</hi> named Monsieur <hi>Ferio,</hi> being of sixty years of age or upwards, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been at <hi>Venice,</hi> where he received 2000 Checchines, and not meeting with a speedy and convenient return for his money, he carried it in a Cloak-bag behind him, and some Jewels of great value which he had bought for the Dutchess of <hi>Orleance,</hi> in a private leathern Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle next his skin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:93450:45"/>As he travell'd on his way, he chanced to fall ill, and having for two or three days contended with his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it now overcame him, and finding himself weak, and unable to travel further, he got into a poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-Tavern on the High-way, where he took up his Lodgings for that night: The next morning (not liking his Lodging, and doubting his safety there, in a loansom place) he took his Horse, and about 2 of the clock after dinner came to <hi>Dieren,</hi> and went into the very first Inn he came to at the Towns-end, where his Host's name was <hi>Briant,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Lauretta. Briant</hi> was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd fellow, and addicted to all manner of lewdness, poor, and of mean Parentage, but his Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e well des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, with whom he had 2000 Crowns in marriage, all which he had spent in Luxury and Riot.</p>
                     <p>Into this House, and to this vitious Host <hi>Briant,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred poor sick <hi>De Ferio</hi> for the recovery of his health: He lik'd his Hostess very well, but not his Host; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he prays him to procure him a Physician, which he did, Monsieur <hi>Morat,</hi> who seeing his Water, and feeling his Pulse, let him blood, to prevent a burning Feaver, and still gave him new hopes of recovery, tho' the Patient complain'd he was rather worse than better. <hi>Lauretta</hi> tended him diligently, and perform'd both the duty of a good Hostess and a good Woman: but her Husband imagining <hi>De Ferio</hi> to be rich, hop'd and pray'd that he might speedily die in his house, and if he does not, resolves to kill him by one means or other. <hi>De Ferio</hi>'s sickness increasing upon him to the despair of his life, he intreated <hi>Briant</hi> to bring him a Priest to give him the Sacrament, which he did, named Father <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> a person as notorious in all vitious courses as himself, and one whose prodigality had made very poor. To this wicked wretch, <hi>Briant</hi> (having first endeavoured to draw his Wife <hi>Lauretta</hi> to be concern'd in it, who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily and constantly refus'd it) on a <hi>Monday</hi>-morning reveals his bloody purpose, which he readily
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93450:45"/>
consented to, provided what Gold, Silver, or Jewels they should find about him might be equally divided between them, which was consented to; so, solemnly swearing to one another not to discover their design, they parted.</p>
                     <p>At night they met again to consider of the manner and time when they should perpetrate this Murther: the safest way was agreed to be by Poyson, which <hi>Briant</hi> should buy, and <hi>Constantine</hi> administer in a Wafer which he used sometimes to give him in his sickness: And as it were the better to favour their Devilish design, word is unexpectedly brought that <hi>Lauretta</hi>'s Father (who liv'd four leagues off) was dangerously sick and like to die, whereupon <hi>Briant</hi> with all hast dispatch'd away his Wife to him and her Maid <hi>Ioanna. De Ferio</hi> was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at his Hostesses departure, in whom he reposed all his trust and confidence; and finding himself every day worse than other, began to suspect his safety as well as recovery: for he often observed his Landlord and the Priest whispering together, and saw some fatal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions in their faces which told him all was not well: This afflicted him day and night with new cause of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair.</p>
                     <p>However, he still conceal'd his Gold and Jewels from his Host and the Priest, but fear'd their jealousie and hopes of it would hasten his end: But so cunning was <hi>Constantine,</hi> that he would not murder him till he knew what would be the reward of his villainy, and what Wealth he had about him; wherefore he advised him to send for his Son to <hi>Tours,</hi> and proffer'd himself in person to carry a Letter, and deliver it with his own hand. <hi>De Ferio</hi> thank'd him, and told him he had rather trouble his Host with it, if he would bear him company in the mean time, which was agreed. The next morning <hi>De Ferio</hi> gave <hi>Briant</hi> this Letter, and four double Pistols to def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Briant</hi> having this Letter, pretends to take leave, and Father <hi>Constantine</hi> in civility goes to see him take Horse; but instead thereof they went into the Parlor, and bolting the door open'd the Letter, and satisfied with the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by the contents, resolved to make that ensuing night his last, so they burnt the Letter, and <hi>Briant</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately hush'd himself up in his own house from the sight of all the world. Father <hi>Constantine</hi> went back to <hi>De Ferio,</hi> who was infinitely troubl'd in mind, fearing that his death was already plotted, and blaming his indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in mentioning in the Letter what sum he had, which if they should come to the knowledge of, might tempt them to commit some violence upon him. And now was the fatal hour come, for about midnight <hi>De Ferio</hi> waking out of a troubled slumber, pray'd <hi>Constantine</hi> to give him a little warm Wine in a small earthen Pot he used to drink in: <hi>Constantine</hi> glad of this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, mix'd the Poyson with it, and gave it him to drink, which he innocently did, and dy'd therewith two hours after: But for fear he should make any noise in the last agonies of death, these two Devils with Bedstaves
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93450:46"/>
ramm'd a great holland Towel down his throat. This was no sooner done, but they cut open his Cloak-bag, where they found a great quantity of Gold and Silver, and searching further, they discovered the leathern Girdle about his wast, in which were quilted the Jewels and several pieces of Gold, which they presently divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and in a great fire burnt his Cloaths, and every thing that belong'd to him, and turn'd his Horse loose into the Fields to seek a new Master: so cautious they were in their villainy! By this time the Corps was grown cold, which (digging a Grave in <hi>Briant</hi>'s Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) they buried, and covered the place with green Turfs so artificially, that no mortal eye could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it.</p>
                     <p>Three weeks after, <hi>Briant</hi> sent for his Wife home, who wondering to see her Husband so gallant in new Cloaths, enquired after <hi>De Ferio,</hi> he told her that about ten days before he went from thence safe and well, and gave him 50 Crowns for his Lodging and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and (as a token of his love for his care and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to him) 20 pieces of Gold more to himself, and as much to Father <hi>Constantine:</hi> but <hi>Lauretta</hi> fearing the worst, would not touch any part thereof.</p>
                     <p>And now with wonder and admiration may we see the Justice of Heaven in the discovery of this cruel Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the same day month <hi>De Ferio</hi> was buried, a huge Wolf seeking for his prey came into <hi>Briant</hi>'s Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, and smelling dead Carrion, with his paws fiercely tore up the earth, and dragg'd up the dead body, and there continued till an hour after day-light, eating the flesh of his Arms, Thighs and Buttocks, but never tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched any part of his face. Some Gentlemen being hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the field, their Dogs took the scent of the Wolf. and followed it into <hi>Briant</hi>'s Orchard. But the Wolf ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the shouts of the Hunters, and crie of the Dogs, left his Prey and fled: when the Hunters coming in to see what the Wolf prey'd upon, with great horror
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93450:47"/>
and amazement they saw the body of a man miserably mangl'd, which the Wolf had digg'd up from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Grave. They presently suspected him to have been murder'd by <hi>Briant,</hi> his Wife and Servants, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Guard upon the house, they sent and acquainted the Criminal Judges with it.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Lauretta</hi> hearing so early and unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual a noise in the Yard, (her Husband lying abroad that night with his Strumpets) began to doubt the worst. By this time the Criminal Judges were come, and with them a multitude of people, amongst whom was the Physician Monsieur <hi>Morel,</hi> who knowing the dead body by the face, cry'd out it was <hi>De Ferio</hi> the Merchant who lay long sick in <hi>Briant</hi>'s house, and he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved was murder'd by him, and buried there. The Judges believing the report of this honest Physician, broke open the house, and seiz'd <hi>Lauretta</hi> and her Maid <hi>Ioanna</hi> and the Ostler, who were brought to the body, and flatly charg'd with the Murther, which they as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely deny'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lauretta</hi> and her Maid both declar'd they believ'd it was the body of <hi>De Ferio,</hi> but called Heaven and Earth to witness they were innocent, and knew not who were the bloody authors of it: however they were all kept close Prisoners, while search was made after <hi>Briant,</hi> who lying that night at Father <hi>Constantine</hi>'s house with two Courtezans, hearing the news of it, they fled together, upon which they were both adjudg'd guilty, and close pursuit made after them. The three Prisoners were all threatned with the Rack, the tortures of which the Ostler and <hi>Ioanna</hi> endured with wonderful constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and patience (so great a comfort is it to be innocent!) but <hi>Lauretta,</hi> upon the good report of her Neighbours, was dispenced withal for that time, and all of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to strict confinement.</p>
                     <p>The Judges sent away post to <hi>Tours</hi> to advertise <hi>Du Mont</hi> of this disaster, who with all speed came to <hi>Dieren,</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:93450:47"/>
where upon view he own'd his Fathers dead body, and with showers of tears decently interr'd him in the next Church. The Judges acquainted him with the manner of the discovery, the certain suspicion they had of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi> and Father <hi>Constantine,</hi> who were fled upon it, and that they had <hi>Lauretta</hi> his Wife, and her Maid and Ostler in Prison, that the two last had been put to the Rack, but would not confess any thing, but strongly justified their Innocence, and that <hi>Lauretta</hi> had so good a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute amongst all her Neighbors, that they exempted her from the torment.</p>
                     <p>Eight days were now past since these wretches first fled, in all which time they had not gone above seven leagues from <hi>Dieren,</hi> when on the tenth night being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely tired, at the entrance of a Wood they spy'd a stray Horse grazing, and coming nearer to him, <hi>Briant</hi> knew him to be <hi>De Ferio</hi>'s Horse: At this they were very jovial, and making a Halter of their Girdles and Garters, they both mounted, hoping to recover St <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> three miles off before night. But not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the way, they wander'd all night, and were now farther off than before: They feared every Bush was an Officer, and to add to their trouble their Horse began to tire, when alighting by turns to ease him, they took the nearest way, and hoped to get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before people were up, it being yet early in the morning. Providence directing <hi>Du Mont</hi> the same way, within a mile of St. <hi>Iuan</hi> he overtook them, and eying the Horse well, knew him to be his Fathers, or very like him, and what more confirmed his suspicion was, that one of the two persons was a Priest, and the other much resembl'd the description that was given of <hi>Briant.</hi> He now and then made a halt, by pretending to mend his Bridle, or better girt his Saddle, that they might keep before him. Coming now to St. <hi>Iuan,</hi> they went in at the Sign of the <hi>White Lion.</hi> where he followed them, without seeming to take notice of hem, but as
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93450:48"/>
soon as they were gone into a Room, he sent to the Criminal Officers and apprehended these two persons, upon suspicion that they were the same who fled, and by all circumstances were guilty of his Fathers murther. They confidently deny'd it, but in searching their Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets they found store of Gold about them, and several pieces more, with some Jewels, quilted in their Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blets, which confirmed them in their belief that they were the persons, and were really guilty. The Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners the next day with a strong Guard were sent over to <hi>Dieren,</hi> where they were again examined, and still as impudently deny'd it, upon which they were both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd to the Rack, and at the first wrench Father <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> confess'd the murther in all its circumstances, and affirm'd that <hi>Briant</hi> and himself were the sole acters, and <hi>Lauretta, Ioanna</hi> and the Ostler absolutely innocent and ignorant of it. The like did <hi>Briant</hi> after some time, upon which the others were acquitted and discharged, and <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Briant</hi> condemn'd to be hang'd next morning and their bodies burnt to ashes, which was executed accordingly. The remainder of <hi>De Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>'s Gold was restored to <hi>Du Mont,</hi> to the general sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of all parties.</p>

Thus <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Briant</hi> in their Luxury, Drunkenness and Whoredoms, only gave him earnest for some greater sin they were ready to commit upon as fair an invitation, which he offer'd in poor <hi>De Ferio,</hi> and they accepted, to their own Ruine and Destruction.</q>

                        <hi>Cordelia,</hi> who did in part believe him, judging his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency by his Constancy, re-admitted him to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, with most dreadful threats of a sharp revenge if he ever relapsed into the same Error.</p>
                     <p>Much about this time Monsieur <hi>Durel,</hi> a brave young Gentleman, came to <hi>Montpelier,</hi> where he no sooner saw <hi>Cordelia,</hi> but he lov'd, admir'd, and was totally enamour'd of her; but his Courtship was only a piece of Gallantry, not in the honourable way of Marriage. <hi>Cordelia,</hi> whose pretensions to Honour were as great as any bodies, was wholly averse and deaf to his requests. Her denial made him the more eager to contrive some means to attain his desires; which after he had in vain endeavoured, an unexpected accident presented him with, by Madamoyselle <hi>de Sinclere,</hi> a rich young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who seeing him dance, fell in love with him, of which she gave many shrewd signs, that he could not but be sensible of it, though his heart was pre-pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with the Charms of <hi>Cordelia.</hi> Madam <hi>de Sinclere</hi> knowing that <hi>Cordelia</hi> was the cause of his indifferency to her, acquaints him that <hi>Cordelia</hi> was already enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and Mistress to Monsieur <hi>Leonardo.</hi> This stings him to the heart, when confirmed by <hi>Sabrina, Cordelia's</hi> waiting woman, (whom he had gain'd by Gold to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess) that <hi>Leonardo</hi> was the only happy man there, but that he had like to have been discarded lately for a word he let fall to her dishonour. <hi>Durel</hi> hearing this, and being told that <hi>Leonardo</hi> was but a Coward, insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates himself into his acquaintance, and becomes his most familiar and intimate Companion. <hi>Durel</hi> making use of this opportunity, contrives a match at Tennis with <hi>Leonardo</hi> for a Collation, and beats him; so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Monsieur <hi>le Roch</hi> and Monsieur <hi>le Mot,</hi> they went to the Tavern, where they were very pleasant. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Durel</hi> in return of his civility invites the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to sup with him at <hi>Le Hare</hi>'s, who was fam'd to have the best Wine in <hi>Montpelier</hi>: After supper they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93450:49"/>
drank plentifully, and now <hi>Durel</hi> laid his bait; O (says he) <hi>how happy are the Gentlemen of</hi> Italy, <hi>to us in</hi> France! <hi>they each of them after dinner go to their Courtezans with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul. I believe</hi> (says <hi>Le Mot</hi>) Montpelier <hi>has as good-natur'd Girls as</hi> Italy. <hi>Ay</hi> (cry'd <hi>Leonardo) I am sure for</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Whores <hi>it may vie with any City in all</hi> Italy; <hi>for 'y Gad they are all right, from the Lady to the Kitchen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, they are all tractable. Nay</hi> (said <hi>Le Roch) except still our holy Sisters the Nuns. Not I</hi> (quoth <hi>Loonardo) nor my Mistress neither,</hi> and so names <hi>Cordelia. Durel</hi> had enough now, so their mirth ended, and the Company parted.</p>
                     <p>Next morning <hi>Durel</hi> in a Letter by his Page informs <hi>Cordelia</hi> what <hi>Leonardo</hi> had said, which she received with grief, anger, and astonishment; and having retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her thanks to <hi>Durel,</hi> sent for <hi>Leonardo,</hi> whom she charges with what he had said the last night in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>Durel</hi> and other Gentlemen against her Honour and Chastity: at which she fell into such a rage, that she had certainly stabb'd her self with a Pen-knife which lay upon the Table, had not <hi>Sabrina</hi> luckily diverted the blow. <hi>Leonardo</hi> (surpriz'd at the violence of her passion) vows and swears he is innocent: She produces <hi>Durel</hi>'s Letter against him, but he still denies and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swears it, which yet gave her no satisfaction, nor should all his protestations gain any credit with her, till he had vindicated her Honour and his Reputation against <hi>Durel</hi> in a Duel, who had so positively averred the truth. <hi>Leonardo,</hi> forc'd by Necessity, more than urg'd by Courage, three days after sent him this Letter by his Page.</p>

                        <hi>Durel</hi> receiv'd the Challenge, and was amazed at his resolution; however he bid his Page tell his Master he would not fail to meet him at the time and place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. The morning is now come, which brings <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo</hi> by unwilling steps to the Bridge, and soon after came <hi>Durel</hi>: They both draw, and pass very furiously at each other; but <hi>Leonardo</hi> having received two wounds, throws down his Sword, and begs his life. <hi>Durel</hi> satisfied with this, goes to his Chamber, and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo</hi> to his Chyrurgeons. The news of this Duel was spread abroad by two Souldiers who saw them fighting. <hi>Cordelia</hi> sends presently to <hi>Leonardo</hi> to know the truth, but he would not be spoken withal; wherefore just as she was sending to <hi>Durel,</hi> he prevented her by a visit in person, and after several Complements told her, That he had given <hi>Leonardo</hi> two wounds for her sake, and his life for his own. At this she seem'd much pleased, and here began the first intrigue of their Amours. Whil'st <hi>Durel</hi> thus triumphs over his conquer'd Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and sleeps secure in the arms of <hi>Cordelia,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoyselle <hi>de Sinclere</hi> grieves for his loss, and <hi>Leonardo</hi> vows his revenge; which <hi>de Sinclere</hi> understanding,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93450:50"/>
out of pure love to <hi>Durel</hi> discovers it in a Letter, in which she both gives him a caution of <hi>Leonardo,</hi> and prays him to have a care of himself. But this was rather pastime than advice to <hi>Durel</hi>; yet his civility return'd her thanks, tho' he continued as regardless of himself as ever. But <hi>Leonardo,</hi> whose revenge made him more watchful, hearing that he came often late from <hi>Cordelia's</hi> Lodgings, pretends to go to his Countrey-house ten leagues off, but returns within six days with none but his Lacquey, and passes the Gates in disguise at the close of the evening, and goes to <hi>Cordelia's</hi> door, where he stands with his Sword ready, (having notice that <hi>Durel</hi> was there) and just as he came out into the street ran him through the body, and with a second pass kill'd him dead; and then returning to his Horse, upon the pretence of urgent business, and by giving the Watch some money, made his escape. By this time the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd body was found, which being view'd by the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Judges, they knew it to be Monsieur <hi>Durel</hi>'s, and order'd a strict search to be made, but could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the murtherer. But <hi>Cordelia</hi> was satisfied in her thoughts, and deeply swears that nothing shall attone for <hi>Durel's</hi> death but <hi>Leonardo</hi>'s blood, who conscious of his own guilt flies to <hi>Paris,</hi> where amongst the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people that daily throng thither, he hop'd to conceal himself. <hi>Leonardo</hi> lives here in all profuseness and prodigality, and wholly devotes himself to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved sins of Whoring and Drinking, which in a short time so drein'd his pockets, that he was forc'd to leave <hi>Paris,</hi> and return home: to which he was the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, by a fresh remembrance of <hi>Cordelia,</hi> whom he preferr'd to all the Beauties of <hi>Paris.</hi> Wherefore, the better to get re-admittance to her, he sent his Page with a Letter first, in which he gave a hint as if he had done her some considerable piece of service, extremely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the unhappy fate of <hi>Durel,</hi> and passionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd to be reconcl'd to her good opinion. <hi>Cordelia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93450:51"/>
this Letter, and was very much pleased with it, to think how he was now plotting his own ruine, and to keep him in the same mind, sends him a Present and a Letter back by his own Page, wherein she tells him she longs to know what he had done for her, which she promises to reward with her most sincere love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection.</p>
                     <p>The receipt of this Letter gives wings to his desires, and early the next morning he sets forward for <hi>Montpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> and the very first night he arriv'd there, made a visit to <hi>Cordelia,</hi> who desires they may be frequent, and outwardly expresses an extraordinary passion for him, and satisfaction in his company. The next day he comes again, when she desires to know what it was he had done for her, that she might make him a sutable acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment. <hi>Leonardo</hi> swearing her to secrecy, tells her it was he who kill'd <hi>Durel,</hi> and the manner how. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia</hi> dissembling her revenge, observing he had a Pistol in his pocket, ask'd him the reason he went so arm'd, who told her it was for his own defence. The next day he came again, upon promise of a further favour: in the mean time she had concluded upon his death, and had accordingly won <hi>Sabrina</hi> for a Purse of Gold to her assistance. After some discourse, <hi>Cordelia</hi> desir'd him to send away his Lacqueys, for she resolv'd not to part with his company that night, which he accordingly did. At his return into the Chamber, he sate down upon the Couch, and laid his Pistol upon the Table; <hi>Cordelia</hi> took it up, and ask'd him if it was charg'd? <hi>Yes Madam</hi> (says he) <hi>with a brace of Bullets. Do you think Sir</hi> (says <hi>Cordelia) I have courage enough to shoot it off? Pray let me try, and look out at that window for a mark.</hi> Whil'st he stoop'd to see for one, she shot him into the Reins of the back, at which he stagger'd, and <hi>Sabrina</hi> with a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyard gave him six wounds upon the back and breast, which she with that hast and fury redoubled upon him, that he immediately fell down dead at her feet; which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93450:51"/>
done, they dragg'd him down into a Cellar, where they buried him in his Cloaths, and laid a pile of Billets o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him. The next day his Lacqueys came to enquire for him, but were answer'd that he parted from them within an hour after, and said he would take a walk in the fields, and that he had not been there since. Three days after, (there being yet no account of him) several Gentlemen his Friends and Relations came to demand him of <hi>Cordelia,</hi> who return'd the same answer as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but they being for some reasons suspicious of her, acquaint the Criminal Judges with it, who after exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of several parties commit her to Prison, where about ten days after the virtuous Madamoyselle <hi>de Sinclere</hi> came to visit her, to whom in discourse <hi>Cordeliae</hi> said, <hi>she was as innocent of</hi> Leonardo<hi>'s death, as he was of</hi> Durel's <hi>Murther</hi>; which being over-heard, was told to the Judges: This gave them more cause of suspicion, but she still justified her Innocence, and positively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd that she ever knew any thing of either of the Murthers; and tho' she was guilty of such a simple expression, it was purely through ignorance and inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency. Upon this she was adjudg'd to the Rack, which she endur'd with admirable patience, insomuch as the Judges now began to favour her, and conclude her Innocence from the constancy and courage of her resolution.</p>
                     <p>About this time News was brought that <hi>Sabrina</hi> (who was fled) was taken up on the banks of the River <hi>Diren</hi> dead: This News revives <hi>Cordelia,</hi> who now began to think her self secure, since there was no person to accuse her, and that she was safe beyond the reach of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Heaven or Earth.</p>
                     <p>But here mark the wonderful Providence and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God! <hi>Cordelia</hi> was indebted to her Landlord a whole years Rent, and 300 Livres in money; which now giving for lost, he lett out her part of the House to Monsieur <hi>Chatillon,</hi> (who came thither for his healths
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93450:52"/>
sake) and sold all her Goods, even to the Billets in the Cellar, to make himself satisfaction; when upon the removal of the last, they found the earth had been lately opened to the proportion of a Grave. The Landlord hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, suspects the truth, and acquaints the Judges with it, who presently order'd it to be search'd, where they found the body of <hi>Leonardo</hi> in his Cloaths, which they carried to the Prison, and exposed to her sight, roughly charging her with the murther of it, which she undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly deny'd. The Judges then commanded her Paps to be torn off with hot burning Pincers, to make her discover the truth: whereat amaz'd, and seeing the torment ready to be inflicted, she fell on her knees and confessed that she and <hi>Sabrina</hi> murder'd <hi>Leonardo,</hi> the manner how, and the reasons why, for which she was condemn'd to be hang'd in the same street, over-against her Lodging, and her body burnt; and <hi>Sabrina</hi>'s dead body to be burnt with her. And for that <hi>Leonardo</hi> had been guilty of the Murther of <hi>Durel</hi> so basely and cowardly as <hi>Cordelia</hi> reported, his body was hung up by the heels upon the common Gibbet for three days, and then thrown into the Lake <hi>Ricon</hi>; all which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted according to the sentence.</p>
                     <q>Thus we see that one sin is the Parent of another; Nor is Vice less fruitful in its Off-spring than the most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Virtue: Whoredom propagates Murther, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness is often the Daughter of Intemperance.</q>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Orlindo</hi> (upon promise of Marriage) gets <hi>Paulina</hi> with Child, and leaves her, and marries <hi>Lucretia. Paulina</hi> sensible of her disgrace and his treachery, in the habit of a Fryar pistols him in the Fields, for which she is hang'd.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the Famous City of <hi>Florence</hi> liv'd of late years two rich and beautiful young Gentlewomen, the one named Donna <hi>Paulina,</hi> Daughter of Seignior <hi>Miranto,</hi> and the other Donna <hi>Lucretia,</hi> the only Child of Seignior <hi>Sterlin.</hi> Both these young Ladies had several Suters, yet none of them so dearly and passionately lov'd <hi>Paulina,</hi> as the Baron of <hi>Orlindo,</hi> a rich young Nobleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Lucretia</hi> as passionately lov'd him, but not he her. <hi>Lucretia</hi> had in vain attempted by her friends to prevail with him to forsake <hi>Paulina,</hi> to love her; for so great was <hi>Orlindo</hi>'s affection to <hi>Paulina,</hi> that by the strictest promise, and most sacred protestations he was privately contracted to her, though he had not yet gain'd her Fathers consent; which after many intreaties he obtain'd, though for some reasons he thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to defer the solemnity of the Espousals.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Orlindo</hi> continuing thus in <hi>Florence</hi> at a vast expence, grew in want of money, which he knew not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve at present, but to make sure work of his Lady <hi>Paulina,</hi> with many Sighs and Prayers, Oaths and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of fidelity and constancy, he drew her to his lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful desires, in which unlawful familiarity they continued several weeks: But then, like a base Nobleman, (having surfeited himself with those amorous pleasures) visited
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93450:53"/>
her but seldom; and when she desired him to marry her, he was either deaf, or so doubtful in his Answers, that she had now great reason to suspect his treachery: But three months after he utterly forsook her sight and company; which tormented her to the heart, nor did she know how to remedy it. <hi>Orlindo</hi> now made all his court to <hi>Lucretia,</hi> at which she was extremely pleased, and being of a great wit, and inform'd some great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tast was fallen out between him and the Lady <hi>Paulina,</hi> and that being far from home, he wanted moneys to bear out his port in <hi>Florence,</hi> imagin'd that might be the cause of it. To oblige him therefore to her self, and knowing her Father had a great respect for him, she one day told him, <hi>That of late she observed</hi> Orlindo <hi>was was grown melancholly, and that she fancied his great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences at</hi> Florence, <hi>and his long absence from</hi> Venice, <hi>might have exhausted his moneys, and that probably the reason of it.</hi> Her Father meeting <hi>Orlindo</hi> the next day, invites him home, and taking him aside into his Study, after several complements told him, <hi>Venice was a great distance from</hi> Florence, <hi>and the return of money uncertain; but if at any time he should have occasion, desired him to make use of his friendship, and that he should freely command whatever he could call his own</hi>; and there laid him down 500 double Pistols: Adding withal, <hi>That if he needed more at present, he should have what he pleas'd, and repay it when he pleas'd; and if he thought good to marry his Daughter, he would settle his whole Estate upon him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This kindness of Seignior <hi>Sterlin</hi> so prevail'd with <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindo,</hi> that he presently found out his new Mistress <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia,</hi> and relates to her what had passed between her Father and himself; which so pleas'd her, that she now assures her self she alone shall be happy in the affection of <hi>Orlindo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paulina,</hi> who in this time had heard what frequent visits <hi>Orlindo</hi> made to <hi>Lucretia,</hi> and consider'd her own distressed condition, resolves to try if she can reclaim
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93450:53"/>
him, and to that end, knowing the fidelity of <hi>Curanto</hi> her Fathers Coach-man, she gives him a rich Diamond-Ring from her finger, and bids him find out the Baron of <hi>Orlindo,</hi> and deliver it to him, and tell him that she desires to see him in the afternoon. <hi>Curanto</hi> finds him out, and delivers his message; To whom <hi>Orlindo</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this answer; <hi>Commend me to thy Lady, and tell her I will wait on her immediately after dinner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Orlindo</hi> came according to his promise, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to <hi>Paulina</hi>'s Chamber, where taking him aside, she complain'd of the coldness of his affection, his long absence, the violation of his Oaths, and her own great belly: which he angrily reply'd, <hi>That he ceuld not get his Friends consent, and without it he would not marry her; That</hi> Lucretia, <hi>though she was not so Fair, was more Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous; and therefore</hi> (says he) <hi>provide for your Fortunes, and so will I for mine</hi>; and throwing back her Ring in a passion, hastily departed from her. The consideration of this barbarous cruelty to her, pierc'd her heart with sorrow; but seeing no help, she resolves to provide for her Reputation, and the disposal of her great belly: To this end she thinks none so fit to be entrusted with a secret of that nature, as her Aunt <hi>Camilla,</hi> a wise and rich Widow who lived at <hi>Pontarlin</hi> ten miles from <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> by whose advice and prudent conduct she hop'd to prevent a publick disgrace. <hi>Paulina,</hi> who wanted not an excuse, obtains her Fathers leave to go to <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarlin</hi> for change of Air, and there acquaints her Aunt with the secret of her great Belly, and prays her love and assistance, which she faithfully promis'd, highly extolling her prudence in concealing her folly. Here she often remembred <hi>Orlindo</hi>'s monstrous ingratitude, the thoughts whereof impair'd her health, and made her miscarry of a lovely Boy, which she kiss'd and bath'd in tears, and at night her Aunt buried it decently in the Garden. <hi>Paulina,</hi> though she continued very sick and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93450:54"/>
weak, yet her heart was still towards the ungrateful Baron; and not daring to trust any person but her faithful Coach-man <hi>Curanto,</hi> she ordered him to post to <hi>Florence,</hi> and acquaint <hi>Orlindo</hi> with her deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and pray him to come and see her before she dies. <hi>Curanto</hi> made hast to <hi>Florence,</hi> and meeting <hi>Orlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> as he was going into his Coach, delivers his Ladies message to him; who first smiling, and then in passion, returns <hi>Curanto</hi> this answer in his ear; <hi>Tell thy Mistress</hi> Paulina <hi>from me, that I wish she was buried with her Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard, and both at the Devil</hi>; and so (without any more words) took Coach, and drove away to <hi>Lucretia. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> returns this answer to his Lady, who bitterly grieves at it, and tells her Aunt, who blames her for her fondness and folly, and bids her rather scorn and detest him. In the midst of this discourse, comes a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant from her Father <hi>Miranto</hi> with this Letter to her.</p>

                        <hi>Paulina</hi> at the receipt hereof was all on fire, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd on the faithless <hi>Orlindo,</hi> and swore he should pay dear for his Ingratitude, and vows either to murder him her self, or procure those who should do it for her sake: In this fury she returns to <hi>Florence,</hi> and first tempts <hi>Marcian</hi> her Apothecary to poyson him, and then <hi>Curanto</hi> her Coach-man to stab him, but both these absolutely refuse to engage in so wicked a Design. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus disappointed by these two, she resolves to act that tragical part her self; and understanding that mornings and evenings he frequently walked a mile out of the City to a pleasant walk planted on both sides with Olive and Orange-Trees, concludes to make that the Scene of her bloody revenge. To this purpose she secretly provides her self with a Fryars compleat Weed, a sad-colour'd Russet Gown and Coat, with a Girdle of a knotty Rope, wooden Sandals, a false, negligent old Beard, and hair to the head suitable to the same; in one pocket of his Gown she puts a begging box and a new Breviary bound in blew Turkey-leather, richly guilt, and in the other a couple of short Pistols, each charg'd with a brace of Bullets. All these she ties up close in the Gown, waiting an opportunity to effect her execrable Contrivance. The <hi>Thursday</hi> following she had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that <hi>Orlindo</hi> was gone to his usual walk, upon which she ordered <hi>Curanto</hi> to bring the Coach to the door; and giving him the little bundle, told him, <hi>She was now resolved to give</hi> Orlindo <hi>such a merry meeting in the fields, as should make him laugh,</hi> and so bid him drive on. Being now come near the walks she descends from the Coach, and taking the little bundle in her hand, orders <hi>Curanto</hi> to wait her return, and under the covert of some Bushes puts on the Fryars habit. At a distance she saw <hi>Orlindo</hi> walking very contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, whom with a bow or two she approached, holding up her begging Box for an Alms, which he was ready to give; but seeing so fair a Breviary in the Fryars

hand, he took and opened it; when <hi>Paulina</hi> stepping behind him, softly drew out one of the Pistols, and shot him into the back, and as he fell discharg'd the other into his breast, of which he presently died. <hi>Paulina</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus wrought her revenge, withdraws hastily to the same covert, puts off her Disguise, which she hides and returns to the Coach: <hi>Well</hi> Curanto (says she <hi>with a smile) my heart is now at ease, my injur'd Honour has now receiv'd a satisfaction, and his ingratitude a just reward. Drive speedily back, and keep your own counsel. Curanto,</hi> who knew nothing of her Design, yet now guess'd her meaning by the report of the Pistols which he heard go off, was astonished at it, suspecting the worst; when driving on with more hast than good speed, passing by the side of a Hill, the Coach over-turn'd, and broke his left leg, and <hi>Paulina's</hi> right arm; The furious Horses ran away with the Coach, which was torn all a pieces. At this instant came by <hi>Orlindo</hi>'s Coach with his Page <hi>Varini</hi> in in it, going to his Master; who seeing the Lady <hi>Paulina</hi> (whom he knew) in so distressed a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, alighted, and took her up into his Lords Coach, and <hi>Curanto</hi> with her, and so speedily returned to fetch his Lord, whom he found in the same Grove dead. <hi>Varini</hi> strangely amazed at this ruful spectacle, cries out, and tares his hair for grief, not knowing what to say or do: At last he resolves to stay by the body, and send the Coach for his Lady and her Father Seignior <hi>Sterlin. Paulina</hi> and <hi>Curanto</hi> went back to <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Orlindo</hi>'s Coach, where she had leisure to consider the mischiefs she had drawn upon her self by her violent passion and insatiable malice. Seignior <hi>Sterlin</hi> and the Lady <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia</hi> are now arrived, where they see and bewail the one his Son, the other her beloved Lord, with sorrows inexpressible. The Criminal Judges being acquainted with the murther of <hi>Orlindo,</hi> send out their Officers into the Fields to apprehend all persons they found there, and bring them before them: but they found no

more but one poor ragged Boy, who was keeping of Cows on the other side of the hedge, and gave them this account:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>That he saw the Gentleman walk alone at least an hour, and then an old Fryar came to him who shot two Pistols at him, and kill'd him, and then the Fryar went away, and he saw him no more; but there was a fine Coach which stood a little distance from the Grove, where a fine Lady came out, and went into the Grove; and after the Fryar had kill'd the Gentleman, the Lady went back to the Coach, and drove away.</hi>
                        </q>
They asked him what colour the Horses were, and what Livery the Coach-man had on? The Boy said, <hi>The Horses were white, and the Coach-man had a red Cloak with white Lace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Varini</hi> observing this, affirmed it was the Lady <hi>Paulina,</hi> her Coach and Coach-man, and so related in what a condition he had found them two hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Upon this they were suspected of the Murther, and the Officers at their return to <hi>Florence</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to apprehend them, which they did, as they were going out in a fresh Hackney-Coach, and brought them Prisoners to the common Goal of the City.</p>
                     <p>Two days after <hi>Orlindo</hi> had been solemnly interred, <hi>Paulina</hi> and <hi>Curanto</hi> were brought before the Judges, and charged with the Murther of <hi>Orlindo,</hi> which they both stoutly deny'd. The Boy is called to give in Evidence against them, who stands to his former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, but cannot think the Lady was the Fryar, nor can he truly say that this was the Coach-man.</p>
                     <p>The next morning <hi>Curanto</hi> was rack'd, but the torments could not make him confess any thing: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after <hi>Paulina</hi> was put to the same torture;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93450:56"/>
which not being able to endure, she confessed her self to be the sole Author and Acter in the Murther of <hi>Orlindo</hi> in all the circumstances as before represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and strongly affirmed her Coach-man <hi>Curanto</hi> was Innocent: For which she received Sentence to be hang'd next morning, and accordingly about ten the sorrowful <hi>Paulina</hi> was brought between two Nuns to the place of Execution, where (after a very peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and religious Speech) she was turned over.</p>
                     <p>Honest <hi>Curanto,</hi> though he was thus cleared by <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> yet by the sollicitations of <hi>Lucretia</hi> was adjudg'd to the double torments of the Rack, which he patiently endured without confessing any thing: The Judges therefore moved in conscience to make him some satisfaction for enfeebling his body, and impairing his health, decree the Lady <hi>Lucretia</hi> to give him three hundred Duckatoons, which was paid him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he discharged.</p>
                     <q>May the reading of this Tragical History learn us all to hate from our hearts the Inconstancy and Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of <hi>Orlindo,</hi> and from our souls abhor the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of <hi>Paulina,</hi> who though at first she seems to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in sin, and praise the success of her Revenge and bloody Enterprize, yet the Iudgment of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately overtakes the bold offender, and brings her to open and condign Punishment.</q>

                        <hi>Perina</hi> being thus settled there, her Aunt hath a Daughter who was suddenly to be married to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Nice,</hi> where she was chosen Bride-maid, and Don <hi>Francisco de Castlenovo,</hi> (a Native of <hi>Nice,</hi> Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> and sole Heir to <hi>Iacomo de Castlenovo,</hi> a rich and ancient Baron of <hi>Savoy</hi>) Bride-man, who is enamour'd of <hi>Perina,</hi> and understanding that her Birth and Quality answer'd his, during his stay there made his court to her, and in fifteen days obtain'd her consent to be his Wife, with which he acquaints the Lady <hi>Dominica,</hi> desiring her assistance to obtain her Fathers, which in a short time she effects. <hi>Castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novo</hi> posts away home to his own Father, and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily returns with his approbation, whereupon they were married in great pomp and solemnity, and <hi>Perina</hi> brought home to <hi>Nice,</hi> where she was honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by his Father with great Feasting and Mirth, at which the young Couple thought themselves in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But old <hi>Castlenovo</hi> being threescore and eight years old, forgetting both his Duty to God and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, lusts after his young Daughter-in-law <hi>Perina,</hi> which makes him wonderful complaisant to her; but not daring to express his beastly Desires whil'st her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is at home, he tells him, <hi>That his Honour and the service of his Prince and Countrey invite him to the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the</hi> Spaniards <hi>out of</hi> Piedmont: His Son (nothing suspecting his Fathers treachery) notwithstanding all his Wifes tears and intreaties, takes his leave of her for three or four months, and fitting his Equipage, goes to the Camp. Now old <hi>Castlenovo</hi> plays the part of a young Lover, is still with <hi>Perina,</hi> and ever and anon kissing her; which though she thinks too much, yet a Fathers name makes it currant. But the Lady <hi>Fidelia</hi> seeing her Husbands humour, is jealous of the truth, and exceedingly troubl'd at it, but manages her grief with discretion, till one day with tears in her eyes she privately reproves him for his lustful Desires;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93450:57"/>
which wrought so bad an effect on him, that he resolves to remove that obstacle, in order to which he hires <hi>Ierantha, Fidelia's</hi> waiting-woman, for 500 Duckats to poyson her, which she did by infusing Poyson in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some white Broth she had made her, and so in eight days dispatch'd her into a better place.</p>
                     <p>The old Leacher inwardly rejoyces, but in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew is exceedingly afflicted and dejected, and in very honourable manner causes her to be interred. While this is acting at <hi>Nice,</hi> Peace is concluded between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> and young <hi>Castlenovo</hi> comes home, where he is entertained with mourning for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The old man knowing it was impossible for him to obtain his ends whil'st his Son was at home, seeks a pretence to send him away, and in a short time two several occasions offer themselves, either to go to <hi>France</hi> with the Prince Major, who was to marry the Kings second Sister, or to go to <hi>Malta</hi> to get a pension during his life. The young Couple like that of <hi>France</hi> best for several reasons; but in obedience to his Father he must to <hi>Malta.</hi> This filthy old Leacher now resolves either by fair or foul means to compass his end, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which he gives her the sole Government of his house: But e'er fifteen days were past, finding her in her Bed-chamber playing on her Lute, after some pauses, Coughs and Kisses, he vomits forth his foul affection; at which enrag'd, she throws away her Lute, and in great passion leaves him; but he in every Walk, Garden and Room haunts her like a Ghost, thinking to gain by importunity what he could not by persuasion. But modest <hi>Perina</hi> is inflexible, and grieves at his perseverance, but how to quench the fire of his Lust she knows not; she has no friend to retire or make her moan to, wherefore she resolves to write a Letter to hasten her Husbands return, which she does, and sends by the hands of his intimate Friend Seignior <hi>Sabia,</hi>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:93450:58"/>
wherein she tells him, <hi>That her Honour is in danger by his absence,</hi> (but names not from whom) and earnestly presses his speedy return. At the receipt hereof he was troubl'd, but fancy'd it was only a trick of his Wifes to make him speed home; and so being loth to quit his hopes of the Preferment the Grand Master had promised him, returns <hi>Sabia</hi> to <hi>Nice</hi> with a rich Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald-Ring, and a Letter to this purpose, <hi>That he was assured of her Love, and the care she took of her Honour, and that he only believed it was an artifice of hers to call him sooner home, which he could not yet comply with, since he daily expected Preferment from the Grand Master; which being obtain'd, he would flie to her embraces.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Letter was both a comfort and affliction to her; for as she was confirm'd in his health, so she was too well assured of his stay, and now begins to fear her Father-in-laws wicked purpose; nor were her fears groundless, for he seeing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>treaties prevail not, threatens to force what she will not freely give. At which being terribly affrighted, she resolves to provide for her safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which by the help of <hi>Sabia</hi> she effects, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys her from <hi>Nice</hi> to her Father <hi>Arconeto</hi>'s house, where reflecting on former passages, she grew sickly, which made her once more send <hi>Sabia</hi> to <hi>Malta</hi> with another Letter; <hi>That she is gone from</hi> Nice <hi>to her own Fathers at St.</hi> John de Maurien; <hi>That if neither her Affection nor her Honour will draw him, yet she begs the care of her Life may invite him</hi>; and withal says, <hi>That she has a secret to impart to him before she dies, which she will entrust with no person but himself.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whil'st <hi>Sabia</hi> is going to <hi>Malta</hi> with this, old <hi>Castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novo</hi> finding his Villainy would be discovered by the flight of his Daughter-in-law, and being sure that his Son will be enrag'd at it, is in great perplexity, not knowing what to do. Mean time <hi>Sabia</hi> delivers the Letter to young <hi>Castlenovo,</hi> who wonders who it should be in his Fathers house that durst attempt his Wife,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93450:58"/>
which makes him dispatch <hi>Sabia</hi> away to carry News of his coming, and three days after arrives there him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The joys of both parties were unspeakable, but when he knew it was his own Father that sought ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuously to enjoy his Daughter, he was struck with horror at the thought, and resolv'd to continue at St. <hi>Iohn Maurien</hi> with <hi>Arconeto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But old <hi>Castlenovo</hi> thinking what a scandal the divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Crime, and his Sons absence would prove to him, wrote a Letter to him, wherein he acknowledg'd his lascivious and graceless attempt upon the Honour of so chast a Lady, which he could not remember but with detestation: but now Religion had vanquished Lust, and he did heartily sorrow and repent of so foul a miscarriage. That if he, who was the sole prop of his age, (whose absence he daily lamented) would return with his Lady to <hi>Nice,</hi> he call'd Heaven and Earth to witness, <hi>That for the future he would as much honour her for her Chastity, as he had formerly lasciviously sought to betray it.</hi> And further adds, <hi>That his tongue should make good what his pen had writ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Letter prevail'd with his Son and Daughter, who about eight days after the receipt thereof return to <hi>Nice,</hi> where the old man with tears in his eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses his error, and so they were perfectly reconcil'd. But (alas!) this Sunshine will quickly be clouded, for the old Dotard daily beholding <hi>Perina</hi>'s Beauty, soon relapsed; and knowing he cannot obtain his desires so long as his Son lives, makes use of the same hellish Agent <hi>Ierantha,</hi> with the promise to marry her, and give her down 500 Duckats more, to poyson him; which she, for lucre of the Money, and ambition of be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>Muletto</hi> going one day to <hi>Cassan,</hi> twenty miles distant from <hi>Naples,</hi> he there saw and fell in love with a rich Vintners Daughter, her Fathers name was <hi>Pedro Spondy</hi> and hers <hi>Servia,</hi> a lovely and beautiful Maid, exceeding virtuous and religious; who tho' she had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Suiters, yet fancied <hi>Muletto</hi> above 'em all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he sought her in Marriage, and easily got her good will, provided he could obtain her Fathers consent.</p>

                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:93450:60"/>
                        <hi>Muletto</hi> having thus won the Daughter, applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Father, but so averse is old <hi>Spondy,</hi> that he will not by any means hear of it; yet still <hi>Muletto</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues his Sute, and jointly with <hi>Servia</hi> intreat his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but he proudly and disdainfully refuses, swearing he will die before he will permit him to marry his Daughter. At which answer <hi>Muletto</hi> went very discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly back to <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Servia</hi> remains at <hi>Cassan</hi> with her Father, who now thinks to provide her another Husband, and gives her choice of two (to prevent her marrying <hi>Muletto</hi>) but she utterly refuses both; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at old <hi>Spondy</hi> is mad, and threatens to dis-inherit her.</p>
                     <p>Three years are now past since the young Couple first saw one another, and since <hi>Muletto</hi> first ask'd <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>'s consent; and still seeing it in vain, he thinks it now high time to lay close siege to <hi>Servia,</hi> that she would agree to marry him, (notwithstanding her Fathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal, telling her, <hi>That though he had not a Duckatoon in Portion with her, he valued it not, that he married her for Love, and had Estate enough to maintain her in a prosperous condition.</hi> By which sweet words she was prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to leave her Father, and go along with <hi>Muletto.</hi> Thus agreed, <hi>Muletto</hi> hires a Boat, whereof having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, she goes out at the Garden-door. That night they went down the River, and early the next morning he hires Horses, and brings her to <hi>Naples,</hi> where they were privately married.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spondy</hi> missing his Daughter, rages extremely, as doubting that <hi>Muletto</hi> had stole her: whereof making secret enquiry at <hi>Naples,</hi> and being assur'd of it, he passionately swears, <hi>That they shall never enjoy one penny of his Estate, nor will he ever after see them.</hi> Ten days after their Marriage, <hi>Muletto</hi> rode over to <hi>Cassan</hi> to <hi>Spondy,</hi> to labour with his best respects and duty for a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. Coming to <hi>Spondy</hi>'s house with intent to see and discourse him, he bolts himself into his Chamber, and charges his Servants to deny him, for that he is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93450:60"/>
resolv'd neither to see nor speak with him. <hi>Muletto</hi> went back to his Inn, and two hours after came again, but <hi>Spondy</hi> was still deny'd; when the next morning rising early, he went to <hi>Spondy</hi>'s house, but received the same answer: whereat very angry, he took his Horse and rode home to <hi>Naples,</hi> where he truly relates to his Wife the entertainment he had at her Fathers; whereat she was exceedingly grieved, but <hi>Muletto</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted her up with good words, and was indeed very kind and loving to her. Thus they lived very provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and managed their Trade to the best advantage, both of them being very diligent and saving. Six months after, having not heard one word from <hi>Spondy, Muletto</hi> prays his Wife to go over to her Father her self. <hi>Servia</hi> accepted of the journey, and comes to <hi>Cassan,</hi> where she received the same entertainment her Husband had found before in all respects; nay he caused his doors to be shut against her: At which unkindness of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she wept bitterly, and got her Aunt and her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers own Ghostly Father to intercede for her; but fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all fruitless, and to no effect, she returned to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> to her Husband. <hi>Muletto</hi> asking what success, she relates to him the unnatural discourtesie of her Father towards her, which vexed him to the heart, but he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth his discontent, which is aggravated by being known to his Neighbours, who flout and jeer him in all Companies.</p>
                     <p>This makes him now to look untowardly on his Wife, and slight her, and turn ill Husband, neglect himself and his Profession, and follow lewd and evil Company, spending and consuming his Estate with Whores and Strumpets, which at length reduces him to great pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and want; for the relieving whereof she sends to <hi>Spondy</hi> her Father, and acquaints him with her necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, praying his assistance to relieve her present distress: but he is so hard-hearted, that he will neither help her wants, nor pity her affliction, whereby her condition is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93450:61"/>
grown so miserable, that she is ready to despair. In the midst of these her sorrows, she was brought to bed of a fine Boy, who was christned in a poor manner, and named <hi>Augustino.</hi> The charity of her Neighbours to her in this condition preserved her from starving, for her wicked Husband took no care of her, but was so wholly devoted to Drunkenness and Debauchery, that he never thought of being better, nor had she any reasonable grounds to expect his amendment. After she was up again she work'd very hard with her Needle to maintain her poor Babe and her self; and if she got a little money to keep them from starving, he presently tore it from her; so that not knowing what to do in so great want and misery, she sent a Letter to her Father in these words:

(if possible) is more dissolute than ever, grows weary of his poor virtuous Wife, and thinks if she were dead he might get another which should enrich him, for which reason he resolves to murder her; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, on a great Holy-day took her out with him to walk to a Vineyard out of the City, pretending to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create themselves, which poor <hi>Servia</hi> took for a great kindness, and gladly went along. <hi>Muletto</hi> lies down upon the ground, &amp; feigns himself asleep, when she lying down by him slept soundly; which he observing, softly rises up, and cuts her throat, not suffering her to cry or speak one word: So leaving her, went back to <hi>Naples</hi> a contrary way, to take off all suspicion.</p>
                     <p>The very same night her murther'd body was found by some who chanc'd to walk that way, and brought to <hi>Naples,</hi> where it is known to be <hi>Servia, Muletto</hi>'s Wife, who was sent for, and seems passionately affected at her untimely death, requests the Criminal Officers to search for the Murtherers, which he is very diligent and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious in himself, and with that cunning and hypocrisie conceals his own guilt, that he of all men is least sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>

                        <hi>Muletto</hi> (his Wife being buried) now sells her Cloaths to buy himself some, and seeks many Maids and Widows in marriage, but he is refused and scorned by all; so that utterly despairing to raise himself at home, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolleth himself a <hi>Banditti,</hi> and for many years practiseth that theivish and villainous Profession.</p>
                     <p>Old <hi>Spondy</hi> trains up his Grandchild virtuously and industriously, so that he becomes excellent in Painting, Graving, and Imagery, and then chooses to be a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith, and proves a singular workman in his Trade.

therein. Being arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> he becomes a singular ingenious Goldsmith, and expert workman, thriving so well, that he resolves to set up his abode there.</p>
                     <p>Four and twenty years are now past since <hi>Muletto</hi> left <hi>Naples</hi> and turn'd <hi>Banditti,</hi> of which growing weary at last, he went to <hi>Florence,</hi> and set up his Trade of a Baker, intending there to settle and marry; but it happened otherwise, for the Cardinal <hi>De Medices</hi> going to <hi>Rome</hi> to receive his Hat, and intending to enter and continue there in great state and magnificence, he took into his house double Officers, to whom he gave rich and costly Liveries, and amongst others <hi>Muletto</hi> was chosen Baker in that journey, and at <hi>Rome</hi> flaunts it out gallantly, and is more debauch'd and prodigal than any other of the Cardinals Servants: So that at last growing bare both of money and credit, he resolves to recruit himself by stealing some pieces of Plate out of a young Goldsmiths Shop in <hi>Rome.</hi> with whom he had some little acquaintance. From him he stole two fair rich gilded Chalices, a curious small Gold Crucifix set with Saphyrs and Emralds, all amounting to the value of 450 Duckatoons.</p>
                     <p>The young Goldsmith amazed at his loss, knows not whom to suspect or accuse for this Robbery, but <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letto</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Florence</hi> his Baker, who much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented his Shop. Upon which, knowing that he lay not in the Cardinals Palace, but in a Taylers house ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, he got an Officer and search'd his Chamber and Trunk, where he found one of his Chalices, but nothing else, and as he was going out meets <hi>Muletto,</hi> who is committed to Prison, and by the evidence of part of the Goods found in his possession, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in hopes of mercy, is condemn'd to be hang'd next day.</p>

                     <p>As for <hi>Augustino,</hi> after this infamous death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he remov'd from <hi>Rome,</hi> and return'd to his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father <hi>Spondy,</hi> who received him with many demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of joy and affection, and at his death made him sole Heir of all his Goods and Estate.</p>

                     <p>IN the famous City of <hi>Venice,</hi> lived a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, called Seignior <hi>Angelo Morosino</hi>; who in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Seignior <hi>Astonicus</hi> and Seignior <hi>Donato,</hi> Embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu'd for the Islands of <hi>Corfu</hi> and <hi>Zant,</hi> and after a short stay there, were bound for <hi>Constantinople</hi>; but by the way forc'd by a Storm, they put into the Harbour of <hi>Ancona,</hi> which belongs to the Pope.

Mass being ended, he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her out of the Chappel, and seeing her only attended with a Waiting Woman and a Lacquey, with great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and Civility offer'd his Service to wait upon her home, and after several Complements, which passed between them, obtain'd the favour to take her by the Hand, and gracefully conducted her to her Fathers House, whose name was Seignior <hi>Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not be able to acquit himself with that decency, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Cavalier, to a Person of her Merits and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>In the Afternoon he made his visit to her, acquainted her with his Name and Quality, his intended Voyage to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but chiefly with his constant Resolution to seek her in Marriage both of her self and her Father: and so expert was he in the Art of Love, that in three weeks time (the Winds continuing contrary) he made her many Visits and amorous Courtships, and at last ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd her Consent to be his Wife at his return from <hi>Constantinople.</hi> He then address'd himself to her Father <hi>Bondino,</hi> who was so averse to it, that neither his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and Perswasions, or her Tears and Prayers could melt his heart into a better Temper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Morosino</hi> now acquaints his two Friends, <hi>Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato</hi> with his Affection to <hi>Imperia,</hi> and brings them next Morning to see her; they highly commend his Choice, and use all their Endeavours to gain <hi>Bondino</hi>'s Consent; but he is so resolutely obstinate, that no Arguments can in the least affect him. This grieves the two Lovers to the Heart, to see they must now be parted, for the Master of the Ship had sent word, that the Wind now blowing fair, he should with all Expedition weigh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor and set Sail for <hi>Corfu. Morosino</hi> seeing the necessity of his departure, again moves <hi>Bondino</hi> for his Consent, but he proves inexorable, when going to bid <hi>Imperia</hi> Adieu, he sacredly Vows to live unmarried till his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, which shall be within a year, and then to marry her; and as a Pledge of his Fidelity and Constancy, presents her with a rich Diamond Ring from his Finger, and she him with a fair Bracelet of Orient Pearl, as a sign of their mutual Contract: to which <hi>Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato</hi> are both Witnesses. This done, they took Horse for <hi>Ancona,</hi> and presently Embarqu'd for <hi>Corfu</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>

In the Interim, her Father had charg'd her to receive him with all Respect, and accept his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; which with Tears in her Eyes, she flatly told him, she could not Obey; she was fixt already, and would marry no Person but <hi>Morosino: Bondino</hi> with Fury in his Face, told her he expected no other answer but her dutiful Complyance with his Commands, and in a Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on left her to the Company of old <hi>Palmerius,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd at the same time, and with all the kind Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he was Master of, offer'd her the intire command of himself and his Fortunes, in Exchange for her Love and Affection: She told him, If this was all his Errand, she did assure him, she neither would nor could dispose of that which was already in the possession of another, and so left him to his own Meditations. <hi>Palmerius</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Ancona</hi>; but two months after, to the great Joy of <hi>Bondino,</hi> made a second Visit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and now both day and night, they importune <hi>Imperia</hi> to consummate the Marriage; and to that purpose her Father gives her good Words, and <hi>Palmerius</hi> rich Gifts and Presents: but she will neither hear the one, nor accept the other; however <hi>Palmerius</hi> grows obstinate in his Suit, and her Father resolute in his Commands; to avoid which she locks her self up in her Chamber, and concludes that her only preservation, can be in the Company of <hi>Morosino,</hi> whose Return she earnestly desires; and accordingly furnishes Seignior <hi>Mercario,</hi> her faithful Friend, with Gold for his Journey, and this Letter to her beloved <hi>Morosino.</hi>

of her, which is immediately granted, and the next night in her own house they met. At <hi>Morosino's</hi> first entrance into her Chamber, she fell at his feet and beg'd his Pardon; he took her up with all the passion and tenderness ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and then with mutual Embraces they reviv'd those Affections, which their long absence might have buried in Oblivion; and as he promises her that she shall be his sole and only Love, so she willingly protests to him, that he shall be more her Husband than <hi>Palmerius.</hi> Thus for that night they part.</p>

her Husband, for which he confin'd her that day to his own house, and sent his Officers to seize <hi>Morosino,</hi> who so strongly beset his Lodging, that though he and his two Friends were well arm'd, they thought their best resistance would be in vain, and therefore delivered up their Persons, Pistols and Swords, and were committed to the common Prison of the City. <hi>Bondino</hi> hearing the sad News of these passages at <hi>Loretto,</hi> suddenly fell sick and dyed.</p>
                     <p>The third day after, <hi>Morosino, Astonicus</hi> and <hi>Donato</hi> were separately examin'd, but neither of them would confess any thing, whereupon <hi>Astonicus</hi> was put to the Rack, which Torments he endur'd, still affirming his Innocence; an hour after <hi>Donato</hi> was adjudg'd to the <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,</hi> who being but of a weak Constitution, his right foot no sooner felt the fire, but with Tears he confess'd the whole Truth in all it's Circumstances.

Upon which they were all four sentenc'd to be hang'd next morning, at the common place of Execution. <hi>Imperia</hi> next day had notice that her Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle Seignior <hi>Bondino</hi> had obtain'd her Pardon, at which she askt the Messenger if <hi>Morosino</hi> was pardon'd too, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, No; then said she I will dye with him; and though the Judges came and advis'd her to live, and all her Relations intreated her to accept the Pardon, she would not be perswaded, but her answer to the last was, I hate Life if he must dye. The next day first <hi>Donato</hi> and then <hi>Astonicus</hi> were executed, then came <hi>Morosino</hi> who taking leave of <hi>Imperia</hi> earnestly desir'd her to accept her Life, which now was the only favour she could gratifie him in, and so was turned off. <hi>Imperia</hi> was now afresh sollicited by the Judges, Fryers and Nuns, but she refus'd with disdain, and voluntarily went up the Ladder, where making a short Speech to the numerous Spectators,

bid the Executioner do his Office, who immediately turn'd her over. Thus lived and thus dyed three young Gentlemen, and the constant <hi>Imperia,</hi> than whom never any dyed more pitied and lamented.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the City of <hi>Santarem</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> dwelt an ancient Gentleman named <hi>Don Alonzo de Cortez,</hi> whose Wife was <hi>Dona Aspatia</hi>; they had now liv'd happily in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bonds of Marriage near fourty years, and had two Sons and four Daughters, all which dyed young except <hi>Don Araneo,</hi> who for his excellent Parts, compleat Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Courtship, was esteem'd a most accomplish'd Gallant, and one of the prime Cavaliers in all <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Six Leagues from <hi>Santarem,</hi> dwelt a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman very handsom, and a Widdow, named <hi>Dona Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minta</hi>; to this Lady, old <hi>Cortez</hi> (having now left the Vertues of his Youth to grow vicious in his Age) makes his address by frequent Visits, and discovers the violent flames of his raging Lust, which she severely checks him for, and with peremptory refusals, scorns and denies his lascivious Suit. But he is as constant in his sollicitations as she in her disdain, when at last <hi>Orminta</hi> perceiving,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93450:68"/>
he passionately affected her; told him plainly, that if he ever thought to gratifie his desires in her Love and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he must first cause her to be married to his Son <hi>Don Araneo,</hi> which once effected, she swore to deny him nothing. <hi>De Cortez</hi> wondred at this strange proposal, and knew not what readily to answer to it, but going home seriously consults with himself about it, very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he was to preserve his Sons Honour and Bed unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd, that point he found very tender, but alas! <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minta</hi>'s Beauty had so great a power and command over him, that it easily conquer'd his most serious and vertuous Considerations. The next day he made her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Visit, but she was fixt to her first resolve, and would not recede a tittle from it; when like an old Lech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, rather than lose the pleasure of his obscene Lust, he promised to use all means possible to prevail with his Son to marry her, and at his return home motion'd the Match to him; <hi>Don Araneo</hi> after a short time of Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, told him he very well approv'd of it, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally since he was pleas'd to direct his Affections in it, and some time after, rode over to St. <hi>Estianne</hi> to make his Court to her, who seem'd wondrous coy on purpose to draw him on with more Vigour and Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>While thus the Father under-hand, and the Son open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, courted <hi>Orminta, Dona Aspatia, Don Araneo</hi>'s Mother, by many strong reasons, sought to divert him from her, and peremptorily on her Blessing, forbid him to marry her, adding that if he did, more Misery would attend those unhappy Nuptials, than was yet possible for him either to know or conceive. <hi>Don Araneo</hi> pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd on these Speeches, and for a month forbore to visit <hi>Orminta,</hi> which made her frown on <hi>De Cortez</hi> who inquires of him what made him so strange and cold in his Affections to <hi>Orminta; Araneo</hi> made a very modest Excuse, wholly concealing his Mothers advice to him in it. <hi>Orminta</hi> was mad to see her hopes of <hi>Don Araneo</hi> almost frustrate, and asks <hi>De Cortez</hi> the cause of his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93450:69"/>
Sons Aversness, who told her he suppos'd it was his Mother who had diverted him; whereat in a rage she told him, The old Beldam his Wife must first be sent to Heav'n before he can hope to enjoy her, or she his Son on Earth; and withal voluntarily offer'd to make a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit to her and poyson her, which <hi>De Cortez</hi> would by no means admit of, but promised speedily to perform it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Upon this she took care to provide him the Poyson, which he administred to her in preserved Barberies, which he observ'd she lov'd very well and often eat of, so that in three days after <hi>Aspatia</hi> dyed, whereat <hi>Don Araneo</hi> wept bitterly, not in the least suspecting she was poyson'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Orminta</hi> understanding <hi>Aspatia</hi> was dead, is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously pleas'd, and in three months after <hi>De Cortez</hi> and she dealt so politickly with <hi>Araneo,</hi> that he married her and brought her home to his Lewd Fathers House, who as often as he pleas'd commits Adultery and Incest with her, but so clandestinely that for two years <hi>Araneo</hi> had not the least inkling of it. But <hi>Dian</hi> her waiting Woman, took notice of this unlawful familiarity of hers with <hi>De Cortez,</hi> which her Mistress understanding, beat her severely for it, and twice whip'd her naked in her Chamber, and dragg'd her about by the Hair; which <hi>Dian</hi> resolving to be reveng'd for, acquaints her young Master <hi>Araneo</hi> with this foul Business, between his Wife and his Father, at which he was so amaz'd and griev'd, that he scorning to be an eye-witness of his own shame, and their grievous Crimes, which had now made them as unworthy of his Sight and Company, as they were of his Love and Respect; took horse and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>De Cortez</hi> and <hi>Orminta</hi> seeing this his sudden depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they were conscious would make apparent to the World those horrid Crimes they had so privately indulg'd themselves in, and knowing that none but <hi>Dian</hi> could have made this Discovery to her Husband; she
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93450:69"/>
provides her self with rods, intending the next morning to glut her anger and Indignation with a sharp Revenge: but <hi>Dian</hi> having notice of this the night before, takes Horse, and rides home to her Fathers House, and there from point to point relates all the former passages, and publishes, the Adulteries of her Mistress. <hi>Orminta</hi> being advertiz'd hereof sends for her Brother <hi>Delrio,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints him with the base Treachery of her Maid against her Honour; protesting both her own and <hi>De Cortez</hi> his Innocency, which he too credulously believing, bids her be of good cheer, and he will soon take such Order, that her maids Tongue shall no longer spit her envenom'd malice against her in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus to make good his promise to his Sister, <hi>Delrio</hi> rode over to St. <hi>Saviours,</hi> and there by night waiting at the Door, as <hi>Dian</hi> came out in a dark night, ran her through the Body in two several places, upon which she fell down dead without speaking one word, and he posted away to <hi>Santarem</hi> being neither seen nor discovered. As soon as he came thither he inform'd his Sister what he had done, who infinitely glad thereof gave him many thanks, and now bent her whole malice against her Husband, <hi>Don Araneo,</hi> cunningly provoking her Brother to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish it, which he (thus exasperated by her Policy) vows to effect, &amp; that he would immediately fight him if he did but know in what part of the World to find him in. When behold (as it were to bind him to his promise) news of his Residence at <hi>Madrid</hi> is accidentally brought him by a Servant purposely sent to <hi>Santarem</hi> with these ensuing Letters; the one to his Father the other to his Wife.</p>

Then being ask'd if <hi>Orminta</hi> was guilty, he said, true it was that she bought the poyson and he administred it; for which her dead Body was that afternoon burnt at the common place of Execution, and <hi>De Cortez</hi> was condemned to loose his head, from which Sentence he appealed to <hi>Santarem,</hi> where the first Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is confirm'd, and an addition thereto, that his Body should be burnt and his Ashes thrown into the Air.</p>
                     <p>The next morning a Scaffold was erected at his own Door, whereon he lost his Head, the rest of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence being executed to the satisfaction of Justice and content of all the Spectators.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN <hi>Otranto,</hi> a City of <hi>Apulia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> dwelt an ancient, rich and valiant Gentleman, termed Capt. <hi>Benevente,</hi> who, by his deceased Lady, had a Son, named Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or <hi>Alcasero,</hi> and two Daughters, called <hi>Fidelia</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestina,</hi> who continued at home with their Father, whilst <hi>Alcasero</hi> lived altogether at <hi>Naples,</hi> with the Spanish Viceroy.</p>
                     <p>Capt. <hi>Benevente</hi> was a Gentleman beloved and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all the Nobility of <hi>Apulia,</hi> so that his House was like an Academy for all Martial Exercises; and as the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his two Daughters, amongst so great resort, could not be long unseen, or uncourted; so were they addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to by many Persons, of great Worth and Quality, who sought them in Marriage; but such was the averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Father's Temper, that he constantly cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all motions of that nature, to the great Trouble and Discontent of his Daughters. <hi>Alcasero</hi> is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Otranto,</hi> and his two Sisters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the severity of their Father's Humour towards them, and desire him to intercede for them, who dealt so effectually with his Father, that he told him, he had provided the Baron of <hi>Carpi</hi> for <hi>Fidelia,</hi> and the Knight <hi>Mont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Within the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed these two Noblemen come, and are assoon mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93450:72"/>
                        <hi>Carpi</hi> being Crookbackt, and <hi>Monteleon</hi> lame of a Leg: <hi>Benevente</hi> receives and entertains them nobly, whilst his Daughters treat them with Frowns and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; he tells them plainly they shall marry these, and no other; the Father presses them, and the Noblemen importune them to confirm the Contracts, but they plainly answer, they neither can nor will force their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to comply with all his unreasonable Commands. The young Ladies are very much dissatisfied with their Father's Perverseness, who, they think, usurps too much upon the freedom of their choice, by his positive and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Orders. This, at length, bred ill bloud, and they begin to hate him, which <hi>Fidelia</hi> first discovers to her Sister in her Complaints, That, for her part, since her Father is so resolute, she had rather see him laid in his Grave, than be forced by him to marry that Man she cannot affect: <hi>Celestina</hi> declared her self of the same Opinion, adding withal, that the sooner he was dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the better: Thus they conclude his death, and as to the manner of it, after many Consultations, they think it most safe to engage <hi>Carpi</hi> and <hi>Monteleon</hi> to effect it. To this end they now change the Scene, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to love those they mortally hated, which so pleases the two Noblemen, that with much urgency they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune them to Marriage; but they told them it was impossible, so long as their Father lived; for though he seemed to countenance and encourage them in their Suit, yet he had given them express Commands not to love them, which was the true reason of that Slight and Disrespect they had all along received them with. The Noblemen were taken in the trap, and never considered the Treachery of those deceitful and bloudy minded Ladies, but joyntly engage themselves, in a short time to remove him who was the mistaken Subject of their Hate, and his Daughters Disobedience.</p>
                     <p>Capt. <hi>Benevente</hi> used often, after Dinner, to ride to his Vineyard, and now and then to a neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Village: <hi>Carpi</hi> and <hi>Monteleon</hi> took their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93450:73"/>
                        <hi>Lorenzo</hi> and <hi>Anselmo,</hi> and disguising themselves, set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him at the corner of a Wood, with their Swords and Pistols, attended only with his Servant <hi>Fiamenti,</hi> whom after they had murdered, they carried their Bodies to the top of an adjacent Hill, and threw them down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deep Quarry, full of thick Bushes and Brambles. Then they consulted of their Flight, <hi>Carpi</hi> took Post to <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Monteleon</hi> with his Lacquey rode to <hi>Brundu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sium,</hi> but on the way <hi>Monteleon</hi>'s Horse fell down dead under him, and he was forced to dismount his Lacquey and ride his horse, leaving him to follow after a-Foot. At length near the Village <hi>Blanquettelle</hi> he met with a swift Ford passable only with Horses, which constrained him to take up his Lacquey <hi>Anselmo</hi> behind him; but in the midst of the Water his Horse stumbled, and so violent was the Torrent of the River that before they could recover themselves, they were both drowned.</p>
                     <p>By this time <hi>Benevente</hi> and his Man, were both missing and not to be heard of, <hi>Alcasero</hi> who was now at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> was acquainted with it by his Sisters and grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laments, for fear any mischief should have befallen him, promising great rewards to any person who could give intelligence of him. After five dayes search and no news of him, his Daughters with all the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Passions of Sorrow, begin to suspect he is murthered by his Servant <hi>Fiamenti,</hi> who alone went out with him, and had not since been heard of. <hi>Alcasero</hi>'s Grief was as real as theirs was feigned, and left nothing unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted that might lead to a discovery, but all had hitherto been in Vain; when it happened one day, that some Gentlemen who were hunting the Stag near <hi>Alpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata,</hi> he being now tyred with a long pursuit ran for Shelter in to the Quarry among the Bushes, whither the Hunters following him, they discovered two dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which the Crows had pitifully mangled, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nearer, they knew them by their Cloaths to be <hi>Benevente</hi> and his Man <hi>Fiamenti,</hi> which they gave <hi>Alcasero</hi> and his Sisters notice of, the Bodies were brought
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93450:73"/>
to <hi>Otranto</hi> that night in a Coach, where they were the same Evening interred, with as much decency as the short time would allow, but with Floods of Tears from <hi>Alcasero,</hi> whilst his two Sisters wept like Crocodiles. Next day News came, that <hi>Monteleon</hi> and his Lacquey were both drowned, which added yet more to the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of these bloody Sisters, who heartily wished that <hi>Carpi</hi> and his Lacquey, might meet with the same Fate. Six weeks were now past, since the Funeral of <hi>Benevente</hi> when <hi>Alcasero</hi> began to think it strange that <hi>Carpi</hi> came not to condole with him for his Fathers Death and renew his Suit to his Sister, which made him entertain some jealous thoughts, though at the same time, he had no probable ground of Suspicion. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Month after, <hi>Carpi</hi> having heard nothing of the Premises, sends a Lacquey over to <hi>Fidelia</hi> at <hi>Otranto</hi> with this Letter.</p>

                           <hi>Coligni</hi> seeks <hi>Cleandra</hi> in Marriage, but she loves <hi>Dario, Varini</hi> courts her for <hi>Coligni</hi> but in vain, whereupon <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligni</hi> rails against both, for which <hi>Varini</hi> challenges him but is killed. <hi>Dario</hi> desires to marry her, but his Father is against it, and sends him away, whereupon <hi>Cleandra</hi> dyes for Grief; <hi>Dario</hi> fights <hi>Coligni,</hi> and gives him his Life, for which he basely Murders him and is behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN <hi>Rome</hi> were two noble young Gentlemen, the one named Seignior <hi>Francisco Coligni,</hi> the other Seignior <hi>Andre o Varini,</hi> the latter of which had a Sister fair and young named <hi>Cleandra,</hi> and her <hi>Coligni</hi> had chosen for his Mistress; And as his Wealth made him confident, so he in amorous and honourable Terms, courts her by himself and Friends, but he is not so full of hope, as she is of disdain, and in few words tells him his Suit will be in Vain, for her Affections are pre-engaged. But he unwilling to give over his Suit, for the first denyals, acquaints her Brother <hi>Varini</hi> with his Passion for her, and desires his assistance, which he promises, and like a true Friend, earnestly sollicits for <hi>Coligni,</hi> but with no success, for she tells him her Heart is already disposed of; he desires to know to whom; she told him (after she had sworn him to secrecy) to Seignior <hi>Pedro Dario</hi>; at which he left her, and gave his Friend <hi>Coligni,</hi> her defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Answer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Coligni</hi> hearing this grows enraged, and abruptly walks from him, and the next day, in Cardinal <hi>Farnesi</hi>'s Gallery, being asked by four or five Gentlemen, for his Friend and Companion <hi>Varini,</hi> very passionately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, He was a base beggarly Gentleman, and his Sister <hi>Cleandra</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a lascivious dissembling Strumpet; which words were carried the same night to <hi>Varini</hi> by some of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93450:76"/>
the Company, which he highly resents, but chiefly for his Sisters Sake, and will not bear them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore next day he goes to <hi>Coligni</hi>'s Fathers House, and asks for his Son; his Father directed him into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where he enters and meets <hi>Coligni</hi> with his Hat in his hand, and desires him to dismiss his Servants for he had a Secret to impart to him. <hi>Coligni</hi> sends them away, and then <hi>Varini</hi> charges him with the former Words, whereat <hi>Coligni</hi> in a great heat, swore they were his, and what his Tongue had affirmed, his Sword should justifie, on which they cover and abruptly part. <hi>Cleandra</hi> having understood that her Brother was gone to find out <hi>Coligni,</hi> waited his return to know the Issue, which he told her in general Terms, should shortly prove to her Honour and his Content, and praying her not to be troubled, went to his Chamber, and wrote this Challenge.</p>

passes along the Street, and understanding that <hi>Dario</hi> used to go to his morning Mass, at the English College, he provides himself accordingly. On a <hi>Monday</hi> morning early, he puts himself into an unknown house, between the said College, and the Pallace of <hi>Farresi,</hi> and having charged his piece with a brace of Bullets, prim'd and cock'd, he saw <hi>Dario</hi> in the Street, upon his prancing <hi>Barbary</hi> Horse and foot cloth, and as he passed over against him he let fly, and lodged both the Bullets in his Breast, with which he tumbles from his Horse dead to the ground, onely giving two or three lamentable groans.</p>

                     <p>IN <hi>Vannes,</hi> a City of <hi>Britain</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> lived <hi>Monsieur Boren,</hi> a Gentleman of ancient Family, and fair E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, who having several Children, his eldest named <hi>Monsieur de Mansey,</hi> whilest he was yet very young, was sent over to his Uncle, Mr. <hi>Verdue,</hi> who lived at <hi>Turenne,</hi> in the Court of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> where he was both in his Favour and Service considerably preferred. <hi>De Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> being arrived to the Age of Five and twenty, his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle dyed, and left him sole Heir to a plentiful Estate, which was very much advanced by the addition he received by the death of his Father, at <hi>Vannes,</hi> and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93450:79"/>
afterwards of several other Relations, who all, as it were, conspired to make him rich and great. <hi>De Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> continued his Residence at <hi>Turenne,</hi> it being the place of his Education, and most familiar Acquaintance, but generally once a year, made a Journey to <hi>Vannes,</hi> to receive his Rents, and see in what condition his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants were, and how well they improved his Lands. This being his Custom, for several years he kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Stages in his Journey, and every night lay at such Towns, and such Inns as his long travelling that Rode had best acquainted him with. It happened that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into his Inn one night at St. <hi>Claney,</hi> (a Town in the mid way between <hi>Turenne</hi> and <hi>Vannes,</hi>) alighting from his Horse, he called for his Host, who was familiarly called by his Friends, honest <hi>Adrian</hi>; his Hostess with a low Courtesie, wellcom'd him to her House, and with seeming trouble and perplexity, told him that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was dead, and had been so for near six months. <hi>De Mansey</hi> condoled with her, for the loss of so good an Host and so kind a Husband, when being conducted to his Chamber, a ground Room where he constantly lay, he gave order for Supper, and designing to rise soon in the Morning, went early to Bed.</p>
                     <p>It was now about midnight, as he judged by the Moon which shone full in at the Window, when he heard a noise as if his Door opened, (for his wandring thoughts disturbed his Repose,) and drawing the Curtain in a fright, to see who it was entered at that unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hour, he saw the fair Image and Representation of his Host standing at his Bed side, in the same propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as alive, with a pale look, and his Throat cut from ear to ear. This Spectacle did very much surprize him at first, but after a little time recovering himself, he thus spoke to it, <hi>If thou art what thou appearest to be, the Ghost of my deceased Host, I conjure thee by all that's Sacred, to tell me what disturbs thy quiet in the Grave, and what thy business is with me. I come,</hi> said the Apparition, <hi>to acquaint thee, that I am basely and barbarously murthered
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93450:79"/>
by my Wife, her Sister, and the Ostler, and request thee (whose Friendship I have always been obligd to) to acquaint the Officers of Iustice with it, and under this Bed they shall find my Body privately buried, with a stake thrust through my heart:</hi> at these words the Apparition vanished, and <hi>De Mansey</hi> endeavoured to compose himself to rest, but in vain; for his thoughts were so intent on what he had seen, and the Discovery his Host had made him, that he began to consider his own Life might be in danger, if all this was not delusion, which he did not in the least sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
                     <p>About an hour after he heard a second noise at his door of some persons tampering with the Lock, when having his Pistols at his Bed's head, ready charged, he prepared himself to receive them: <hi>De Mansey</hi> got out of his Bed, and stood behind the Curtains, his door with a sudden shock was violently forced open, at which some Persons entred, but who, or how many he could not tell, (for the light of the Moon was now shaded by a cloud) however he discharged his Pistols amongst them at which he heard a great shriek, and two or three la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable groans; the report of the Pistol alarm'd all the Lodgers, and some of the Neighbours, who presently came to know the meaning of it. At the entrance into his Chamber they found the Ostler upon the floor, shot into the Breast, and almost dead. By this time the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Town were come with the Watch, to know the reason of so unusual a disturbance. The Ostler and the whole Family were secured that night, and the next morning they were all examined, and the Ostler having no hopes of recovery, confessed, that himself, his Mistress, and her Sister, had designed to rob and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>De Mansey,</hi> for which he was now heartily sorry and repentant. <hi>De Mansey</hi> seeing how miraculously he had been preserved by the appearance of his Host, relates the whole Story to the Judges in all its Circumstances, and accuses the Ostler, his Hostess and her Sister, of the Murther, and to confirm the truth of what he said,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93450:80"/>
desired they would search under the Bed in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which they did, and there found his Body with a Stake through his Breast: These Circumstances made their Guilt so apparent, that neither of them had Confidence enough to deny it, for which the next day his Wife was burnt, and the Ostler and his Sister hang'd. <hi>De Mansey</hi> was so much concerned at his own preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the Discovery he had so strangely made of his Landlords Murther, that he stayes to see the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Criminals, and removes his Lodging to another House: when being in Bed the night after they had suffered, his Landlord appeared to him again all in white, and thanked him for the trouble he had given him and the Justice he had done him; adding, that if any thing lay in his Power, whereby he might oblige him and express his Gratitude he would willingly do it. <hi>De Mansey</hi> told him he expected neither Thanks nor Reward, but if departed Souls know what's hid from mortal Eyes, if he could tell him when he should dye three hours before, as it was his greatest concernment it would be his greatest satisfaction. The Ghost promised if (it should ever be in his power), to perform it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>De Mansey</hi> returned to <hi>Turenne,</hi> where amongst his Friends he would sometimes discourse this Story, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them if they thought it was in the Power of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Host to make good his Promise to him, in that nature he desired it. It was now upwards of twenty years, since this had happened to <hi>De Mansey</hi>; and he now grown into years being almost sixty, when he, whom all the charms of Love had never affected, was now ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by those of Lust; The Beautiful <hi>Almanda</hi> who was both young and fair, was the Object he so much admired and doted on. <hi>Almanda</hi> was the Daughter of Monsieur <hi>Chartres,</hi> a Lady highly vertuous had not Ambition poysoned her excellent Qualities, and was two years before, married to a young Gentleman more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant than rich, whose name was Monsieur <hi>Perron</hi>; This Lady<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>De Mansey</hi> courted with assiduous Visits and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93450:80"/>
costly Presents, both which she willingly received, but would by no means yield up her Honour to his lustfull Embraces. Having thus been at great expence of Time and Moneys, without any hopes of success, one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to urge his Amours with the most prevailing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, he offered her a vast Treasure to consent to his desires, which she absolutely refused, telling him, if she was at liberty she could love him as a Husband, but never as a Gallant, which was a Crime so odious to her, that all the Riches of the World should never tempt her to the violation of her Marriage Vows. <hi>De Mansey</hi> either misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding her meaning, or out of despair of attaining his Ends, resolves to put her into such a condition, as she might with honour comply with him; and to that purpose hires two Bravo's, call'd <hi>Lycon</hi> and <hi>Cruento,</hi> to murder her Husband <hi>Perron,</hi> for the Reward of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Duckats, which they agreed to, and about a Week after, as he came late from the Tavern, in a dark night, set upon him in the Streets with their Rapiers, and after several Wounds left him dead upon the place, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>De Mansey</hi> what they had done, who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately paid the Money, and they made their escape to <hi>Genoa.</hi>

                        <hi>Almanda</hi> grievously lamented the death of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and gave the Officers of Justice, all possible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to search after, and discover the Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, but all in vain; three days after his Body was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently interred by <hi>Almanda,</hi> with greater show of grief than cost; and about six months after she was solemnly married to <hi>De Mansey,</hi> who, as an Argument of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, discovered how instrumental he had been to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge her of those Bonds which were so uneasie to her. <hi>Almanda</hi> had not been long married to <hi>De Mansey,</hi> but as she was pleased with the present state and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her fortune, so did she loath the cold Embraces of her impotent Husband, which would by no means suit with the warm and vigorous desires of her Youth. To remedy this intolerable Evil, she familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93450:81"/>
her self with a young Gentleman, called <hi>Seignior Rosino,</hi> an Italian by birth, who for a Murther commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Venice</hi> had fled to <hi>Turenne.</hi> No sooner was old <hi>De Mansey</hi> gone abroad, but <hi>Rosino</hi> supplied his place at home, and all those hours passed away in sighs, when <hi>De Mansey</hi>'s Company prevented her of her beloved <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sino</hi>'s. This the Servants could not but take some notice of, but her imperious Sway, and absolute Command, aw'd them into silence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lycon</hi> and <hi>Cruento</hi> having riotously spent their Moneys, came privately back to <hi>Turenne,</hi> and told <hi>De Mansey</hi> their great Wants, that the hazard and danger which they ran in accomplishing his Desires, deserved more than so poor a Reward; that he was rich enough, and ought to supply their necessities, which were the effect of their faithful Service to him. <hi>De Mansey</hi> was very much surprised at this Discourse, and promised largely, but at present he was unfurnished of Moneys, and could not answer their occasions till he had received his Rents, which would be within a Month, or little more; with this Answer they went away seemingly satisfied.</p>
                     <p>Four days after <hi>De Mansey</hi> went to his Country House at <hi>St. Agneaw,</hi> five Miles from <hi>Turenne,</hi> with a design to stay a week, for the advantage of the Air. This was a blessed opportunity for <hi>Rosino</hi> and <hi>Almanda,</hi> who Improve each minute, and day and night revel in the close Enjoyment of forbidden pleasures. <hi>De Mansey</hi> had now been but three days at St. <hi>Agneaw,</hi> and finding the Air not agreeable to his present Indisposition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves that Afternoon to return to <hi>Turenne,</hi> but setting out late, night grew upon him, which proving dark, and being without his Servant, he was forced to ride more easily, so that the Clock struck Twelve, just as he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the Gates of <hi>Turenne.</hi> But that which most trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, was, that when he was yet two Miles off, at the upper end of a Lane, his Horse snorted and started, and would by no means go forward; at which looking to see what the matter was, he saw the shape of his Host,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93450:81"/>
honest <hi>Adrian,</hi> who appeared to him clothed all in white, and bid him fear not, for he came only to make good his promise to him, and to tell him that within three hours he should be as he was; and at those words vanished and left <hi>De Mansey</hi> in great Horror and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation, who remembring it was his own Request did now firmly believe it would be accordingly, and as he rid on, dispos'd his thoughts into Meditations of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. At the Gates of the City he was well known and presently admitted, but when he came to his own house (which was walled about) seeing no light he concluded his Family all in Bed, and it would be to little purpose, to endeavour to awaken them at that distance. Considering what to do in that great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity he was in, he remembred his Gardiner lived hard by, and if he could raise him he might get in by the Garden Door. When coming to his House he knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and called, the Gardiner knowing his Masters Voice he presently rose; <hi>De Mansey</hi> told him he was very ill, and for that reason had returned late from St. <hi>Agneaw,</hi> that his Servants were all in Bed, and he had no way to get into his House, but by his Key thorough the Garden. The Gardiner put his Horse into the Stable and went with him. <hi>De Mansey</hi> appeared very melancholly, and complained of his present Illness, and as they walkt together, told him he was sure he should dye that night, for as he came along within two miles of <hi>Turenne</hi> he had seen the Ghost of his Host, who had told him so; by this time they were got into the Garden, and the Gardiner call'd up the Groom, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the Door and let him in. <hi>De Mansey</hi> orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to go back with the Gardiner and take care of his Horse, and with the Candle in his hand went up Stairs into his Study, which was the next Room to his Bed-Chamber. <hi>Almanda</hi> hearing some body go into the Study, askt who was there. <hi>'Tis I my dear,</hi> answered <hi>De Mansey</hi>; at which she was at her Wits end, and so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted she did not know what to do, to conceal her
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93450:82"/>
Gallant <hi>Rosino,</hi> who was in Bed with her; <hi>De Mansey</hi> having finished his Devotions, came into his Chamber to go to Bed, and as he entred <hi>Rosino</hi> stepping out from behind the door, stabbed him to the heart with his Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letto, at which <hi>De Mansey</hi> dropt down dead, giving one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one lamentable groan. Never were two persons in greater confusion than <hi>Rosino</hi> and <hi>Almanda</hi> now are, they know not what course to take to prevent the Discovery, or to discharge themselves of the Guilt of this Murther, which would certainly be known in the morning. As they were consulting what measures to take, <hi>Almanda</hi> told <hi>Rosino,</hi> that his Shirt was all bloudy, and advised him to change it for a clean one of her Husbands, which she fetched him, and wrapt up his and the Stilletto in a black Scarf of her own, which she put into a green Silk bag, and locked them up in her Trunk. At last it was agreed that <hi>Rosino</hi> should make his escape immediately, and after he was gone, <hi>Almanda</hi> having laid a Stilletto of <hi>De Mansey</hi>'s all bloudy by him, should in a great fright call up her Servants, and say that he had murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself. This was resolved upon as the best expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent they could at present find out, but Fortune seemed to be more kind to them than they could expect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. <hi>Rosino</hi> was no sooner gone down the back Stairs, but <hi>Almanda</hi> heard a noise of some Persons coming up the other way, which her Fear and Guilt assured her were the Officers of Justice, come to apprehend her for this barbarous Murther. They first opened <hi>De Mansey</hi>'s Study, where they found the Key in it, and ransacked all there; then came into the Chamber, where they found him dead upon the floor, at which they were strangely surprised, but pity, or the curiosity to know how he came so, was no part of their business; when coming to the Bed, they seized <hi>Almanda,</hi> and gagged her, and then rifled her Trunks of her Plate, Jewels, and what they liked best. <hi>Rosino</hi> heard the noise, and had the same apprehensions of danger as <hi>Almanda,</hi> believing them to have been the Officers of Justice, or some of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93450:82"/>
the Servants of the House who were risen to apprehend him, for which reason he made all possible hast, and ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving a Key in his Pocket of a private Door where he used to come in, went off undiscovered. The noise these Thieves had made, awak'ned the Servants, who coming up into <hi>De Mansey</hi>'s Chamber, found him dead upon the Floor, <hi>Almanda</hi> bound and gagg'd in Bed, and the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and his Study robb'd, but those who had been the Actors of this bloody Tragedy were fled, of whom they hoped <hi>Almanda</hi> could give some Account, who was presently unbound, and with showers of Tears told them that Thieves had been there and murdered her Husband, because he would not discover his Money, which they supposed was a greater Summ than they could find, and that they had most cruelly used her, and had they not come in at that instant, had certainly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her too. The Servants presently called the Watch and made what search and pursuit after them they could, and <hi>Almanda</hi> being now recovered from her Fright, smil'd to her self to see how favourable Fortune was to her, and that this lucky Robbery of the Thieves would for ever secure her and <hi>Rosino</hi> from being either charged or suspected of <hi>De Mansey</hi>'s Murther. But see when the prosperous Sinner thinks himself most secure, then often is the Vengeance of Heaven at the Door, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to punish those very Crimes, which he thinks himself most successful in.</p>
                     <p>The next day two of the Robbers, by the industrious search of the Servants, were apprehended in their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in St. <hi>Leonard</hi>'s Street, and some of the Plate, Jewels and other things taken with them; who were presently brought before the Judge-Advocate of <hi>Turenne,</hi> and charged with the Robbery and Murther, and several of the Goods produced in Evidence against them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other things the green Silk Bag, which was tyed up fast, and had not yet been opened. The Judge asked what that Bag was, and what in't, which being opened, they found a bloody Shirt and a Stilletto wrapt up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93450:83"/>
in a black Scarf. The Thieves confessed the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, but utterly denied the Murther, for which they were put to the Rack, when one of them confessed, their names were <hi>Lycon</hi> and <hi>Cruento,</hi> that <hi>De Mansey</hi> had hired them for 500 Ducats to murder Monsieur <hi>Perron,</hi> which they had effected some years ago, and having spent all their money, they sollicited him for more, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a speedy Supply, and understanding he was at his Country House, they resolved to rob him here; and that assoon as they came into his Chamber they saw him dead, and a Stilletto all bloody lying by him, and no person in the Room, but his Wife in Bed, and that he took that green Bag out of her Trunk, and till now knew not what was in it. <hi>Cruento</hi> confirmed what <hi>Lycon</hi> had confessed in every particular, and one of <hi>De Mansey</hi>'s Servants said, the Stilletto was the same or very like that he had often seen Seignior <hi>Rosino</hi> wear, who had been frequently at his Masters house; This gave the Judge some suspition he might be privy to the Murther, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Discourse of the Town, which spoke loudly of the endear'd Familiarity between <hi>Rosino</hi> and <hi>Almanda,</hi> upon which he sent a Relation of his own to acquaint <hi>Almanda</hi> that the Robbers were taken, and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to hear what Evidence she could give against them; she immediately came suspecting nothing, and in the interim the Captain of the Watch brought <hi>Rosino</hi> before the Judge, complaining that because he had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to let him through the Gates at an unseasonable hour he endeavoured to force his way, and had wounded him in several places: upon this he was asked what ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent business he had to go abroad so early, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was not his Stilletto; for the first Question he had a plausible excuse, and utterly denyed the second. By this time the Judge had notice that <hi>Almanda</hi> was come who was brought in, and demanded if she knew that silk Bag and the Scarf, and who owned that bloody Shirt and Stilletto; at this she was so confounded she had not one word to answer; the Judge observing the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93450:83"/>
great disorder she was in, told her, if she hoped for mercy, the only means to purchase it, must be by a free and open Confession; whereupon she accused <hi>Rosino</hi> of the Murther, and said, that was his Bloody Shirt and that his Stilletto, and that she was no farther Guilty than as so great a surprize forc't her consent, and her own Safety, the Concealment which she had endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by hiding them in her Trunk. <hi>Rosino</hi> being confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by her confessed the Fact, and was adjudged to be hanged and his Body burnt; <hi>Lycon</hi> and <hi>Cruento</hi> were condemned to be broke on the Wheel alive, and their Bodies left as a prey to the Beasts of the Field, and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda</hi> to be beheaded, and the dead Body of <hi>De Mansey</hi> for the Murther of <hi>Perron,</hi> to be hanged at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gallows for three days, and then thrown into the River <hi>Ormo,</hi> all which was the next day executed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                     <q>In this last History we have a Complication of Murthers, that of <hi>Adrian, Perron</hi> and <hi>De Mansey,</hi> perpetrated for different ends, and all the bloody Criminals brought to condign and open Punishment by strange and various Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods: For be assured that as Happiness here and Glory hereafter, are the encouragements and rewards of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Honesty, so present Shame and future Punishment will be the dreadful Portion of all those whose sanguinary Crimes and horrid Villanies, have made them the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Subjects of divine Vengeance and everlasting Wroth.</q>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the former Book thou hast seen (Courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) the dreadful Judgments of God, upon those wretched Sinners, who have been guilty of that cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin of Murther, and in this I will present thee with the miserable Examples of Adultery; a Crime so odious to God and Man, that whatever gentle names we may gloss it over with, hath been always attended with sad and lamentable Consequences. It has been the Opinion of some, that the <hi>Forbidden Fruit in the midst of the Garden,</hi> which God Almighty by his especial
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93450:86"/>
Command so strictly prohibited, and the Devil tempted <hi>Eve</hi> withal, was no other than Carnality; what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions this may admit of, I shall not now dispute; but the great mercy of God, hath since taken pity of our Frailties, and not only permitted that pleasure but sanctified it in Paradise by the solemn Union of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, taken from it all filthiness, and made our very Lust, pure and immaculate. Chastity and Lust, are so profess'd Enemies to one another, that they can never live together in the same Subject, no more than day and night, light and darkness; the first is a bright and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendent Vertue, the other a raging and devouring Vice: Chastity makes us Glorious as the Angels, Lust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd as Devils; it is like the black foyl to the spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Diamond, or the dark shade to a beautiful Image. Love is the <hi>Intelligence</hi> that gently moves the Soul from innocent Desires to chast Embraces, but Incontinence is the Devils <hi>Incendiary,</hi> which first fires us with unlawful Flames, and then violently hurries us over all the sacred Boundaries of Modesty, Justice and Religion, to satisfie the impious Cravings of one burning Lust. I could here inlarge on the sacred Institution of Marriage in Paradise, he noble Royalties it is endowed with, and how <hi>Adam,</hi> no sooner beheld the light and glory of the Sun, but he saw the brightness and illustrious Beauty of a Wife; how Chastity is as unlimited as Lust, and that we have as many glorious Examples of the one, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies of the other; that the name of <hi>Iudith</hi> is yet fam'd by her Continence, whilst the memory of <hi>Lais</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by her Ignominy; that the insatiate <hi>Messalina,</hi> was not more the scandal, than the chast <hi>Lucretia</hi> the honour of her Sex, who fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>w from the hot Embraces of the lustful <hi>Tarquin,</hi> to the cold arms of Death for refuge, her purer Soul now loath'd that Body which had suffered the pollutions of the Ravisher, and with an undaunted courage opened the door to death, and lodg'd the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Steel, in her yet unspotted Breast. But I should expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate too far, thou shalt here find variety of Examples in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93450:86"/>
the following Histories, a Chast <hi>Imbrigis</hi> and a Lascivious <hi>Helda,</hi> as Loose, as her Sister Continent; where I hope the beautiful Character of the one, will attract thy imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Vertue, and the deformity of Vice in the other deter thee from the Commission of that Sin, which often imprints it's own punishment on the Offender, (<hi>Viz.</hi> the Venereal Disease) but if he is so happy to escape the <hi>Brand</hi> of his own Iniquity here, the Terrors of an evil Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will be his constant Executioner, as the Devil his <hi>Tormentor</hi> hereafter.</p>
                     <p>But I proceed to the History.</p>
                     <p>AT <hi>Venice,</hi> the Beauty of <hi>Italy,</hi> which is the Garden of <hi>Europe,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Leonardo Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato</hi> that noble Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> famous for ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the Jesuits, and opposing the intrusions of the Popish See, and fulminations of <hi>Paulus Quintus</hi> in the just defence and maintenance of the Priviledges and Prerogatives of the Seigniory, lived <hi>Pedro Giovanno</hi> Count of <hi>Varini.</hi> He was a Gentleman no less Eminent for the many Services he had done the State, than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd for his Virtues; He was honoured with the Title of Count, but much more illustrious in the rich Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a noble Mind; to all which was added a large Estate and plentiful Revenues, which gave Lustre and Support to the Royalty of his House and Grandeur of his Family. <hi>Varini</hi> was now arrived to the sixtieth year of his Age, and being desirous to retire from the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Cares, that constantly attend publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, left the crowded Streets of <hi>Venice</hi> for the quiet and recess of a Country Life, and presently taking leave of his Friends, went to his Castle at St. <hi>Brien</hi> about 30 <hi>Italian</hi> miles distant from <hi>Venice,</hi> where he passed his time in the pleasant Diversion of those Rural Sports he was ever delighted in. It happened one day, as he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the Field with several other Gentlemen who were his daily Companions in his Country Recreations, his Falkner discovered a large <hi>Heron</hi> upon the Wing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93450:87"/>
whereupon <hi>Varini</hi> immediately ordered him to try the courage of his <hi>Hawk</hi> if he durst fasten on so bold an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. After several bickerings in the Air, to the great satisfaction of the Spectators, the Conflict remain'd doubtful, till at last the <hi>Hawk</hi> impatient in the Conquest of his stubborn Adversary, redoubled his force and struck him to the ground, who fell into the Garden of Seignior <hi>Berinto,</hi> whither they all hasted to the assistance of the <hi>Hawk</hi> and seizure of their Game. <hi>Berinto</hi> understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Count of <hi>Varini,</hi> with several other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Quality were gon into his Garden, followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where he found them taking up the <hi>Heron</hi> yet alive though disabled; all the Company highly commended the courage and strength of his <hi>Hawk,</hi> which <hi>Varini</hi> seemed very much pleased at, and being invited into the House by <hi>Berinto</hi> was nobly treated, where he first saw the matchless <hi>Gloriana,</hi> to whom with all the Expressions of Respect and Kindness, he presented the <hi>Heron,</hi> which she with equal Grace and Courtesie received.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Berinto</hi> was a Gentleman of Honourable Extract, whose great Grandfather had been Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> and he himself a considerable Merchant there, but having suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered great Losses at Sea and particularly in one Ship, whose <hi>Cargo</hi> was valued at near 100000 <hi>l.</hi> which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Corsairs</hi> of <hi>Argiers,</hi> in the Wars between the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> he left off Merchandizing and betook himself to the happy and peaceful solitude, of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-House at <hi>Vernon</hi> a League from St. <hi>Brien,</hi> where he spent his days free from the dangerous blasts of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Fortune; He had one Daughter named <hi>Gloriana</hi> the Paragon of her Sex, in whom Virtue and Beauty were equally eminent, and being now of the age of 21 by the consent and approbation of her Father, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to Seignior <hi>Castrucchio,</hi> a young Gentleman of a neighbouring Village, who being lately returned from his Travells in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> desired no other repose of his future Happiness, but what he should find in the soft Embraces of the Beautiful <hi>Gloriana.</hi> But alass in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93450:87"/>
vain do we seek for a perfect and establish'd Happiness amongst the fading Joys of this uncertain World, in the midst of our greatest security we are on the Brink of Danger; and those Blessings we catch at are but the Shadows of what we mistake them for, and either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude us in our vain pursuit, or ruine us in the fatal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them. <hi>Varini</hi> having pay'd his Thanks to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinto</hi> for his generous Reception and splendid Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, took his leave of him, inviting him over to St. <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> and telling him, that as such a fortunate Accident had made him happy in his Acquaintance, he would stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy all Opportunities to improve it, and he hoped they who were so near Neighbours, should be no longer Strangers to one another in their Friendship and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. <hi>Berinto</hi> promised in few days to wait upon him at his Castle in return of the great Honour he had now done him, and that though the sense of his Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to him, was beyond the power of his present Gratitude, yet he would never be wanting in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of that debt he was not able to discharge. Night coming on the Company parted, and <hi>Varini</hi> retired to St. <hi>Brien,</hi> where being alone his thoughts began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the Beauty of <hi>Gloriana,</hi> the elegant composure of her Body and the excellent perfections of her mind, which had now made so violent an Assault and deep impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on his Heart, that his blood which had been chill'd by the cares and sollicitudes of sixty Winters, now grew warm and wanton, his Pulse beat vigorously, and all parts grew active and sprightly, so powerful is the strong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse of Love.</p>
                     <p>Ten days after <hi>Berinto</hi> came over to make his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to the Count, who received him with all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of Friendship and Respect, and after he had entertain'd him with a sight of his Castle, the rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Closet, and the fragrant Curiosities of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he retir'd into a shady Arbour covered with <hi>Iessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> where after a pleasant Discourse on the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a true and sincere Friendship, he began an
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93450:88"/>
excellent Harangue, in commendation of Love and the happiness of Marriage, above the Care and Solitude of a single Life, which <hi>Berinto</hi> assented to, saying, <hi>he much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that a Person of his Honour and Quality, who wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to render him compleatly happy, had never yet tasted the Ioys of Wedlock, which he had so passionately extoll'd.</hi> The Count told him, <hi>Amongst all the Beauties of</hi> Italy, <hi>he but once saw that incomparable Creature worthy of his Affections; And pray my Lord, said</hi> Berinto, <hi>what then could obstruct the noble designs of your Love</hi>? That Question <hi>saies</hi> Varini, <hi>My dear</hi> Berinto, <hi>you best can Answer. It is</hi> Gloriana, <hi>the matchless</hi> Gloriana <hi>I love, she alone is the Lady of my Affections, at whose feet I would prostrate my self and all the Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Fortune I am Master of, to receive the name of Husband from her, more glorious and valuable to me than the Purple Robes of aspiring</hi> Senators, <hi>or the sparkling Diadems of Eastern</hi> Monarchs. <hi>Berinto</hi> was not a little surpriz'd to hear <hi>Varini</hi> with so much ardency of Affection, commend his Daughter <hi>Gloriana,</hi> nor did he presently know what answer to return; the Ambition of seeing his Daughter so great a Lady, and that breach of Faith which would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily attend it, rais'd two different Passions in his Breast, and so far distracted his Thoughts, that <hi>Varini</hi> might easily read the labours and troubles of his mind in his discomposed Countenance and profound Silence. At last having something recovered himself, he thus replyed, <hi>My Lord, the Transcendency of your Goodness, and the noble offer you please to make my Daughter, is so great an Honour to my Family, that I, who am highly sensible of my own demerits, can receive it with no less Transports of joy and satisfaction than the Captive does his Freedom, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Criminal a gracious Reprieve.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next day, <hi>Varini</hi> returned <hi>Berinto</hi>'s Visit and made his first Address to <hi>Gloriana,</hi> who being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by her Father, with the great professions of Kindness, the Count had made to him, and his m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re particular Respect to her, gave him a reception which rather show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her deference and regard to his Quality, than any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93450:88"/>
she received from the Courtship of a Lover. However the Count so vigorously pursued his Amours, that in a short time he absolutely gained the Father, and had been no less successful over the Affections of the Daughter, had not her pre-engagement to <hi>Castrucchio,</hi> obstructed the Conquest of his Flames, who was fully resolved, that no power should be able to rescind that sacred Tye, by which they were so firmly linkt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Nor should all those empty Titles of Honour, now laid at her Feet, tempt her heart to Treachery, and prevail upon her to forsake him to whom she had once vow'd eternal Constancy and Fidelity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Castrucchio</hi> was soon acquainted by <hi>Gloriana</hi> with the unwelcome News, that the Lord <hi>Varini</hi> was now his Rival in his pretensions to her, which he received with a courage undaunted, telling her, that as no person of what Quality soever, durst make an attempt upon her Vertue, so he was well assured he would find as cold Entertainment in her Affections; and that she who knew the Honor and Justice of his Cause, was the most fit person to determine his Right, which the Lord <hi>Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> with more Treachery than Gallantry endeavoured to supplant. <hi>Gloriana</hi> with repeated promises gave fresh assurance of a constant and Loyal Heart, which all the charms of Ambition, should never be able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with <hi>levity,</hi> nor the gilded promises of a plentiful Joynture corrupt with <hi>Infidelity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But alass! what Heart is so steel'd from all Impressions of Vice, that Covetousness and Ambition can make no dint upon it? Love too often softens the most rigid and austere Vertue, which once made pliable receives the easie Signatures of those Crimes, we at first so boldly scorn'd and detested. This was the case of fair but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant <hi>Gloriana,</hi> the present Temptation of Riches and Honour, were so often presented to her with all the glorious Train of future Blessings, that at last the gawdy show stagger'd her weaker Resolution, and she rather chose the Age and Impotency of a Gouty Lord, than
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93450:89"/>
the Youth and Vigour of her faithful <hi>Castrucchio.</hi> In short, the sedulous Addresses of <hi>Varini,</hi> joyn'd with the powerful Commands of <hi>Berinto,</hi> at last took place, and <hi>Gloriana</hi> consented to the Marriage, which was solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the Castle of St. <hi>Brien</hi> a forthnight after, with all the Magnificence and Splendor a generous Bounty was able to express.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Castrucchio</hi> was not long before he received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the fatal News, and a positive confirmation of his own unhappy State by the treacherous <hi>Gloriana,</hi> which so nearly reach'd his heart, that he immediately fell into a deep Melancholy, which continued for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Months upon him, and had now brought him into a Consumption, which his Friends apprehending the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of advised him to remove to <hi>Padua,</hi> the chief Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Italy,</hi> not far from <hi>Venice,</hi> for change of Air; where we shall leave him to the care of the most able and learned Physicians, and return to <hi>Gloriana,</hi> who has now attained the utmost perfection of that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness she had aspired to.</p>
                     <p>The Count and his Lady lived at St. <hi>Brien,</hi> were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited and complemented by all the Nobility and Gentry of the Country, and to all appearance no persons could be more happy than <hi>Varini</hi> in the Embraces of <hi>Gloriana,</hi> and <hi>Gloriana</hi> in the Love and Endearments of <hi>Varini</hi>: But alas! the fairest Picture hath its shade, and the brightest day is closed by the dark and dismal night. <hi>Gloriana</hi> had not been married above nine months, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she grew pale and wan, the Roses of her Cheeks were faded, and the little <hi>Cupids</hi> which formerly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c'd in her Eyes were fled and gone, a Cloud of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly sate hovering on her Forehead, and all her Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Discourse spoke the Resentments of a troubled and discontented Mind. Her Conversation had now lost that air and briskness she was once so admired for, and all her time was spent in a melancholy retirement to her Closet, or in the most shady recesses of her Garden, where she sigh'd away her bitter hours in complaints to the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93450:89"/>
more happy Birds, who free from the Tyranny of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, did once a year choose their own Mates, and in fresh enjoyments could bill without controul. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> was passionately concerned to see his beloved <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> so strangely alter'd, and with all the tender expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Love and Kindness endeavoured to expel those Troubles which had seiz'd her Mind; but all in vain, Age had now made him an impotent Physician, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture denyed him that <hi>Elixir</hi> of Life which could only cure the Longings of a youthful and vigorous Lady. <hi>Gloriana</hi> declined so fast in her Health, that he resolved to remove to <hi>Venice,</hi> in hopes the pleasantness of the Place, and variety of Company, would divert her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and restore her to her former Health and Beauty, and accordingly did so.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Varini</hi> had not been above three months there, but <hi>Castrucchio,</hi> who was now perfectly recovered at <hi>Padua,</hi> heard of his return to <hi>Venice,</hi> whither he immediately removed, and courted all opportunities to get a sight of the Countess, which soon after he effected. Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing she used to go to St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Chappel to Mass, he constantly paid his Devotions there, where at last he spied her upon her Knees before the high Altar, and not observing the Count her Husband, or any of her Servants near, went and kneel'd down by her. It is not difficult to guess what Saint he made his Prayers to, nor what was the Subject of his Petitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Countess was strangely surpriz'd to see <hi>Castrucchio</hi> so near her, and in the midst of his Discourse bid him forbear, and meet her there the next Afternoon at four precisely. <hi>Castrucchio</hi> in the <hi>interim</hi> suffered all the Torments that variety of Thoughts could rack him with, sometimes blaming her Disloyalty to him, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing but scorn and contempt, and presently when he considered her first infidelity, it gave him hopes she might prove as faithless to the Count, whose cold and impotent Embraces could never oblige the craving desires of a youthful Beauty. The hour was now come,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93450:90"/>
and <hi>Castrucchio</hi> impatiently expected the Countess, who presently came and kneeled down in the same place he had seen her before; <hi>Castrucchio</hi> placed himself next to her, who immediately gave him a Note into his hands, wherein he found these Contents following:
<floatingText type="letter">

                              <head>
                                 <hi>Gloriana</hi> to <hi>Castrucchio.</hi>
                              </head>
                              <p>TO morrow the Count <hi>Varini</hi> goes to his Castle at St. <hi>Brien,</hi> and at ten in the morning I will be at the <hi>Franciscan</hi> Church, till then farewell my dear, my dear <hi>Castrucchio.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </body>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Castrucchio</hi> was overjoyed at this Assignation, and punctually observed it, where, notwithstanding his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the Countess prevented him, from whence they immediately went to the Water-side, and took a <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dola,</hi> and so directly to a private Garden of Pleasure, where the recluseness of the place presented them with the opportunity of a more secret Converse. <hi>Castrucchio</hi> could not so prudently stifle his resentments of <hi>Gloriana</hi>'s Inconstancy, but she presently observ'd discontent in his looks, and by the breaks of his Discourse, that a more fix'd and compos'd trouble was settled in his heart. Whereupon, <hi>My dear</hi> Castrucchio, sayes she, <hi>You blame me I know, and presume the Iustice of your Cause, will warrant your Reflections on my guilty Breast; I confess I am not so innocent as I ought to be, yet let not the severity of your prosecution, exceed the quality of my Offence; if I have wronged your Goodness by my Breach of Faith, let that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness now forgive me, and my too late Repentance be my Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Gloriana</hi>'s Penitence and <hi>Castrucchio</hi>'s Mercy, soon wrought a perfect reconciliation, and the rest of the time was spent in more pleasant and amorous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments. At evening they parted, when <hi>Gloria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> told <hi>Castrucchio,</hi> the Visit he promised she'd receive at her own House the next Evening, for she did not expect the Count's Return till ten days after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:93450:90"/>Thus they had frequent Enterviews, in the absence of the Count by the assistance of <hi>Fortia, Gloriana</hi>'s Waiting-Woman, who being privy to the Intrigues of Love between the Countess and <hi>Castrucchio,</hi> was very serviceable to their Amours, by admitting him in the dusk of the Evening, at a back door into her Lodgings where they revelled all night in forbidden Pleasures, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dreaming of those heavy Judgments, which so close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued their Adulterous Crimes. The Count was now returned, who observ'd great alterations in the Temper and Behaviour of <hi>Gloriana,</hi> her Humour had now recovered its former Sprightliness, and nothing seemed so dear and obliging to her, as the Embraces of her Husband, which he was extreamly pleased withal, mistaking that for Love and Kindness in her, which was only a feigned Passion and crafty disguise, to conceal a more notorious Offence. <hi>Varini</hi> had now continued two months at <hi>Venice,</hi> whose presence prevented that famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity and those frequent Visits the Lady and her Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour so earnestly coveted, which <hi>Gloriana</hi> much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and by the advice of <hi>Fortia,</hi> resolv'd to remedy. It was agreed that <hi>Gloriana</hi> should counterfeit her self sick, which she did, and prayed <hi>Varini</hi> that Father <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Raquinto</hi> her Confessor might be sent for, whose Prayers and Ghostly Counsel she hoped would turn to her great advantage. <hi>Varini</hi> was much grieved at the sickness of his Lady, and readily granted any request she made; accordingly the Holy Father came daily to visit the Countess, of which <hi>Fortia</hi> gave <hi>Castrucchio</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and that it was her Ladies Pleasure that he should put himself into the same Religious habit, under which Covert he might with safety see her when ever <hi>Varini</hi> was abroad. This design was of great Service to them, for no sooner was <hi>Varini</hi> gone to the Rialto, but <hi>Fortia</hi> gave <hi>Castrucchio</hi> intelligence, who presently came and was admitted without the least mistrust of the Servants. This politick contrivance for a long time skreen'd the Adulterous Countess, from the suspitions of her Servants
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93450:91"/>
and the Jealousies of <hi>Varini</hi>; who (she appearing now to be with Child,) doted on her more than ever; praised his own happiness in a mistaken Blessing, deeming that the strength of his Impotent Age and the Glory of his Gray-Hairs, which was the effect of youthful Lust in his shameless and Adulterous Wife.</p>
                     <p>But not long after <hi>Varini</hi> by accident took up a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his Ladies Chamber, and found the Directions of it to Seignior <hi>Castrucchio</hi>; the name startled him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, wondring how it should come there; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it, were business writ from some Gentleman in the Country; after he had a long time pondered upon the matter, with all the jealous Disquisitions of an <hi>Italian</hi> Brain, he resolved the point, that this Gentleman was most certainly his Ladies Gallant, and probably the same Person since the name was so, to whom he too lately understood she had been pre-contracted. The Letter however he concealed, and presuming if there was any such Intrigue that <hi>Fortia</hi> was acquainted with it, the Countess being gone to Mass, he strictly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her, whom he endeavoured to threaten into a Confession which she couragiously withstood; but at last being tempted with a Purse of <hi>Checquins,</hi> she made that Faith a Slave to Gold, which could not be forc'd by the Terrors of Punishment, and discovered the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Secret with all it's Circumstances. <hi>Varini</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the dismal Story, with horror and amazement, curs'd his own unhappy Fortune, and much more the Treachery of his disloyal Countess; after a little pause he gratified <hi>Fortia</hi> according to his promise, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding her to silence, retired to his Closet where he meditated a Revenge proportionable to his own Injury and <hi>Gloriana</hi>

                     <p>Three days after, he told <hi>Gloriana</hi> with a smiling Countenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he must leave her to lye alone that night and go over to St. <hi>Brien</hi> for some Writings he wanted, but would be back the next Evening; and to give a fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gloss to the business, and make her more secure, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

her if Seignior <hi>Boraccio</hi> the Procurator came, to give him those Parchments in his Closet, of which that was the Key. <hi>Varini</hi> immediately parted for St. <hi>Brien,</hi> who was no sooner gone, but the Countess sent <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strucchio</hi> word of it, and desired his Company that night; <hi>Castrucchio</hi> who had never yet failed her amorous invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations was punctual at the hour. <hi>Varini</hi> pretending to his Servants he had forgot something, returned by 11 at night, and went directly up to her Chamber atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Sturio</hi> a Gentleman that waited upon him, whom he ordered to knock at the door, (which was locked) and say, he had a Letter to the Countess of urgent Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness from his Lord <hi>Varini.</hi> The Lovers having weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves with the repetition of their unlawful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures lay fast asleep enchased in each others Arms, till <hi>Fortia</hi> awaked <hi>Gloriana,</hi> telling her some body knockt at the Chamber door, who startled at it, bid her ask who was so rude, and what their Business; <hi>Sturio</hi> (whose Voice was very well known) answered, he had brought a Letter from his Lord <hi>Varini</hi> to the Countess of important busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, upon which, not in the least suspecting what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd against her, she commanded <hi>Fortia</hi> to open the door, and receive the Letter, and bid <hi>Sturio</hi> to wait her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer below. <hi>Fortia</hi> no sooner opened the door, but <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> rushed in with his Sword drawn, and <hi>Sturio</hi> after him with a brace of Pistols in his hands; <hi>Castrucchio</hi> was asleep, and the Countess so surprised, that she onely gave one loud shriek, at which <hi>Castrucchio</hi> awaking, at the same instant felt <hi>Varini</hi>'s Sword in his Breast, who with repeated Wounds gave his fleeting Soul an easie passage into another World. The Countess lay trembling by, happy in this onely, that she had nothing now to fear, but each minute hop'd and begg'd his revenging S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hand, <hi>This Madam,</hi> says he, (turning to the Countess) <hi>is the heart of your beloved Paramour, see yet how sprightly it is; it was unreasonable, Lady, you should have him wholly to your self, this is my share now, and that yours,</hi> scornfully kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Head to her. It is impossible to describe that horrour of Mind and Anguish of Soul <hi>Gloriana</hi> laboured under, which nothing but the Blessing of a sudden death was able to relieve her from. <hi>Castrucchio</hi>'s Body thus mangled was thrown out at the Window snto the Street, and <hi>Gloriana</hi> confined to her Chamber, where she was left alone, with the head of her Lover placed on her Cabinet, to furnish her with constant Meditations of Death, and the sad remembrance of her former pleasures, which, with the present torment of a guilty Conscience, was a punishment more grievous than ten thousand deaths. The next Morning discovered <hi>Castrucchio</hi>'s Body, which was found under <hi>Gloriana</hi>'s Window, with the Head off, the Breast cut open, and the Heart pull'd out, to the great wonder and astonishment of every gazing Passenger. <hi>Varini</hi> went early in the morning to the Council and acquainted them with the Circumstances of the Fact, before the Officers of Justice had notice of it, acknowledged himself the Authour, proved by <hi>Sturio</hi> and <hi>Fortia,</hi> that he found <hi>Castrucchio</hi> in Bed with his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and upon that provocation had taken this severe but just Revenge, which appearing to he true by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Evidence, he was acquitted.</p>
                     <p>Seven days after <hi>Gloriana</hi> was delivered of a dead Son, whose immature Birth was occasioned by the Violence of her grief and sorrow, which yet was not powerful enough to end her unhappy days, and put a period to those Miseries under which she languished. <hi>Varini</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the present illness of <hi>Gloriana,</hi> ordered the Head of <hi>Castrucchio</hi> to be removed from her sight, the smell of it now growing very offensive, and sometimes used to visit her, and in some measure, seemed to remit the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of his Revenge, and give place to Pitty and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion. <hi>Gloriana</hi> after a Month, was so well recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93450:92"/>
that she walked about her Chamber and had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to take the air of the Garden, and dine if she plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed publickly with <hi>Varini</hi> or privately in her own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but constantly obliged to drink out of <hi>Castrucchio</hi>'s Skull, which by the Command of the Count, had the Flesh boyled off, the Brains taken out, and fashioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the form of a Cup.</p>
                     <p>Not long after <hi>Varini</hi> meeting <hi>Gloriana</hi> one Evening, walking solitary in the Gallery, <hi>My Dear,</hi> says he, <hi>I observe you yet continue very pensive and Melancholly, at which I am much concerned; I have consulted your Physitians in relation to your Health, who have prescribed an Electuary which you must take this Evening, an hour before you go to Bed, it will comfort your Spirits and cheer your Heart</hi>: which she wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly assented to.

This Gentleman had one only Child, a Daughter called <hi>Petronella,</hi> a young Lady of admirable Beauty, in which she not more excell'd all others of her Sex, than in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of her mind, which Bounty of Heaven, her careful Father still endeavoured to improve by the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93450:93"/>
most learned Masters of all Sciences that Age afforded.</p>
                     <p>Amongst others, <hi>Dribellus</hi> a young Gentleman who had been Educated under <hi>Miletus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> was entertained by him, with the promise of a generous Reward, to instruct his Daughter in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> in which he particularly excelled; the good Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving she should want no accomplishment that Art could furnish her with, to render her the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Pattern of Vertue and Learning, and the only <hi>Phaenix</hi> of her Age and Sex. The Care and Industry of <hi>Dribellus</hi> was soon discovered by the great Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Pupil, which <hi>Patricius</hi> was no less sensible of, and constantly encouraged with his bountiful Hand. Twelve Months were now passed, in which <hi>Dribellus</hi> by his obliging behaviour, had equally charm'd the tender Affections of <hi>Petronella,</hi> and won the good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of her Father and Mother, both highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his modest Carriage and sweetness of Temper, from whose indefatigable pains, they hoped to reap those great advantages, his studious Labours so fairly promised.</p>
                     <p>The constant society of <hi>Dribellus</hi> with <hi>Petronella,</hi> had now endear'd them to each other, and the unhappy Flames of Love warm'd their Breasts with mutual Kindness and Respect, which <hi>Dribellus</hi> no sooner dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the languishing Looks of <hi>Petronella,</hi> but he resolved if possible, to raise a future Fortune there, where at first, he only expected a present Support and Maintainance. To this end he courted all Opportunities to enjoy her Company, and frequently exchanged his <hi>Lectures</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> for the more pleasing discourses of <hi>Love,</hi> which he soon found were no less acceptable to his <hi>Mistress</hi> than the other had been grateful to his <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pill.</hi> Thus they continued for some time, courting each other with Amorous Glances and melancholly Sighs, the dumb but powerful Rhetorick of bashful Lovers; till at last <hi>Dribellus</hi> in express Terms, discovered his Passion to her, at which she seemed very much surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93450:94"/>
but having recovered her self, told him, she had been always very sensible of his great Respects to her in those diligent Instructions she received from him, which though she was in no capacity to retaliate, she would never forget; and hoped the Bounty and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity of her Parents, would in some measure answer his Merits, whilst she could only reward him with a Thankful acknowledgement. <hi>Dribellus</hi> who well knew the great Wit of <hi>Petronella</hi> could not mistake the true sence and meaning of his discourse, though her Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Modesty diverted it to another Subject, presently reply'd, Dribellus <hi>has no such haughty Thoughts of his past Service, to think he ever could oblige the fair</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronella, <hi>or in the least deserve a return of that sincere Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he professes to her. I love my fairest</hi> Petronella; <hi>I leve; and no reward is valuable with me but what gives me your Heart, or robs me of my Life; if your Kindness bids me live, I live your Servant, or your frown at the same minute, commands me to dye your Martyr.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Petronella</hi> blush'd, and what Modesty would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her to utter in words, she spoke in her languishing eyes and abrupt sighs, <hi>live</hi> Dribellus, <hi>live, and let that cruel Maid, be for ever forsaken who bids her lover dye.</hi> At this <hi>Dribellus</hi> took Heart and pursued his Amours with so vigorous an Attaque, that the Lady made a willing Surrender, and promised that the Heart he had so bravely conquered, should ever be the Trophy, of his Victory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dribellus</hi> having thus gain'd an assurance of <hi>Petronella</hi>'s Affections, endeavoured by all means, to fix it beyond the Power or Cause of ill Fortune, and accordingly some few days after, finding <hi>Petronella</hi> in the Garden, began an Assault upon her Vertue, with all the specious pretensions of Affection that Love could inspire him with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Petronella,</hi> who had already yielded up her heart to <hi>Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellus,</hi> thought the sacred trust of her Honours might be reposed in the same Breast, with equal securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thus with kind Caresses, and wanton Dalliances,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93450:94"/>
did this subtil Thief rob her of the Flower of her Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and with the sighs and denials of a languishing Maid, she at last exchanged the native Innocence of her Soul, and Vertue of her Mind, for Shame, Folly and Dishonour: This was the first step they made in those crooked Paths of Wickedness, which they afterwards so much delighted in, who by the frequent Repetition of their unlawful Pleasures, were now grown so careless and secure, as if they gloried in their sins, and were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sensible of their shame, nor apprehensive of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which with a silent pace constantly pursues the lustful Criminal.</p>
                     <p>Before this was discovered by any of her Relations, a young Gentleman, who lived at <hi>Larissa,</hi> (the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of <hi>Achilles,</hi> not far from <hi>Oeta</hi>) whose Name is <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissus,</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Abridatus,</hi> a Gentleman of very considerable Estate and Family, was recommended to her Father, as a Person who would be a very suitable Match for his Daughter, who with a very handsome Equipage, was now come over to <hi>Hypata</hi> to court her. Fame had spoke loud of the Perfections of <hi>Petronella,</hi> both in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind, and after some days Converse found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self absolutely conquered by the Charms of her Witand Conversation, which were more irresistible than those of her Face and Beauty, in both which she appeared so il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious, that <hi>Polissus</hi> was straight made a Prisoner by her, and fast fettered in the golden Chains of Love. This gave the Lovers an unexpected disturbance, who with Sighs and Tears express the present Trouble and Anguish of their Minds, they curse the coming of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissus,</hi> and charge him as the sole Author of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness and Misery: <hi>Dribellus</hi> looks on him with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and <hi>Petronella</hi> with Disdain; she could not willingly afford him one amorous glance, all her smiles were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, and the best Entertainment she could give him was upon force and constraint, whil'st he sighs and throws himself at her Feet, without moving her to the least Pity or Compassion; but <hi>Polissus</hi> grew daily into
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93450:95"/>
the favour of her Parents, though he found little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in the heart of the Daughter; and although <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricius</hi> himself interposed his Paternal Authority to recommend him to her Affections, told her of his Riches, and fair Possessions, the Nobility of his Family, and his Personal Endowments, yet she slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contemned him, and one day told her Mother, that though she did allow <hi>Polissus</hi> to be a compleat Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, yet it was impossible for her to act so great a violence upon her self, as to force her Affections to love that Person she ever had an aversion to, and should think her self more happy in the cold Arms of Death, than the Embraces of that Husband that she could not affect. The Mother moved with the Tears of her Daughter, took pity on her, but her Father being of a more stern and austere Nature, grew enraged at her denial, and was so far from admitting her impertinent Reasonings, that he resolved to force her to compliance, and not suffer her longer to resist his Will and Pleasure, and to that end dispatched a Messenger to <hi>Abridatus, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissus</hi> his Father, in order to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But his Wife, who best knew the temper of her own Sex,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93450:95"/>
so narrowly watched all the Actions and Gestures of <hi>Petronella,</hi> that she soon discovered the kindness and Familiarity that was between the Master and the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; but (like a prudent Woman) she did not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately acquaint her Husband with it, and publish to the World the folly of her Daughter, but watched an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, that she might take them together and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them of that Folly which would certainly be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Misery and Repentance.</p>
                     <p>It happened not long after, that <hi>Dribellus</hi> and <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella</hi> being retired into a Grove of <hi>Olives,</hi> which by the privacy and recluseness of it, had been the frequent Scene of their dishonest Pleasures, the Mother followed them at a distance, and in the midst of those ravishing Delights they entertain'd each other with; she cryed out and appeared to the two Lovers in the very Extasie and Rapture of their Lust. It is here impossible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the horror and amasement the two Lovers were in, to see themselves surprized in this wanton Posture; the sight of her Mother was more terrible to them, than that of a <hi>Basilisk,</hi> the lightning of her eyes and the thunder of her voice, pierced their Breasts and cleft their Hearts asunder. In this posture they continued a while, without being able to say one word in excuse of themselves or the notoriousness of that Fact which was too apparent to be denyed; till at last <hi>Dribellus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to speak in Justification of himself and the afflicted <hi>Petronella,</hi> cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93450:97"/>
forc'd Marriages, which often prove most fatal in the consequence. At last (<hi>Marella</hi> being made one of their Council) it was agreed that <hi>Dribellus</hi> who was scarce known to <hi>Polissus,</hi> should put himself into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a Servant, and under the feigned name of <hi>Cotys</hi> be admitted into the Family to look after the Wardrobe, which place was now vacant. <hi>Dribellus</hi> was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly entertained, whilst <hi>Polissus</hi> never suspects the Snake he lodg'd in his bosom, nor the Thief he harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his House; and now <hi>Cotys</hi> thinks himself happy, hugs his own Ingenuity, and imagins himself blessed and fortunate. In this manner the two Lovers live together, take hold of all Opportunities to converse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and enjoy each other; no Clouds appeared to interrupt their Joy, and all things ran with a smooth and even Current. Among the many Servants they kept, there was a Maid called <hi>Paretta,</hi> who fell despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in Love with <hi>Cotys,</hi> would never be out of his Company, and at last grew so troublesome to him, that he was forced to slight and disrespect her that he might rid himself of her importunity. This she took in evil part, and supposing the reason of his unkindness to her, was the Love he had for some other Person, narrowly watched him; and at last discovered the Kindness and Familiarity between him and <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella.</hi>

Two hours after, entered <hi>Cotys</hi> and <hi>Morella,</hi> and presently after <hi>Petronella</hi> descended from the Balcony by the same Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Ropes. Their ears were the first witnesses of their Amorous Parly, and it was not long before their eyes discovered their Filthiness, when in the midst of their lustful Pleasures, they surprized them with their glittering Scymiters in their hands, which struck the Lovers with a horror and consternation, beyond the power of words to express. <hi>Petronella</hi> implor'd nothing but present Death from his own hands, which he had not Mercy enough to give, but reserv'd her for a more infamous and shameful end. Turning his Eyes from her, with all the passionate Expressions of Abhorence and Detestation, he called in his Servants, and order'd them to bind <hi>Dribellus,</hi> who was immediately dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred before her Face, and thrust out of Doors to seek his Fortune. <hi>Morella</hi> was stript and bound to a Tree,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93450:98"/>
and scourged with the Twigs of Hazle, till the Skin was Flead off from her Back, and then banished the City; <hi>Petronella</hi> was carried to her Chamber, where she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Prisoner till the next Morning, when she was brought before the Magistrates, and upon evident Proof of the Adultery, was condemned to undergo the <hi>Raphination</hi> or Punishment of the Radish, which in those Countrys grow to a great magnitude, which they force up their Bodies. Thus the wretehed <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella</hi> suffered, when she had in vain begged to be strangled, and dyed the most ignominious and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Death the Art of Man could invent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Petronella</hi> dyed very penitent, confessing the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of her Crime, and begging pardon of her Husband was both pitied by him, and much lamented by all who knew the Quality of her Birth and vertuous Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <q>Thus we see the Tragical End, of unlawful Pleasures which like the <hi>Apples</hi> of <hi>Sodom</hi> appear fair and beautiful to the Eye; promise a Thousand Happinesses by their bewitching outside and false appearances, but within are either nothing but rotteness, or upon the first touch, crumble into Dust, acd leave us to Shame and Misery here, and eternal Damnation hereafter.</q>

Don Pedro</hi> de <hi>Castello</hi> by the assistance of <hi>John</hi> de <hi>Blinco,</hi> the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger, and <hi>Laura</hi> her Waiting-Woman, commits Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with her. <hi>Paulinta</hi> upon her delivery of a monstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Birth, dyes. <hi>Roderigo</hi> runs mad, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> is branded in the Forehead, <hi>Blinco</hi> whipt through the Streets of <hi>Corduba,</hi> and sent to the Mines; and <hi>Laura</hi> torn in pieces by Wild Beasts.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AT <hi>Corduba</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> lived <hi>Don Andreo Rametzi,</hi> who was a Person very considerable in those Parts, both for his Estate and Quality, and a peculiar excellency he had in dispatch of Business of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est moment, in which he was indefatigable: For these Reasons in the year 1579 he was made Proveditor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral under <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> to whose care and provision, were committed the Arms, Ammunition, and all other Naval Preparations, for that huge <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>; which was compleatly furnish'd out in 1588, and design'd for the Invasion of <hi>England,</hi> and utter Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reformed Religion. This Gentleman died in the year before at <hi>Cales</hi> of a malignant Feaver, and left three Sons of which, <hi>Don Roderigo</hi> was the eldest, who upon his Fathers Death, being Master of a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Estate, left the Command he had in the Fleet, (upon some disgust) and returned to <hi>Corduba</hi>; where within a Twelvemonth he was married to <hi>Dona Paulinta,</hi> the only Daughter of <hi>Don Camillo,</hi> a rich and wealthy Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen. The young couple lived with great content and satisfaction in their mutual Love and Affection, during the first three years of their Marriage; but being not yet bless'd with any Children, those desired Fruits of their Conjugal Vows, the discouragements of their vigorous Embraces bred discontent; and each blam'd
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93450:99"/>
the other, for the want of that Happiness neither could give.</p>
                     <p>These Differences between <hi>Roderigo</hi> and <hi>Paulinta</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd to that height, that <hi>Roderigo</hi> forsook her Bed, and often with opprobious Taunts, call'd her <hi>Barren Doe</hi>; all his Satyrical Expressions, were still pointed with Reflections on her Sterility; which she unable to bear, with her wonted Patience and Submission, complained to her Relations, of the unkindness of her Husband, and desired their Intercession, often saying, she believed he would be a <hi>contented Cuckold,</hi> upon condition, he was but a <hi>Presumptive Father.</hi> These Discords were in some measure reconcil'd by the Mediation of Friends; but the occasion of them was now grown the chat and entertainment of every Feast, and at last reached the Ears of <hi>Don Pedro</hi> de <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stello</hi> a young Gentleman, whose extravagant Pleasures had much impayr'd his Estate, which oblig'd him to consider of some new methods of living, to maintain his Port and Quality. He was familiarly acquainted with <hi>Roderigo,</hi> and the late discourses he had heard of the difference between him and his Wife, rais'd new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs in his head of advancing his Fortunes by a Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to her, in which his own hopes, and her present Discontent flattered him with Success. To this end, he watch'd all Opportunities to oblige him with some respectful Service, and not long after meeting <hi>Roderigo,</hi> who told him of the late misfortune he had in Hunting, to gore his Horse upon a Stake as he leapt a Hedge, with the danger of his own life; they fell upon a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the excellency of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Jennets, their beautiful Shape and Fleetness, in the close of all, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derigo</hi> told him he thought no Gentleman in <hi>Corduba</hi> was Master of a better Horse than himself; <hi>Don Pedro</hi> presently replyed <hi>your Commendations Seignior will make me place a greater Value and Esteem upon him</hi>; and the next day, by his Servant presented him with his Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and a Saddle and Foot cloth richly Embroydered.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93450:99"/>
This generous Kindness of <hi>Don Pedro</hi> so highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd him to <hi>Roderigo,</hi> that they vow'd eternal Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to each other; were constant Companions in all their Pleasures and Diversions, and the same Soul seem'd to animate both their Bodies. This Intimacy gave <hi>Don Pedro</hi> free access to <hi>Roderigo</hi>'s House, where he observed the disgusts between him and his Wife, which, whenever he was absent, by his graceful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and more particular Respects to her, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to improve to his own advantage.</p>
                     <p>The assiduous Address of <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to <hi>Paulinta,</hi> and the continual slights of <hi>Roderigo,</hi> promis'd him success in his Amours; which he pursued with so much Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Industry, that <hi>Roderigo</hi> was not in the least jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his design, nor <hi>Paulinta</hi> insensible of his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had now made his Applications, for four Months, in amorous Glances, and courtly Smiles, which he flatter'd himself, had so far prevail'd upon her that nothing remain'd but an easie Conquest, and that she would readily Surrender the Fort of Honour, assoon as he had the Opportunity to make one bold Attacque. Two days after <hi>Roderigo</hi> told <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> Seignior <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telet</hi> had desir'd his Company to Hunt the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which he had promis'd him; and hoped he would not be the last in the Field, who loved the Sport so well. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> excus'd himself, that he had Business of great Consequence fixt for that day, which <hi>Roderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> believing, admitted of, and prest no further. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derigo</hi> being abroad a hunting, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> followed his Game at home, and in express Terms, discover'd his Passion to <hi>Paulinta,</hi> which she receiv'd with disdain, telling him, her Husband little suspected that Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Friendship he pretended to him was false and counterfeit, and that the Injury he had offer'd him, would warrant his sharpest Revenge. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was very much surpriz'd at so unkind an Answer, and pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d that the reality of his Love to her Person and Zeal to her Service, might atone for the rudeness of his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93450:100"/>
and though he believed her Chast as the fam'd <hi>Lucretia,</hi> yet when her too vigorous Vertue, shall be the occasion of her Husband's discontent and her own Unhappiness, common Prudence would advise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move both; which since it was the true Sense of his Discourse, he hop'd rather to merit her Esteem than deserve her Reprimand. <hi>Paulinta</hi> with a look as if she intended to smile, which was presently dash'd with a frown thus replyed; <hi>The great Concernment you express at my present Troubles challenge my Thanks, but did you as well consider the sacred Name of Vertue, which I must for ever disown, you would not so unworthily tempt me to prostitute my Honour, to cure the unreasonable Capricio's of a discontented Husband: This first Offence I'le parden but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware you never provoke my Anger by a Second, which shall make you sensible of your Fault, by the Iustice of your Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Pedro</hi> seeing all his hopes of a projected Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, thus blasted in a minute, resolv'd however not to quit his Design for a single disappointment, bur try to effect that by Stratagem, which he could not attain by the common methods of Love and Address. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Crowd of Thoughts and various Designs, his wandring Fancy presented him with, he at last hit upon this one Consideration which pleas'd above the rest. <hi>Laura Paulinta</hi>'s Woman was passionately in Love, with his Man <hi>Philip,</hi> who either despising her Poverty or contemning her Beauty, slighted all offers of Kindness with a sullen Disrespect: Whereupon meeting her one day alone in the Street, he told her he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood she had a particular Kindness for <hi>Philip,</hi> which he very well approv'd of, and if she would come to his Lodgings in the afternoon, he would propose a way to make her happy in the enjoyment of her Lover. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> overjoy'd at this, came accordingly, and after seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral discourses on that Subject to her great satisfaction, he promis'd her <hi>Philip</hi> for a Husband, and a hundred Duccatoons Reward, if she would prevail with <hi>Paulinta</hi>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:93450:100"/>
to go to <hi>Iohn</hi> de <hi>Blinco</hi> the <hi>Astrologer,</hi> who was famous for telling of <hi>Fortunes,</hi> helping Maids to their <hi>Sweet-Hearts,</hi> and curing Barrenness in Married Women, which he was confident, <hi>Paulinta</hi> would experience the Truth of, in a short time, to the Joy and Content of her self and <hi>Roderigo. Laura</hi> told him this would be so great an Obligation to them, that no Person was more proper than himself to recommend it to her Mistress, which he excus'd as not consistent with her Modesty to hear, or his Friendship to discourse the <hi>Secrets</hi> of the <hi>Sheets</hi> and <hi>Sacred Royalties of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Bed.</hi> At last <hi>Laura</hi> agreed to undertake it and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly at the first Opportunity, proposed it to her Mistress, as a Thought of her own without ever na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> which he had positively forbid, and she religiously swore to Observe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paulinta,</hi> like some of her Sex, who by being too strait lac'd, do often grow awry; as she was strictly Vertuous, was a litttle warp'd by Superstition, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be less than good, endeavour'd to be more; This made her easily Credit <hi>Laura</hi>'s Discourse, who having according to <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Instructions, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her, of the lawfulness and certainty of Astrological Judgments, she presently concluded her self obliged to make use of those methods which would infallibly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them both happy in a fruitful Offspring. Three days after <hi>Laura</hi> acquainted <hi>Don Pedro</hi> that the next morning under pretence of going to Mass, <hi>Paulinta</hi> had determin'd to go to <hi>Iohn</hi> de <hi>Blinco</hi>'s, to consult him what was the reason of her want of Children, and what Prolific Remedies were best in her Case. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was well pleas'd at this News and the more that she did it without the privity and knowledge of <hi>Roderigo</hi>; No sooner was <hi>Laura</hi> gone, but he went directly to <hi>Iohn de Blinco,</hi> foretold him of <hi>Paulinta</hi>'s coming next day, her Business, and furnish'd him with Answers of all sorts to satisfie the Queries that she or <hi>Laura</hi> should make; gave him fifty Duccatoons in hand, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93450:101"/>
fifty more three days after, if the Design was discreetly manag'd. This de <hi>Blinco</hi> accepted, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd him of his utmost Care and Fidelity.</p>
                     <p>Next morning, <hi>Paulinta</hi> attended by <hi>Laura,</hi> went accordingly, and inquir'd if Seignior <hi>De Blinco</hi> the learn'd Astrologer was within; upon which they were conducted up Stairs into his Chamber; <hi>De Blinco</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently came out of his Study in a Furr'd Gown, and blew Sattin Cap, with two and thirty Corners, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon'd according to the points of the Compass; the gravity of his Beard and solemn Meen, furnish'd them with a Respect and Reverence suitable to his Quality. <hi>Paulinta</hi> began to discourse her Business to him, which he prevented by telling her, <hi>You need not trouble your self Lady, to acquaint me with one Tittle you have to say, the Starrs have already better inform'd me, and if you please to have a little Patience till I have made a perfect Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Scheme, I have but now erected, I hope the present Face of the Heavens will return you (by me their Mouth) a serene and pleasing Answer. De Blinco</hi> went back to his Study, and <hi>Paulinta</hi> with Impatience wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Return. About an hour after he came out again with a pair of Compasses in one hand, and a large Scheme in the other, <hi>and now Lady</hi> (said he) <hi>I am prepar'd to resolve all your Doubts; but first let me tell you at your Birth I calculated your Nativity, of which this is the</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. <hi>You are the only Daughter of</hi> Don Camillo, <hi>I see very plainly here, and the present Conjunction was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to you; you have six Enemies and but one Friend in this whole House, under their malignant Influence you have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd these several years, but now they have spit their Venom and the favourable Aspect of your Friend, shall make you Glorious and Triumphant. But as to your present Business, you desire to know the reasons of your Barrenness, and the Cure; The general Reasons are three, which proceed, from the three elemental Spirits</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tohu, Bohu <hi>and</hi> Vezi, <hi>and these I have already reconcil'd you to: Now as to the Cure, yours is the most desperate Case that I ever met with, there
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93450:101"/>
is but one Man in the World born under the same Configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with your self, and unless you are in Conjunction with him, you will never be Prolific. Alas</hi> said <hi>Paulinta I am the unhappiest Creature in the World! Pray Sir look again I have told you all the Truth,</hi> reply'd <hi>De Blinco, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and can add no more; but if you desire to know that single Man, it is within the power of my Art to discover him to you. Paulinta</hi> intreated it, and de <hi>Blinco</hi> thus went on; <hi>In the</hi> Sycamore <hi>Walk of the</hi> Carmelites <hi>Garden; at four in the Evening after the next full Moon (which is your Auspicious Planet) you will see him sitting alone upon a Bench reading</hi> Quevedo's Visions; <hi>and that's the</hi> Phaenix <hi>you look for. Paulinta</hi> having nobly rewarded him, desir'd to have it in Writing, which he gave her, and then taking leave, wish'd that blessed minute was now come which could only satisfie her labouring Mind in the Truth of these strange Predictions.</p>
                     <p>Learned <hi>Mythologists,</hi> who best expound the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys of Poetic Fictions, say, the antient Heathens wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd the Moon, under the name of <hi>Lucina</hi> the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess of Midwifry; and the old Women of those days, thought her in Travel when she suffered an Eclipse, and by the beating of Kettles, and scraping of Trenchers kindly endeavour'd to recover her from those fainting Fits, by their hoarse Prayers and dismal Noises. But never did they pray more heartily than <hi>Paulinta</hi> did, to see her in the full Circle of her resplendant Glory: Nor did she more passionately caress <hi>Endymion</hi> when she stoopt to kiss the fair Youth; than <hi>Paulinta</hi> now did her, for the sake of her unknown Gallant.</p>
                     <p>The wish'd for day is come at last, but the sluggish hour mov'd on too slow to answer the earnest and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging expectations of thoughtful <hi>Paulinta</hi>; the clock had no sooner struck three, but she call'd <hi>Laura,</hi> and made hast to the Garden, and still as she pass'd along (impatient of delay) sent her eyes, the quick Harbingers of her troubled mind to make the happy Discovery. But oh the strange surprize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> just as she entred the <hi>Syca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:93450:102"/>
Walk, she saw <hi>Don Pedro</hi> upon the next Bench leaning on his Arm in a melancholy posture, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to himself. <hi>Paulinta</hi> knew him at first sight, and suddenly stept back, as if her tender foot had prest the poysonous Adder, or more loathsom Toad: <hi>Don Pedro</hi> looking up spy'd <hi>Paulinta</hi> in disorder, whom he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach'd with that Civility and Respect he constantly pay'd her; whilst she prudently endeavour'd to hide her Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pleasantly ask'd him what Book that was in his hand; <hi>It is Madam, said</hi> Don Pedro, Quevedo's Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, <hi>he is a merry Companion, with whom I have diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many a tedious hour and melancholy Thought; if you are a Stranger to him, pray accept him from my hands, and I am sure upon better Acquaintance, you will give him the best reception he deserves. Paulinta</hi> receiv'd it, and at that minute by one amorous Glance discover'd the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of that Vertue which was thought to be impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but now forc'd to retreat, and give place to a more powerful and succcessfull Vice.</p>
                     <p>Frequent enterviews, at length made <hi>Paulinta's</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate Heart malleable, and her Innocence and chast Resolutions, were by degrees undermin'd, and all her Pretensions to Honour, laid in the dust by the Craft of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and the Roguery of <hi>De Blinco.</hi> As to the first Act of Commission, I could charitably think her almost Innocent, because she was betrayed to it, but when once she came to relish those forbidden Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and grow Wanton in the enjoyment, <hi>Messali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was less Intemperate, she had both the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a <hi>Duegna,</hi> and the lasciviousness of a <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These Intrigues, were for some time so well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the cunning of <hi>Laura,</hi> that <hi>Roderigo</hi> either not knew of them, or contrary to the common Temper of his Country, pretended Ignorance; and rather chose to conceal her Infamy, and his own abuse, than pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish it to the World, by a notorious and bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. But at last her Lewdness grew so extravagant
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93450:102"/>
that he was now become the common Cornuto for every slavish finger to point at; Thisso enrag'd him that he threatned her with the severest Tortures, if she did not confess her Guilt, or justifie her Innocence. <hi>Paulinta</hi> upon her Knees, with Tears in her Eyes, pray'd his Patience and common Justice, assur'd him of her Fidelity, and with a thousand horrid Imprecations desir'd her dying Fame might be for ever attended with all those marks of Ignominy, with which the malice and detraction of her Enemies had stayn'd her living Reputation, if she had been ever guilty of the least of those Crimes, they had so unjustly charg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her. <hi>Roderigo</hi> credulously believ'd her, and was perfectly reconcil'd.</p>
                     <p>Three months after, <hi>Paulinta</hi> appear'd big with Child to the great Satisfaction of her Husband, and in that time had behav'd her self with that Prudence and Caution, that no Man was more ready to accuse her than he to Vindicate her Honour, from the Calumnies and Aspersions of such malevolent Tongues. At her time of Travel, no Husband was more tenderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for a Wife than <hi>Roderigo</hi> for <hi>Paulinta</hi>; and being told they had small hopes of preserving the Child, but less of saving her, he wept bitterly. At last it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd her Case was desperate, and their best endeavours to be employ'd in care of the Child, for whom like a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Caesar</hi> they made his way by Incision. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impatiently desired a sight of his Son and Heir, which he had so heartily prayed for: But oh the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Confusion! it had the exact resemblance of a Goat in the Face, with a long grizly Beard, but in all other parts of excellent Shape and Feature. At this dreadful sight, <hi>Roderigo</hi> immediately lost his Wits ran raving about the House, crying out, O <hi>wicked and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworn Wretch!</hi> and three days after, dyed stark staring Mad. The monstruous Birth expired within few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after it was born.</p>

                        <hi>Don Pedro</hi> followed his old course of Revelling all night with his drunken Companions; and being at the Tavern when this tragical News was brought, he smil'd at it, and told the Company (who were supriz'd to hear so sad a Relation) that he could spice it with a Cup of Mirth, and so began the Account of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries with <hi>Paulinta,</hi> and how by the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of <hi>De Blinco</hi> he had betray'd her to his wicked Lust; which being heard by the Company with Horror and Detestation; he was immediately apprehended by an <hi>Alguezile</hi> and carried before the Magistrates of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duba,</hi> and Orders issued out for the taking <hi>De Blinco,</hi> who was brought in the same Furr'd Gown and Corner'd Cap, and by the Evidence and Confession of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who also produc'd his Note for the Receipt of the last fifty Duccatoons with his Hand and Seal; He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be first whipt through the Streets of <hi>Corduba</hi> with <hi>Scorpions,</hi> and then sent to the Mines at <hi>Peru.

Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or <hi>Conto</hi> was Master of a very considerable Estate, and blest with one only Child a Daughter, and nam'd <hi>Cleandra,</hi> whose native Beauty, vertuous Education, and the Honour of her Family, made her highly valued by all; but amongst the crowd of Suitors who made their Addresses to her, Seignior <hi>Makenti</hi> a Person of great Estate and a Gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> was that happy Man, who had gain'd the Affections of the Daughter, and Respect of her Parents; and in the Opinion of the World, would carry the beautiful Prize from the rest of the numerous Pretenders.</p>
                     <p>At this time, a young Gentleman whose name was Seignior <hi>Parmel,</hi> having lately commenced Dr. of <hi>Physick</hi> at <hi>Padua,</hi> (whose Father had been Seignior <hi>Conto</hi>'s inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and familiar Acquaintance at <hi>Venice</hi>) came over to <hi>Marli</hi> to make a Visit to Seignior <hi>Conto</hi> and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who at first sight was so enamour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Cleandra,</hi> that though his discretion forbid him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any publick Application to her, who was a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune beyond his reach; yet he flatter'd himself with hopes of Success, if he could by any means divert the intended Marrige between her and <hi>Makenti.</hi> In this Design one lucky Accident advantag'd him more than all his Wit and Invention could do; for there happening a Quarrel between Seignior <hi>Makenti</hi> and Seignior <hi>Las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suno,</hi> upon discourse of Seignior <hi>Conto</hi>'s missing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatorship of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> after several sharp Expressions on both sides, Seignior <hi>Lassuno</hi> drew his Dagger, and suddenly stab'd Seignior <hi>Makenti</hi> into the Breast four inches deep, and immediately made his escape. Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions were sent for who drest <hi>Makenti</hi>'s Wound, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him they hop'd to make a good Cure of it, for though it was very deep it had miss'd the Vitals, which in six weeks time they effected. The great loss of Blood <hi>Makenti</hi> suffer'd, threw him into a Consumption, upon which he was remov'd to <hi>Padua,</hi> where he continued for three months with small hopes of Recovery. In this time Dr. <hi>Parmel</hi> made frequent Visits at Seignior <hi>Conto</hi>'s, and by his insinuating Carriage and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had gain'd a more than ordinary Friendship in the Family; but yet considering the vast dis-proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Quality and Fortune, and Seignior <hi>Conto</hi>'s; never durst discover to the Father or Daughter, that Love and Affection which lay smothering in his Breast. After several Considerations how to effect his Purpose, at last he resolv'd to try how far the misterious Secrets of his own Art and Profession could assist his Design, and accordingly one day prepar'd an Opiate Powder, which he had compounded of such Ingredients as he thought most proper, and waited an Opportunity to give it <hi>Cleandra</hi> in such a Vehicle, as would admit no Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                     <p>Three days after in the Evening Dr. <hi>Parmel</hi> came down from his Study, and found <hi>Cleandra</hi> in the Kitchin making a pot of <hi>Chocolate,</hi> for the Entertainment of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93450:104"/>
some Friends in the Parlour; <hi>Cleandra</hi> offer'd him a Dish, who thanked her, and said he would accept it upon Terms that she would drink another, which being agreed too, he privately convey'd the Opiate Powder into her Mess, without any Suspition. About an hour after the Powder began to operate so effectually, that though she endeavour'd to divert the Drowsiness which had so strangely crept upon her, by walking in the Garden, and other violent Agitation, yet at last it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, and she was forc't to retire to her Chamber, where she repos'd herself upon the Bed, charm'd into a deep Sleep by the powerful Medicine. Dr. <hi>Parmel</hi> narrowly watch'd her, and seeing her go into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber followed after, and there found her upon the Bed fast asleep; whereupon observing the rest of the Family were otherwise busied thought he might now securely, prosecute his wicked Design and locking the Chamber Door, treacherously robb'd sleeping <hi>Cleandra</hi> of her Honour and Virginity, which her waking Vertue had constantly defended against all the Temptations of Lust and Charms of Love. The Doctor having thus far ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd his Ends, opened the Door and went out undiscover'd, leaving <hi>Cleandra</hi> fast asleep, who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so for several hours till the soporific Vertue of the Powder was extinguished, and then wak'd without being in the least sensible of the Injury she had received from those villanious Practices of the Doctor, but as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Dreams or the sportive Frolicks of Fancy and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination presented her with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dr. <hi>Parmel</hi> two days after took his leave and return'd to <hi>Venice,</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Impatience, the Issue of this odd Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment.</p>
                     <p>Five Months after, Seignior <hi>Makenti</hi> whose Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had been retarded by frequent Relapses, return'd to <hi>Marli</hi> in perfect Health, and earnestly desired that his Espousals with the fair <hi>Cleandra</hi> might now be no longer deferred, which his own Misfortune had been the unhappy cause of; but being acquainted that his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:93450:105"/>
had for some time been very much indispos'd and now kept her Chamber, desired to see her, whom he found so strangely alter'd, he scarce knew her to be the same, but by the faint Remains of that flourishing Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which had once reign'd in her Face, and made a Conquest of his Heart. <hi>Seignior Makenti</hi> was equally surpriz'd and griev'd to see her in this Condition, she was grown pale and lean, her Eyes were livid and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and all the expressions of her Tongue, spoke an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and setled discontent of Mind. Seignior <hi>Conto</hi> and his Lady were no less afflicted, and advised with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the most eminent Physitians, what should be the Cause of her Distemper, and what the most proper and speedy Cure; they all agreed she was with Child, and her Disease no other than the natural Infirmities of Women in such Cases, which her Parents heard with Horrour and Amazement. The Doctors being gone, her Father and Mother with Tears in their Eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd her to tell the Truth, and discover who was that lustful Paramour that had despoyl'd her of her Honour, and brought that stain and infamy upon their Family, which all their Tears were not able to wash away. <hi>Cleandra</hi> with no less trouble and astonishment, deny'd the Guilt of such lewd Debaucheries, and by all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Powers of Heaven protested her Innocence and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted Chastity: The Sighs, Tears, and passionate Imprecations of <hi>Cleandra,</hi> perswaded her Parents at last to think the Doctors mistaken in their Judgments, and that the swelling of her Belly, which they considered as an Argument of her Pregnancy, was occasioned by a <hi>Tympany</hi> or some other Praeter-natural Tumour, which was the real Cause of her present Distemper.</p>
                     <p>Some time after Dr. <hi>Parmel</hi> came over to <hi>Marli</hi> and excus'd himself that the multitude of Business had made him so great a Stranger, and wanting in those respectful Visits their great Civilties obliged him to; and missing <hi>Cleandra</hi> at Dinner, particularly Inquir'd how she did, and if she was yet marrried? Her Mother answer'd
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93450:105"/>
with a Sigh, that she was very ill and had been so for two months past, in which time she had not stirr'd out of her Chamber; Dr. <hi>Parmel</hi> seem'd very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at the young Ladies illness, and desired he might be admitted to see her, and that he should think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self extreamly happy if the best of his Art and Skill could contribute any thing to her Recovery. Her Mother told him, she was afraid she already too well understood her Distemper, which in due time Nature would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it self, and that indeed she was asham'd any Friend should see her in that Condition, which would end in Shame to her self, and Disgrace to all her Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Dr. seem'd wholly ignorant of what she meant (though extreamly pleas'd at the success of his Design) and still more earnestly prest to see her, which at last she consented to, and conducted him to <hi>Cleandra</hi>'s Chamber, whom he found alone extreem Pensive and Melancholy. The Doctor after he had exprest his Respects and Sorrow for her present illness, desired to feel her Pulse, and after several other critical Observations more for form than any thing else, told her Mother her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper now would not be of long Continuance, that she was certainly with Child, and all that he could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect was as a Friend and not a Physitian, that they would prevail with her to confess who was the Father, and by a speedy Marriage, prevent that Disgrace, which otherwise was unavoidable; whereupon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desired him to use his Endeavours with her, to discover the Person, and that she would withdraw, that <hi>Cleandra</hi> might with more Freedom discourse him, and accordingly did so. After the Dr. had said what he thought convenient, in pursuit of that Question which he himself was only able to answer, he took his leave and told her Mother that was he not assur'd by all those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Symptoms he had observ'd that she was with Child, her solemn Protestations to the contrary, would almost perswade him to credit what she had said in her own
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93450:106"/>
Vindication: upon which her Mother ask'd him if it was possible for a Woman to Conceive in her Sleep, without being sensible of those Pleasures of Fruition, and the Person she enjoy'd; to which the Dr. answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it was possible, and that we might observe it in several Persons who walk in their Sleep, and do those several Acts of which they have no remembrance when they wake. This one Argument prevail'd with Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or <hi>Conto</hi> and his Lady, to believe <hi>Cleandra</hi> was with Child, and at the same time innocent of the Guilt and ignorant of the Person; for she had oftentimes walked about her Chamber, and sometimes down into the Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and so to Bed again, without remembring one tittle of it next morning.</p>
                     <p>After several Considerations what was to be done in a matter of so much difficulty, and that did they know the real Father, he might possibly prove to be the Groom or Footman, where the discredit and reproach of such a Match would be equal to the infamous Name of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezan; the Dr. told them that if they thought him a worthy Husband for <hi>Cleandra,</hi> he would marry her immediately, nor did he value her being with Child, nor who was the Father, since he was so well satisfied her Soul was immaculate and pure, though her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was stain'd; and that the preserving of her Fame, and the Honour of so illustrious a Family, was more dear to him than any private Interest or Respect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Seignior <hi>Conto</hi> was infinitely pleas'd to hear the Dr. express himself in those Terms, and after his most particular Thanks, told him he would endeavour in few days to dispose <hi>Cleandra</hi> to the Match, which he did, and ten dayes after they were privately married, not long after, Seignior <hi>Conto</hi> and his Lady both dyed and left their whole Estate to Dr. <hi>Parmel,</hi> and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by <hi>Cleandra</hi>; who now lived at <hi>Marli</hi> in great esteem and Reputation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:93450:106"/>It happened one day after Dinner, the Doctor being in a most pleasant Humour, and the Discourse of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany leading to it, he told them by what Trick he had married a Person of that Quality and Estate <hi>Cleandra</hi> was; at which they seem'd very much surpriz'd, but in Compliment commended his Design, which had now crown'd him with so bountiful a Success. <hi>Cleandra</hi> bit her Lip, and by change of Colour, discovered the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward perplexity of her Thoughts, nor could she alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether refrain from some passionate expressions of her Resentment, that she should lye under the great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of a Whore, and lose her Lover <hi>Makenti</hi> whom she loved dearer than her Life, and be so basely betray'd into a Marriage with so mean and perfidious a Wretch as the Doctor was. Some time after she writ a Letter to <hi>Makenti,</hi> and acquainted him with all the Circumstances of this Relation, who was extreamly troubled at it; and upon the first Discourse of her being with Child, had utterly forsaken her and never since seen her. The Discovery of this Intrigue, created a more particular Love and Respect between <hi>Makenti</hi> and <hi>Cleandra,</hi> who readily agreed, to revenge the Injury they had both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the faithless Doctor, by abusing his Bed in their Adulterous Enjoyments, and charging his Forehead with the shameful Emblem of a Cuckold, which they thought the heinousness of the provocation, would war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them in. Thus did they continue in their Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Pleasures, till the Doctor grew sensible of it, and by frequent Observations of their private Meetings, was sufficiently confirm'd in the Truth of their lustful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces; whereupon he resolv'd to meet them with a proportionate Revenge which he thus effected. Having a young Gentlewoman under Cure, who was very much afflicted with the Venerial Distemper, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly infected himself with it, which he communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Wife, and she to <hi>Makenti,</hi> who neither of them suspecting the present Cause of their Illness, were so surpriz'd by the Venom of the Disease, that <hi>Makenti</hi>
                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:93450:107"/>
in a short time lost his Nose and both his Eyes, and hardly escap'd with Life, spending the rest of his days in Shame and Repentance, <hi>Cleandra</hi> languish'd a long time in great Misery, which her Husband saw with Pleasure and Satisfaction, and growing weary at last to see her Distemper so tedious in the Punishment he design'd, prepar'd a Cordial for her in which he infus'd a large Dose of Poyson, and recommending it to her as a great Restorative to take at three in the afternoon, went abroad expecting at his Return to find her in the Agonies of Death. Dr. <hi>Parmel</hi> coming back very hot and faint (it being the midst of <hi>August</hi>) went directly to her Chamber, and sitting down by the Beds-side took a Glass of Cordial Drink, which stood by amongst the rest, and hastily drank it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:93450:108"/>The constant Conversation of <hi>Bertolin</hi> and <hi>Chapee</hi> with <hi>Aurella,</hi> and the consideration of her Fortune, which was very great, soon fired their Hearts with the Flames of Love and Affection towards her. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty of <hi>Aurella,</hi> her excellent Beauty and sweetness of Temper, were Charms able to warm the most frozen Breast, with zeal to her Person and admiration of her Vertue. These two Rivals made their Courtship to <hi>Aurella</hi> in Smiles and Glances, and all those little Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which might render them grateful to her, in which <hi>Bertolin</hi> and <hi>Chapee</hi> endeavoured to outdoe each other, but still with that Respect and Friendship, that no Clouds of Jealousie appear'd by any outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Disrespect. They us'd often to Hunt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and one Morning, <hi>Chapee</hi> sent his Servant to <hi>Bertolin</hi> to acquaint him, he was going abroad a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and desir'd his Company: <hi>Bertolin</hi> return'd his Thanks, and told him he was yet in Bed, but would rise and follow after; who did so, but when he came into the Field, as he soon found the rest of the Company so he mist <hi>Chapee,</hi> and inquiring where he was, they answer'd, he came out with them, but the Dogs making a default by yonder <hi>Copse</hi> he rid in, and since they had nor seen him. <hi>Bertolin</hi> after four hours stay, (<hi>Chapee</hi> not yet coming, and the Sport growing cold) return'd home where he expected to have met him, but the Groom told him he went abroad in the Morning, with the Dogs and had not been at home since, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he went to <hi>Aurella</hi>'s Chamber, where her Maid answered she was gone out in the Coach alone upon a Visit to <hi>Pontaret.</hi> The Weather being hot and <hi>Bertolin</hi> weary with his Mornings Exercise, he went to his Chamber, where after a turn or two, he lay down and drew the Curtains: a quarter of an hour after <hi>Chapee,</hi> and <hi>Aurella</hi> coming by his Chamber (the same Stairs leading to her Apartment) saw the door open and no Body there; and supposing <hi>Bertolin</hi> was yet in the Field walked in; but no sooner had they begun to express
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93450:108"/>
the constancy and sincerity of their Affection to each other, but they saw the Marquess coming cross the Court with intent as they suspected to visit <hi>Aurella,</hi> upon which <hi>Chapee,</hi> hastily asked if he should not that night be happy in her arms? <hi>Yes my dear,</hi> said <hi>Aurella, come between eleven and twelve, when my Maid is gone to her Chamber, and give three scratches upon the Door with your hand, let that be the signal and I will open it and let you in,</hi> The Marquess was now coming up the stairs, and <hi>Chapee</hi> and <hi>Aurella</hi> being unwilling he should see them together immediately parted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bertolin</hi> overheard this discourse, and presently sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <hi>Chapee</hi> had dealt deceitfully with him by inviting him abroad to Hunt, that he might alone enjoy the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Aurella,</hi> which he had reason to believe from the freedom of their late Discourse, and that <hi>Chapee</hi> so soon left the Field, and when he came back found <hi>Aurella</hi> was gone out, who had no doubt made an Assignation to meet him, of which this was the Result that <hi>Chapee</hi> should that night be admitted to <hi>Aurella</hi>'s Bed, to which promise his own Ears were Witnesses. <hi>Bertolin</hi> who ever had a most passionate Love for <hi>Aurella,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believed her of unspotted Reputation and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable Vertue; now began to exclaim against all her false and counterfeit pretensions to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty; call'd her all the names of a Whore and Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet which did not so much trouble him that she was dishonest, of which he now made no question, but that he himself was not her happy Paramour, and to see <hi>Chapee</hi> preferr'd to those Pleasures to which his own Merit and Abilities gave him equal claim, was an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front he scorn'd to bear. However since he had a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge so sweet in his own power, he resolv'd to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, and supplant <hi>Chapee</hi> of those Delights <hi>Aurella</hi> had promis'd with more Lust in her than Desert in him: And having the Signal which would gain him admittance at the hour appointed, he concluded to make use of it to his own Advantage. Night being come and Supper
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93450:109"/>
ended, <hi>Aurella</hi> retir'd to her Chamber, and <hi>Bertolin</hi> endeavour'd to engage <hi>Chapee</hi> in Company with some Gentlemen of their Acquaintance at Cards, whilst he attended the lucky hour; which he did with so much Artifice, excusing himself that he was very ill of a pain in his Head, and desir'd to withdraw to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that <hi>Chapee</hi> was oblig'd in Civility to his Friends, to stay with them, though he intended not to forfeit <hi>Aurella</hi>'s Promise by two strict an observance of the Rules of Friendship and good Manners. <hi>Bertolin</hi> went up to his Chamber and undrest, diligently waiting till he heard <hi>Aurella</hi>'s Maid go out of her Chamber, and then in his Gown and Slippers went softly up, and scratched three times upon her Door, she presently rose and opened it; the Candle was gone for fear the light might give any occasion of Suspition, and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella</hi> took <hi>Bertolin</hi> by the hand and led him to her Bed, gently whispering him not to speak for fear they should be over-heard by the Lady in the next Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                     <p>Whilst <hi>Bertolin</hi> was revelling in stoln Delights, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling the richest Jewel in the whole Treasury of Love, <hi>Chapee</hi> came to the Door and scratch'd three times, according to <hi>Aurella</hi>'s Directions, which <hi>Bertolin</hi> heard, but <hi>Aurella</hi>'s Senses were all lost, and dissolv'd in Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Bliss. <hi>Chapee</hi> for fear of being discovered, went discontedly back to his Chamber, accusing the innocent <hi>Aurella</hi> of Treachery and Injustice, and cursing his unhappy Stars which first inclin'd him to Love and believe false and deceitful Women. In the morning ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Bertolin</hi> stole from <hi>Aurella</hi>'s arms, leaving her fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep and went to his own Chamber and so to Bed; his languishing Spirits coveted a Refreshment, and each weary Member a quiet Repose. <hi>Aurella</hi> according to her Custom hearing the Bell toll to Chappel, drest and went to Prayers, where she saw <hi>Chapee</hi> with a sad and dejected Countenance like one who had been all night under the severities of Pennance, which she little sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93450:109"/>
had been true in the literal sense. Prayers being done, <hi>Aurella</hi> went up to her Chamber and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pee</hi> followed, and upon the Stairs with a stern look told her, he thought his present Title to her Affections had been of more value with her than to be so slighted, and her promise more sacred to him than so easily violated. <hi>Aurella</hi> reply'd <hi>I am sorry my Dear, you did not reap the satisfaction you expected, I had thought our endearments had been mutual and our Happiness equal in our exalted Ioys.</hi> The Marquess at that word call'd <hi>Chapee,</hi> which broke off the Discourse. <hi>Aurella</hi> went up to her Chamber ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much dissatisfied with <hi>Chapee</hi>'s Behaviour and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and he no less concern'd at her Reply won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring with himself, what could be the sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bertolin</hi> was now risen, and according to his Custom went to walk in the Garden, where he found <hi>Aurella</hi> gathering Flowers and her Maid at a distance from her, upon which he addressed himself to her with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment; <hi>These Flowers Madam are happy to be gather'd by your fair Hands, but certainly much happier is that Man who shall crop the blushing Rose of your Virginity; Aurella</hi> started at the Expression, and told him those were Flowers in Discourse, which she did not understand nor know how to answer. <hi>Bertolin</hi> proceeded, <hi>is the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of last nights Enjoyments so soon faded? Madam I assure you the relish of it is yet fresh in my Fancy, and my unwearied Imagination e'ry minute repeats those Pleasures with fresh Delights; Aurella</hi> was strangely surpriz'd at his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and after a little pause told him, she had quite forgot all Riddles, and he that made them was best a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to explain them. Whereupon Monsieur <hi>Bertolin,</hi> discovered the Secret, telling her how happily he had over-heard their discourse, and the advantage he had made of it, and that if it was a Crime, he hop'd that absolute Royalty of Love, which encouraged him to the Trangression would pardon the fault. <hi>Aurella</hi> heard him with Wonder and Astonishment, and with
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93450:110"/>
a deep sigh answered, <hi>Alas Monsieur! Your mistaken suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Dishonesty, will prove your Unhappiness and my Ruine! Our Loves were not unchast as you imagin'd, I was yesterday privately married at</hi> Pontaret <hi>to Monsieur</hi> Chapee, <hi>and the Signal I gave him to enter my Chamber, was to compleat our Religious Vows in innocent Embraces, you have for ever undon me, your Friend and your self— Oh, Oh,</hi> and with that swoon'd away, <hi>Bertolin</hi> call'd her Maid to assist him, by whose help they carried her to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where she continued all day extreamly ill. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Chapee</hi> was presently acquainted with it, who came to know the reason; to whom <hi>Aurella</hi> with showers of Tears related all the passages of the last nights Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions adding in the close, <hi>since we are so unfortunate in our Love, Heaven pardon me, and comfort you; I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choose to Sacrifice my Life to the Memory of my lost Honour, and dye a Martyr to my Vertue, than live with the Shame and Ignominy of a Strumpet, and at that word struck a Ponyard to her Heart of which she immmediately dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Monsieur <hi>Bertolin,</hi> upon the first notice of <hi>Aurella</hi>'s Tragical end, took Horse for <hi>Paris,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued some time, and then travell'd into <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and after three years return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he setled and married <hi>Orinta,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Cardans</hi> eldest Daughter, a Lady who had ingross'd all the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her Sex in her single self. Monsieur <hi>Chapee</hi> was for some time, distracted with that torment of Grief which now seem'd to over-whelm him, but after two years time recovered his Senses, and vow'd a severe Revenge, should only quit scores with so treacherous a Friend and degenerous an Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Monsieur <hi>Chapee,</hi> after several inquiries, at last heard Monsieur <hi>Bertolin</hi> was return'd to <hi>France</hi> and married at <hi>Paris,</hi> where he lived in great State and Splendour; this refresh'd his Memory, with the heynousness of that injury he had formerly offer'd him, and the loss of so Vertuous a Wife who suffered upon his Account,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93450:110"/>
which now whetted his anger to a sharp Revenge, and exacted from him the Justice of as rigorous Punishment. After several considerations in what proper method he should challenge a satisfaction, he resolv'd to Pistoll him as cowardly, as he had treacherously abus'd him; but this not so well consisting with the Honour and Gallantry of <hi>Chapee,</hi> to take a base and ignoble Revenge; upon second thoughts, he resolv'd to pay him in his own Coyn, and make his abuse to <hi>Aurella,</hi> the square of his Revenge on <hi>Bertolin,</hi> to this purpose, he went privately to <hi>Paris,</hi> where after he had learnt where <hi>Bertolin</hi> liv'd, he lodg'd himself hard by, and narrowly watch'd his going abroad, and at last by some Spyes he hir'd to that purpose understood that three days after he design'd to follow the Court to St. <hi>Germans</hi> where he intended to stay a Week, and leave his Lady <hi>Orinta</hi> at home. No sooner was <hi>Bertolin</hi> gone his Journey, but in the Evening late he came to his House, in the same Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Habit as <hi>Bertolin</hi> wore, which rendred him so like, that his very Servants receiv'd him as their Master; but for fear of any Discovery, he had brib'd <hi>Orinta</hi>'s Woman with a Purse of Gold, in which were a hundred Pistolls, who was ready below to receive him, and conduct him to his Ladys Chamber, who was just gone to Bed. <hi>Orinta</hi> no sooner saw him, but believing him to be her Husband cry'd out, <hi>O Lord my Dear, I hope you have met with no misfortune, I did not expect you so soon</hi>; No said <hi>Chapee</hi> with a low voice, <hi>I forgot a Paper I must give to the Secretary of State, which was the occasion of my Return, I must go back to morrow early and therefore I'le make hast to Bed</hi>; upon which he undrest and stept into Bed, where no man had ever better Opportunity or Encouragement to the Sweets of Revenge than <hi>Chapee</hi> now had. About twelve, the real Monsieur <hi>Bertolin</hi> return'd, having accidentally met with some Friends 3 miles out of Town, who diverted his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for two or three days, upon promise they would bear him Company, if he would defer it till then, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93450:111"/>
spend the day with them at Bowls, which he accepted of. <hi>Bertolin</hi> came hastily into his Chamber, without the least suspition of finding a Gallant in Bed with his Wife, whom he no sooner saw, without distinguishing who he was, but he pass'd at his Wife with his Sword who lay next, and ran her deep into the left Breast: <hi>Chapee</hi> suddenly stept out of Bed, and catching his Sword which lay naked by, prevented <hi>Bertolin</hi>'s Revenge upon himself, by running him through the Heart of which Wound he dropt down dead upon the place. The next morning <hi>Orinta</hi> dyed with great Pity and Lamentation for her unnhappy end. Monsieur <hi>Chapee</hi> was presently apprehended, who voluntarily confess'd the Murther which he was forc't to in his own Defence; and the reason of his Adultery with <hi>Orinta</hi> (of which she was altogether innocent) that he might satisfie the Injuries he had receiv'd from Monsieur <hi>Bertolin</hi> in a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Revenge, for which he was condemn'd to lose his Head before the <hi>Bastile</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> which two days after was executed accordingly.</p>

                        <p>Thus Monsieur <hi>Bertolin,</hi> thought Lust but a weak Enemy which once admitted, soon ripen'd into three Murthers, two Adulteries, and his own shameful and fatal Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Count of St. <hi>Quintin</hi> commits Adultery with <hi>Lovisia</hi> Countess of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and kills her Husband in a Duell; whereupon he flyes to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and there debauches <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issa,</hi> Wife to the <hi>Heer Van Zetken.</hi> The House being accidentally fir'd, <hi>Cloissa</hi> is supposed burnt in it, but is preserv'd by the Count. They live in Adultery, till he falling from his Horse, is drag'd dead to her Door; upon which she is discovered and dyes suddenly.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Count of St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> was a Cavalier eminently known in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> for his Intrigue with Madamoyselle <hi>Lovisia,</hi> Wife to the Earl of St. <hi>Denis</hi>; The Count her Husband growing sensible of the Injury and Disgrace he received from St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> sent him a Challenge, upon which they met in an adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Field to <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> where St. <hi>Denis</hi> was mortally wounded, of which in six Weeks after he dyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> St. <hi>Quintin</hi> withdrew himself for some time, and when he heard of the Death of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> made his escape to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> chief Town in the Marquisate of the Empire, in the Dukedom of <hi>Brabant</hi>; his Lady and the rest of his Family follow'd after, where he continued till the Justice of Heaven punish'd his present and former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries by a Tragical and deserved Death.</p>
                     <p>At this time the <hi>Heer Van Zetken</hi> was Governour of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> to whom the Count of St. <hi>Quintin</hi> upon his first arrival made his Compliment, and was receiv'd by him with all the expressions of Respect and Kindness, due to a Gentleman of his Quality and Grandeur. The Count seeing himself daily oblig'd by the Civilites of the Governour, pay'd his acknowledgments to him in constant Visits, which by degrees rendred them most intimate and familiar Acquaintance. The generous Hospitality of the Governour, often invited St. <hi>Quintin</hi> to his House, and the courtly behaviour of the Earl
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93450:112"/>
made him a welcome and acceptable Guess. These frequent Enterviews, gave him the opportunity of a free Converse with his Lady <hi>Cloissa,</hi> whose Beauty was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone able to subdue an Empire, and her Wit Command it. But alas <hi>Cloissa</hi>'s Beauty was not adorn'd with Honesty, nor her Wit inspir'd with Grace. St. <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> (whose Inclinations were always Amorous) soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the imperfections of <hi>Cloissa,</hi> and how to attaque the Fort where it was least capable of resistance. To this end, he courted all opportunities of Address to her, in which he behav'd himself with that Artifice and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that his sutble Charms soon won <hi>Cloissa</hi>'s Heart, and made her a Slave to his Lust, whose Honour and Chastity had they equall'd her Wit and Beauty, would have made her an Angel on Earth, and a Saint in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The great Observance and profound Respects the Earl of St. <hi>Quintin</hi> constantly paid <hi>Cloissa,</hi> were dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently remarqu'd by Captain <hi>Cassel,</hi> a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and an Officer in the Town, who was deeply enamour'd with her Beauty, and promis'd himself that happy Conquest, which he now presum'd the Gallantry and courtship of the Count had rob'd him of; this made him resolute in his Revenge, which his Interest and Familiarity with the Governour in some Measure gave him an Opportunity to effect, which he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this manner. Being one day alone, with the Governour in his Closet, he took occasion to commend the Count for a most compleat Gentleman, adding that if he was as great a Soldier, as he was an accomplish'd Courtier, he believ'd his Valour and Conduct would render him no less successful in War, than he was now prosperous in all his Amorous Encounters, with the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Sex. <hi>Say you so?</hi> said the Governour, <hi>is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yes my Lord,</hi> said Captain <hi>Cassel, and has Confidence enough to tempt a Nun, if once his Breast is warm'd with the heats of Passion and Desire. You would make me Iealous</hi> said the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:93450:112"/>
Governour, <hi>did I not believe you are mistaken in your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of him; I have oftentimes observ'd his familiar Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with my Wife, but never yet question'd his Honour or her Honesty. Heaven forbid, replyed the Captain, no doubt but the fair</hi> Cloissa, <hi>is Vertuous too, Chast and Uncorrupt as the falling Snow or Virgin Fountain; but this once shed upon the Earth, is trod by every common Foot, and those Waters which were pure in their Original Bed, do often lodge in dirty Ditches, and by the dangerous Neighbourhood of Filth at last incorporate with it, and become polluted Streams. I mean Sir the Devil tempted</hi> Eve, <hi>and she yielded to it. But though I believe the Count of St.</hi> Quintin <hi>dare be a Devil in his Temptation; yet I hope</hi> Cloissa <hi>will never be an</hi> Eve <hi>in her Complyance.</hi> This Discourse fir'd the Governours Breast with Jealousie and Suspition, and to add more Fuel to the Flame, looking accidentally out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, he saw the Count and <hi>Cloissa</hi> walking hand in hand in the Garden; but being at that instant acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that some of the principal Officers of the Town attended him in the Hall, he broke off the Discourse and went immediately down to them.</p>
                     <p>Two days after, the Count receiv'd this Letter from one of his Footmen which was delivered to him in the Streets by an unknown Person with Orders to carry it immediately to his Lord,

He had now leisure to meditate a Revenge on Captain <hi>Cassel,</hi> but considering him as a particular Favourite of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, he thought it not discretion to give him any publick Affront; but understanding he had an Intrigue with <hi>Olivia</hi> (the Daughter of one <hi>Caldus</hi> a Shoemaker, who was dead) and by fair promises had got her with Child, and now deserted her; he privately by <hi>Bautrin</hi> his Taylour, encourag'd her to complain to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which she did, and expos'd the Captain to the discourse of the Town, in his Name and Reputation, but without any advantage to her self. This so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd <hi>Olivia,</hi> who had the Courage of an Amazon and the Malice of a Woman, that she swore a Revenge, and <hi>Bautrin</hi> acquainted the Count with her Resolution, who order'd <hi>Bautrin</hi> to animate her in it, and tell her, that <hi>Cassel</hi> was a dastardly Captain, and if she sent him a Challenge in the name of some Friend of hers he would never dare to fight, but sign what Terms she offered. <hi>Olivia</hi> who was of a bold undaunted Spirit, approv'd his Advice, saying, if she had but Cloaths, Horse and Arms, she would immediately prosecute it; which <hi>Bautrin</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and two days after furnished her with all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries, that she wanted nothing now but an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93450:113"/>
to engage her Enemy, and revenge herself on the faithless and treacherous Captain. <hi>Olivia</hi> being thus equipp'd by the directions of <hi>Bautrin</hi> sent Captain <hi>Cassel</hi> this Challenge by a private Footman in an unknown Livery.</p>

                     <p>The Captain receiv'd this Challenge with Wonder and Surprize, inquir'd of the Footman who his Master was, but he being instructed to the contrary, told him he had no Orders to resolve any Questions, but return with his Answer; which the Captain with some trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and disorder told him he should have, and bid him acquaint his Master, he would not fail to meet him upon the Word of a Gentleman and Reputation of a Soldier, at the time and place appointed. These Champions met accordingly, and the Female Warriour without any Compliment discharg'd a Pistol, which wounded the Captain in the left Shoulder, upon which he immediately desir'd a Parley, and promis'd the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent payment of a hundred Pistols, to compose the Quarrel, which <hi>Olivia</hi> accepted of, and an hour after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them at his Quarters, and then discovered her self: For the bravery of this Action, <hi>Olivia</hi> was highly commended of all, and the Captain so scorn'd and flouted that he immediately quitted his Command and retir'd into the Country to a private Life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:93450:114"/>The Count made very good advantage of Captain <hi>Cassels</hi> Disgrace, and so well improv'd it, that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour reflecting on the Debauchery of the Captain, which was so notoriously apparent, began to think the Count innocent of his Aspersions, and <hi>Cloissa</hi> truly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous; upon which he soon after took off her restraint, but still watch'd her Behaviour with an observing Eye. This the Count was sensible of, which made them both so cautious to prevent new Fears and Jealousies in the Husband, that they never durst exchange a Smile or one Amorous Glance but by stealth, and all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Delights, were but the empty effects of exalted imagination.</p>
                     <p>A Month after, the Governour appointed a Mask and invited the Count, his principal Officers and several Gentlemen of the Town, who all came in Masquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Habits; The Count had notice of it a Week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and withal from <hi>Cloissa</hi> that her Husband had strictly charg'd her to keep her Chamber that night, for he did not think it proper she should appear, since he had only design'd the Entertainment for Gentlemen, nor was there any of her Sex to be admitted: This was a great affliction to <hi>Cloissa</hi> who had some hopes by the advantage, of her Disguise, to have had a more private Converse with the Count, which she saw her self now wholly debarr'd from. The Count having considered the Circumstances of time and place, communicated his design to an intimate Acquaintance, and desir'd him to be there drest in the same Habit exactly with himself, but to stand in a Corner where he might not be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, with a Cloak on, and not to appear till he gave him his Q. to enter. After two hours Diversion, they were all conducted into the Dining-Room where they had a noble and splendid Entertainment, and pulling off their Masks, paid their mutual Respects to one another. The collation being over they return'd to the Hall, and the Count withdrew to his Friend, where he put on his Cloak, and sent him into the Hall to Masquerade
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93450:114"/>
his Person, who was so like him in the Proportion of his Body, Stature and Habit, that the most critical Eye, could not distinguish him. The Count was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducted to <hi>Cloissa</hi>'s Apartment by <hi>Lydia</hi> her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, where the Lovers feasted their longing desires in the unbounded Joys of their Adulterous and Lascivious Passions.</p>
                     <p>In the midst of their Pleasures above, the Footmen and Servants were Revelling in Drunkenness below; whereby their Carelesness and Neglect of their Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaux, the Room was fir'd, which burnt so furiously that in an instant, <hi>Cloissa</hi>'s Chamber which was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, was in a bright Flame before they were sensible of it. The Gentlemen in the Hall were strangely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with the lowd Outcryes of Fire, and as little able to assist in the extinguishing the Flames, as their drunken Servants; but each made hast away to preserve him self. The Count and <hi>Cloissa</hi> by the Care and Diligence of <hi>Lydia,</hi> had more early notice of the Danger and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most choak'd with the Smoak, with great difficulty got down the back Stairs; and thus they all three sav'd-themselves from the rage of the devouring Flames. No sooner were they got safe into the Court, but the Roof fell down, and the Count spreading his Cloak over <hi>Cloissa</hi> (who was in her Night Gown) carried her to his Coach, and with her and <hi>Lydia</hi> went to his Friends Lodgings, who had personated him in the Hall, who presently came in, in great Horror and Affright, believing the Count (who he knew was in <hi>Cloissa</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) had been burnt with her, for the Report at the House, was, that <hi>Cloissa</hi> and her Maid had both suffer'd in the Flames.</p>
                     <p>The next day, the Count disposed <hi>Cloissa</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> to a private Lodging three miles off in the Country where he made his constant Visits to her, and without controul indulg'd himself in her lustful Arms, and the dissolute Pleasures of her Adulterous Bed. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her Husband sadly lamented her Loss and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93450:115"/>
in close Mourning for her a Twelvemonth after; which she often had the pleasure to see and smile at, as often as she met him in the Streets, where she never appear'd in her Coach, but with her Mask on. Thus they continued for two years, riotous in their Pleasures, only then most happy, when in their close Embraces they were most luxuriously wicked; till at last the Countess was privately acquainted with the Amours of her Husband; which he had so secretly manag'd that the Lady was yet undiscover'd. It happened one day that the Count being ready to go abroad to make his customary Visits to his Mistress, the Countess earnestly intreated him to stay within, adding she was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his secret Pleasures, which she with more Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than Prudence charg'd him withal. The Count highly inrag'd, told her he should not forget her Insolence, nor should her Prayers or Tears prevail with him, though all the Devils in Hell oppos'd him in the way; at which he clapt Spurs, to his Horse and rid on with full speed: But had not gone above two miles, before his Horse threw him, and (his Foot hanging in the Stirrup) dragg'd him along the Road, till he had beat out his Brains; and coming to <hi>Cloissa</hi>'s Lodgings, stopt at the door, who soon saw the wretched and deplorable end of her Unhappy and Adulterous Lover.</p>
                     <p>The Countess had presently notice of the miserable Death of her Husband, and in her Coach went directly to <hi>Cloissa</hi>'s Lodgings (where his mangled Body lay) and here saw the most rueful Sight that ever Eyes beheld. After she had in some measure discharg'd her Grief in showers of Tears and lamentable Exclamations, she sent for the Officers, and desir'd, that the Strumpet who had been the sole cause of this Misfortune, might be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and carried before the Governour, whose Justice she hop'd, would punish her according to the Quality of the Crime and her own Dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93450:115"/>
her Passion prompted her to, or the Circumstances of the thing admitted of. The Governour with an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ear, heard this dismal Relation, and express'd his Sorrow for the loss of so worthy a Gentleman and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friend as the Count was and then ordered the accurs'd Lady to make her defence, and withal, bid her and her Maid put up their Hoods and discover their Faces; which they delaying to do, the Officers pulled them off, when the Governour at first sight, knew her to be his Wife, and with surprize and wonder cryed out, <hi>It is my Wife, It is my Wife</hi>; at which words she drop'd down in a Swound from which she never recover'd. <hi>Lydia</hi> to the great Astonishment of the Governour and the numerous crowd of Spectators, gave a full Relation of all these Passages, which she had been privy to; whereupon she was committed to Prison, and a Week after condemn'd to be publickly whipt in the Market Place of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and for ever banished the City.</p>

                     <p>IN the Popedom of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> Seignior <hi>Rigidoro</hi> a-young extravagant Gentleman lived at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:93450:116"/>
who according to the modish Gallantries of the Age, was a very compleat and fashionable Sinner, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly acquainted with <hi>Emilia</hi> a young Lady, by whom he had one Daughter nam'd <hi>Corinna</hi>; who (to prevent the Shame, and conceal the Lewdness of her Parents) was privately educated; and assoon as her Age had qualified her for the Vows of a Religious Life dispos'd to the Nunnery of St. <hi>Bridget.</hi> Presently after the Birth of <hi>Corinna, Rigidoro</hi> married <hi>Mariana</hi> the only daughter of Seignior <hi>Placento</hi> a Goldsmith; whose plentiful Fortune was above the Quality of her Family, and by her had two Sons <hi>Carollo</hi> and <hi>Erasto,</hi> and one Daughter. <hi>Carollo</hi> the eldest was no sooner arriv'd to those years which ought to have intitled him as discreet as manly; but he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently known through the whole City for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries of his Life and Conversation, which rendred him no less acceptable to the lewd and vitious, than he was abhorr'd and detested by all vertuous and sober Men. As he went one day with some Gentlemen to see the Nunnery of St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> where one of his Friends had a Sister lately entered, he had the Fortune to see a young Gentlewoman, whose Beauty suddenly inflam'd his Heart, with the wanton desires of Love; which he cherished, though but with slender hopes of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing his Design, and reaping that satisfaction he so earnestly coveted; after he had inquired who she was he understood her name was <hi>Corinna,</hi> but her parents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. <hi>Corinna</hi> was no less enamour'd of <hi>Carollo</hi> and growing weary of the smart and severe Discipline she was confin'd to, resolv'd to embrace the first Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to discharge her self of those sacred Fetters which rendred <hi>Carollo</hi>'s Courtship more easie and successful. Not to relate all the Intrigues of their Love which were many, dark and mysterious, to prevent the suspition of the Lady-Abbess and the Holy-Sisters her Companions; <hi>Carollo</hi> in two months time gain'd her Heart, upon the promise of Marriage, and a Dispensation from the Pope, and at last by his Assistance, she made her Escape.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93450:116"/>
                        <hi>Corinna</hi> was lodged at Monsieur <hi>Torquato</hi>'s House, his particular Friend, where her Name and all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of her Quality, were so well disguis'd that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appear'd but what was just and honourable: And here he first gained the Enjoyment of his unlawful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures under the umbrage and promise of future Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which he religiously swore to, and she credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously believed. <hi>Carollo</hi> having now satiated his Lust, began to make his Visits more seldom, and was soon cloy'd with the Repetition of such unchast Delights. In the Interim, whilst they banqueted their Senses in the fruition of sacrilegious Pleasures, <hi>Corinna</hi> was discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the search made after her, and apprehended one night in the embraces of her lascivious Paramour, who was seiz'd by the same Officers, and both imprison'd till the Pope and the Conclave of Cardinals, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Fact. <hi>Rigidoro</hi> was not long a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Misfortune of his Son, but when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the Ladies Name was <hi>Corinna,</hi> his Daughter, and <hi>Carollo</hi>'s Sister; he was so incens'd, that nothing could reconcile him, but resolv'd he himself would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be the Prosecutor, than <hi>Carollo</hi> should not be pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nish'd according to his demerits. This present Fury of <hi>Rigidoro,</hi> was soon allay'd by his Natural Affection to his Son and Daughter, but his Passion and Indiscretion, had so far transported him; that in the extremities of his Rage, he discovered the nearness of their Relation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the Pope and Conclave being acquainted with, all Intercession for his and <hi>Corinna</hi>'s Life, was ineffectual though <hi>Rigidoro</hi> offer'd a very considerable sum, and six days after <hi>Carollo</hi> was condemn'd to lose his Head for violating the Nunnery in stealing <hi>Corinna</hi> and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Incest with her. <hi>Corinna</hi>'s Crime was no less heinous and her punishment as just and severe; she was first sentenced to be Immur'd, and so starv'd to Death between two Walls, which Judgment the Court was afterwards pleased at the Prayers of her Father, to change into a speedier Death, and ordered that 3 days
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93450:117"/>
after in her Nun's Habit she should be burnt near <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Pillar, which was accordingly executed upon her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rigidoro</hi> was very much afflicted, at the Tragical and Unfortunate End of <hi>Carollo</hi> and <hi>Corinna</hi> but time at last dried up his Tears; and the hopes he had of being happy in <hi>Erasto</hi> and his Sister, abated his Sorrows and gave some Refreshment to his distressed Mind: But alas? we too often flatter our selves, with the expectations of Happiness here, from that very Subject, which proves the only occasion of our Trouble and Misery. <hi>Erasto</hi> was as vitious and debauch'd as <hi>Carollo</hi> had been, and no less incontinent, though more private in his Sins, which at last were punish'd by a cruel and ignominious Death.

of <hi>Erasto.</hi> Two months this Marriage was conceal'd from <hi>Rigidoro,</hi> but he at last was acquainted with it, and charged <hi>Erasto</hi> with the Truth of what he had heard; that he had married <hi>Favonia</hi> the most impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Courtezan in all <hi>Rome: Erasto</hi> acknowledged that he was married, and without his advice or consent, for which he humbly begg'd his Pardon; that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he had married, was call'd <hi>Favonia,</hi> but chast and vertuous as the most modest Nun; and however her Reputation had been formely stain'd, she had washt out those Spots with Tears and Repentance: and though possibly she had been loose and dissolute in her Virgin State, she was now a most loving Chast and Vertuous Wife. <hi>Rigidoro</hi> was so highly provok'd to hear his Son vindicate <hi>Favonia</hi>'s Fame, and justifie his own Errour, that he immediately turn'd him out of Doors, and disinherited him, telling him with a deep Oath he would rather give his whole Estate to the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> than relieve his utmost Distresses, with the least expression of common Charity or Kindness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Erasto</hi> acquainted <hi>Favonia</hi> with <hi>Rigidoro</hi>'s Cruelty, saying if he continued his severity toward him he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd all his Obligations of Duty and Respect to him, by his barbarous and inhumane Usage; and that he would Study a Revenge which should make him as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable as himself. And being now reduc'd to great Poverty and Want, and finding his Father inexorable, notwithstanding he endeavour'd a Reconciliation by a most profound Submission to him, owning his Fault and begging his Pardon for his Offence; resolv'd, with his own hand to Murder him in the Street, rather than see him live in a plentiful and prosperous Estate, whilst he starv'd for want of Bread. Thus the Devil encourag'd him to the most villanous Sin of <hi>Parricide</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prospect of Happiness to himself, but as he gratified present Revenge by destroying that Life, from whence he had receiv'd his own, and since to live miserably is the most grievous punishment of Life; he resolv'd a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93450:118"/>
violent Death should make his Father as unhappy as he was wretched. To this end he watch'd frequently in the dark of the Evening over against <hi>Rigidoro</hi>'s House, and seeing him come forth without any Attendance, followed him, and suddenly ran his Rapier in at his Back quite through his Body, upon which <hi>Rigidoro</hi> fell to the Ground Dead, and <hi>Erasto</hi> made his Escape. Presently after the Body was found, and within three days decently buried, great search was made for the Murtherers; but no Person discovered on whom they could fix the Guilt. <hi>Erasto,</hi> who was constantly haunted with the Terrors of an evil Conscience, and the dread of that Punishment he had so justly deserv'd, fled aboard one of the Popes Galleys which was bound for <hi>Sicily,</hi> and was afterwards taken by two <hi>Turks</hi> Men of War belonging to <hi>Tunis,</hi> and all the Seamen and Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who surviv'd the Fight (which was very bloody) either made Slaves aboard their own Vessels, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to Land-Servitude, amongst whom <hi>Erasto</hi> was sold ashore, to <hi>Barbarossa</hi> a Person of principal Note and Command in <hi>Tunis.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Erasto</hi> had now leisure to reflect on the vitious and wicked Courses of his former Life, and particularly on the bloody and inhumane Murther of his Father, which he now saw in some measure punish'd by the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his present Condition; which wrought Complaint &amp; Sorrow for the Evils he now suffer'd under, rather than a true and sincere Penitence for his notorious Offences. But though <hi>Barbarossa</hi> his Patron was severe and cruel, <hi>Adulla</hi> his Wife was more kind to him, and often when her Husband was abroad, brought him Victuals into the Garden where he work'd, above what was allow'd him, or the other Slaves had, which <hi>Erasto</hi> interpreted as a particular Respect and Love to his Person, which made her so charitable and bountiful to him, and hop'd to improve, to a more considerable Advantage.

jealous thoughts of his Wife, and us'd <hi>Erasto</hi> with the greater Severity, which <hi>Adulla</hi> being sensible of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled her Kindness, and upon the first Opportunity exprest her more particular Love to him, which <hi>Erasto</hi> readily Embrac'd, promising that no Torments should ever extort a Confession from him, of those obliging Favours he receiv'd. Their Amorous entertainments had been many and frequent, which <hi>Barbarossa</hi> was not altogether ignorant of; but willing that their Crime should be as apparent as he intended their Punishment, dissembled his Anger; and one day pretending to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, conceal'd himself in the House, till he had notice by one of the Slaves (who was a Spye over all their Actions) that <hi>Adulla</hi> was retir'd to her Chamber, and had sent for <hi>Erasto,</hi> who was gone in to her; upon which he followed up, and surprized them in the very Act. The next day <hi>Erasto</hi> and <hi>Adulla</hi> were carried in Chains before the <hi>Divan,</hi> and there accus'd by <hi>Barbarossa</hi> of Adultery, which was so undeniably prov'd against them that <hi>Erasto</hi> was condemn'd to be flead alive, and <hi>Adulla</hi> delivered to her Husband to be punished as he thought convenient, who immediately ordered two of his Slaves to strangle her. Thus dyed <hi>Erasto</hi> miserably at <hi>Tunis</hi> whilst <hi>Favonia</hi> return'd to her old profession at <hi>Rome,</hi> and liv'd in all the lewdness and debauchery of a common Strumpet, till at last she was infected with the foul Disease, and died with Shame and Ignominy in the <hi>Burdello's.</hi>

                           <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Werdenberg</hi> is carried away by the Lord of <hi>Zeringen;</hi> rescued by Captain <hi>Conrade,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards married to the Duke of <hi>Ulme:</hi> she falls in Love with <hi>Philip (Conrade</hi>'s Brother) by mistake, seeks to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son him, and is discovered; afterwards runs away with the Lord of <hi>Zeringen,</hi> and lives in Adultery with him.

                     <p>IN that part of <hi>Germany</hi> which is called <hi>Suevia,</hi> liv'd once a Prince whose Name was <hi>Rodolph,</hi> of the Family of <hi>Schwalen,</hi> intitled Duke of <hi>Ulme,</hi> an imperial City in those Parts founded at first by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great; this <hi>Rodolph</hi> after the Death of his Father suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his Principality at thirty years of Age, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet unmarried resolv'd to make his own choice, &amp; contrary to the mind of most Princes, to have a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Respect to Love than Interest or Reason of State: whereupon he declin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The curious <hi>Rodolph</hi> had seen all the Ladies of Quality those Countrys afforded without being charm'd by any of them, till at last, hearing of the celebrated Wit and fam'd Beauty of <hi>Ann</hi> the Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Werdenberg,</hi> a Town in the Province of <hi>Suevia,</hi> he rode

over to the Earl's Castle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a handsome Equipage, where he soon found Report had not been too lavish in her praise: The Angelical form of this Lady at first sight Conquer'd <hi>Rodolph</hi>'s Heart, but when he discover,d the acuteness of her Wit, and Ingenuity of mind, he soon concluded her the Paragon of her Sex. But alass! he could not penetrate her Soul, nor behold the Vices which lay conceal'd under so fair an Outside; with all these Accomplishments she was fickle and Inconstant, Sullen and Revengeful, and what is yet worse, of an Incontinent and Lustful Temper; but the Duke saw none of these deformities, the lustre of her Eyes, and the bright Glories of her Beauteous Form had dazled his, upon which he acquainted the Earl with his pretensions to this Young Lady, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Worth of the Duke, readily embraced so fair an Offer for the Advancement of his Daughter, and the Alliance with so Potent a Prince, by who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e Power and Assistance he should be able to oppose himself to some Enemies he had of the House of <hi>Hadsburgh,</hi> who were now in Arms against him. <hi>Rodolph</hi> made his Court to the Lady <hi>Anne,</hi> whom he found very reserv'd and shie, who entertained him Civilly, but without any sign of Love and Affection, so that he soon perceiv'd it must be a long and formal Siege could take her in, and accomplish his Desires.</p>
                     <p>At this time there was a great Contest between the Earl of <hi>Wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

This young Lord was not above the Age of Five and Twenty, and possest of a fair Estate, who, tho' he was at difference with the Father, was in friendship with the Daughter, and having once upon the Road surpriz'd her, and made
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93450:120"/>
her Prisoner for some Hours, was suddenly Captivated with the Excellence of her Wit and Beauty, and not only releas'd her, but discovered his Passion to her, begging that She might be the only Reward of his Conquests, and all their Hostile Disputes amicably reconciled in the happy Conjunction of their Persons, by the Sacred Bonds of Marriage. Not long after, <hi>Birthold,</hi> by his Friends, made Overtures of Peace to the Earl, and proposed a Match between himself and the Lady <hi>Anne,</hi> and that the Lands in question should be Assigned over as part of her Dowry. But the Earl diverted this Design by his unreasonable demands, which <hi>Birthold</hi> in Honour could not comply withall. However <hi>Birthold</hi> made secret Court to the Lady, and at last obtained the Favour of a private meeting with his Mistress, and notwithstanding the Obstinacy of the Father, came to Terms with the Daughter, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Earl, they were Contracted, making sure of each other, before the Ceremonies of the Church had confirm'd their Vows.</p>
                     <p>But the Duke by renewing his Suit, interrupted the secret Converse of the Lovers which tho' he knew not of, yet fearing the propositions of Peace made by his Rival <hi>Birthold,</hi> should take Effect, offered the Earl a supply of five hundred men, which he accep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed, and by this powerful Assistance regained the greatest part of those Lands <hi>Birthold</hi> had made himself Master of. This so far inraged <hi>Birthold</hi> (his Affairs growing every day into a worse Condition, and fearing the loss of his Mistress, with whom he had frequent meetings in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise) that he earnestly solicited her to make her flight with him, which she as often refused with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, That she hoped the Valour and good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of her Lover would at last compel her Father to Consent; which he seeing no probability of, resolv'd by Stratagem to carry her off. To this end he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged her Maid <hi>Mariana</hi> by rich Presents, to tempt her
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93450:120"/>
abroad the next Day to take the Air, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her to a remote place (at an appointed Hour) in the Park adjoyning to the Castle, where they no sooner arriv'd, but they were surprised by some Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Ambush, and notwithstanding their Shrieks and Outcries, were forcibly carried out of the Park to his Coach, where he in Person attended.</p>
                     <p>This Violence extreamly troubled the Lady, who (tho' <hi>Birthold</hi> threw himself at her Feet, and begg'd Pardon for so great a rudeness, yet) being of an haughty Temper, and proud Spirit, resolved to Chastise him severely for it. <hi>Birthold</hi> endeavoured to pacifie her with all the most humble submissions he could make; and with smooth and passionate Language, allay the Storm he had raised, but all his Rhetorick was in vain; when considering this was no place for a long Parle, and the present posture of his Affairs requiring his presence, he committed her to the Care and Fidelity of his Kinsman, to carry her a private way to his Castle, whilst he returned to his Soldiers, who were now ready to mutiny in his Absence. <hi>Birthold</hi> having appeas'd his Army, committed the Conduct of it to <hi>Braganti,</hi> his Lieutenant General, and posted away cross the Country to make a Visit to his Mistress; but on the way he met his Kinsman wounded, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently recounted to him the sad disaster he had met with. That his Mistress was forced from him by a Troop of Horse, they had met withal on the way, who upon the Ladies Shreeks and Cries, rescued her from them, notwithstanding all the Resistance they could make; in which Conflict himself was wounded and several of his Men killed. This News afflcted him beyond measure; but seeing no Remedy, he return'd to his Camp, full of Grief and Vexation.</p>
                     <p>The Rape of the Lady <hi>Anne</hi> being made known to the Duke, and the Earl her Father, they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly troubled at it, and immediately caused the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93450:121"/>
Ravishers to be pursued by some of his Troops, who after three days Search, understood she was brought back to the Castle by one Captain <hi>Conrade</hi>; upon which they made a speedy Return. The Earl was exceeding Joyful at the Recovery of his Daughter, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by her, That Captain <hi>Conrade</hi> (whom they accidentally met, marching with his Troop for the Emperour's Service in <hi>Hungary</hi>) had delivered her, and safely brought her home, was returned to his Troop, without his Thanks or Reward; according to his Noble Disposition, sent to invite him to his Castle, that he might make some Acknowledgments for the great Service they had done him, and least they should not prevail with him, caused the Lady <hi>Anne</hi> to send him a fair Diamond Ring to wear for her sake, and he himself sent him the best Horse in his Stable, with Furniture richly Embroyder'd. But they needed not thus to have presented <hi>Conrade,</hi> for this Young Lady had already given gim her Heart, from whom she parted with much regret.</p>
                     <p>The late Affront of the Lord of <hi>Zeringen,</hi> and the Generous Gallantry of <hi>Conrade,</hi> had now planted her fickle and wandring Heart in the Captain's Breast, whom she expected with impatience. But <hi>Conrade</hi> Excused himself by a Gentleman, That he was upon Duty, and in all hast going to the place of <hi>Rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Young Lady was very much discontented when she saw the Captain did not return, as she had Flatter'd her self he would, her troubled Breast was wreck'd with Hopes and Fears, and great was the Conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Love and Honour: The handsom Proportion, sweet Countenance, Genteel Behaviour, Courtly Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,

This Sight rais'd so violent a Transport in the Soul of the New-Married Dutchess, that she could not contain her self from charging <hi>Mariana</hi> to set some body to watch him to his Lodging, and that she should privately Inquire of him his Design of coming thither in that Garb and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise. <hi>Mariana</hi> in obedience to the Commands of the Dutchess, set one of the Servants belonging to her Train to watch him to his Lodging, and there Acquaint him that she desir'd to speak with him at the Palace, whither he was privately to conduct him. The Man obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Orders punctually, and the Young Gentleman
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93450:123"/>
received the Message with Wonder and Amazement, protesting that <hi>Mariana</hi> was utterly unknown to him; however at the Entreaty of the Messenger he went along; and being introduced into a private Lobby, <hi>Mariana</hi> came to him, and looking full in his Face, Captain (<hi>says she</hi>) what makes you here thus disguised? The Dutchess owes too much to your Generosity and Valour, not to take Notice of her Deliverer. The Gentleman look'd strange upon her, as one he had never seen before, which made <hi>Mariana</hi> stop, and Ark him if he was not Captain <hi>Conrade?</hi> the Gentleman answered No, but that he was his own Brother, and a Twin, and so like him, that not only Strangers but their own Parents could not distinguish them, but by a Red Mole under the Right Pap, which his Brother had, that his Name was <hi>Philip,</hi> born at <hi>Villengen,</hi> and Elder by four Minutes.</p>

                        <hi>Mariana</hi> seeing his Speech, Carriage, Proportion, Face, Hair, Smiles, and Actions so very like, would not believe one word he say'd, but taking all for Fiction prest him to let her know his Intentions of being there, and whither he had already forsaken his Mistress Honour, for whom he had lost a Young and Obliging Lady, to her great Grief and Trouble. <hi>Philip</hi> seeing the Incredulity of <hi>Mariana,</hi> smil'd at her Error, but it not being the first time by many he had been mistaken for his Brother, it was no great Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to him; <hi>Mariana</hi> still urg'd he was the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whilst <hi>Philip</hi> with many Oaths and Asseverations endeavoured to confirm the Truth of what he had said, and that he came over only to see the publick Sports, and the Entrance of the Duke and Dutchess, and to morrow intended to return to <hi>Villengen,</hi> unless she or the Dutchess had any Commands to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>Mariana</hi> went presently to Inform the Dutchess of what he had sayed, and desir'd him to wait in the Lobby till her Return.</p>

                        <pb n="233" facs="tcp:93450:123"/>About an hour after <hi>Mariana</hi> returns with the Dutchess who was amazed to see the Captain she lov'd, deny himself, for both her Eyes and Ears told her it was he and no other. Captain (said she) the Obligation I have to you, may Excuse this strangeness, but after the Letter I sent you, and that I received from you, I cannot but wonder you should call your self <hi>Philip,</hi> and make so strange of a Business I would have esteemed more serious; and therefore pray tell me why you thus disguise your self, and what your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are? Madam, replyed the Gentleman, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire not to deceive a Person of your Quality, and I do swear by all that's Sacred, I am not Captain <hi>Conrade,</hi> but his Brother <hi>Philip,</hi> that I came hither only out of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity, and shall return to morrow, unless for my Brother's sake, who I perceive has done you some considerable Service<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you will be pleased to entertain me amongst your Followers. The Dutchess looked somewhat amazedly, and her Eyes told her she could not believe him, his desire of being retained about her made her conclude he was no other than <hi>Conrade,</hi> whom her Letter and his Love had brought back to serve her. This thought pleas'd her, and she told him he should Attend her the next day, and in the mean time she would speak to the Duke to Entertain him amongst his Domesticks for his Brother's sake, if he were not the same she took him for, which she still doubted.</p>
                     <p>But it is too true, the Dutchess is deceived, <hi>Mariana</hi> is deceived, and all the World who had seen the one, would have been deceived by the other; This was one of the Fantasticks of Nature, or one of her Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities which she seldom makes, in this she had imitated <hi>Conrade</hi> so exactly, that he was not to be known from <hi>Philip,</hi> nor <hi>Philip</hi> from him, she had form'd them in the same Molds in the dark Cell of the Womb, that it was not possible for the Eye to distinguish them, and least she should mistake her self, had only differenced
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93450:124"/>
                        <hi>Conrade</hi> by a private Mark. But how like soever their Bodies were, their Souls were as different; <hi>Conrade</hi> had a Noble Generous Soul, full of Life and Valour, <hi>Philip</hi> (though the Eldest) was Covetous, Sordid and Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly: besides these internal marks of difference, Time and Accident had caused one notable distinction, which not being known to many, was kept a Secret, and being in those parts of the Body which common Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty obliges us to conceal, was not discoverable. <hi>Philip</hi> in his Younger Years climbing up a high Pear-Tree, the Bough broke, and he fell so unluckily that a Stump of the Tree stuck between his Legs, which so bruised those parts, that they gangreend and were cut clean off, so that <hi>Philip</hi> was a Capon, and as true an <hi>Eunuch</hi> as any the <hi>Turk</hi> had in his whole <hi>Seraglio.</hi> This was a Secret which shame caused to be conceal'd, <hi>Eunuchs</hi> being accounted Monsters in that part of the World where they are not seen every day, or do not Govern Provinces, or Command Armies.</p>
                     <p>The Dutchess was not yet convincd, but this was her real <hi>Conrade,</hi> however he was pleas'd to assume the Name and Person of <hi>Philip,</hi> and accordingly so represented him to the Duke, that the Brother of that Captain who had so bravely rescued her from the hands of her Ravishers was now in the City, and had Petition'd her in consideration of his Brother's Service, to be admitted one of her Domesticks: The Duke glad of an Opportunity to be grateful, and please his New Dutchess, whom he passionately Lov'd, order'd him to be entertain'd in the place of one of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his Chamber, to the great content of <hi>Philip,</hi> and satisfaction of the Dutchess. The Dutchess for some time remain'd very reserv'd, expecting this <hi>Phillp,</hi> or disguised <hi>Conrade,</hi> should make his Addresses to her, but observing in him so great Indifference, she was not a little Amaz'd and Perplex'd at it. To be better inform'd she sent privately to <hi>Villengen,</hi> and was there
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93450:124"/>
satisfied that this was not <hi>Conrade</hi> but <hi>Philip</hi> his Brother, However as she had before been Enamour'd on the Comely Shape, and Graceful Deportment of <hi>Conrade,</hi> she could not be said to change the Object of her Love in <hi>Philip,</hi> who was so like him in all outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as one drop of water to another, which occasion'd the same Sentiments of Mind, and Lustful Desires for <hi>Philip,</hi> as She before had for <hi>Conrade.</hi> She knew that <hi>Conrade</hi> was gone to the Wars, and his return uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but here she beheld, and had in her power the same Person with a different Name only; and thought it the greatest Folly imaginable to sigh for one that was absent, and fore-go the same present; to dye for the shadow, when she might freely enjoy the substance. The Dutchess discovered the secret Passion of her Heart to <hi>Mariana,</hi> brib'd her with Gold, and did all that a Flattering Mistress is capable of, to subvert the Honesty and Integrity of a Servant, and make her Faithful to her; <hi>Mariana</hi> readily understood what the Dutchess meant, and with pity to the poor forsaken <hi>Birthold,</hi> unwillingly paid Obedience to her unlawful Commands.</p>
                     <p>The Dutchess took all Opportunities of shewing kindness to <hi>Philip,</hi> and with her Eyes and Actions spoke the hidden Passions of her Heart; but all her Favours and Caresses were thrown away on this dull and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Statue, his incapacity for Love had chill'd his Blood, and made him cold and reserv'd; all her smiles were lost upon him, and for those many marks of her Esteem, he only returned low Cringes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent submissions. The Dutchess was vext and angry at his dulness and stupidity, or fear and modesty, not being able to distinguish which was the true reason of so great reservedness. Great Persons love to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood at first sight, with a word and a beck, and it is better to be too forward and mistake their intentions, than too backward, and not understand their desires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="236" facs="tcp:93450:125"/>At this time the great success of <hi>Birthold</hi> caused the Duke to go into the Field himself, with those New Forces he had raised for the Assistance of the Earl of <hi>Werdenberg,</hi> and with much regret he parted from the Dutchess, laying a particular Command on <hi>Philip</hi> to be diligent in his Attendance on her, and to certifie him continually of her Health, of which Honour he was not a little proud. The Duke being thus departed with his Army, the Dutchess, with <hi>Mariana, Philip,</hi> and some few other Servants, went to her Castle of <hi>Blaford,</hi> a League from <hi>Vlme,</hi> where she designed to divert her self with Hunting for two or three days, and then return to <hi>Vlme.</hi> Here she resolved to lay the Scene of her Amorous Design, and contrive every thing so cunningly, that the most searching Eye should not be able to find a flaw in her Honour. The second Night after her Arrival, having before order'd <hi>Philip</hi> to be Lodg'd in a Chamber remote from the rest of the Servants, to which there was a private Gallery, which led from her Apartment, about Midnight her unruly Love having kept her waking, she arose out of her Bed, and (giving <hi>Mariana</hi> strict charge not to stir) flung over her a light Silk Mantle, richly Embroyder'd, her Head was curiously drest, as on her Bridal Night, then putting on a pair of Velvet Slippers, she took the white Wax Taper burning in her Chamber in a Silver Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick, in one Hand, and a Dagger in the other, and in this posture left her Chamber, and through the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gallery convey'd her self to <hi>Philip's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Apparition in the middle of the Night (as sweet and tempting as this lovely and lustful Dutchess seem'd to be) struck the Amazed <hi>Philip</hi> with horrour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation, not knowing whether it was the bright Vision of some Angelical Phantasm, or some sportive Devil in the Counterfeit Shape of a Glorious Spirit, his little Acquaintance with either, gave him sufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for his present Fears. <hi>Philip</hi> lay trembling in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93450:125"/>
his Bed, which the Dutchess approachd and holding the Dagger towards his Breast, thus exprest her Self.
<q>The many Favours I have shown, are the manifest tokens of my Affection to you, and which have been received with too much Slight and Neglect; you either disdain my Love, or are so stupid not to understand my Passion, either of which is alike dangerous to my Repose, and your Life. I have in this manner Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to you, as you see, to discover the Violence of my Love, and intrust my Honour with you: you have no other way to choose, but to Answer my Desires, or dye by my hands, this poyson'd Dagger shall Sacrifice you to my Fury, if you deny to be an Offering to my Love.</q>
This was a pretty way of Courtship indeed, but this Lady was none of those who desir'd to be Ador'd and Sigh'd for, to be Worshipp'd as a Saint, or Respected as a <hi>Vestal</hi>: Hers was not Fantastick or Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Love, placed only in Shadows and respectful Ceremonies, her Flames were to be quench'd, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires satisfied with Secrecy and Expedition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Philip</hi> open'd his Mouth, and fixing his Eyes on the Amiable yet Terrible Object, spake something so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly and abruptly, that the Dutchess soon perceived the Affright she had put her Lover in, had in some measure debarr'd her of the Satisfaction she expected, and to allay those fearful Spirits she had raised, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to rectifie the Error she had committed, by smoothing her Brow, and putting on her Sweetest and most Charming Looks: She Arm'd her Eyes with a softer Fire, her Countenance on a sudden became Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene and Amorous, Inviting Smiles dispell'd the frowns of her contracted Brow. She laid aside the Weapon in her Hand, and made use of none but Rays of Light, which shot themselves into the Soul of <hi>Philip</hi> like so many Daggers, for he trembled to see what would have rejoyced another Man. She set down the Taper, and disrobing her self into the Glories of a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93450:126"/>
Naked Goddess, lifted up the Cloaths and laid her self down by him, saying;
<q>Thus will I Charm your Fears, thus will I Court your Love: I have laid by my Thunder and Lightning, and imagine me no longer the Dutchess of <hi>Vlme</hi> your Mistress, but your Lover, and one that Expects to give and take a Felicity, Princes would not refuse.</q>
                        <hi>Philip</hi> was getting out on the other side of the Bed, when she laid her Arm over him, warm enough to melt the most snowy Chastity; What (said she) do you flie me? am I a Person after all this to be refus'd? then resetling her disturbed spirits, and gently drawing him towards her, she began to smother him with Kisses, whilst he like a trembling Partridge under the Pounces of an Hawk made some faint strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to get from her Embraces, and assoon as he could have Liberty from the Kisses she loaded him with, Cryed out, Ah Madam! I am not able to perform what you expect from me, I must Confess I am no Man, and that it is impossible for me to give you the Satisfaction you desire.</p>
                     <p>The Dutchess was so Confounded at these words, that she let go her Arms from their Embrace, and rising half way out of Bed, thought he had been a Woman, but discovering the contrary by his Breasts, which were bare, she thought he only said so to deceive her, when presently the Colour flushing into her Cheeks, and a fierceness mounting into her Eyes, she began to grow terrible to <hi>Philip,</hi> who leaping out flung himself on his Knees by the Bed side, and with many Oaths and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severations related his Misfortune to her.</p>
                     <p>It is impossible to speak the Confusion this disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Lady was in, her Eyes were fierce and spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Shame and Anger, and transported with Rage she flew to her Dagger, which <hi>Philip</hi> being aware of, ran to the Table where his Sword lay, and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a Posture of Defence, whilst she seeing her self thus defeated of her Pleasure, and prevented in her
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93450:126"/>
Revenge, look'd like a distracted <hi>Fury,</hi> all her lovely Charms grew terrible and frightful. Whether it be true or false (said the inraged Dutchess) That you have told me, or whether thou art impotent or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, 'tis not much matter, for thou shalt dye for my mistake. But <hi>Philip</hi> had no mind to be kill'd, and kept her off with the point of his Sword, assuring her with a Thousand Oaths and Imprecations of the Truth of what he said; told her more fully his Misfortune, promised and vow'd Eternal Secrecy, that no Person in the World should ever know one syllable of this Action, that he himself would endeavour to forget it, and believe it only a Dream or Vision, provided she did no ways hereafter attempt his Life; But if he should happen to fall by her Malice, as he easily might, he would leave this Nights Transactions, under his Hand and Seal, with an Intimate Friend, who after Death would deliver it to the Duke, and that if he might live secure, he would be secret, silent, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, her Shame should be hid, and her Honour safe.</p>
                     <p>The Dutchess saw no other Remedy, but without Reply threw her Mantle about her, slipp'd on her Pantoffles, took up the Candle, and left <hi>Philip</hi> not a little glad that he was so easily rid of this Amiable Fury. <hi>Mariana</hi> saw her Lady return, but with such marks of Disturbance in her Looks, Confusion in her Eyes, and Shame in her Cheeks, that she wondred what could be the Cause of so great a Disturbance. The next day the Dutchess feign'd her self Sick, caus'd her Coach to be made ready, and return'd to <hi>Vlme,</hi> writing Dispatches to the Duke, wherein she told him (with the greatest Art of Feminine Cunning and Collogueing) how much she suffer'd by his Absence, who like the Flower of the Sun must droop 'till his Return, and wither like the Female Palm in the Absence of the Male. These Let<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Removal from the sight of the incensed Dutchess. All this <hi>Mariana</hi> saw and wondred at, 'till the Dutchess one Evening in her Closet acquainted her with the odd Circumstances of her Love, and her more strange disappointment.</p>
                     <p>The Duke receiv'd the kind Letters of the Dutchess, and was not a little satisfied with her Love and Care, and after he had put his Affairs in a good posture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd Post to <hi>Vlme,</hi> to the Embraces of his Lady. <hi>Philip</hi> came along with the Duke, but kept himself as much out of her Presence as he could, who never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him but with Shame and Confusion, and that very Object, which before had been so pleasant in her Eyes, was now as monstrous and hateful, Malice and Revenge succeeded her Love in as great a degree, and considering her Honour and Life were intrusted to his keeping, she resolved neither could be safe as long as he liv'd, and having in vain endeavour'd by several Artifices to remove him from the Duke, she Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with <hi>Mariana</hi> what was to be done in so difficult a Case, who agreed to send him into another World, which could only secure his Silence. To this End, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> the Cook was hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He presently imagin'd it came from the implacable Hatred of the Dutchess, and resolv'd to be Reveng'd of her before he Dy'd: whereupon he sent for the Duke, and having made all Persons avoid the Room, Acquainted him with the Visit the Dutchess had given him, with all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumstances of it, and fully inform'd him of the reason of her Malice and his Empoysoning.</p>
                     <p>The Duke was like one Thunder-struck with this
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:93450:127"/>
Relation, and having consider'd the several parts of it, began to question whether <hi>Philip</hi> was not distracted by his Distemper, but having heard him confirm it with many Oaths and Imprecations, expecting every moment to dye; Trouble and Grief succeeded his Wonder and Astonishment, and Jealousie and Rage follow'd after. He stayed some time to compose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and charg'd <hi>Philip, To let no other know of his Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>; telling him, <hi>if he dy'd he would revenge his Death, and if he liv'd, reward his Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Philip</hi> being young and lusty, Nature at last (by the help of powerful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,) or'ecame the Poyson, and he recover'd with the loss only of his Hair and Nails. The Duke in the mean time smother'd his Trouble all he could, from the piercing Eye of the Dutchess, and when <hi>Philip</hi> was recover'd carried him one day into her Chamber, and making all others but <hi>Mariana</hi> to quit the Room, caused him to Accuse her Face to Face.</p>
                     <p>The Dutchess seem'd not much mov'd, but took it as if the Duke had been in Jest with her, at which he grew so inraged, he flatly charg'd her with the Crime, calling her <hi>Impudent Strumpet,</hi> she appearing as Angry and High, peremptorily deny'd it, and told him, <hi>She would have satisfaction for so base an Abuse put upon her</hi>: She Vindicated her self from all that <hi>Philip</hi> had said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with so many Asseverations justify'd her Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that the Duke stood Amaz'd, not knowing which to Credit. The Subtle Lady perceiving the Duke's mind wavering, fell on her Knees and Crav'd Justice against that perjur'd Villain <hi>Philip</hi>; who now saw his own Folly and Danger, in Accusing the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess without any other Witness to corroborate his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The Duke was very much perplex'd with this matter, and knowing the Dutchess had not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally defiled his bed, but intentionally only, if that was true she was Accused of, and that probably <hi>Philip</hi>'s Impotency rather than his Vertue, or a due regard to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93450:128"/>
his Honour, had kept him Chast; by many good words endeavour'd to pacifie the Dutchess, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile her to <hi>Phillip,</hi> whom he still continued in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                     <p>However the Duke seem'd to dissemble the Trouble of his mind, <hi>Philip</hi> still standing firm in his Accusation, Jealousie began to prevail upon his Soul, and imbitter all his Thoughts: He grew Melancholy and Churlish, and she so proud and disdainful, that an apparent breach was made between them; she Curs'd her Marriage, and the time she forsook <hi>Birthold,</hi> the Kind and Loving <hi>Birthold.</hi> This <hi>Mariana</hi> took notice of, and acquainted <hi>Birthold</hi> with the Discontents of the Dutchess, who dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently by Letters address'd himself to her, from whom he receiv'd this Answer.</p>

Being taken and brought before her Husband and Father, the Earl would have run her thorough with his own hand, but was hindred by the Duke, who desired her punishment might be left to him, against whom she had more grievously of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, who resolved not to chastise her by death, but to give her a Life, tho' full of pain and misery, by which she might have time to Repent of her Crimes, and save her Soul.</p>
                     <p>The Duke sent away the Dutchess, and the dead Body of <hi>Birthold,</hi> with a strong Guard to his Castle at <hi>Blaford,</hi> and having finish'd the <hi>Campaign,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd the Country to Peace, return'd to <hi>Vlme</hi> with Honour and Victory.

In the mean time Captain <hi>Conrade</hi> (a Truce being made between the <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi>) return'd to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and from thence with the Emperours leave to his own Country, full of Glory and Renown, to visit his Friends and Relations, till the End of the Truce should call him again to Action.

He therefore privately and without any attendance, went over to <hi>Blaford,</hi> and staying at a house in a little Village near the Castle, sent a Messenger with a Note to his Brother to acquaint him he desir'd to see him, but without any Company for some reasons he should afterwards understand; <hi>Philip</hi> could not but wonder at the Secrecy and Caution that he us'd in his Visit; but however observ'd his directions and went immediately over to him. The Ceremony of their mutual respects bring over, <hi>Conrade</hi> conjur'd <hi>Philip</hi> to hearken to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and told him the passionate desire he had to see

The Duke began now to think afresh on the likeness of the Two Brothers, and how easily he might be deceived if they should agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that <hi>Conrade</hi> should be the Keeper of his Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess instead of the Eunuch <hi>Philip.</hi> He knew the Service that <hi>Conrade</hi> had done the Dutchess formerly, and some had told him that his Actions exprest more of Love than Civility: Evil men have Evil thoughts, and they measure other mens Actions by their own.

                        <hi>JVderina</hi> was born of poor and honest Parents, in a little Village near <hi>Roterdam,</hi> and being now arrived to Twelve Years of Age, was entertained by <hi>Emantha</hi> an Antient Lady and a VVidow, who was reputed very Rich, and for that reason was Courted by several Gentlemen, who more valued her for the Reputation of her Fortune, than they admired the ruins of her Beauty. Amongst others who made sute to the Widow, a Gentleman known by the name of Captain <hi>Grantz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> was one, who though he had no Assurance of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her, had yet more Encouragement than the rest, being always Civilly treated, and greatly respected. <hi>Iuderina</hi> who was a Person of a ready and subtle wit, soon learnt to Sing and Dance exactly, <hi>Emantha</hi> having preferr'd her to wait on her Daughter <hi>Editha,</hi> by whose favour, and the opportunities of her Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on her, she gain'd all the Accomplishments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting a Person of greater Quality: to all which, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture added a larger share of Beauty than is commonly seen in Maids of her mean Rank and Family. Captain <hi>Grantzford</hi> no sooner saw the fair <hi>Iuderina</hi> but he fell desperately in Love with her, and <hi>Iuderina</hi> was no less
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:93450:132"/>
pleas'd with the Captain's Courtship, which <hi>Emantha</hi> observing, he soon lost all hopes of obtaining the VViddow, however the satisfaction of enjoying his Lustful Pleasures with <hi>Iuderina,</hi> made some amends, which every day advanc'd by the seeming Compliance of the VVench.</p>
                     <p>At this time Young <hi>Walter</hi> her Son return'd from the University of <hi>Leyden,</hi> to Visit his Mother, and Sister <hi>Editha,</hi> whose presence very much obstructed the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proceedings of the Captain, who at first sight was deeply in Love with <hi>Iuderina</hi> (whose Charms were not to be resisted) and quickly let her know the power of her Eyes, and the Conquest she had made. This proud Beauty gloried in her New Victory, and was not a little glad to see her Young Master at her Feet, fetter'd with her Charming Graces, whom she preferr'd to his Rival <hi>Grantzford,</hi> and at last yielded to his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, who now Enjoyed at pleasure what the Captain's Evil Fortune still deny'd him.

The Captain soon grew sensible of the double defeat he had receiv'd, in obtaining the Widow, and enjoying her Maid, for which reason he determin'd to try his Fortune with <hi>Editha,</hi> by whose Courteous and obliging Respects, he might promise himself better success: But her Person was not so Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, either to Enkindle Love, or inflame his Breast with Lust, <hi>Iuderina</hi> was the only Amorous and Tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Object, but her Cruel Disdain had now forced him to Dispair.</p>

But yet she told her if she pleas'd to make an advantage of his Folly, she might both please her fancy and obtain him for a Husband if she would consent to put a Cheat upon him, which she might easily effect by her contrivance. <hi>Editha</hi> having heard the methods of her Design, approv'd them well, and desir'd her to put them in Practice upon the first Opportunity. The Plot being thus laid betwixt them, the cunning <hi>Iuderina</hi> seem'd to hearken more willingly to the Courtship of <hi>Grantzford,</hi> she accepts his Gold, seems to believe his Oaths and Promises, and at the last overcome with his Flateries to grant his Desires. There is nothing in the World so Joyful as the <hi>Captain</hi> really was at the Consent of <hi>Iuderina,</hi> the Content of his mind might be easily read in his Eyes, he kiss'd her a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times, and gave her as many Thanks for what he is not like to obtain.

                     <p>In a short time <hi>Iuderina's</hi> Beauty was fam'd, of which she knew how to make the best Advantage, and so well improv'd her Talent in those wicked Courses, that she had now considerably inrich'd her-self by prostituting her long lost Maiden-head, to seven or eight wealthy <hi>Dutch Cullies,</hi> who all swore, and really believ'd they had it, for which they roundly paid. Having thus advanc'd her Fortune, and being unwilling
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93450:134"/>
to Expose her self longer in a place so infamous, she privately withdrew, and took Lodgings between the Stadt-house and Exchange, where she chang'd her Name to <hi>Angelica,</hi> and pass'd for a vertuous young Lady, whose Brother was a Merchant and suddenly Expected from the Indies. Not long after it happen'd that a Gentleman of good Fortune, call'd <hi>Mine Heer Vandretch,</hi> had some short repartees with <hi>Angelica</hi> under her Viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard at the Play-house, who was so taken with her Wit, that he would not leave her till he had seen her Face, which appearing to him, beyond Expectation, handsome, he grew passionately in Love with her, and carried her home to her Lodging in his own Coach. <hi>Angelica</hi> had cunning enough not to be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with his first Offers of Kindness, nor alter'd with those rich and Noble presents he made her, which he wondring at, believed her Counterfeit Vertue was real, proposed a Cosiderable Settlement, a Stately House, Gilded Coach, and rich Liveries, if she would consent to live with him and be his Mistress, which she at last agreed to, rather out of passion and respect to his person, than that such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Offers had any power over her Chaste and Innocent mind. She now goes abroad in her Charriot, sits in the Boxes at Plays, with all the bravery and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Kept-Mistress, or more Notorious Strumpet.</p>
                     <p>Being one day at the Play-house, she was seen by Captain <hi>Grantzford</hi> (whom some business had brought to Town) who presently knew her, and much wondred to see that Beauty (which ever appear'd to him with a more than ordinary Lusture) now so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendent with Jewells, and all the dazling Embellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Art could invent. He could not but confess that she who before appear'd a twinkling Star of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was now become an illuminated Sun, Bright and Glorious. The <hi>Captain</hi> made his Complement to her, which she receiv'd with more favourable Expressions
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93450:135"/>
of respect to him, and in a Short time they became so intimate that he often visited her, where he was blest with those ravishing Delights he had so long Coveted in vain. This Amour of <hi>Grantzford</hi> with <hi>Angelica</hi> was at last suspected by <hi>Vandretch,</hi> who surpriz'd him at the botom of the Stairs, one Night as he had newly parted with <hi>Angelica,</hi> and with his Sword Ran him to the Heart, of which he immediately dy'd. <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretch</hi> sent for a Friend and acquainted him with his present misfortune, dispos'd the care of his House and Goods into his hands, disrobed <hi>Angelica</hi> of all her finery, turn'd her out of Doors and then made his Escape, but in his way to the <hi>Brill</hi> was unhappily drown'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Angelica</hi> having Sav'd a little money, put her self in a plain Country dress, remov'd to a remote place in the Town, where she took a Convenient Chamber and professed herself a Saint, going to all the private meetings she could hear of, where she Sigh'd, lifted up her Eyes, made Faces, was diligent at Lectures and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundings, so that in a little time she began to be taken notice of, and attracted the Eyes of many a young Zealot and Amorous <hi>Puritan.</hi> She changed her Name to <hi>Mabella,</hi> though <hi>Iuderina</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> the Hypocrite were the same in Heart and mind as <hi>Mabella</hi> the Saint. At length the Piety and Devotion of <hi>Mabella</hi> was taken Notice of, as well as her Modesty and Beauty, by <hi>Titus</hi> a <hi>Young Brother,</hi> a Linnen Draper, who was resolv'd not to Marry out of his own <hi>Tribe,</hi> and only wanted a Wife to make him Happy. She observ'd his Eyes to be often fixt upon her, and tho' he took Notes, and wrote in Characters none else could Read, he look'd as if he had been drawing her Picture, he was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon her. His Courtship was Sentences of <hi>Love</hi> and Cant intermix'd, and <hi>Cupid</hi> and <hi>Knox</hi> were joyn'd together: His Amorous Discourse was larded with fragments of Sermons, and Doctrines and Uses shuffled
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93450:135"/>
together, with Notes taken out of the <hi>Academy of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements.</hi> There was such a strange medly of Love and Religion, of Wooing and Praying, of pious Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and smutty Courtship, that <hi>Mabella</hi> could not but laugh in her sleeve, how gravely and demurely soever she look'd. <hi>Titus</hi> at last won the good will of his Dear <hi>Mabella,</hi> and what she much desir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Mabella</hi> had not been long married before she began to patch and deck her self with Ribons, and <hi>Titus</hi> to his great grief saw his Shop crowded with Gallants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Chap men, who came to Cheapen his Wife rather than Buy his Linnen; he first reprov'd her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty himself, and then desir'd the Pastor to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Lewd Carriage of his Wife, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: so that seeing himself undone, he resolv'd to shut up Shop and leave her to her Fortune. <hi>Mabella</hi> had yet scap'd the Pox, that Ruin and Confusion of so many of <hi>Venus</hi> her Votaries; but as many have Escaped being wounded in a Battel who have been kill'd in a Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, so far'd it with <hi>Mabella, Titus</hi> plainly perceiving his Horns grew as fast as his Estate wasted, was resolv'd to be first Reveng'd, and then leave her. To this end he designedly got a severe Clap, which he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Mabbella</hi> and then deserted her, carrying away all his Goods along with him to <hi>France. Mabella</hi> lay long Sick, and was twice Fluxed for her <hi>Foul Distemper</hi>; but wanting Money to carry on her Cure, was forced to consider of New Methods to relieve her presett Wants, before it was compleated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mabella</hi> was now again left to her shifts, her Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Clap, with the Apothecaries, Surgeons and Doctors Bills, had robb'd her of all that little she had left, whereupon she resolved to change her Counterfeit Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion, from that of <hi>Puritan</hi> to <hi>Quaker,</hi> and accordingly took a private Lodging at a <hi>Quaker</hi>'s
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93450:136"/>
House, who had known her Husband, and believ'd him to be as she represented him, a sly and debauched Fellow, pitty'd her very much, and by her discourse judg'd her to be very Innocent, and a Zealous Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor. To this <hi>Quaker</hi>'s House resorted several of that Sect, and amongst the rest, one <hi>Simon</hi> an itinerant Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Forth, who no sooner saw <hi>Mabella,</hi> who was pretty well recover'd of her Clap, her Colour coming fresh into her Cheeks, and her Old wanton Flame into her Eyes, but the <hi>Carnal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Man</hi> in him began to have a desperate Conflict. We are all Flesh and Blood, and the little god <hi>Cupid</hi> is no respecter of Sects; he spares no <hi>Mortal</hi> that is composed of those <hi>Atoms.

                     <p>IN <hi>Gothland,</hi> the best and richest Province of <hi>Sweed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is the hinthermost part of <hi>Scandia</hi> next to <hi>Denmark,</hi> stands the Famous and Impregnable Castle of <hi>Colmar,</hi> of which Count <hi>Wald-bourge</hi> was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in the Third Year of the Reign of that August and Victorious Prince, <hi>Gustavus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> At this time there were Bloody Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Two Crowns of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Moruffi</hi> Lieutenant General of the <hi>Danish</hi> Army, by the Command of the King, made a descent into <hi>Gothland</hi> with an Army of Thirty Thousand Horse and Foot, and having miserably ravag'd the Country, at last sate down before the Castle of <hi>Colmar,</hi> which he straitly Beseig'd. I shall say nothing of those many bold Assaults made by the <hi>Danes</hi> upon the place, nor the Stout resistance and Courage of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> brave and daring Actions were perform'd on both sides, the Soldiers at last growing very much distress'd for want of provisions, the Besieged made a desperate Salley, in which they had the good Fortune to take the Lord of <hi>Moruffi</hi> Prisoner, whom they brought into the Castle and presented to the Governour. The Count of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenzi</hi>
                        <pb n="267" facs="tcp:93450:137"/>
General of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces, receiving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ill Condition the Castle of <hi>Colmar</hi> was in, made a speedy March with his Army for the Releif of it, which the <hi>Danes</hi> having notice of, and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had lost their General the Lord <hi>Moruffi,</hi> on whose Courage and Conduct they very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, they immediately rais'd the Seige and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd.</p>
                     <p>The Virtuous and Beautiful <hi>Belanca</hi> upon the first Report that her Dear Lord was a Prisoner in the Castle of <hi>Colmar,</hi> was very much afflicted, but there being some overtures of a Truce then made between the Two Crowns, shee hop'd upon the Conclusion of it the Lord <hi>Moruffi</hi> would be discharg'd; but the Terms propos'd not being agreed to, the War was renew'd with greater Violence. Three months after a Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Arms was Consented to, for a short time, and <hi>Belanca</hi> attended with some few of her Servants, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtain'd a Pass-port from General <hi>Polenzi,</hi> took a Journey, full of hazard and danger, to the Castle of <hi>Colmar,</hi> to see her Beloved Lord and Husband. The Count of <hi>Waldbourge</hi> the Governour receiv'd her with all respect and kindness, who soon became an Earnest Suitor to him for the Release of <hi>Moruffi,</hi> offering all her Jewels and a very considerable Sum for his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, which the Governour told her he could not comply withal without direct and positive Orders from the King. <hi>Belanca</hi> told him that would be a matter of great difficulty to Effect, till a Peace was Concluded, which was very uncertain, but if he pleas'd he might suffer him to Escape, for which she would make him the same generous Present; the Governour answer'd that was so great a piece of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery to his Prince, that in Honour he could never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it. The Fidelity of this Noble Count which was not to be Corrupted by Gold, was soon Conquer'd by the more powerful Charms of <hi>Belanca</hi>'s Beauty, whose
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93450:138"/>
Vertue after he had long and in vain sollicited, he promis'd to free the Lord <hi>Moruffi</hi> his Prisoner, if she would Consent to his unchaste Desires, and upon no other Terms whatever: <hi>Belanca</hi> was very much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at his discourse, and told him, <hi>I wonder my Lord that you who have so great a Regard to your Honour</hi> (as you but now Exprest your self) <hi>can have so little Esteem for your own Vertue, or my Chastity. Belanca</hi> would have proceeded but the Count interrupted her, saying, <hi>Madam I expect not your Advice but Consent, if my Lord</hi> Moruffi <hi>is so dear to you, you know upon what Terms you may gain his Freedom, which if you do not readily Comply with, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all his designs of Escape, by a Closer Confinement. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanca</hi> desir'd leave till the next day to consider of it, and then promis'd to return her Answer, and having parted from the Count, acquainted her Husband with the Discourse which had pass'd between them, that she found the Count altogether inflexible, and unless she submitted to such dishonourable Terms should never be able to Obtain his Liberty upon any other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moruffi</hi> was very unwilling to purchase his Freedom with the loss of his Honour; but his Restraint growing now more irksome and tedious to him, by the daily hopes of Liberty, he at last Advis'd his Lady to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Count's demand, tho' they were rigid and severe, adding, <hi>That since she was now in his power, he might possibly force her Vertue to a Surender upon worser Terms. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanca,</hi> who was wholly at the Devotion of her Lord, whom she lov'd intirely, was with some regret at last prevail'd upon by his Argument, assuring him, <hi>That she could at the same Instant, with greater Satisfaction, Sacrifice her Life for his Ransom, than prostitute her Honour.</hi> The False Count having now Satiated himself with the full Enjoyment of his Lustful pleasures, left <hi>Belanca</hi> in his Chamber, telling her, <hi>he would now go and give present orders for the Lord</hi> Moruffi<hi>'s discharge, desireing her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

four of his Servants to go to the Lord <hi>Moruffi</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and bring his Head to him in that Embroyder'd Bag, which was accordingly done. The Count took the Bag in his own hands, and went to <hi>Belanca</hi>'s Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where she was with great Impatience expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Moruffi,</hi> and told her, <hi>Madam, take there your beloved Husband, Belanca</hi> not understanding his meaning, open'd the Bag, and there saw <hi>Moruffis</hi> Head fresh Bleeding, at which she Swoond away, and had not the diligent Attendance and Care of the Women, and the Excellent Vertues of the Cordials they gave her, forc'd her Soul unwillingly back to her hated body, she had immediately followed her Beloved Lord. Three days after the Count being acquainted that her passion was something abated, made a Visit to her, and by all the tender Expressions of Love and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, excusd the late bloody Act he had been Guilty of, that having once tasted those ravishing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, he not only resolvd never to part with her, but could endure no Rival, and that not his Cruelty to <hi>Moruffi,</hi> but his Love to <hi>Belanca</hi> was the Occasion of it. The Count at last won so much upon her, that she seemed wholly to forget <hi>Moruffi,</hi> and with pleasure and delight wanton'd in his Lustful Arms, till Three Months after, that Noble Prince <hi>Gustavus Adolphus</hi> being Encamp'd with his Army Ten Miles off, rode over to his Castle of <hi>Colmar,</hi> to whom <hi>Belanca</hi> on her Knees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated this horrible Cruelty of the Count to her Husband the Lord <hi>Moruffi,</hi> and Implor'd his Justice against him the King having understood the whole Intrigue of their Amours, ask'd her the next day what would Satisfie her for the loss she receiv'd in her Husband, and propos'd a Match with the Count which should compensate the Injury she receiv'd. <hi>Belanca</hi> accepted of the Kings proposal, and the Count was well pleas'd his Punishment was not more severe; whereupon they were Married in the Kings presence, who told

At last, upon the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Prayers and Presents, one of her Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men promis'd to bring him in the Night time, to her Ladies Lodgings, and so to dispose of him, that he should see her pull off her Cloaths before she went to Bed, walking in her Smock about the Chamber for Coolness, and Singing and Playing upon the Lute, which she did admirably well. <hi>Adrastus</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd with the thoughts of so great an happiness, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanca</hi> was very surprizing under the disadvantages of a Widows Habit, but would certainly be much more Beautiful, when she appear'd like a <hi>Naked Venus</hi>; Her great pretensions to Vertue and Modesty, laid so severe a Restraint upon her Conversation, That she rarely or never admitted any Gallant to a private Discourse; These Considerations rais'd <hi>Adrastus</hi> his Expectations to the highest degree of Pleasure and Contentment. Night being come, <hi>Adrastus</hi> by the direction of <hi>Clora, Belanca</hi>'s Woman, convey'd himself into her House, and was so conveniently plac'd, that he saw her sitting on a Couch, reading in a Prayer-Book whilst her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were undressing her. <hi>Belanca</hi> was ready to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Bed, when <hi>Clora</hi> entreated her Mistress to Sing, and put a Lute into her Hand, which she readily comply'd withal (it being her usual Custom, when she was not

At length he perceived her to go towards the Stable door, whither he at a distance follow'd her, and supposing she went to visit some Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that was Sick, wondred at the Excess of her Pious Charity.

When he with his scraggy Hand removing her Face from his own, with a hollow Voice, said to her, <hi>What would you have of me Madam? why will you not let me dye in quiet?

Take a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Take a Husband Madam, and Expect no more from me, who am more fit for the Cold Embraces of Death, than the Warm Pleasures of your Lustful Arms.</hi> Having so said, he slunk down into the Bed, and so suddenly, that <hi>Belanca</hi> could not get one word more from him, but return'd to her Chamber with a Countenance full of Sadness and Discontent, like a disconsolate Widow at the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of a Husband she dearly lov'd. <hi>Adrastus</hi> lay close in the Corner of the Stable till the Gate was open, and getting into the Streets return'd to his Lodgings with Wonder and Astonishment.

                        </gap>ly Sin is ally'd to Punishment, in several Tragical Examples of Murder and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; to deter us from the Commission of those Crimes which will render us as infamously miserable, as those poor Wretches were. And in this Second Part I shall endeavour to encourage Vertue by those Glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Successful Goodness, which have perfum'd the Memories of the Authors, and given Immortality to their Names, whose Bodies are long since crumbled into Dust, and their Ashes lost amongst the common Ruines of Mankind. I shall Contract my Discourse under these two Heads, <hi>Friendship</hi> and <hi>Chastity,</hi> as they do more directly oppose the precedent Crimes of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Adultery.</hi> And here I mean not that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which receives its Birth from any Effeminate Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Love and Desire; but that Exalted Friendship,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:93450:144"/>
whose Noble Extract is only derived from Vertue and Honour, which is of so pure a Temper, that none but Good Men are Capable of it. 'Tis a Misery indeed, that the Knowledge of such a Blessedness as a True Friend is, can hardly be without some sad Misfortune, for when we are Happy in the Spring-tide of Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and the Rising flood of Plenty, all Men flock about us with bare Heads, bended Knees, and protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tongues: But when these pleasing waters fall to an Ebb, then they look upon us at a distance, and stiffen themselves as if they were in Armour, lest (if they should comply with us) they get a wound in the Close. This has deterr'd some from taking part with an inauspicious Friendship, but by how much the more miserable, by so much are they the more certain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of a Generous Fidelity. For a Man to Expose his Life to the Hazard of a Duel in behalf of his Friend, may appear an Action of Honour and Gallantry; but in Cold Blood to present himself to an undoubted Death for a Friend, is a thing rarely seen, and Antiquity furnishes us with few Examples thereof, they tell us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias,</hi> and the Poets speak with Admiration touching <hi>Castor</hi> his sharing of Immortality with his Brother <hi>Pollux.</hi> But I shall here present you with a late memorable Example of a Generous Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship (out of the History of <hi>Poland</hi>) which preserv'd the Lives of both the Friends, who eagerly contended to Dye for each other, As follows:</p>

                     <p>What Furies of Jealousie did then invade the Breast of Impatient <hi>Potosti?</hi> then was the time, the Appetite of Vengeance seiz'd him, and that he intended to Cut his Rival in pieces, who to his disadvantage was thus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by his Mistress; upon which he commanded his Man to set upon <hi>Farnel,</hi> whilst <hi>Leoline</hi> and he wou'd Chastise the Insolence of <hi>Rabatski.</hi> At this they all three started out at once, and parting, ran to Assayl their Adversaries. <hi>Farnel</hi> soon laid the Servant at his Feet for dead and then ran to help <hi>Rabatski,</hi> who having set his Back to a Wall, by the advantage of a Shop,

warded the Blows and Thrusts which his Enemies made at him. <hi>Farnel</hi> came furiously up, and the first he met with at his Swords-point was <hi>Potosti,</hi> whom surprizing behind as he was eagerly passing at <hi>Rabatski,</hi> he ran his Sword into his Back up to the Hilt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he fell dead to the ground: <hi>Leoline</hi> receiv'd some slight wounds, but secur'd his Life by a speedy Flight. <hi>Farnel</hi> scap'd without any hurt, but <hi>Rabatski</hi> was in danger of his Life by the great effusion of Blood from his several Wounds. The People came out at the Noise of this Combat, and found <hi>Potosti</hi> stark dead on the stones, and his man some few steps from him, yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up the Ghost. <hi>Rabatski</hi> was conducted to a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's House, and a Surgeon sent for to dress his wounds but he swounded in such a manner that for a while they thought him dead, but by the force of Remedies they brought him to himself again, and after he was dress'd, laid him into Bed.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while <hi>Leoline</hi> acquainted <hi>Potosti</hi>'s Parents with the untimely Death of their Son, and related the matter to his own Advantage, telling them they were both treacherously assaulted by <hi>Rabatski</hi> and <hi>Farnel,</hi> which took such impression, that they believ'd all he said, and immediately acquainted the Officers of Justice with the Murther, who order'd that <hi>Rabatski</hi> and <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> should be Apprehended and cast into Prison<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Rabatski</hi> was seiz'd and dragg'd to Prison, without any respect to his weak Condition. <hi>Farnel</hi> made his Escape in hopes to prove his own Innocency and his Friends, by showing what they did was in their own Defence: But the Case went quite otherways than he expected, <hi>Potosti</hi>'s Friends and Relations had that Power and Authority in the City of <hi>Vilna,</hi> that in few days <hi>Rabatski</hi> was Arraign'd and Condemn'd to lose his Head.

                     <p>All the Company were struck with Admiration to see this Generous Act! and the People began to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, Crying out <hi>Pardon, Pardon,</hi> resolving to kill all that oppos'd them, rather than suffer the Execution to proceed any farther. This Tumult grew very great, But with difficulty was appeas'd by the Magistrate, who promis'd the Cause should be heard over again, and Judg'd according to Equity, upon which they grew quiet and the two Friends were led to Prison. The Palatine of <hi>Vilna</hi> heating of this Incomparable Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity of <hi>Farnel,</hi> went himself in Person to the Prison to visit these two Friends, who both contested before him who should dye for his Fellow.

Upon this <hi>Farnel</hi> pleaded the Cause for his own Death and the Safety of <hi>Rabatski,</hi> with all the powerful Arguments a less Generous Friend could have us'd for the preservation of his Life; urging, <hi>That if to save his Friend from Violence was a Crime so hainous, he alone deserv'd the Punishment. Nay, rather Glory, Honour and

                     <p>The Palatine was not pleased only with saving the Lives of these two Friends, but caus'd <hi>Rabatski</hi> to marry with <hi>Hilaria,</hi> and procur'd a Wife for <hi>Farnel,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman who was nearly Allyed to himself; intreating these two Friends to receive him as a Third into their Incomparable Friendship. This afterwards coming to the Ears of the King, in favour of the Palatine, they were both advanced to Honourable Employments. And Liv'd together many years after, happy in the fruition of a Reciprocal Affection, and intire Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, till time at length put a period to their days, and gave immortality to their Names, which still bear Record, as a Glorious Example to future Ages.</p>
                     <q>Thus we see a Sincere Friendship is the strictest Allyance, and most Noble Relation. <hi>Orestes</hi> is better known by his Friend <hi>Pylades,</hi> than by <hi>Agamemnon</hi> his Father.

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93450:148"/>
unfortuate in the Success. It seem'd strange to him that an Armed <hi>Venus</hi> should be found there enchac'd in the Arms of <hi>Mars</hi>; he passionately desir'd to know who these two Lovers were, that he might pay a suitable Honour to the Memory of their Courage and Fidelity. At length he was told, that a Soldier who was extreamly wounded, and had yielded himself Prisoner to a <hi>Burgundian</hi> Captain, had offer'd to satisfie him in the Truth of this Amorous and Warlike History.</p>
                     <p>The Prisoner being in that desperate Condition, the Surgeons thought it very unsafe for him to stir, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Marquess went to see him, accompanied with several of his Principal Officers, that he might learn from his own mouth the particulars of this strange Event.

                        <q>My Lord, I render Thanks to Heaven, which hath given me so much Life as I wish for, to yield in so Honourable Company the glorious Testimony which I owe to my Love, and to my Friendship, which done, I shall dye in peace; for I can no more live without Friendship, than move without a Soul, that indeed is my Soul, the Intelligence which actuates this Body, and gives Life and Vigour to all my Faculties.</q>

We liv'd in the same House, lay in the same Bed, had but one Purse, one Table, the same Servants, the same Liveries, the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93450:148"/>
same Retinue, and when any of our Servants were Ask'd unto whom they did belong, they answer'd to <hi>The Two Friends,</hi> if those that are but one, may be called Two. It happen'd once when we were at <hi>Melsignam,</hi> my Friend saw a fair Maid in Company, nam'd <hi>Yoland,</hi> whose Graces so surpriz'd his Heart, that all his Thoughts and Meditations were fix'd on this Beautiful Object. I presently judg'd he was stung with Love, and he acknowledg'd as much to me at first asking, for he conceal'd nothing from me. Truly said I, I am very glad you have address'd your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to a Gentlewoman with whom I have some Interest and Acquaintance, and who is at a distance ally'd to me, and by these Advantages I hope to make your access more easie to her. My Friend with Tears of Joy in his Eyes, told me it was the most grateful piece of Friendship I could offer to him, and earnestly begg'd of me that I would contrive some way that he might the next Evening be happy in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. This and all other good Offices I perform'd with that Success, that my Friend was now assur'd, that all his Respects to the Beautiful <hi>Yoland</hi> were answer'd with a reciprocal Passion.</q>

Raoul, Yoland's</hi> Father, was Married to <hi>Graciana</hi> her Step-Mother, upon condition that a Son of hers nam'd <hi>Hugolin,</hi> should marry this Gentlewoman, assoon as their Age made them capable of those Nuptial Ceremonies, which <hi>Raoul</hi> in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>Graciana's</hi> present Fortune (which was very great) had sacredly obliged himself to, without any respect to the content of his Daughter, who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly could never take pleasure in the Embraces of

him, that he lost both Judgment and Knowledge of himself; and though he was very Antient, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Afflicted with the Gout, yet would he needs inroll himself under the Standard of <hi>Cupid,</hi> where the Old and Impotent are never welcome; so great was the Folly and Dotage of this Decrepid Lord.</p>
                     <p>After he had made a weak Resistance to the Assault this Innocent Beauty made, he yields, resolving to Cure himself of this importunate Desire by Marriage; whereupon he went to <hi>Mordenni,</hi> the Father of this Beautiful Conqueress, and weeping like a Child, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented his Grief to him: <hi>Mordenni</hi> took pity of him, and counted it a great Honour that he should request to have his Daughter in Marriage; <hi>But my Lord</hi> (said he) <hi>you know she is Espoused to another, and this Promise cannot be broken but by the Consent of both Parties. I shall</hi> (reply'd the Lord <hi>Beltimore) deal so bountifully with</hi> Mellinto, <hi>that in obliging me he shall be the better for it as long as he lives, and I will so well provide for your Daughter, that both she and your whole Family shall be sensible of the good effects of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This News was carried by <hi>Mordenni</hi> to <hi>Mellinto,</hi> who (poor Gentleman) receiv'd it as the Sentence of his Death, and indeed to rend so strong a Love from his Heart, was no less than to tear his Soul from his Body. He could not Answer but with Tears, like a Stag that stands at <hi>Bay (Mordenni</hi> pressing him to it) he fell down in a Swoon, shewing thereby that he could not grant so hard a Request but by Death. Then went he to his Daughter to try her mind, who had no other Answer but Sighs and Sobs; at last, amongst many interruptions, he learn'd That her will was in the hands of <hi>Mellinto,</hi> and being Espoused to him, she had now no more power to dispose of her self. He then went back to <hi>Mellinto,</hi> who having with incredible Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of mind, digested the bitter Thoughts of the Ruin of his Love, which he saw so apparent, took at

last a Couragious Resolution and such a one as he might justly be blam'd for, if not rightly understood, <hi>Philosophers</hi> distinguish between Loves, and say the most perfect is that which tends most to the good of the Person belov'd, and that which is less perfect and respects the advantage of the Person loving, is not so properly call'd Love, as self-interest and design. In this <hi>Mellinto</hi> desir'd to show the perfection of his love to <hi>Valeria,</hi> by considering more her happiness and advancement, than his own content. Whereupon <hi>Mellinto</hi> told him, he would, though unwillingly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign his Title to the Lord <hi>Beltimore; Mordenni</hi> overjoy'd at this answer, tenderly embrac'd him, and mixing their Tears together, told him, he should be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblig'd to him, and wou'd ever account him as much the Raiser of his House and Family as the Lord <hi>Beltimore</hi> was. This news was presently carried by <hi>Mordenni</hi> to his Daughter, who was so incredulous, that she told him she would never believe it, till she heard it from <hi>Mellinto</hi>'s own mouth. Presently after <hi>Mellinto</hi> came in, with a dejected countenance, and eyes overflowing with tears, who could not endure to look <hi>Valeria</hi> in the face, who he thought wou'd upbraid him with disloyalty thus to forsake her, &amp; give her up to the embraces of another. After they had in some measure overcome the violence of their passions, <hi>Mellinto</hi> made it evidently appear to <hi>Valeria,</hi> that she was much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in accounting that for baseness of heart and disloyalty in him, which was the greatest act of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity</hi> his heart cou'd show, to renounce his own proper interest and satisfaction in favour of the person he so dearly lov'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Valeria</hi> cou'd not at first conceive this subtlety, her soul being so closely united to <hi>Mellinto</hi>'s, that she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd nothing but death cou'd part them.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:93450:153"/>
perfectly loving to part with me? I should not only have pefer'd you to a Lord, but a King, to the most potent Emperour on the Earth; for I esteem not men for their wealth or greatness, but for their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per merits. Dear <hi>Valeria</hi> (repli'd <hi>Mellinto</hi>) the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I bear you, works in me the same effect as death wou'd do, since it separates me from you: my vehement desire of your greatness, makes me deprive my self of the greatest contentment I cou'd have wish'd, and without which my life henceforward will be but a death: Live then Great, Honour'd, Happy, Rich, most Dear <hi>Valeria,</hi> and by marrying with <hi>Beltimore,</hi> become the Glory of thy Kindred, whilst I go miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poor, unhappy and forlorn <hi>Mellinto,</hi> spinning out the remainder of my sad days in melancholly Groves, and solitary Retirements. Much adoe had they to part these two Lovers from each others Armes: A heart as hard as Adamant, could not but have relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at so Tragical a scene of Sorrow.</p>
                     <p>The words of Betrothing being rendred back, the very next morning the Lord <hi>Beltimore</hi> made his visit to <hi>Valeria,</hi> vainly flattering himself, it was now no longer in the power of fate to blast, or cross his Amours; he promis'd to make her a Lady, &amp; settle his whole Estate upon her (having no Children,) and that the Writings should be seal'd before the Marriage was Consummated, which was appointed two days after. <hi>Beltimore</hi> gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously sent <hi>Mellinto</hi> a Bag with 2000.

you, so I cannot with Iastice to my self receive your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships present, which must make me a Debtor to you, more then ever I shall be able to repay. If your Lordship thinks my resigning <hi>Valeria</hi> to you, had a respect to my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, or your Satisfaction, you much mistake me, all my good wishes center in the fair <hi>Valeria,</hi> whom I endeavour to render as compleatly happy, as I make my self wretched and miserable. Upon no other Terms would I have parted with her, whom I value above the Treasure of both the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and was I that Potent Monarch, who sees the Sun both rise and set in his own Dominions, I would lay my Crown at your Feet to preserve <hi>Valeria</hi> in my Armes.</p>

                        <hi>Valeria</hi> was in presence when <hi>Beltimore</hi> receiv'd this Answer from <hi>Mellinto,</hi> which made so deep Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on her, that the next morning, which was design'd for the Wedding, she rose early, and attended only by her Maid, went over to <hi>Mellinto,</hi> and was privately married to him, of which, she immediately sent her Father an account. <hi>Modenni</hi> spar'd no words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his rage and fury, nor did <hi>Beltimore</hi> conceal his deep Resentments of the Affront done to his Person, and the disappointment to his longing Expectations. The Father utterly disown'd his Daughter, and would not admit of a Reconciliation, though they offer'd the most powerful reasons for what was done by the Intercession of Friends. <hi>Mellinto</hi> had but a very small Estate, which the Expences their Quality oblig'd them to soon Consum'd, nor would Cruel <hi>Mordenni</hi> relieve their distresses, though he daily heard of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: But these wants made no breach between this loving pair, who were constant in their affections, happy in the midst of poverty, and contented in the extremity of misery.</p>
                     <p>It unfortunately hapen'd, that <hi>Mellinto</hi> and <hi>Valeria</hi> walk'd out together one Evening, more to divert their
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:93450:154"/>
Melancholy thoughts, than any Pleasure they could take in viewing that single Acre which was all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their Land, on which fed their whole Herd of Cattle, two loving Mulls, the living Riches, and support of their Family. <hi>Mellinto</hi> upon some urgent occasion in their return staid behind, and <hi>Valeria</hi> went on to take her usual walk upon the Beach where she had the prospect of those Galleys which Row'd by; A <hi>Turkish</hi> Galley belonging to <hi>Algiers</hi> having just landed their Boat, immediately seiz'd all they met with on the <hi>Strand,</hi> and amongst others <hi>Valerea,</hi> who in sight of her Husband, was carried off to the Galley which lay hard by with <hi>Spanish</hi> Colours, this dreadful sight he saw, heard her Skreaks and outcries which peirced his Heart, but he was too far distant to make any attempt, tho his best endeavours would have prov'd fruitless, and unsucessful in her Rescue. He saw her gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond recovery, and tears and complaints were but in vain, when like a constant Friend, and loving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he plung'd himself into the Sea, and swam up to the Galley where he was taken up and brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Captain, who told him, he was come to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Wife, and neither fear'd their Cruelty nor beg'd their Pitty, that freedom without her Company was a more miserable slavery to him, then they endured who tug'd at the Oar. The <hi>Turks</hi> very much admir'd his Transcendent Love and Courage, for they had seen some of his Country Men rather choose death than endure a life so Severe and Cruel.</p>
                     <p>Amongst some others that he knew a Board, there was a Young Gentleman nam'd <hi>Placento,</hi> about 22 Years of Age, whose Father was next neighbour to <hi>Mellinto, Placento</hi> lying chain'd to his Oar as the rest were, was not able to endure the <hi>Turkish</hi> Cruelty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

slave for the sake of his Wife, and would scorn that Ransom which did not first purchase her liberty before his own, much less would he run the hazard and danger of his project, and then leave her behind to their merciless fury and revenge. However <hi>Placento</hi> proceeded, and was happy in the success, which he effected in this manner, he had observed that the utmost liberty they had, was no further then their Chain gave 'em leave, which reach'd to the end of the Bench, where there was a large hole for the necessity of nature. <hi>Placento</hi> having prepared his Chains to come off upon easie Terms, goes to the Hole one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Slaves were all asleep, and only the Sentinells awake upon the fore or hindeck, who mistrusted nothing. <hi>Placento</hi> first pul'd off his Coat, which he underprop'd with two sticks, and then got off his Fetters, (his legs being so fallen away since his being a Slave, that they grew too small for his shackles) and committing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Sea, landed safe upon an Island not far off, but though his Person was gone, his Coat was severely threatned with Bastinado<hi>'s</hi> before his real escape was discovered.</p>
                     <p>At their return to <hi>Tunis,</hi> the Captain of the Galley acquainted the King with the whole account of their surprizing <hi>Valeria</hi> walking on the Beach, and how her Husband <hi>Mellinto</hi> swam after in Love to his Wife, and made himself a Voluntary Slave, rather than be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of her Company. The King was much mov'd with the Relation of so faithful &amp; constant a Love, and within three days gave them both their Freedom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the interim, the Lord <hi>Beltimore</hi> having receiv'd intelligence by some of the Neighbours of this sad Misfortune of <hi>Mellinto</hi> and <hi>Valeria,</hi> in respect of their great fidelity,

(like a Noble Gentleman, had taken Care for their Ransom,) but dying before he could have any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Arrival at <hi>Tunis,</hi> bequeath'd his whole Estate to <hi>Valeria,</hi> and left it in trust with her Father, who upon their return to <hi>Brurdusium,</hi> enjoy'd it, and liv'd out the rest of their days in a pompous plenty, and happy Tranquillity.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AT <hi>Breslaw,</hi> Chief City in the Dukedom of <hi>Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> a Province of <hi>Germany,</hi> lived two Citizens of good quality, who lov'd each other entirely; the one was <hi>Teudas</hi> a Goldsmith, and the other <hi>Venon</hi> a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, <hi>Venon</hi> being gone to <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Austria,</hi> to buy some Commodities, staid three Months in his Voyage: and at his return, found himself welcom'd with two disasters, <hi>viz</hi>: The loss of his Wife whom he dearly
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93450:155"/>
loved, and the misfortune of his Friend, who was cast into Prison, and past hope of ever getting out; it was not any disorder, but rather his goodness which had reduced him to this deplorable Estate, for being bound in a great sum of Mony for one of his Friends, who prov'd insolvent, he was condemn'd to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it himself, whereupon all that he was worth being sold, his body was attach'd and clapt up into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for the remainder.</p>
                     <p>In this place, which may very well be call'd the Center of Misery, and the Tomb of the living, <hi>Venon</hi> came to see him, who grievously complain'd of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, accus'd her of Injustice, for reducing him to that miserable Estate for well doing; But that which most troubl'd him, was that he lost the means to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his only Daughter, (her Age now requiring it) fearing necessity should bring her into some vain and lewd course of life. <hi>Venon</hi> stood not to comfort him with many words, but came to promises which he soon confirm'd by effects. He told him that his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery was a mark of his Vertue, against whom Fortune had sworn a pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I am so far pleas'd with your misfortune (said <hi>Venon,</hi>) as it gives me the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of showing the sincerity of my affection to you in this necessity, and that I am truly your Friend: As for your Daughter, let not that trouble you, seeing I have lost my Wife, I am contented to take her for my second, if you will; but if her Affections are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise disposed of, I have wherewithal to give her a good Portion.</p>

                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:93450:156"/>What unexpected Consolation was this to the heart of <hi>Teudas,</hi> to hear these speeches from his Friend, whose words he knew were as true as they were free. He would have used some Complements to him, but the greatness of the benefit going beyond his Thoughts, Words and Thanks vanished in his Mouth. No says <hi>Venon,</hi> (who judg'd of his Interiour Thoughts, by the Exteriour alteration of his Countenance,) we need not give thanks for that which is our own, If I am yours, much more are all my goods yours; and either you had no need of them, or else it was your own fault, you did not dispose of them at your pleasure before, without any longer discourse, he went presently home, and fetch money, and paid the sum <hi>Teudas</hi> was detain'd for, upon which he was presently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, <hi>Venon</hi> married <hi>Ermige</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Teudas,</hi> who notwithstanding the great desparity of their Years, lov'd him affectionately, not only as a Husband, but a second Father, and esteem'd her self happy, to be a Recompence to him who had with so much good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and liberality, releas'd her Father out of Prison. Of so Amorous an Union of these two Hearts and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>Rosana</hi> was the fair product, a Creature destind to love honourably, and generously, and was but two Months old, when her Grandfather <hi>Teudas</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with sorrow and grief for the loss of his Estate, left this life to enjoy a better. Her Father <hi>Venon</hi> (who had much weakened his Fortunes in delivering his dear Friend out of Prison,) daily felt necessity approaching, but Heaven which guards the just, and will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer such noble Acts of Friendship to go unrewarded, provided for him beyond all hope and expectation: <hi>Venons</hi> grief was much like that <hi>Teudas</hi> felt in Prison, seeing himself old, he much feard he should not leave his Wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherewithal honestly to maintain her self, and bring up, and match his Daughter. But Comfort thy

self O <hi>Venon</hi> with good <hi>Tobias,</hi> and be assur'd, that though poverty overtake thee, yet thou shalt have means sufficient; hope with <hi>Iob</hi> and thou shalt have all things restor'd to the double.</p>
                     <p>The Dutchess of <hi>Signits</hi> of a Noble House in <hi>Silesia</hi> reckon'd in the Rank of Princes being ready to cry out, a Nurse was sought for to give suck to the Child she expected; and <hi>Ermige</hi> was chosen to be one of the best that could be found in all <hi>Breslaw</hi>; this came in good time to preserve this poor Family from necesity, which daily encreased upon them. The Dutchess was delivered of a Son, whose name was <hi>Sapor,</hi> who was delivered to <hi>Ermige</hi> to Nurse, and <hi>Rosana</hi> put to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Ermige</hi> and her Husband were now both made part of the Dukes Household, and when time came, that <hi>Rosana</hi> was weaned and of some stature, she was put to rock the Prince, and find him sport, as the manner of Children is, thus grew <hi>Rosana</hi> gently like a Vine by its Elme Tree. <hi>Sapor</hi> was not above three or four Years old when <hi>Venon</hi> died, leaving both his Wife and Daughter to the Dutchess, who look'd for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fortune but what proceeded from her Bounty. The little Prince affected his Nurse and <hi>Rosana</hi> in such a manner, that although he was wean'd, yet they both tended him and waited on him.</p>
                     <p>Although it is a grand Error to say that the Parents beget the Souls as well as the Bodies; yet since the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesition of the Temperature, and of the Organs, through which the Spirit exerciseth it Functions hath great effect in regard of the firm Union of Soul and Body; It is no great wonder if that <hi>Rosana</hi> sprung from Parents, whose Inclinations were wholly to Friendship, was naturally her self addicted to the same passion; which she discover'd in that Love and Affection her more early Years constantly express'd to <hi>Sapor. Rosana</hi> lov'd <hi>Sapor</hi> in her infancy, with such an extrraordinary fervour, that as soon as she lost the sight of him, she
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93450:157"/>
did nothing but weep and complain; never was there seen in so tender Years so strong a passion, all the World wondered at it, and the Duke and Dutchess took incomperable pleasure in it. It was a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible but that <hi>Sapor</hi> should love this little Creature, which so much affected him, for to love is the most powerful Charm whereby to make our selves belov'd of others: He cou'd not be without her, and if at any time she chanc'd to be away, there was nothing cou'd make him merry. The Dutchess seeing the humour of this little Girle, caus'd her (for Recreation only,) to be cloath'd like a little Page, a habit which pleas'd her so well, that she never put it off, but with Tears. In their first Infancy which Unites the Tongue, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ceremony call'd Brother and Sister, every one wondered at the Courage and Boldness of this little Girle, when she grew bigger, she call'd the Prince her Master, and he call'd her his Page. All the Exercises which the Master learned, the Page did learn, and what is more to be admir'd, with such a Grace, that she seem'd for a Mirrour or Example to her little Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, as Physick is given to the Nurse, that so through her milk the Child may be cur'd, so was it with <hi>Sapor,</hi> for when they were to give him any lesson either of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Dancing, or any thing else, they first taught it to his Page, she learn'd the faster to please him, and he took the greater Care that he might not be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stript by a Girle, an Emulation of Vertue without Envy.</p>
                     <p>They being now grown up from the Innocency of their first Age, they entred into the limits of Civility, and the Cerimonies of the World. She was always much affected with all bodily Exercises, as Leaping, Vaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Riding, Fencing, and whatever was manly and the proper accomplishment of a Cavaleer; The Prince still calling for her, not only when he was at any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, but at all other times when she was absent. At
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93450:157"/>
last her Age permitting her no longer with decency and modesty so freely to frequent with <hi>Sapor,</hi> the Dutchess plac'd her among the other Gentlewomen, where upon all occasions she still payed that diligent observance to the Prince as sufficiently witnessed the Ardour of her Affection: And the Prince on his part bore with no less Impatience the privation of his Pages Company, it was his greatest contentment, when he could steal in amongst the Gentlewomen, thereby to entertain her who wholy possessed his thoughts.</p>
                     <p>Lewd desires entring into his heart with knowledg poyson'd his Love with sensuality, which he for some time dissembled, but not being able longer to bear the Impetuosity of his desires, he offer'd these Indecencies to her which could neither consist with his Honour or her unspotted Honesty, from whom he received this discreet Answer.
<q>Remember <hi>O Prince</hi> that poor as I am, and destitute of Fortunes Favours, I am Rich in Honesty, which if you once offer to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine, you ruin my Vertue the most Establish'd Foundation of my Life, but as I love my Honour more then my Life, so I love it also more than <hi>Sapor.</hi> If you truly love me as you have given me many signal Testimonies of it, love me honourably, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I freely renounce your Friendship, and all the happy advantages thereby. I love you without Interest, and without any other desire than to see you Great and Glorious in the World, and in the Arms of a Princess worthy to be the Spouse of so Noble a Prince, and she will I wait upon with all the humility and affection of a faithful slave, who will seek no other Reward but the Glory of serving You. If Fortune should so frown that you dye in deeds of Arms I will perish at your Feet, that on my Grave may be mixt the Lilies of my Chastity with the Palms of your Valour, and the Mirtles of my Incomparable Love to so dear a Master.</q>
Whoever

hath seen a strong North Wind sweeping away on a suddain all the Clouds which obscured the Face of Heaven, hath seen the effects these genorous words utter'd with so good a grace, immediatly wrought in <hi>Sapor,</hi> the flame of his Love was now pure, the heat moderate without blackness or smoke.</p>
                     <p>The Duke his Father being dead, and he the next Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Successor of that House entred into the Honours his Birth called him to. Amongst many Gentlemen, his followers, he had a particular favour for <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> a younger Brother and a Gentleman well descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; <hi>Sapor</hi> desirous to advance this Gentleman thought he could not more befriend him than in giving him for his Wife her whom he affected as his Sister, and her whom he could have wish'd himself, if the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of his Birth had not obliged him, by reason of State, to seek a Match more suitable to his Quality. The Prince first acquainted <hi>Numerian</hi> with his design, who received it with all the humble and dutiful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments for so great an Honour, and next <hi>Rosana</hi> who Answer'd him with her accustomed Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity, <hi>Master</hi> (said She) <hi>will it not be a Treason to give this Body to a Man who shall not possess the Heart, being so fill'd with the honest love it bears you, that there is no place void for any other Subject: Permit me (My dear Prince) to die a Virgin, with the glory of a Vestal, who hath not let her fire go out.</hi> The Prince was infinitely pleas'd with her discourse which at that time lasted long, still closing every Period with some expression of a love to him as sincere and innocent. The next day the Prince ordered <hi>Rosana</hi> to come to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Afternoon where she should meet <hi>Numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> whom she no sooner saw but with a Manly and Generous behaviour, which was both natural and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual with her, spoke to him in these words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Sir, Here is your Master and mine, who hath a desire to joyn us together in the Rites of Hymen:
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:93450:158"/>
but before I embrace this proffer, and be subject to your power, I must propound two Conditions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which I cannot, nor will not be perswaded to take you for my Husband: My Body shall be thine, and so entirely thine, that never any but thy self shall have part therein. I shall come a Virgin to thy Bed, and if it be so that I must loose the flower of that Integrity (which I did intend to preserve all my life time,) yet it shall Perish at last with Honour in lawful Wedlock. First, then thou shalt not need to watch over my fidelity, of which I shall be more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant than thou canst, and if it shall be my hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to outlive thee, I will be just even to thine Ashes and keep a body pure, and a Troth inviolable. I will Love thee as my Husband withal my Heart, but to prevent future Jealousies, know this, that I will love <hi>Sapor</hi> as my dear Prince, and dear Master, but Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine not him to have any part thereby, in any thing that shall appertain to thee, he hath no such thought, and if he had, he should find his expectations fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; and if thou dost think this Friendship which is so pure, honest, just and lawful, should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Loyalty I owe to thee; I do now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce to thy love and allyance, for I am resolv'd to carry to my grave this first &amp; glorious flame. The other Condition is, that thou permit me to exercise my self in Arms, in Hunting, and other like Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, and if thy Courage calls thee at any time to War, either of thy own accord, or with our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that thou permit me to be partaker of thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and thy hazards as I desire to be of thy Lawrels, and thy Palms. On these Conditions I am ready to obey, and follow thee in life or death.</q>

                        <hi>Numerian</hi> no less Ravish'd at the Spirit and Courage of this Maid, than with her Beauty, agreed to all she desir'd; and the Young Duke Honoured the Marriage with such Pomp and Magnificence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he could not

have expended more liberally at the Marriage of his own Sister. Thus they passed some Years Rich in Wealth and Children, when the Wars of <hi>Hungary</hi> a Kingdom bordering on <hi>Silesia,</hi> came to disturb this Calm.

The Earl surprised at the News, little suspected the villanous design of <hi>Romindus,</hi> neither did he believe the message to be other than real, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took Horse with some few Servants, and with all speed posted away to Court. <hi>Romindus</hi> (then but one mile distant from the Abbey where <hi>Samina</hi> was left to the charge of some Gentlemen) soon receiv'd the news of my Lords departure for Court, and in the dusk of the evening set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Fire being now extreme vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, gave them reason to fear the ruine of the Abbey, which made them all very busie and laborious to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish it, which could not be done without much noise and clamour. This pleas'd <hi>Romindus</hi> well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their tumult drown'd the cries of <hi>Samina,</hi> whom he had wounded in several places, (though not mortally)

imagining that the sence of torture might move her to admit of his Embraces; but all was without effect, for with how much the greater violence and severity he us'd her, with so much the greater constancy and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity of spirit she renounced him. After a great relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy, recovering a Dagger from his hand, she said, <hi>You base and ignominious wretch, dost think that Heaven cannot free me from thy lewd Embraces? Yes; thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus</hi> (stabbing her self) <hi>I set my self at liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Honour far outweighs my Life, and my blood shall cool the fire that burns within thee:</hi> and thus speaking dy'd.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus the Virtue of</hi> Samina <hi>was most conspicuous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendant in her greatest extremity, who rather chose the chast Embraces of a cold Grave, than the hot polluted Arms of lustful</hi> Romindus.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Chast <hi>Imbrigis</hi> is contracted to <hi>Sueno,</hi> but by the compulsion of her Father is married to <hi>Helga,</hi> a rich old man. The Baron of <hi>Fobroch</hi> afterwards falls in love with her, and bribes her Husband that he might make an attempt upon her Chastity. <hi>Imbrigis</hi> kills the Baron who went about to ravish her, and stabs her self: She recovers, and marries <hi>Sueno</hi> after the Death of her Husband.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the Reign of <hi>Christiern</hi> the fourth, King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> liv'd in <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> chief City of that Kingdom, seated in the Isle of <hi>Zealand,</hi> and usual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence of its Kings, a rich old Burgher, who had two Daughters, the elder named <hi>Helda,</hi> the younger <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brigis,</hi> both very beautiful Ladies, though of so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent inclinations, that it seem'd a Prodigy for one Womb to produce such different fruits. <hi>Helda</hi> was as lustful as she was fair, placing her greatest pleasure abroad and in company: <hi>Imbrigis</hi> as chast as beautiful, and most delighted at home in the contemplation of Virtue, and enjoyment of a solitary retirement.</p>
                     <p>These two different Beauties being ripe for Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, were both severally courted; but the excellent Beauty and Virtues of <hi>Imbrigis</hi> had more attractions than the Face and Riches of <hi>Helda</hi>; however the Father resolv'd to marry the Elder first, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly disposed of her to <hi>Ericus,</hi> a Gentleman of great Estate, who had some little kindness for <hi>Helda,</hi> but more for her Dower; and she more regard to his rich Possessions and Lordships, than his Person: however the Match was concluded, and the Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated; but true love appeared not at this <hi>Hymen,</hi>
                        <pb n="323" facs="tcp:93450:166"/>
neither would the Blessing of Heaven attend upon such Marriages: they both liv'd together in Adultery, spending the remainder of their days in Discord and Infamy.</p>
                     <p>And now the old Burgher having disposed of his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and most beloved Daughter, he began to think of a match for the youngest, in which he resolv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult more his own judgment and convenience, than his Daughters affection and liking. He had bestowed so large a Portion on his beloved <hi>Helda,</hi> that he much streightned the Fortune of <hi>Imbrigis,</hi> and could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any great and rich Husband for her, unless such a one should be extraordinarily smitten with Love, or some great disparity in their years; however the Virtues and excellent Graces of <hi>Imbrigis</hi> had rendred her desirable to several persons of a sutable condition, but none were so agreeable to the humour of the old Burgher as to obtain his approbation, till Fortune and blind Love brought one as unsuitable to the Youth of the Daughter, as he was acceptable to the covetous mind of the Father.</p>
                     <p>An ancient grave Doctor named <hi>Helga,</hi> a Widower, and one of the Heads of the Colledge of <hi>Sora</hi> in that Island, being sent by the University to Court, the Wheel of his Coach broke as he passed by the door of the old Burgher, who (being in his Porch) invited the Doctor into his house whil'st the Coach was making fit, which <hi>Helga</hi> readily accepted, and there first saw the lovely and virtuous <hi>Imbrigis,</hi> whose Wit and Beauty had such powerful Charms over him, that notwithstanding the Snow which covered his head, and the chilness of sixty Winters that had benumm'd his flesh, he found the Ice which the Frost of Age had congealed about his heart begin to melt, and all the fiery passions of a youthful Lover play in his breast, which he strove to lay with Stoical Maxims and prudent Morals; but all proved weak and defenceless against the more powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:93450:167"/>
of Love; he finds his youthful thoughts to spring up anew, and the Image of the beautiful and modest <hi>Imbrigis</hi> never from his sight, which makes him renew his visits, till by daily converse his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ames in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, he was forc'd to declare to her Father his passion, and the desire he has of making her his Wife, who readily embraced his motion, and commanded his Daughter to entertain him as her Lover.</p>
                     <p>And now this grave Doctor is become a Child a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ridiculously acting over at three-score all the follies of a youthful Lover: He makes court to this young Virgin of nineteen, plays with her Hands, looks old Babies in her Eyes, discourses to her of Love, Fire, and Flame, and makes Verses and Sonnets in praise of her Wit and Beauty. But whil'st he thus plays the Lover and Gallant, she seems to act the Stoick and Philosopher, by representing to him the evil ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which such unequal Marriages might produce, tells him his flame will soon vanish and decay, and that his Love is but an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> a wandring and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous fire, that will lead him at last into a thousand inconveniences, and precipitate him into the Pit of Jealousie; that though she should be never so vigilant and circumspect over her actions, his Age and her Youth would give grounds for the world to asperse her Honour, though never so white and innocent; that she could not have any passion for him, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Love Marriage would be a double Yoke and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Burthen. But <hi>Helga</hi> was deaf to these speeches, to the great grief of the modest and virtuous <hi>Imbrigis,</hi> who had a God to wrestle with that made fools of wise men, and Children of Philosophers; a God that had enkindled a more bright and Coelestial flame in her breast, than in the heart of the grave Doctor, which made his Deformity apparent, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of her Father more terrible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="325" facs="tcp:93450:167"/>Amongst the many Conquests which her Beauty &amp; Virtue had obtain'd, and that seemed to stand first in her esteem and favour of the number of those who made their Addresses and Courtship to her, was <hi>Sueno,</hi> a young Gentleman of a comely Personage, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly descended, though a younger Brother, and of mean Fortune, (being at that time an Ensign in the Castle of <hi>Cronnembergh</hi>) yet in regard of the constant and sincere love he bore to the chast and virtuous <hi>Imbrigis,</hi> had the happiness to be at last blest with a reciprocal and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affection from her, and so far prevailed upon her as to gain her consent to the uniting of their hearts in sacred Matrimony so soon as her Fathers approbation should be obtained. But they both sollicited the old Burgher in vain, for he would by no means hear the suit of a needy Souldier, but more eagerly prest for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the match with old <hi>Helga</hi> his Rival, whom For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and blind Love had now brought to interrupt his Amours. All this the prudent <hi>Imbrigis</hi> was sensible of, neither was she ignorant of the covetous inclinations of her Father; she therefore discreetly began to lessen the hopes of <hi>Sueno,</hi> doubting her Duty and Obedience must take place of Love, for she was inform'd by her Father that he had concluded the match with <hi>Helga,</hi> that her Portion and Jointure was settled, and the day prefix'd for the solemnization of their Nuptials, who commanded her to prepare for the Wedding. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she was resolved first to take her farewell and last meeting of her beloved <hi>Sueno,</hi> which she performed the night before her Marriage. What passed betwixt these two Lovers was very moving and tender, and poor <hi>Sueno</hi> receiv'd her last farewell with as great emotion of Spirit as a condemned Criminal his Sentence of Death; however he was persuaded to preserve that Life which was not unpleasing to her.</p>
                     <p>After the celebration of their Nuptials, <hi>Helga</hi> returns to <hi>Sora,</hi> and carries with him his beautiful and chast
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:93450:168"/>
Wife, who would have been priz'd as a greater Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by any other person than the covetous Miser, whose short-liv'd flame was too violent to continue: His Age at length declares him impotent, yet the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>Imbrigis</hi> was most delighted when she could contrive any thing to the content and pleasure of her Husband, and declared she should enjoy more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with him (since they were espoused) at a slender entertainment, than to swim in the most luxurious Plenty of a Seraglio.</p>
                     <p>And now I shall proceed to shew you the many try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and temptations she resisted by her Heroick actions, which made bright her Virtues, and illuminated her Glory.</p>
                     <p>Her former Lover <hi>Sueno</hi> (by the death of his elder Brother) is become Lord of a plentiful Estate at <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semore,</hi> where he now resides, refusing many rich Matches and beautiful Ladies, whose Charms could not deface the Image he bore in his mind of the virtuous and chast <hi>Imbrigis,</hi> whom he esteemed as a Jewel of greater worth than all his Lands and rich Possessions. And now he rides over to <hi>Sora,</hi> to enjoy a sight of this beautiful Image which so frequently represented it self before him, and to inform her both of his good fortune, and firm resolution of living only for her, still hoping that the declining Winter of Age will at last give place to the spring of Youth, and that he shall be made happy in the possession of his Love: But his journey was in vain, for all his Artifices and Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems to speak with his beloved <hi>Imbrigis</hi> were defeated; she would neither be seen nor spoke to by him, as doubting that the former sparks of her affection might re-kindle at his sight. He returned therefore to <hi>Helse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> but before his departure made shift to get this following Letter conveyed into her hands.</p>

                        <hi>Imbrigis</hi> is well pleas'd with the departure of her beloved <hi>Sueno,</hi> as hoping now to enjoy an undisturbed repose; But, alas! her hopes are vain, she must yet undergo a harder task, her Chastity must yet shine brighter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by resisting the assaults and batteries made upon her Virtue; she has hitherto only encounter'd with a virtuous and chast Love in <hi>Sueno,</hi> who is rather a Son of <hi>Urania,</hi> than <hi>Venus</hi>: but now she will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the fury of one sully'd with impurity.</p>
                     <p>The Baron of <hi>Fobrock,</hi> who liv'd in a very stately Palace not far distant from <hi>Sora,</hi> (a person very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent at Court, and in great favour with the King,) having several times seen the virtuous <hi>Imbrigis</hi> at Church, was more attentive upon her Beauty, than

                     <p>Greatness begets respect, and commands an entrance into almost all places; the doors of <hi>Helga,</hi> which were shut to almost all the world, were opened to <hi>Fobroch,</hi> and <hi>Helga</hi> thought himself honour'd by the visits of the Baron, whom he entertains with freedom and joy, hoping by the favour and friendship of this Nobleman and Courtier to obtain great advancement. It was not long e're the lustful Baron acquainted the cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he was much surpriz'd to meet with such stout resistance from the virtuous <hi>Imbrigis,</hi> who receiv'd his Courtships and Addresses with disdain, refused his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, and avoided his Company as a Pestilence, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he takes a review of this impregnable Fort, but finds no other access than by the covetous and sordid humour of <hi>Helga</hi>: He therefore feeds him with hopes of great Preferment, and finding him a great lover of Play, (whil'st on the winning side) he designedly, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came to visit <hi>Helga,</hi> lost ten or twenty Crown-pieces of Gold, which so much rejoyced the heart of the old man, that the sight of this Lord was as desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him as an Angel, and <hi>Imbrigis</hi> sollicited him in vain not to entertain the Baron so often, intreating him to let her retire to her Fathers, or some other place in the Countrey, whil'st the Baron continued in those parts, lest his frequent visits might blemish her Honour, and blast her Reputation: But perceiving him instead
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:93450:170"/>

But the sweetness of winning the Barons Gold took away the bitterness of Jealousie, And the virtuous <hi>Imbrigis</hi> seeing that <hi>Helga</hi> knew not how to guard her Honour, was the more circumspect her self: She therefore (whenever <hi>Fobrock</hi> came to the house) immediately lock'd her self up in her Chamber, or went to a Neighbours house, and neither the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of the Baron, or commands of her Husband, could obtain her presence.</p>
                     <p>But the Baron finding the effects which Gold had over old <hi>Helga</hi>'s heart, and that 'twas rather his Wifes Chastity and Prudence than his Jealousie, put a stop to, and obstructed his sight of that beautiful Object, he resolves to bribe the covetous old man, and so pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the dishonour of his Wife; in order to which, he invites <hi>Helga</hi> over to his own Palace, and (his Lady being gone to the <hi>Spaw</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> for the recovering of her health) there they diverted themselves with Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles as they us'd to do, when the Baron having one day drawn aside this old Dotard from all Company, he carries him into a Chamber, where on several Tables he had laid one by one 20000 pieces of Gold, most of them Crown-pieces, and having fastned the door <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           <hi>Jacob Van Zwerts,</hi> after many signal proofs of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, takes shipping for <hi>Spain,</hi> but in his Voyage is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Prisoner by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and sold to <hi>Ali Pigget,</hi> a <hi>Turkish</hi> Merchant, whose Sister falling in love with <hi>Jacob,</hi> sollicits him to Debauchery, and upon his refusal of her lewd Embraces, accuseth him of a Rape: <hi>Ali Pigget</hi> being sensible of her Treachery, first stabs her, then gives <hi>Van Zwerts</hi> his liberty, who soon after his arrival at <hi>Spain</hi> is married to the virtuous and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Marinda,</hi> who by a notable Stratagem preserved her Chastity.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOt many years since at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> a Port-Town in <hi>Holland,</hi> one of the United Provinces belonging to the States, lived <hi>Iacob Van Zwerts,</hi> second Son to the <hi>Heer Van Zwerts,</hi> a very wealthy and creditable Merchant, of ancient and reputable Extraction. <hi>Iacob Van Zwerts</hi> (whose Virtue and Chastity was as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable as any left upon the Records of Time) being weary of the Debaucheries of that City, to which he was often and frequently sollicited by some extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Youths of his former acquaintance, did by the next opportunity resolve for <hi>Spain,</hi> whither he might retire with an intimate acquaintance of his Fathers, and reap the peaceable enjoyment of himself and his Virtue. While his Father was weighing the consequence of this design, the unpleasant News had reach'd the ears of the roaring Debauchees his late Companions, who having let loose the Reins of Sobriety and Virtue, had plung'd themselves into the greatest Exorbitancy, and therefore nothing could be more unwelcom than the desertion of one of their beloved associates, on
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:93450:172"/>
whom (as he was rich) they had some flattering hopes of dependance, and therefore were resolved, if possible, to convert him to themselves; to which end they sent for him in the names of some later Friends, (of whom he was less shie) to drink with him at the <hi>Sun-Tavern</hi> not far distant from his Fathers, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to prevent his Voyage to <hi>Spain. Van Zwerts</hi> (according to their request) went to them, where he found them caressing each one his Strumpet, and using even the most immodest and lewdest actions. They observ'd <hi>Van Zwerts,</hi> that his eye was fix'd, and his countenance austere, as declaring the inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments of his mind; yet however they presented him with one of the most beautiful of their Company; but he declar'd his aversion to such lewdness, saying, <hi>Gentlemen, Have ye neither sense of Honour, Virtue, nor Conscience? Think ye that Iustice sleeps for ever? No, Heaven will be speedily mov'd, lay all its Mercy down, take up revenging Bolts of Thunder, and dash all such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate offenders to inevitable ruine: Why then</hi>— But as he would have proceeded, they interrupted him, and said, <hi>What,</hi> Jacob, <hi>always preaching! will you never give over canting? Let dull Religious Fools, who never knew the sweets of stolen pleasures, be ty'd to the strict Rules of Virtue; but Love's a roving Libertine, scales the weak Battlements which Virtue raises, and tramples upon Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to obtain a place safe in the arms of Beauty. Alas! thou art lost, thou huntest after shadows, and followest imaginary Heavens, while we have ours in possession. 'Tis ill trusting to Castles in the Air, or, like Astrologers, have twelve Houses they know not where, yet never a one for themselves to live in. No, 'tis</hi> we <hi>alone enjoy Honour, Beauty, Happiness, and Heaven on Earth.</hi> To which <hi>Iacob</hi> reply'd, O <hi>prophane wretches! have you no remorse of conscience? what means</hi>—But they interrupting him, said, <hi>Go preach conscience to the</hi> Spaniard; <hi>'t might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps make him less proud, though no ways abate his amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

inclinations, for he'd love his Wench in spight of Fate, or twenty Consciences</hi>; and so dismist him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Van Zwerts</hi> remain'd unshaken in his resolutions, and hastning his Voyage, embarqu'd the night following, but e're he had reach'd the Coasts of <hi>Spain,</hi> he was taken by a <hi>Turkish</hi> Pirate, (whose Power they were not able to resist) and straightway convey'd to <hi>Turkey,</hi> and (as Providence had appointed) sold Slave to <hi>Ali Pigget,</hi> a <hi>Turkish</hi> Merchant, formerly a correspondent of his Fathers, which <hi>Ali Pigget</hi> by questioning him concerning his Countrey, Education, and Extraction, found out, but did not discover it to <hi>Van Zwerts,</hi> only pretending civility on the account of his Learning, (for he was a good Linguist, and an excellent Penman and Accomptant) he employ'd him as Steward of his house. <hi>Ali Pigget</hi>'s eye was always severe and strict over <hi>Van Zwerts</hi> and his own Sister, (whose modesty he had reason to suspect) judging that she who had formerly so little respect to her Honour as to admit of the lewd embraces of a common Slave, would not be backward in promoting her lustful inclinations to such a qualified person as <hi>Van Zwerts</hi>; neither was his sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition or jealousie in vain, for she omitted no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of spreading her Charms to catch the heart of <hi>Van Zwerts,</hi> neither was she asham'd to tell him many times, that he was a person of the most winning and obliging good nature, that he had fir'd her heart, and she should never know any greater happiness than to be blest in his Embraces. Thus she often assaulted him, but found her amorous passion still defeated by the Chastity of the virtuous <hi>Van Zwerts</hi>; yet she resolv'd with all the power and Charms imaginable, and the strongest temptations of Lust, once more to besiege his Virtue, which she did in this manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ali Pigget</hi> being to ride out of Town some miles distant, about his Merchandise, she thought it her best and securest time to put in practice her unchast design.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:93450:173"/>
Accordingly upon the departure of <hi>Ali Pigget</hi> she or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Van Zwerts</hi> to wait on her at her Chamber within the space of half an hour at farthest: <hi>Van Zwerts</hi> (whose Honour was his guard) suspected not the lewd intentions of this Lady, but went into her Chamber, where finding her in bed, began to retire, when she call'd to him as to speak with him, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on his hand, said sighing, <hi>Iacob, hast thou no sense nor compassion for a poor suffering Lover? must I for ever burn in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She was indeed the Mirrour of her Age, and had as large a share of Beauty as any in that Countrey could boast of, which probably might occasion her more temptations to try

her Chastity, than others who were less beautiful; for in the Civil Wars, when Rapine was fierce and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and Virgins knew not by what means to resist or reclaim the extravagances of enraged Souldiers, she by a notable Stratagem (tho' very irksom to her self) preserv'd her Chastity, which she effected in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Under her Arm-pits she plac'd raw Bief, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it there till by the heat of her body it became so loathsom that none could endure to come within her sight, much less endure her Embraces. The relation of this, and the like Triumphs of her Chastity, well pleased <hi>Van Zwerts,</hi> who after the formalities of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship (which he was well vers'd in) obtain'd her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and was espoused to her, returning shortly after to his Fathers house in <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> who in a short time after his Sons return dy'd, and left him Master of a plentiful Estate, upon which this chast Couple liv'd many years happily.
