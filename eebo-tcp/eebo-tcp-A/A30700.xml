         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THis Veſſels ſudden departure, and our amazeing
diſtraction gives us time to write to you, onely 2
or three lines, but upon the moſt diſmal and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting

for on Satterday evening laſt, being the eighteenth of this
inſtant month, there hapned a moſt dreadful Fire in our
Town, which in the ſpace of two or three houres time,
burnt and conſumed almoſt all the whole buildings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

or ſpectators thereof.</p>
                  <p>Divine Providence ſo ordered it, that our houſe was
one of the firſt ſacrifices to the flames, whether it begun in
our or our Neighbors houſe we know not; and help could
none be there expected, it being next door to the publique
Magazine of the Iſland, which ſomtime after blew up,
with great terrour and damage; we having ſcare time
in the mean ſpace to ſave our Books and Papers of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
(together with our lives) from the mercileſs rage
of that devouring fire, and dreadful ſtroke of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                  <p>WE ſhall now (as having more time and leaſure)
give you a particular account of the ſad callamity
which befel on Satrurday the 18 inſtant, mentioned in
my laſt: that day we were at home buſy, writing moſt
part of the day, and at Evening about five of the clock,
(our houſe being waſhed and books and papers laid
aſide, being our uſual practiſe in order to a timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
for the Sabboth; we two walked out as far as
<hi>Exchange-place,</hi> leaving three or four of our ſervants at
home, but we had not been gone little above the ſpace of a
quarter of an hour, till we were allarum'd with an out
cry of a fire, which was ſaid to be either in our, or our
Neighbours Garret. <hi>James Coſtin</hi> was then in our count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
houſe receiving of mony, yet ſo ignorant of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap
that he knew nothing thereof, till he was made
ſenſible of it, by the peoples running up ſtairs, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the garret all on fire: nor can he give any account
by what means or when it hapned, that which is much
ſuſpected and moſt probable, is that it was either
done by a little <hi>Negro,</hi> who lighted the Candle
for them to tell the Money, and might go up
with the ſame into the Garret, or elſe that it might
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57886:4"/>
be kindled by ſome ſpark accidentally falling from ſome
of the Neighbours Chimneys, but of which we cannot
yet abſolutely determine,</p>
                  <p>But we upon our return, finding the Fire paſt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
haſted to ſecure what was moſt conſiderable, and
what in ſuch a ſudden exigency we could carry away, not
daring to ſtay any long time, the Fire prevailing ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
upon our Houſe, and it being next to the Magazine
of the Iſland, which had in it about 170 barrels of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which ſet ſuch an amazement, and ſtruck ſuch a
terrour upon the hearts of moſt people, that they durſt
not attempt to give that aſſiſtance, which otherwiſe would
have been done and performed, and might have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(in all probability) a great part of this devaſtation.</p>
                  <p>So that by what hath been demonſtrated, we muſt
aſcribe the cauſe of the Fire prevailing ſo far, to be the
cauſe of the Magazine, which being in the middle of the
Town, was a terrour to every man for lending his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
to the quenching of the flames, well knowing
that when the Fire came to the powder ſo near adjacent,
it would cauſe ſuch a blow as would deſtory all near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it: and indeed it is a miracle of mercy (that upon ſo
little warning) it did not deſtroy many hundreds of
people, which either by covetuoſneſs of ſaving their
goods, or impotency, ſtaid behind, as it was likely to
have done, had the powder been in a low room, and not
above, and queſtionleſs had it met with any oppoſition
it might have cauſed a very great Earthquake (which
Iſlands of this Nature are much ſubject unto) and ſo by
conſequence, reaſon induces me to believe, that very
few in or near the Town had eſcaped alive. But God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57886:4"/>
whoſe mercies are infinite here demonſtrated it unto us,
and mingled pitty with his Judgements, in not puniſhing
to the full meaſure of our deſerts.</p>
                  <p>This blow ſo diſperſed the Fire, and ſhattered all the
houſes, that the whole Town became preſently a prey
to its flames, it being ſuppoſed there is no leſs then
800 houſes conſumed in this terrible conflagration, with
a very great value of goods, the Town being very rich in
Commodities, of which very little was ſaved, moſt off
thoſe goods being too cumberous as to admit of a ſudden
removeal.</p>
