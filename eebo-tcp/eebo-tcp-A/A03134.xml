            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN EXACT CARD, Wherein is described, and delineated the famous Seige of <hi>Mastricht,</hi> begun the 10. of June, and ended the 23. of Angust, following Anno 1632.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He name of the citie of <hi>Mastricht,</hi> is compounded of two words <hi>Maze,</hi> and <hi>treckt,</hi> a dutch word, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in English, a <hi>passage over the Maze,</hi> called also in Latine <hi>Traiectum Mosae,</hi> or <hi>Traiectum Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> to distinguish betweene yt, &amp; <hi>Traiectum inferius,</hi> which is <hi>Vtrecht.</hi> This citie is very well scituated vpon the river of Maze, having <hi>Brabant</hi> on the VVest &amp; Northwest-side, Luykland, &amp; the <hi>Dukedome</hi> of <hi>Limburch</hi> on the South, and south East-side, and <hi>Gulickland,</hi> and the Countie of <hi>Valckenberke</hi> on the East, and North-side. It is devided into two Townes, the one called <hi>Mastricht,</hi> the other <hi>Wieck,</hi> the Maze running between them, and have also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, a very faire stone bridge of nine great arches to passe over.</p>
            <p>This is an ancient Towne, of a large Circuit and stronge, lying foure Germane miles from <hi>Luyck,</hi> haveing in yt two Cathedrall Churches,
<pb facs="tcp:4196:4"/>
the one called <hi>St. Servaes,</hi> vvhereof the King of Spayne as Duke of Brabant is Canon, which heretofore hath bin a Bishopprick, and was founded in the yeare of our Lord 395. whereby the antiquitio thereof is Knowne, but the Bishops seate was removed from thence to <hi>Luyck</hi> anno 1210. The other Cathedrall Church is called <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Maries,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Convent neere yt called the <hi>Bissen,</hi> vvherein a mightly Prince and his trayne maye lodge, and besides these Catheralls, it hath many other Churches, Cloisters &amp; Monasteries of men and woemen in yt.</p>
            <p>This citie also hath two Lords over yt, vvhereof the one is in the possession of the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> the other the Prince of <hi>Luyck</hi> by loane. And as they have two Lords, so they have two seats of Iustice two Maires, or Burgomasters, Aldermen &amp; Officers of Iustice, which meete and keepe good correspondence together, vvithout distinction of limits, neverthelesse the Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> was the Soveraigne Lord over them both, for hee onely stamps his picture vpon the Coine, and at his Entrance into these cities shewes mercie, and gives pardon to Malefactours.</p>
            <p>These two townes prospered and flourished well a long time, till the <hi>Netherlandish Troubles,</hi> and warr brake forth, and till the Spay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard put a garrison into yt, as being a chiefe Frontier towne, the key of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and the Magazin for all the King of Spaynes guarnisons over the Maze, and a ready passage for the sending vp of his forces into Germanie to assist the Emperour. In the time of some of her Gouvernours (especially vvhen Duke <hi>d'Alva</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannised and Domineered) yt sustayned great losses, and dammages by the Spaynards: for in the yeare 1576. they cunningly surprised yt did plunder, and pillage in yt. The States having gott yt in againe Anno 1579. the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> came before yt, and beleagured yt straightly, for the time of 8 mounts playing continually vpon yt vvith 54 peeces of Ordnance. The inhabitants and Souldiers car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
<pb facs="tcp:4196:4"/>
themselves so well, that scarcly the like hath bin parareld since the beginning of the Low-Countrie warrs: Notwithstanding the 29 of Iune 1579 being S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>: Ieames his day, hee tooke yt in with an assault the Spaynards murdring, and killing a great many of men woemen, and children in yt, and cast over the stone Bridge betweene <hi>Mastricht</hi> and <hi>Weyck</hi> some hundreds, and drownd them the River of the Maze, some others got vp into the steeples, and turrets of Churchers, and Cloisters to save themselves, crying out at the holes for quarter to them, but they insteed of that, sent them volleys of Musket-bullets vvhich yet stick in the vvall, and the holes of many of them are to be seene vnto this daye, and some people yett living in yt, which by the mercie of God, escaped their bloudie hands can witnesse. VVhat hath hapned vnto yt the last yeare 1632. how yt was beseiged againe and taken, how the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> his quarters laye, how the line of Circumvallation was fortisyed with strong &amp; impregnable works how the lines in the Approches were runne this <hi>Card</hi> deliniates, and the Iournall herevnto annexed, will demonstrate and satisfie the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall Reader.</p>

            <p>The first of Iune, the Army began to moue againe, at the creeke of the day, and about noone made a halt by the Maze side ouer against <hi>Stral,</hi> vvhilst some of our firelocks tooke in the forte of <hi>Aersen,</hi> on the other side of the Riuer. One of the Enemies Sconces which lay vpon their <hi>New-fare,</hi> discharged two or three peeces of ordnance at vs, but the bullets fell short. This night vvee quartered vpon a Heath, a litle short of <hi>Venlo:</hi> the English haueing the Vanguard, Count Earnest the Battaile, and the Frenches the Reare.

            <p>The third of Iune Collonell <hi>Varick,</hi> commanded in the approches, and this day wee receaued the sadd and heauy news, that Count <hi>Earnest</hi> Lord Marshall of the feild, in veivving of the grounde before <hi>Roermondt,</hi> vvas slayne from the vvall vvith a firelocke bullet: and also Captaine Murrey a Scotch Captaine.</p>
            <p>The fourth, those of <hi>Venlo</hi> came to a parley and shooting vvas left on both sides for a vvhile: the Magistrats came out vnto the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> his Army, &amp; made their owne quarter &amp; conditions, without makeing any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of the militarie men, which the souldiers vnderstanding, that they were not included in the composition, began to Shoote againe, and obteyned good quarter, both for Burgers and Souldiers, vvhich vvas this, that the Burgers and the Clergie, should liue vnmolested for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, &amp; all their Cloysters and Nunneries in their former estate that they should enioy all their antient Priuiledges and Customes.

their Religion. That the Officers and Souldiers should march out with flying colours, light matches, bullets in their mouthes, and with bagg and baggage, soe on the fourth of Iune according to the composition, there marched out of <hi>Venlo,</hi> sixe vveake Companies, which vvere not aboue 300 strong, and sixe of our Dutch Companies marched into the towne, and Lieutenant Collonell Brederode a Dutch Captaine vvas made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of that Garrison.

This afternoone wee had orders to prouide victualls for three dayes, and to be ready to march att the breake of the day the next morning.</p>
            <p>The fifth of Iune vvee marched from <hi>Venlo</hi> to <hi>Roermondt,</hi> being a long and a wearisome march, by reason of the abundance of rayne vvhich fell that day and night, soe that many of the souldiers vvere left behinde, and could not gett vp to the quarters till the next morning: the order of the march vvas this.</p>
            <p>Count Earnest his Brigado being sent before to <hi>Roermondt,</hi> vvas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted for the Van-guarde, the French the Battle, and the English the Reare, &amp; this night vvee bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make our approches towards the towne.</p>

            <p>It vvas generally supposed, that those of <hi>Roermondt</hi> yeilded vp the towne with so much the more speed, fearing that his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: vvould vvith violence haue assaulted it, vvithout giueing them any quarter, in reveng of Count Earnest his death, vvho vvas shot and Slayne before it.</p>

            <p>The Enemyes Army lying so neere vs, it was now a tyme of action, for euerie night the whole Armye at the shooting off, of the warning peece, was in Armes, and drew to the lyne, every Companie standing 100. or 150. paces, one from another, and the horse troopes behinde them: this lasted for sixe weekes every night, till we had taken in the towne.</p>
            <p>The first of Iuly also, out long runing trench began to be made, on the other side of the <hi>Maze,</hi> beneath the Lord of <hi>Brederodes</hi> bridge, for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of our men, that went daylye at noone to guarde the water side, even from the Bridge to the house of <hi>Geul,</hi> where Count <hi>Stirums</hi> quarter was: the Enemye had planted ordnance vpon diverse Batteries, along the water side, and shott at our men marching to their Guards, but did them little harme.</p>
            <p>The second of Iuly in the morning, sixe French Companies of the <hi>Duke</hi> of Candales Regiment, the Marques <hi>d'Esteaux</hi> his Leiftenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell commanding, had the guard on the other side of the River, to hinder the Enemye from putting over the <hi>Maze,</hi> below the Lord of <hi>Brederodes</hi> quarter: The Marques distrusting the Enemye would attempt some such thing in the night, layed some of his men in <hi>Ambuscadoe</hi> among the Reedes, and in the Corne, and suffred the Enemye to put over two punts full of his men, about 300 strong, and another punt full followed them; The Enemye being landed, high <hi>Dutches</hi> and <hi>Wallons,</hi> fell to worke with their Spades, to make good that peece of ground, where they intended to lay over their bridge, &amp; had cast vp three Crosse Batteries on the other side of the River, that vnder the favour of them, hee might passe over his men, and had lodged some 3000 Muskettiers along the River side in a brest-worke cast vp in the night, to play vpon our men. The Frenches seing them at worke, burst out of their ambuscadoes, fell vpon them <hi>Pell-Mell,</hi> and gott betweene the River and them, and charged them vp to the very middle in water: The Enemye played cruellye vpon the Frenches from their Batteryes, which flanckered that place, and their Cannon bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets raked through he French Companies, slew many of them, and shott of the Armes &amp; leggs of divers of them, &amp; some of them were shott with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4196:12"/>
Muskett bulletts, from over the River: Howsoeuer the Marques and his men carryed them selues so well, that they beate the Enemy backe, and sunck one punt with men in it, so that there was drowned, slayne, &amp; taken Prisoners of the Enemye vpon this action, about 400 men, where of five or sixe of them were Captaines, two or three <hi>Alferusses,</hi> and 70. Souldiers. The Marques d'Esteaux, who had bestirred himselfe so bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velye, when all was done, &amp; in coming of, was slayne with an vnhappye cannon bullett of the Enemies, and with him also were slayne Captaine <hi>Foullon,</hi> Captaine du <hi>Fresnes,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Bois</hi> his Leiftenant, and Leiftenant de <hi>Fay,</hi> besides divers voluntiers, Gentelmen, and Souldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fifty which lay dead vpon the place, and a greate many hurte men were brought of.</p>
            <p>This afternoone the Enemye sent a Trompetter to demaund his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonners, hee speaking with his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: for their releasment, commended much his clemencie, and mercye, that they were not all put to the sword, and also what good quarter was given to the kings men the yeare before at <hi>Bergen op Zoom,</hi> when wee tooke their punts, and Shalloups, and that if ever they should haue such an advantage vpon vs, hee hoped they would doe the like.</p>
            <p>Saturday the third of Iuly, our horse tooke five carrs laden with bread, and other provision which was going to the Kinges Campe.</p>
            <p>The next day being the fourth, the Regiment of Colonell <hi>Belford</hi> being in the trenches, (Sr. <hi>Iames Levistone,</hi> his Leift. Colonell who then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded) the Enemye gaue them an Alarme, Sr. <hi>Iames</hi> standing vp to see what the matter was, receaved a dangerous shott vpon the crowne of his head, whereof thanks be to God he recovered.</p>
            <p>The fourth of Iuly also, our horse &amp; firelocks, tooke 60 waggons and carres, laden with wyne, beare, and victualls for the Enemies Armye, and brought in 103 Pesants, whereof some proved Newtralls, the other Enemies.</p>
            <p>The fift of Iuly, without the losse of any men, our sapp was cut into the Enemyes traverse, which the English before had assaulted.</p>
            <p>About this tyme it was a very wet season, &amp; greate store of Raine fell, so that the River swelled, and the Enemye could not forde it over, till our works, double entrenchements, Ditches, Skonces, Ravelings, and halfe-Moones on the other side of the River, were defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sible, which made vs beleive, that as God fought for vs before the Busse with drye weather, so now hee did the like by wett weather, &amp; made the heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to favour vs.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:4196:13"/>Tuesday the sixte off Iuly, the beseiged fell out vpon our workmen in the sappe off the traverse, my Lord <hi>Morgan</hi> then commanding, beate them twice out off it, hee himselfe was shott vpon his brest, and some others hurt and slayne. This night the Enemy sprung a myne vnder the traverse in the English approches, but did little harme.</p>
            <p>This sixte off Iuly also his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: hearing that the Enemy intended to fall on, hee sent Mons<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Stackenburch</hi> Lieuetenant Generall off the horse to giue them a sound alarme, which was done in this manner following: Hee had with him some 80: horse, &amp; some 80: firelocks, and tooke with him many trumpetts, and Drums, which where to sound, and to beate a charge in sundry places, and coming neere them, hee fell on with his horse, &amp; firelocks, the trumpetts sounding, &amp; the Drums beating, gaue them such a terrible allarme, that the Enemy supposing (as the runewayes and prisoners reported) that his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on with his whole Army, did so pusle them, that they run too, and fro, like men amazed, and could not get into Armes: Mons<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Stackenburch</hi> broke into their trench and cut off a corps de Guard, wherein a Spanish Captaine was slayne, and takeing diverse prisoners, returned backe into his quarters.</p>
            <p>The 7. our men brought in 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> horsemen prisonners with a Drossard, and 9 Carrs laden with provisions, which were declared good boote.</p>

            <p>The 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an 10. our approches were well advanced.</p>

            <p>The 12: off Iuly wee had intelligence that the Marquesse <hi>Sancte Croce</hi> was in Armes, &amp; had deuided his troopes into three Battalio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, with intent to attempt some thing vpon vs, and to see if they could have brooke through our lyne, but bethinking themselves they returned back againe into their quarters. This day also sixe Souldiers off the Enemies, came out off the towne with their Armes, &amp; advertized the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> of the towne, &amp; where their Mynes lay: they were sent to take entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of count <hi>Henry</hi> of the <hi>Berke,</hi> which they themselves desired.</p>
            <p>More over this daye the French approches were so well advanced, that a Soudier called <hi>Wild-boare</hi> of my Lord <hi>Veres</hi> Company of <hi>Dort,</hi> and 4: other souldiers, for 800: gilders vndertoke to sapp into the Counterscarfe of the towne, this day also there came nyne Dutch Companies from <hi>Groning</hi> to our Army, which were quartered on <hi>Weick</hi> side.</p>
            <p>Tuesday the 13. of Iuly certaine forces of the Enemy marched towards

               <hi>Maseyck,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> fearing that they might get over the <hi>Maze,</hi> or take in the house of Count <hi>Henry</hi> of the <hi>Berke</hi> in <hi>Steevens-weert,</hi> sent thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Count <hi>Stirum</hi> with diverse Foote Companies, and the Duke off Bouillon followed him with some 20: troopes of horse more.</p>
            <p>The 14: the Enemy found out a Myne in the French approches, and stole the Powder out of it. The French likewise found out a Myne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one of their Corps du guard, and served them in the like Manner. This daye five women were taken coming out off the towne whereoff one had a packett of letters found about her.</p>
            <p>The 15. this daye in the morning those off the towne fell vpon the French works, and tooke in part off their sapp, and began to cast it vp against them, but in the afternoone the French falling on vpon them recouered the most part of it againe with the losse of some men.</p>
            <p>This night the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bouillon</hi> tooke in the Castle of Argenteau, scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on a high Hill betweene Luke &amp; our army to secure our provisions.</p>
            <p>Vpon Fryday the 16. of Iuly, the Enemy had in a readinesse another Myne, and springing that, filled the French sapp with earth some foure rodds, where vpon the French Colonell Monsieur <hi>Maison-Neusve,</hi> that commanded, desired his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: that the French might spring their myne, and haue a revenge, which the <hi>Prince</hi> not only granted; but also was present there himselfe: The myne then being sprung the Frenches fell on brauely, and droue the Enemy into their Moate, and followed them so close, that they cryed out, Mesieurs <hi>Faitez Nous Graces,</hi> the French lost aboue 40: men, among which Ensigne <hi>Fay</hi> was slayne, and the Enemy aboue 100: slayne and hurt that day, as they themselues confessed. The springing off the Myne tooke but little effect, yet not with-standing: the French Voluntiers, Gentlemen, &amp; Souldiers fell on &amp; pursued them the Enemy shooting so thicke with their Cannon and small shott, from the walle and their out-works, that they could not lodge in the Myne, nor cast vp the earth against the Enemy, where driven to retyre againe into their workes.</p>
            <p>The VVallons relieuing the French, about one of the clocke in the night fell on againe vpon the Enemyes worke, and beate them out off it, but fresh seconds falling out of the towne, the vvallons retreated into their works.</p>
            <p>In this fight were slayne Monsieur <hi>Beza</hi> a French Captain that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, a French Lieuetenant, and a VVallons Ensigne, beside, some 30: Souldiers slayne and hurt.

The Enemy lost also in these seuerall encounters 82 men, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves reported, and about 60 hurt, whereof some of them died of their wounds afterwards.</p>
            <p>The 18: a Burger of <hi>Mastricht</hi> came voluntarily ouer into our Army. This day also there came 60: Musketteirs from Leige, which were taken vp there, and raysed for vs.</p>
            <p>A woman also was apprehended, and taken goeing with a letters to the Spanish Army.</p>
            <p>Also a Spaniard was taken in pesants Cloathes, and brought in, which had letters from Sancte Croce, to the Gouernour of <hi>Gulick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Letters were likewise intercepted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Infanta</hi> to <hi>Papenheim,</hi> wherein shee offered him present pay for two monthes, if hee would helpe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue <hi>Mastricht,</hi> and come into the Land of <hi>Luke</hi> as an Enemy.</p>
            <p>Vpon Munday the 19: the Enemyes Horse of <hi>Sancte Croce</hi> his Army, surrounded, and made a brauado before the <hi>Princes</hi> Quarters, chased and tooke many of the waggoners horses, and slew some Foremen, our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance playd vpon them, and our horse charged them and slew a Captaine of theirs and made them to retreate. The <hi>Princes</hi> Captaine of his troope of Harquebusiers was slayne this day, our men also slew some of the Enemy, and tooke others prisoners.</p>
            <p>The Lord of <hi>Vpdam</hi> haueing 100: horse vpon the <hi>Maze</hi> neere vnto <hi>Stockham,</hi> brooke out of an Ambuscado suddenly, &amp; charged three of the Enemies troopes of horse, put them to flight, and pursued them so fast, that they tooke 12: horse and 25: horsmen prisoners.</p>
            <p>The 20. Nothing of consequence was done.</p>
            <p>Wensday the 21. of Iuly proclamation was made that hee w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. could take any going in, or out of the towne, with letters, should haue two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred gilders for his labour.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>Warfuse</hi> Maister of the King of Spanies finances, or reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes; revolted and declared himselfe at Leige against the Spaniards and published his reasons.</p>
            <p>This day 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firelocks sallied out of the towne, neere vnto the place where S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Robert Honywoods</hi> troope had the guard, hee fell vpon them slew sixe of them and tooke three prisoners.</p>
            <p>This night the Enemy attempted againe to come over the water, and sent ouer two hundred <hi>Italians</hi> in Sloops on our side of the <hi>Maze:</hi> but Colonell <hi>Varick</hi> sett vpon them, slew diuerse of them among the rest a Colonell which had the command in that action, and tooke some 70: pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,

            <p>This day also while the English gave the Enemy an allarum in their trenches, the <hi>Princes</hi> guard, and the vvallons sprung a mine in the French approches, and fell vpon a Traverse of the Enemies, before their halfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moone, they fought a long tyme with the Enemy, till their Amunition was spent, and the alarum being hott Leiutenant <hi>Viuian,</hi> Lieuetnant to Sr: <hi>Iohn Manwoods</hi> Company, was sent with all expedition with 40: fresh Musketteirs out off the English approches to second them, and some Dutch; he fell vpon the Enemy, and put them to retreat, and made the place good, till the workmen turned it vp, &amp; lodged some of our men in it the Enemy holding one side of the worke and wee the other. Count <hi>Haynaw,</hi> who commanded the Regiments of the guards, did carrie himselfe valiantly in this action, charged the Enemy in the playne feild, with his sword drawne in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was there slayne, whose death the <hi>Prince</hi> much lamented. Three vvallon Captaines were hurt, and diverse Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen and Souldiers slayne in this service.</p>
            <p>The 22. of Iuly towards noone the Enemy sprung a myne neere the point off the English sapp, which cast vp abundance of Earth, and falling into our sapp filled it vp a rodd. or more, and likewise stopt the entrance into our myne.</p>
            <p>This cast vs behinde, and wee were driven to worke yt out againe, and cleere both our sapp, and our myne before wee could aduance forward. VVhen the Enemyes men sprung their Myne: vvee had three or foure men a sapping forward, the earth fell vpon them, and buried two off them 12: or 13: foote deepe vnder it in the mouth of our sapp, my Lord of oxford vpon Thursday night commanded, &amp; a little before the breake of the day, these two Souldiers of Sariant Maior Generall <hi>Witts</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which were buried vnder the Earth, when the Enemies myne was blowne vp, lying in the concaue thereof, wrought themselves out with their hands, and a spade, and tumbled into our sapp, among our men, who supposing they had bin the Enemy, were ready to give fire vpon them, which they seeing, cryed out that they were our owne men, thus it pleased God miraculously to preserve these two poore men, which lay buryed vnder the Earth 15: houres, from Eleuen a Clock in the day, till 3 a clock in the next morning. Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Proude</hi> who commanded that day in the approches when the myne was sprung, was shott dead in his head with a firelock bullet.</p>

            <p>Vpon the 24: in the morning the Enemy sprang a Myne in the French Approches, but did little harme. The English also sprung their Myne fearing that the Enemy had discouered it, &amp; would haue prevented them, the Earth fell short of the Enemies worke.</p>
            <p>This day two pesants were taken coming out of the towne, whereoff one off them had letters found about him.</p>
            <p>The 25: two new Companies were raised at Leige w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>: came vnto vs.</p>
            <p>About this time the States raised nine troops off horse.</p>
            <p>About sixe off the clock this morning the Enemies troope off horse, which lay in the towne (laying some firelocks in Ambuscado for their retreat) sallied out vpon <hi>Weike</hi> side, &amp; came vpon the spur into a Village about an English mile from the towne, thinking that our horse troopes, which lay there, had him vpon the watch, and so to have pillaged their lodgings in their absence: but our men staying some thing longer them vsuall; taking the Alarum, charged them with three troopes off our horse, and falling in among them, made them returne with greater speede then they came, and followed them soe close, vn till they came to the Ambushe off ther firelocks, which brake out, and gave fire vpon our men, and the Cannon out of the Towne played, among them, which made the Enemies horse take courage againe, and turning faces about, charged our men, but our men broke them so, that their foote casting away their firelocks, ran away, &amp; after them their horse, whome our men charged home vp to the very port, though they shott much with their ordnance from the wall: In this skirsmish we lost 4 or 5 hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the Enemy lost many more. Captaine <hi>Hurryes</hi> troope a Scotch Captaine was very much comended for this service: This day one of our sapps was so farr advanced, that it touched one of the Enemyes works, this being S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>: <hi>Iames</hi> his day, wee were verilie perswaded, that the Marques <hi>Sancte Croce</hi> would have fallen on vpon our lyne, and outworks, to see iff hee could have releived the towne, but wee kept so strong a watch, that hee did not try what their Patron-Saint would doe for them.</p>
            <p>The 26: the Enemy sent some of his troopes towards <hi>Maseyck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tuesday the 27: of Iuly, the beseiged sprung a Myne in the English trenches, which defaced our sapp, &amp; did a little hurt to one of our mynes.</p>
            <p>This afternoone the Enemy sprung two Mynes in the French appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

the vvallons haveing the guard there, had hurt &amp; slayne 18: of their men, among whom Captaine <hi>Duke</hi> his Ensigne was slaine. The Enemies horse of the towne salied out on <hi>Weike</hi> side, but were presently beaten ile</p>
            <p>This night also a Corps du guard, and a Battery was made in the ille aboue the towne, and a morter planted, the which played with grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and two small peeces into <hi>Weick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 28: of Iuly about one of the clocke in the night, the Enemy shott fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their leaguer, diverse peeces of ordna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but did not atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt to put over.</p>
            <p>The French this afternoone sprung a Myne, and fell on vpon it, but the earth lying so open toward the towne, retreated with the losse off Captaine <hi>Lavilletta</hi> and some others.</p>
            <p>Thusday the 29: of Iuly that afternoone, the Enemy fell out, and shott much in the English trenches: of ours there were some 20 men slayne &amp; hurt, among the rest Captaine Courtney, who commanded Colonell <hi>Pakenhams</hi> Companie, had his thigh broaken with a Granadoe, whereof three dayes after he dyed. And in the night the Enemy sprung a Myne which did some harme to our sapp.</p>
            <p>The 30: of Iuly, the <hi>Prince</hi> went downe into the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch approches, to see the gallery, which was newly begun: In the English approches, a Battery was made &amp; advanced neerer the wall, having two halfe Canon planted vpon it, the one played vpon the Brussels Port, and the halfe-moone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and the other to dismount a peece of the Enemyes, which lay vpon the Rondle of the wall, and did much harme to our men, but the Enemy from the same Rondle, with their peece, put one of our Canons to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and slew a Cannonier.</p>
            <p>The last of Iuly, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Ieames Sanderling</hi> commannding, the Scotch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing the guard in the tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, a sapt was brought into the Enemies spur, which lay before their Counter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> skarfe, which the Enemy seeing, shott continually from 10: of the clock in the morning, till 7. a clock in the Evening, with Cannon, Slings, Firelocks, and Musketts vpon them, and threw hand granadoes among them, &amp; with all they fell on, with flayles, forkes, and clubbs, full of nayles, and sett fire on our blinde, which made our worke lye open to their shott: not withstanding the Scotch main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned yt bravely. In this fight was slayne with a Canon bullet worthy Lieutenant <hi>Bruce,</hi> who carryed himself very vaillantly this day, &amp; fought in his shirt, and oftentimes came to push of the Pike with the Ennemie vpon the top of the worke, and puld their flayles, and clubbs from them with his hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:4196:16"/>Ensigne Riddle also a hope full yong Gentlmen received their his mortal wound, whereof with in two dayes he dyed. And Captaine Leviston, &amp; Lieutenant Douglas were hurt. To conclude the scotch had &amp; hurt slayne this daye some 30: of their men, whereof Colonell <hi>Broughs</hi> owne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie had hurt and slayne about sixteene.</p>
            <p>The first of August our newe Batterie which was put to silence before began to speake againe, &amp; to shot vpon the Ennemies Roundle, to se iff they could dismount their ordinance throw the port-holes they putt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to silence, yett for all that nowe and then they shott very dangerously with their sling peece vpon our men.</p>
            <p>This day also the Ennemy sett fire vpon two of out blinds and slew some of our men.</p>
            <p>The second of August our men with often shooting with two halfe-Canon from the French Battery did so shake &amp; beate vpon the wall ouer against the French approches, that it sunck downe some three rodes, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>: made the Ennemie to quitt a part of their counterskarfe. And the French advanced well their great covert gallerie vnder the dry Moate.</p>
            <p>The third of August the Enemy was not so lavish in shooting awaye their powder and bullets as wouts they to be, but did beginn to husband yt against a time of more neede; so that this night wee had not one man shott, onely Colonell <hi>Harewood</hi> gott a sligh hurt with a granado. This night the English sapt into the Enemies counterskarfe &amp; to the brinke of their moate, and made there two or three small guards, to maintaine the sapp, and to offend the Ennemie.</p>
            <p>The fourth of August wee brought an other sapp vp on our right hand into their moate, and made likewise two or three litle Corps off guard to secure yt. It was admirable to see when wee had gott into their counterskarfe and the brinck of their deep ditch, howe many windings and turnings, lines, flancks, and sapps we made, they were like a <hi>Maze</hi> wherein one might have lost himself, if hee had not knowne them well.

            <p>Our great gallerie was so vnder propt with supporters of timber, and plancks aboue yt, that foure men might march in Frunt in yt. Every daye and night wee got a rode or more, it was 160 paces long, and went shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving downe some 8: foote vnder the bottome of their dry moate, which was of a hugh deepth, and then rising vp againe to come to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

Having then (as is said) gott into the Ennemies Counterskarfe, dry ditch or moate they by degrees litle &amp; lite quitted part of yt, and retyred toward their halfe-moones, before both their ports ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting vp small traverses vpon their Counterskarfe and the brinck of their moate to hinder vs from sapping forward, so that they disputed every patch of ground with vs, &amp; wee were forced to cutt them out of them, or else to fyre them out of them.</p>
            <p>The Enemie had planted a small peece in their halfe-moone, shot into our sapps, and from the Roundle vpon our right hand, which slew some of our men, Among the rest Sargant <hi>Parker</hi> Conductor to Mr: <hi>Niel</hi> his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi> Inginier.</p>

            <p>This day also the great English Gallerie, was begun vnder the Earth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> comming into the French &amp; English approches, which he did comonly every day, &amp; so hazarerd his person more then the Officers were willing to see, escaping narrowly many a shott, espied in the English approches a small traverse, which the Ennemy held on the one side, and wee on the other, from whence the Enemy threw many Granadoes into our sap among our men, which did much annoy them.

            <p>The 11: Colonell <hi>Harwood</hi> having the command in the trenches, and being bid-day, after dinner going to see the sapp, was slayne with a sling bullet, whose death was much lamented. This day those of the towne sprung a myne in the trenches, but did little harme.</p>

            <p>This daye also their was a great fire in Colonell <hi>Harewoods</hi> his quarter, which burnt of a division, &amp; his dead Corps, escaped burning very neere.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Newburch</hi> came also into our Armye to the <hi>States,</hi> &amp; his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: It was reported his Ambassage was from the Bishop of <hi>Collen,</hi> to excuse <hi>Papenheyms</hi> comming, &amp; sollicite that <hi>Weike</hi> might be made new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall, they say hee had noe good answere from the <hi>Prince,</hi> and the <hi>States:</hi> but went away with a flea in his eare.</p>
            <p>This day those of the towne sprung another myne, but it tooke noe great effect, but at night they set some of our blindes on fire.</p>

            <p>The 14: 14. woemen were taken, and 4. firelocks, which came out off the towne to gett forrage.</p>
            <p>This day also <hi>Papenheyms</hi> horse, &amp; ours skirmished together, and sought to beate in our horse centinells.</p>

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:4196:18"/>This night the Ennemy hung out lights on the wall both against the English &amp; French approches, to shoote vpon vs, &amp; to discover what wee were a doing in their moate.</p>
            <p>The 15: also a <hi>Capuchian</hi> Fryer belonging to the Earle of <hi>Vorstenburch</hi> came from <hi>Papenheyms</hi> quarters into ours, to visite a Leiutenant of horse off theirs, who was taken prisonner, and lay wounded in our quarters, hee told vs <hi>Papenheym</hi> desired that <hi>Weike</hi> might be delivered to him, or else hee made noe quastion, but hee would releive the towne, for his men had done wonders, and overrun stronger works then ours at <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburch,</hi> wee prayed the <hi>Pape</hi> that hee would goe &amp; perswade <hi>Papenheym</hi> to make a tryall off the strength off our works, and hee and his muffs should have a very good wel-come.</p>
            <p>This day also came <hi>Kutingen Agent</hi> off the Bishop off <hi>Coullen</hi> to our Armye, to excuse <hi>Papenheyms</hi> coming, but the <hi>States</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> gave him noe great welcome.</p>
            <p>The 16: of August, the Scotts having the gard in the trenches, the beseiged about two a clock in the morning, came into the moate, and gave fire vpon our right hand sapp, that opened in it, and wounded two or three off our workmen: they were presentlie beaten out, &amp; left two or three of their men dead behinde them, afterward they shott into this sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with a sling peece; (&amp; being in drinke) as comonlie they were when they fell on, fell out againe vpon our sappers, but the Scotch beate them back, with the losse of eleven of their men: the scoth also lost a Sergeant with foure men. This day Count <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Nassau</hi> his stuard was slayne.</p>
            <p>This night <hi>Papenheym</hi> shott of five peeces of ordnance towards Count <hi>Maurice</hi> his quarter, by which hee declared himselfe an Enemye, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the day following.</p>
            <p>Those of the towne hung out lights this night three tymes, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished them againe, wee interpreted this to be some signall they could not hold out long. This evening a corporall of the Enemyes came out of the towne, and told vs, that the beseiged intended to fallie out vpon vs the next day, with a greate many men.</p>
            <p>Vpon tuesday the 17: Generall <hi>Morgans</hi> Regiment had the gard in the trenches, my Lord Generall <hi>Vere</hi> commanded the lyne, (as hee did every night,) betweene the English quarter and Count <hi>Henryes,</hi> accompanied with Sergiant Maiour <hi>Holles:</hi> It was my Lord of oxfords turne to coma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this night in the quarters (who being sikly) my Lord <hi>Vere</hi> comanded his quartermaster to attend his lo. &amp; to bring him what orders should come.</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:4196:18"/>This night about 12 a clock: Sergant Maiour Generall <hi>Witz</hi> hearing the Enemy moved, gave order that 150 men should be drawn out of the quarters, &amp; put into the <hi>Fort Anglois</hi> to stregthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yt, this caused my Lord of oxford to come forth, &amp; see it executed &amp; he stayed with the companies till morning.

The Enemye sallied out about 400 men, vpon the English trenches, and over the plain feilde fell into our sapps and guards: it was a mistie morning, &amp; so came stealing behinde our centinells, who could not well discover them, &amp; give the alarum so soone as they might, if it had bene cleare: the Enemye fell into our first <hi>Corps du Gard,</hi> &amp; beate our men out of yt, and so along our right-hand sapps, gott into the second <hi>Corps du Gard,</hi> and at last assaulted the Colonells <hi>Corps du Garde,</hi> where Serg<hi rend="sup">t</hi>: Maiour <hi>Williamson</hi> comanded, and in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>: Generall <hi>Morgans</hi> owne Companye was, and some others.

The Enemye having possessed these vvorks began to slight them, and cast downe many off our muskett-Basketts, which made them lye very open to the wall of the towne: then came my Lord <hi>Vere</hi> my Lord of Oxford, Sarga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Maiour <hi>Holles,</hi> Sr. Io. <hi>Manhood</hi> &amp; Sr. Symon <hi>Harecourt,</hi> my Lord <hi>Vere</hi> being there, gave presently order for the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthning of the guards, and the relieving of our men, and appointed workmen to repaire our blindes, which the Enemye had begun to slight, and by litle and litle to set vp our musket-baskets again, &amp; coma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded our men from all guards to give fire vpon the wall, and the Roundels of it, to keepe the Ennemy from shooting, while our men did their buisinesse.

a sudden impression of greife it vvas to my Lord Generall <hi>Vere,</hi> the <hi>symptomes</hi> of his face did discover: neverthelesse his Lo<hi rend="sup">p</hi>: suppressing yt as well as he could, gave further direction that our men should ply shooting, that the gards, and the sapps should be relieved, and the musket<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>baskets, which the Enemy had throwne downe, by litle and litle should be sett vp againe. And ere all things vvere done, it vvas twelve a clock at the least.

This action was noe soner ended, but an other alarme began on <hi>Count Maurice</hi> his side; for vvhilst my Lord <hi>Vere,</hi> and diversse Officers, vvere at dinner vvith my Lord <hi>Craven</hi> in the trenches, vvee heard ten or twelve rousing Canon goe off from the brow of the hil vvhere <hi>Papenheym</hi> laye.

The night before, the Marquesse <hi>Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cte Croce</hi> had sent Generall <hi>Papenheym</hi> three Italian Regiments, and some of his best Canon. <hi>Papenheym</hi> then thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring with his ordnance from his great batterie vpon <hi>Count Maurice</hi> his quarter, and vpon the line, came marching downe the hill in full Batalia some 6. or 7. thousand horse and foote, drawing downe two feild peeces before them, vvhich they planted within musket shott of the place, were they intended to Enter. The place vvas vpon a litle church yard called <hi>Ammy:</hi> vvhere our line was not yet perfected, &amp; where there were hedges orchardes, and trees which did shelter them much from our shott. They tooke our men iust at dinner, and the alarme being so hotly given, our men leaving their victualls behind them, ran in all expedition to answere yt. The Italian Regiments had the honour to give vs the first charge, and fell vpon this church-yard, and came to pushe of the pike with our men vpon the topp of the trench, The Italians gave on three or foure times, &amp; did their best endeavour, to have entred: but our men gave them such a welcome, and did so repulse them, that some of them were slayne vpon the brest worke, and tumbled downe into the ditch, and others were knockt downe with the stocks of Musketts, and had their braynes beaten out with brick batts. And our ordnance playing from all our Batteries

This fight continued along time from one off the clock, till 8 or nine in the night, before they could come cleare off. In this fight pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nor shott were spared on neither side. Count <hi>Papenheym</hi> wold faine have bin gone sooner, but hee was engaged, to staye the longer for the carrying off of his dead &amp; hurt men, and the drawing off his two feild peeces, which cost many off his men theirs dearest lives. It was credibly reported, that in this fight, hee lost 1400 or 1500 hundred men, &amp; himself hurt. For the daye following the Boores comming in tould vs, that there were 24 vvaggons appointed in the night, to fetch of their dead and hurt men, vvhereof some of them had their leggs &amp; their armes shot off. These waggons went often to and againe in the night, and by the churchyard, vvhere the Italians fell on, their lay 140 of their dead bodies stript, our men did them the honour to cast Earth vpon them, &amp; to bury them in the ditch off our trench.</p>

His Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: the Lord Generall <hi>Vere,</hi> Sariant Maiour Generall, and diverse Officers stood vpon the Batterie, to see the Breach assaulted, where the bullets flew thick, and threefold. It was very difficult for our men to enter, because of the steepnesse of the wall, and their clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring over stones, and dead mens bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being 80: foote in height from the bottome of the moate to the stone wall. Our men giving on three or foure times with freshe courage, vvhich his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: seeing (that the longer they stayed in assaulting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more men wee lost) sent word, that our men should come downe from the breach, and retyre into our works. In this fight captaine <hi>Davis</hi> a worthy Gentleman was slayne, Captaine <hi>Edmund Manly,</hi> who strived to enter cutting off the heads of the Ennemies pikes, received a shott throw his left arme by his shoulder, vvhich brake his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and an other throw the same arme a litle above his Elbow, vvhich likewise broke his bone asunder, &amp; another shott through his right thygh among his synowes, vvhereof the 23. of August he dyed.

also. The Ennemy likewise lost a brave Captaine vpon the breach and a great many of other Officers &amp; men, who did ingeniously confesse vnto vs, after wee came into the Towne, that if our Myne had sprung but halfe an houre sooner, the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Leyde</hi> Vice Gouvernour, and some of the Magistrates standing aboue the myne, and giung some orders how to defend the breach, had bin blowne vp into the aire. Our men falling on &amp; striving to enter, there was a pityfull cry of men, woeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; children in the Towne, their great alarme Bell ringing out. And some of them fearing that our men wold have entred, and served them as the <hi>Prince</hi> off <hi>Parma</hi> did Anno 1579. cryed out for quarter, but our men gave noe eare vnto them, because his Ex<hi rend="sup">ice</hi>: had promissed our men, they should pillage the Towne if they entred, which did much animate them. There was order giving whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our men fell first on, that iff the breach was not moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and the assault feisible, they should have sent his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: word, and have falne off: but it seemes the over-ruling hand of the Lord of <hi>Hoasts</hi> was in this action, and the courage of our men such, that it was omitted: for though wee lost a Company of brave, and worthy men, who desirous of honour lost their lives there, yet they did so startle the Ennemy, that they durst not stand out a second assault, as yee shall heare the daye following.</p>
            <p>Vpon Saterday then the 21 in the morning a parly was beaten for the fetching off of our dead bodies on both sides: S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Ieamet Sanderling</hi> then commanding in the approches, the dead being brought off, our men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gann to shoote againe: but it seemes the Ennemie fore-seeing an other storme, and for the prevention off a further daunger, tooke hold off this oppertunity, calls for a parly, and desired that one or two of them might speake vvith his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: vvhich S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Ieames</hi> graunting, caused his men to leave shooting, and sent word to the French approches, that they wold doe the like also, so his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: sent downe Saria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Maiour Generall Monsieur <hi>Witz,</hi> into the approches and hostages were sent out and in, and the Articles of Composition agreed on, and accordingly performed on both sides.</p>
            <p>According to the Articles of Composition herevnto annexed Munday the 23. of August the Ennemies Garnison marched out of the Towne 29 Coullours a foote, being about 14 comen in all, and a troope of horse.

taking three, his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: caused one of them to be carryed back againe into the towne. They had also a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred of our vvaggons to carrye awaye their hurt, and sickmen, their bagg and baggage, vvhich brought them to the Marquesse <hi>Sancte Croce</hi> his Armie. A great many of them taking their leaves of their frends in <hi>Mastricht</hi> were foxt, and in going out discharging their Musketts and firelocks, one more malicious then the rest having a bullet in his firelock, shott dead a horsemans sonne of ours, for which offence he was apprehended, and presently executed.</p>
            <p>The 24. Count <hi>Papenheym</hi> having marched to a village called <hi>Esder</hi> neere vnto a litle towne called <hi>Vysell</hi> attempted to have put a bridge over the <hi>Maze,</hi> to have hindred, and cutt of our provisions betweene <hi>Luke</hi> &amp; our Army: but hearing that <hi>Mastricht</hi> was come to a parly, that his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: had sent some forces to prevent him, &amp; that the boores round about rose vp in Armes against him, not willing to suffer the insolences of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who neere visell had murthered some of their pesants, in revenge whereof, the bores cutt the throats of some of his stragglars, he bethought himselfe, and returned back againe to his owne quarters.</p>
            <p>The 25. a daye of thankgiving was solemnized to God the Authour, and giver of this Victorie.</p>
            <p>The 26. <hi>Papenheym</hi> marched againe with 6 or 7 thousand men into the Countrie, to pillage &amp; plunder yt. vvhere his men committed cruell In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solences, breaking vp Churches, Cloisters, &amp; Gentlemens houses, spared not the Romish Catholiques themselves, especially his men payd those of the Reformed Religion. Among the rest some of his Officers &amp; Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers fell vpon a Gentlemans house, brooke vp their Chests, Truncks, and Cubbarts, and tooke aboue 20000 gilders in ready coyne from him; this did not onely content them, but also to satiate their fylthy lusts (ô horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble villany) ravished his wife, and daughters: notwithstanding the many teares &amp; cryes they made vnto them for the preserving of their chastetie.</p>
            <p>The 27. <hi>Sancta Croce</hi> removed part of his quarter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Hooght Cloister</hi> and came and laye with some off his men neerer <hi>Stockham</hi> to guard his bridge, vvhich was layd over the <hi>Maze,</hi> to goe into, and to come from Count <hi>Papenheyms</hi> quarter.</p>
            <p>The 31. the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Niewburch</hi> came againe into our Armie, to excuse <hi>Papenheyms</hi> coming against vs, now hee had declared himselfe an Enemy, aswell in his owne behalfe as in the Bishop off <hi>Cullens,</hi> but they sayd hee had noe great audience.</p>
            <p>The first of Septe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber we heard there was agreat contestation betweene

Count <hi>La Motterie,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Leyde</hi> his Vice Gouvernour, and <hi>Sancte Croce</hi> &amp; his Spaynards, hitting them in the teeth, that they had layne there all that whyle, and attempted nothing for the reliefe of <hi>Mastricht.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth of September, <hi>Papenheym</hi> being marched awaye towards <hi>Cullen, Sancte Croce</hi> tooke vp his bridg, and lett some of yt drive downe the streame, he kept it a daye, or two longer, fearing least wee should have falne in the brich of <hi>Papenheym,</hi> and have cutt off his passage.</p>
            <p>The next day he marched awaye with his foote towards <hi>Diest</hi> in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> leaving his horse in the reere of his quarters: His Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: went with our horse, to see his going off, and some of our horse entertayned skirmish with them, and bulletts changed betweene ours, and their centinells. And thus the great braggs they made, that they would give vs battle, and fight with vs before wee came home, came to nothing.</p>
            <p>The Ennemy being gone, our ordnance were drawne off from all Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and sett in order in our quarter.</p>
            <p>Vpon Sunday the 5. of September, two sermons were preached in <hi>Saint Mathews</hi> Church in <hi>Mastricht:</hi> There was a great auditorie of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, &amp; the inhabitants, as full as ever the church cold hold. After the fore nones sermon was ended Mr: <hi>Conrade Merkinius</hi> the States preacher, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming downe from the pulpit, there was an old woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that had bin of the Reformed religion all her life time, &amp; whom God preserved from death, vvhen the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi> tooke in the towne with an assault, &amp; when so many, were Masacred &amp; drownd in it by the Spanyards. This good soule hearing the sound of the Gospell againe in <hi>Mastricht,</hi> was so over ioyd, that (as Symion did to our Saviour) shee catched the preacher in her armes embrassed him, and blessed God for yt. This caused also a great reioycing to the standers by, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>: made some of them shed teares, &amp; weepe for ioye</p>
            <p>This night towards evening his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: Comaunded Monsieur <hi>Staken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brock</hi> Lieutenant Generall of the Horse, &amp; Colonell <hi>Pincen,</hi> who coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the foote, having with them certaine Dutch companies, foure peeces of ordnance, two Morters, and sufficient ammunition, laden vpon vvag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, to march vnto <hi>Limborch,</hi> sixe dutch miles beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Mastricht:</hi> on mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye morning the sixth of September they came before yt, made a Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, &amp; planted their Canon vpon the Castle, which by nature, and art was exceeding stronge, &amp; scituated vpon a sleepe Hill, overlooking the towne: after they had made some 34 shott against the Castle, they came to aparly and yeelded, finding in yt ten or twelve peeces of good ordnance, and so the States and his Ex<hi rend="sup">cie</hi>: became master of the first <hi>Dukedome</hi> of the 17 <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:4196:23"/>
It is a montaynous Country, and full of high hills, in which there are Mineralls found, and great store of Calamine stone, and copper, it is credibly reported, that these hills, especially one of them, were farmed for 300000 gilders yeerly, and besides that, this Towne and Castle brings in agreat deale of Contribution to the <hi>States</hi> from the adiacent <hi>Provinces,</hi> as <hi>Namur, Luxenburch,</hi> litle <hi>Brabant,</hi> &amp;c.
