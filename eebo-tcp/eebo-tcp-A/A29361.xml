            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nor will others want a ſerious Entertainment in this Book, to meet here ſeveral Paſſages of the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtory, and to conſider the Occonomy and Government; not forgetting alſo the Piety of <hi>Paris.</hi> To one purpoſe more this Tranſlation may be uſeful; and that is, to ſuch Young Gentlemen who go over; (as ſome do almoſt daily) in regard this Book in their Pocket with them, will be, as their Informer, ſo their Guide, and lead them directly to ſuch Sights as they moſt fanſie.</p>

            <head>The AUTHOR's Advertiſment.</head>
            <p>NO Man doubts that <hi>Paris</hi> is at preſent one of the greateſt and faireſt Cities of the World; the magnificence of her Buildings, her extent, and the almoſt infinite number of her Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; among whom there are thoſe who for Eſtates may compare with ſome Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns; and in ſine, the perpetual Concourſe of all Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> who come hither with an extream Affection to ſtudy the <hi>French</hi> Behaviour, and obſerve the Rarities of the Place: All theſe things concur to make it to be conſider'd as a City that has no equal. Yet it happens very often, that all its true Beauties are not taken notice of by many perſons, and principally the Strangers, who complain that they can never find them out without making it their particular ſtudy, and giving themſelves a vaſt trouble in the ſearch, no Deſcription having been hitherto Compoſed to inſtruct them in their Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
<pb facs="tcp:62624:5"/>
It is for their aſſiſtance, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Curioſity of Strangers that I have undertaken to deſcribe, by way of Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the moſt noted Beauties of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City. This Deſcription will be the more uſeful unto them, in regard they may inform themſelves of the ſeveral Places here noted, and may view ſeveral Things which they would have paſt by and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they had not been admoniſh'd of them before hand. To make this work the more eaſie and methodical, I have taken the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Quarters and Streets in order, as far as poſſible, that ſo the ſeveral Remarks may be ſeen as they lye.</p>
            <p>I undertake not to make an exact deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, that were almoſt impoſſible to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, what endeavours ſoever we make. I have therefore only collected thoſe things which are moſt obſervable, and that which deſerves to be ſeen with ſomewhat more than ordinary remark: Nor have I deſigned to ſearch into Antiquities; for <hi>Giles Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet,</hi> Father <hi>Breüil,</hi> and ſome others have done that already, better than any can hope to do it after them; and to them I refer ſuch as deſire to know the Originals and Foundations of places. Thoſe Authors will acquaint you with the Epitaphs and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of Private Perſons, which would have
<pb facs="tcp:62624:5"/>
ſwelled this Volume conſiderably, if I ſhould have tranſcribed them here. Beſides, it ſeems unneceſſary for a Strangers knowledge to conſider theſe things which ſerve only as private Monuments, and are of no uſe to the publick Hiſtory, for which they Travel. They take more delight, without doubt, in the deſcription of a Cabinet, a Library, or an Apartment built after the modern way, than in reading the Epitaphs at <hi>Saint Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,</hi> or to pick out the meaning of them.</p>
            <p>Without queſtion ſome will be ſurprized to ſee me undertake a Work ſo difficult as this, in ſight of ſo many learned Perſons abounding in <hi>Paris.</hi> But after all, if I prove not ſucceſsful herein, yet however I ſhall eſteem it ſufficient glory, if I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire into any able Author the deſign of a Work which may in ſome ſort anſwer to the Reputation of this great City.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as I may hereafter inform my ſelf more particularly of ſome things which I have not hitherto been able to diſcover; at the ſame time I ſhall be much obliged to thoſe, who have any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Memorials, if they will be ſo generous to communicate, and thereof advertize the Bookseller who Prints this, that ſo they may be conſulted if they pleaſe.</p>

            <head>A New DESCRIPTION OF The moſt Remarkable things IN THE CITY OF PARIS.</head>
            <p>BEfore I enter upon the matter, it may not be amiſs to ſay ſomething of the Original of <hi>Paris.</hi> If this great City be not one of the Ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> yet at leaſt ſhe may boaſt, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſpeaks advantagiouſly of her in the ſixth Book of his Commentaries; where he ſays, that having ſubdued divers Nations amongſt the <hi>Gauls,</hi> he was forced to lay Siege to <hi>Paris,</hi> which at that time was wholly encloſed between the two
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62624:7"/>
Arms of the <hi>Seine,</hi> into which place all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Neighbouring Country were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired. Here they defended themſelves with ſo much reſolution, and made ſo ſtout a Reſiſtance that he was conſtrained to draw together all the Force he could to attack and fight them. It is true he ſubdued them, but it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Labour, and after ſeveral bloody Fights; and in fine, to reduce them entirely to his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and to keep 'em ſo, he built the <hi>Great Châtelet,</hi> and placed in it a ſtrong Garriſon. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we read in other Hiſtorians, that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> being retired among the <hi>Cauls</hi> (where he remain'd a long time in that part of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> which is now call'd the <hi>Hôtel de Cluny)</hi> he built this Fortreſs, as a Check upon the People of thoſe Parts who were very uneaſie and apt to riſe: after all we muſt confeſs there is no great certainty of theſe things, by reaſon of the Ignorance of thoſe Ages that went before us, which have loſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd thoſe Memorials which ſhould have infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us of the truth, had they been now in being.</p>
            <p>As to the name of this Town; ſome ſay it was called <hi>Lutetia</hi> from King <hi>Luous,</hi> who was of great eſteem among the ancient <hi>Gauls;</hi> others, from the Latin word <hi>Lutum</hi> which ſigniſies Dirt and Mud; poſſibly becauſe its Situation, being between the two Arms of a River, there was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually plenty of Water and Dirt. And without doubt it is for this reaſon that the little ſpace of Ground which lies at the further end of the <hi>Petit Pont,</hi> between the new ſtreet of <hi>Noſtre-Dame,</hi> and the Street <hi>de la Calande,</hi> is at this day ſtill called <hi>le Marchè palud.</hi> Other Authors ſay, that the name <hi>Paris</hi> might well have been derived from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſignifies Near,

and from the Goddeſs <hi>Iſis</hi> who had formerly a Temple in that place where ſtands at preſent the Church of St. <hi>Germain des prez;</hi> from which place <hi>Paris</hi> was not far diſtant. And the Village of <hi>Iſſy</hi> near to <hi>Vaugerard</hi> might perhaps have alſo taken name from her, that Goddeſs having had a Temple there, ſerv'd by certain Prieſts, for whoſe maintenance the Lands that lay about that place were appropriated; which Lands belong at preſent to the Abbey of St. <hi>Geneviéve du Mont.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Iſis</hi> was not the only Deity that was Worſhipp'd about <hi>Paris, Cybele</hi> had alſo her Temples there. To maintain which conjecture we may here take notice of the Diſcovery which was made ſome years paſt in the Garden of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Berrier,</hi> in the Street called <hi>Coquilliere</hi> not far from the Church of St. <hi>Euſtache.</hi> As they were digging there deeper than ordinary to make the foundation of a Wall, they diſcovered the ruins of an old Tower, with a Buſt of Braſs, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Womans head ſomething bigger than the Liſe, and Crowned with a Caſtle compoſed of four Towers, with the ancient ſort of Pinacles in ſuch manner as we ſee 'em in the old Baſs reliefs of <hi>Rome,</hi> or upon Medals repreſenting the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs <hi>Cybele</hi> who was invoked for the fruitſulneſs of the Earth, and whom the Poets called <hi>Turrita Mater.</hi> All Antiquaries who ſaw this Piece did not in the leaſt queſtion its Antiquity. Among others the Reverend Father <hi>du Moulinet</hi> one of the Learnedſt Men of the Kingdom in theſe things, has printed a ſmall Tract to prove that this head might have ſerv'd in ſome Temple built in this place where this Goddeſs was adored. And even in the Library of S. <hi>Geneviéve</hi> they preſerve a Model of this Head taken off in Plaiſter with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62624:8"/>
that could be from the Original, which is at preſent in the Cabinet of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureur-General <hi>de Harlay,</hi> which illuſtrious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is perfectly acquainted with the true value of ſuch curious things. There are other Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies beſide theſe, as that of <hi>Paris</hi> King of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> whoſe dominion extended round about theſe parts, from whence it comes as ſome ſay, that the Inhabitants of the Neigbouring Villages were called <hi>Pariſii</hi> or <hi>Pariſiaci.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be tedious to ſpeak of the ſeveral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements of this Town. It is eaſily concluded that it was not always of the fame dimenſions as it is at preſent. Under the Reign of <hi>Clouis</hi> it was as yet ſhut up within the two Arms of the <hi>Seine,</hi> that is, that it took up no more ground than the <hi>Iſle du Palais,</hi> which is that part which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we call the City, with ſome few houſes on the Bank of the River next St. <hi>Germain l'Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erois;</hi> where was at that time a Wood called <hi>la Foreſt des Charbonniers.</hi> But however tho it was then but very little, it was conſidered as a Place of very great importance, ſince in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition which the Sons of <hi>Clouis</hi> made of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they agreed among themſelves that <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould remain neuter and belong to neither of the four; further, that if any of them ſhould enter there without permiſſion of the other three, he ſhould loſe all the part which he might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe pretend to.</p>
            <p>Under the ſecond Race, the Town became a little more conſiderable: they began then to build on both ſides of the <hi>Seine:</hi> all about the Church of St. <hi>Geniviéve,</hi> which <hi>Clouis</hi> had raiſed: at the upper end of the <hi>Place-Maubert;</hi> where after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Charlemagne</hi> did diſpoſe the Learned Men
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62624:8"/>
which he invited hither out of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> near St. <hi>Martins des Champs;</hi> and in divers other places in the Fields about the Town.</p>
            <p>But under the third Race it was much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> cauſed it to be paved throughout, and a certain Financier (or Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer-Officer) called <hi>Girard de Pouſſy</hi> gave to this uſe out of his own proper Revenue 11000 Marks of Silver, and this he did freely without any conſtraint from the King, in whoſe Service he had doubtleſs attained this great Sum. This was an Example of Generoſity altogether extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; and was done in the year 1185. as <hi>Monſieur de Mezeray</hi> tells us in his Hiſtory of <hi>France.</hi> This King alſo cauſed the ſeveral Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be encloſed with Walls. Thoſe of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity extended from the edge of the <hi>Seine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the Gate of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> or the Gate of the <hi>Tournelle,</hi> and ſo up behind St. <hi>Geniviéve</hi> to the Gate of St. <hi>James,</hi> and then down again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the River to the place where ſtands at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Colledge of the four Nations, and where heretofore was the Gate of <hi>Neſle</hi> taken down not long ſince to enlarge the Place. On the <hi>North</hi> ſide of the River it was alſo encloſed with Walls which had almoſt the ſame extent. There was in former times a Gate near the place where now ſtands the <hi>Quinze-Vingts,</hi> which anſwered to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other called the <hi>Porte-neuve,</hi> (or <hi>New-gate)</hi> on the Bank of the River pulled down ſome years ago, near which was a very high Tower: another Gate in the Street <hi>Coquilliere,</hi> at the end of the Street <hi>Grenelle:</hi> another in the Street of St. Denis, near the Fountain <hi>de la Reine,</hi> which was called the Painters Gate: another in the Street of S. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> at the end of the Street <hi>aux Ours:</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62624:9"/>
near S. <hi>Johns</hi> Church-yard which was called the <hi>Porte Bodais,</hi> becauſe it led to the <hi>Château</hi> or Caſtle of that name, which ſtood in that place where now is the Village of St. <hi>Maur des Foſſez</hi> beyond <hi>Charenton.</hi> Since thoſe times this great City is much augmented, and continually extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Fields, till not long ſince for ſeveral weighty Conſiderations, there have been certain Bounds preſcribed, beyond which it is not lawful to raiſe any buildings. It is to be obſerved that <hi>Paris</hi> being thus bounded, its extent is the more conſiderable, in regard there is not to be found in it any place that is not extreme full of People, and as thick of Houſes as can be contrived, in ſome of which there are continually ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Families in one houſe, which is rarely to be ſeen in other Towns, where every one deſires to dwell apart, and where there are few houſes to be found of ſeven Stories high, as they are all about the <hi>Palais;</hi> near the great <hi>Chatelet;</hi> and round the place called <hi>la Halle;</hi> in which Houſes the leaſt Rooms are full of Inhabitants and let out at dear Rates.</p>

               <p>Hiſtorians ſay that this Palace was firſt found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> in the year 1214.

This Tower was ſtanding in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62624:9"/>
the laſt Age, and had ſerved not only to keep the Kings Treaſure, but alſo had been built to receive therein the Homage and Oath of Fidelity of thoſe who held Lands of the Crown; or rather, as one may preſume, it was the <hi>Seige Seigneurial</hi> (or Head of a Tenure) upon which ſeveral <hi>Fiefs</hi> did depend. For it is well known that our Anceſtors had a cuſtom always to build in their <hi>Châteaux</hi> (or Chief Seats) a great Tower, and to raiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that another leſſer, which they called the <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>on,</hi> this they eſteemed the Mark of a Seigneurie; and without doubt this Tower at the <hi>Louvre</hi> was of the ſame nature. It was taken down when <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt began that building which at preſent is called the old <hi>Louvre.</hi> But Death hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that Prince from performing much of what he intended. <hi>Henry</hi> the Second his Son, carried on the building after the deſigns of his Father, and for the performance he made uſe of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Clugny,</hi> and <hi>John Gougeon,</hi> both <hi>Pariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and the ableſt Architects of their Time, ſince thoſe few things which we ſee of theirs paſs for the moſt regular and fineſt Architecture of the World.

it is within this place that they preſerve the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moveables of the Crown; here one may ſee a Surprizing quantiy of Tapeſtry both anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Modern, here are ſome pieces which <hi>Francis</hi> I. cauſed to be made after the Deſigns of <hi>Julio Romano,</hi> and which were wrought at <hi>Anuers</hi> by a famous Maſter of that time who had an extraordinary Reputation.

               <p>Having ſeen theſe things you ought to go next to the Palace of the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> which extends it ſelf along the Garden in one continued Line; it is compoſed at the ends of two great ſquare Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilions adorned with Pilaſters of the Compoſite Order, and of one great Pavilion, like a Dome, in the middle, under which is the great Hall and Stair-caſe that leads to the Apartments. It is to be obſerved that the middle of this Building, namely the great Pavilion, the two Terraſſes, and the two leſſer Pavilions at the Ends, were built at the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Katharine de Medicis,</hi> who was very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Architecture, as we perceive by theſe Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, which are all of a moſt curious proportion after the Ionick and Corinthian Orders, there are three Ranks of Pillars, with an Attick over head. For this work ſhe employed <hi>Philibert de Lorme</hi> and <hi>John Bulan,</hi> the prime Maſters of their Age. The reſt of the Buildings were performed by <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. who in our days hath repaired this Palace as we now ſee it. There ſtood once under the Pavilion in the middle, a great Stair-caſe, which was one of the fineſt things of its kind in the whole World, for its diſpoſition, and for the ſtrange boldneſs of the Work. Which Stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe was built after the deſigns of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Pilibert de Lorme,</hi> but of late, to the great regret of the Curious, it has been taken
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62624:14"/>
down for the meliorating the Proſpect of the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illeries</hi> to the Court, and for employing the Great Hall to the enlargement of the Kings Apartment. Which Apartment, as alſo that of the Queen, and that of Monſeigneur the Dauphin are enrich'd with excellent Paintings of the ableſt Maſters of <hi>France.</hi> In a Gallery which reaches the whole length of the Kings Apartment on the Court-ſide, you may ſee ſeveral Cabinets enrich'd with Migna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Chiſſel-work extremely fine, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tables of inlaid Stone-work very beautiful, among others one very large, upon which is the repreſentation of a Salamander, which was the device of <hi>Francis</hi> I. and therefore this is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have been his Table. Here are alſo ſome of <hi>Sicilian</hi> Marble of one Piece, of a wonderful variety of Colours. This Gallery hath often ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the Reception and Audience of Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and at ſuch times it hath been adorn'd with Rich Tapiſtry and other precious moveables.</p>
               <p>In the Rooms below are preſerved abundance of antient Statues, and the Buſt of this King made by the Cavalier <hi>Bernin</hi> when he came from <hi>Rome</hi> to draw the Deſigns of the Louvre.

               <p>The Proſpect of all this Palace is into the Garden of the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> to which Garden this Palace alſo ſerves as a moſt Magnifick Perſpective, every one of its Allies being anſwered with a face of the Building of moſt beautiful Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.

It is extreme great and may contain a great number of People. On the other ſide of the great Ally ſtands the Statue of Truth, raiſed upon a great Pedeſtal. It is the Work of a famous Sculptor called <hi>Ville Franche,</hi> who came from <hi>Cambray.</hi> Monſieur <hi>le Noſtre</hi> continued the Works in the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> and it is he alſo who manages thoſe admirable Garden-Works at <hi>Verſailles.</hi> You muſt by no means

               <p>We ought to obſerve that the old Louvre is joyned to the Palace of the <hi>Tuilleries</hi> by the great Gallery which extends it ſelf all along the River; at the end which was begun firſt there are ſeveral Paintings and other Ornaments of the deſign of Monſieur <hi>Pouſſin,</hi> but they being found too ſmall for the Place where they ſtand, the Work ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proceeded further but remained imperfect as it is, the beginning of this Gallery is the work of <hi>Philibert de Lorme,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeau,</hi> he who undertook that great ſervice at the Ditch of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> which was the chief occaſion of the taking that Rebel Town.

               <p>This Quarter begins at the <hi>Rüe de</hi> St. <hi>Denis,</hi> where we may ſee, in the firſt place, a handſom row of Houſes, built uniform with the ſame Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, at the Charges of the Canons of St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main l'Auxerrois,</hi> who raiſe out of 'em a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Revenue. This place hath been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon the Church-yard of the holy Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, which lies behind. The Charnel-houſes which are built round that Church-yard, were built, as reported, out of the Confiſcate Goods of the Jews when they were expelled <hi>Paris</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Philip Auguſtus.</hi> In probability there is not any one place in the whole World in which more dead bodies are interred; which cauſed the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador who reſided in <hi>Paris</hi> during the League, to adviſe the Citizens at ſuch time when the Famine preſſed them cruelly, to grind the Bones of the dead in this Church-yard to make Bread; but this Counſel was not followed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a drolling <hi>Spaniard:</hi> M. <hi>de Mezeray,</hi> ſo well known of the Learned for his delicate Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>France,</hi> is here Interred. You may ſee in this Place a Pyramid adorn'd with Baſs-releifs, much eſteemed, on the top of which is erected a Croſs, this was ſet up in the laſt Age during the horrible Confuſions of the League.

But this is not well proved: and it is much diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among the Hiſtorians, whether this Queen was the moſt illuſtrious, or the moſt wicked of her Age.

They have here on their great Altar a Tabernacle of a magnifick ſort of Architecture, the Pillars are of an admirable <hi>Sicilian</hi> Marble. It is a Dome raiſed very high with four Porticoes, ſupported with ſix Pillars of the compoſite order which ſtand out from the Work; the Ornaments of which are perfectly well wrought, and the Proportions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act. A great Fabrick after this Model might well pleaſe the moſt difficult Perſons in matters of Architecture. The Cardinal <hi>de Berulle</hi> is Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in one of the Cha pels, where his Tomb may be ſeen, and on it his repreſentation in white Marble. He was their Founder, as all men know. Theſe Fathers have a very handſom Library. The

place in Truth is a little too dark; but that does not impair its value, in regard it contains a great number of excellent Volumes both Printed and Manuſcript, among which are a good number of Greeks and Arabians, given them by Monſieur <hi>de Sancy,</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> to the Porte. Who during the time of his Embaſſie made an exact ſearch and collection of ſuch Greek Rarities which had ſcaped the Barbarity of the Turks Such a Library this could never be better diſpoſed of than into the cuſtody of theſe Fathers, there being among them ſome Perſons of moſt profound Learning, as appears by their Works, ſo much ſought after and bought up by all Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. One might mention here Father <hi>Cointe,</hi> and Father <hi>Senault,</hi> both which have left the World ſuch excellent Writings, the one in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the other in Moral Philoſophy; Father <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche</hi> who compoſed <hi>the Enquiry of Truth;</hi> Father <hi>Thomaſſin</hi> who wrote <hi>the Diſcipline of the Church</hi> in three Volumes in Folio; Father <hi>Dubois,</hi> who by order of Monſeigneur the Arch-Biſhop, is now about the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of <hi>Paris.</hi> This Congregation hath alſo furniſhed us with the ableſt Preachers, as Monſieur the Biſhop of <hi>Agen,</hi> ſo famous by the name of Father <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caron,</hi> the Courſe of whoſe Sermons were moſt emphatical; Father <hi>le Bouſt,</hi> and Father <hi>Hubert</hi> who Preach'd a Lent at <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> to a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous concourſe of People, and the laſt year at Court; not to mention Father <hi>Morin,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other famous Preachers who lived not long ſince.</p>
               <p>As you leave the Fathers of the Oratory, and paſs on along the <hi>Rüe St. Honorè,</hi> you ought to viſit</p>

The <hi>Palais Cardinal,</hi> which the People now call the <hi>Palais-Royal,</hi> becauſe the King was here Educated when young. The <hi>Hôtel de Sillery</hi> ſtood formerly in the little Court which is before the Gate, which Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> cauſed to be pulled down to give the better ſight to the Palace, he had then cauſed to be built here after the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Sieur <hi>Mercier,</hi> who had been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very able Architect, had he raiſed his Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſomething higher; and that is the only fault of this Palace, extremely convenient in all things elſe. It is compoſed of two ſquare Courts, of which the firſt and leaſt is compaſſed about with Battlements, and the ſecond is divided from the Garden by a row of Arches which ſupport an open Gallery which reaches from one Wing to the other, through theſe Arches, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with Iron Grates you have a Proſpect into the Garden, which was form'd as it is by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>le Noſtre</hi> after the ſame Model with the <hi>Tuilleries.</hi> As for the Apartments they are all moſt beautiful and convenient, and all the Court reſided here a long time during the Regency. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, we ought to ſee the Gallery where Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> cauſed to be painted all the famous men of <hi>France,</hi> From the time of <hi>Suger</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> down to the time of his Miniſtry: That is in effect the whole French Hiſtory from <hi>Lewis</hi> the young, to the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. Monſieur the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> dwells here at preſent, thô the Houſe belongs to the King, to whom Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> bequeathed it in his Will, together with five hundred thouſand Crowns and that Curious Suit of Tapiſtry which is expoſed on the great Feaſt of <hi>Corpus Chriſti.</hi>

You muſt not forget to ſee the Cabinet of Monſieur the Chevalier <hi>de Loraine,</hi> where are curious Pictures of the beſt Maſters, it is near the Garden which adds not a little to its beauty.</p>
               <p>In a Hall belonging to this Palace is the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre where they repreſent the <hi>Opera</hi> of famous M. <hi>de Lully,</hi> which draws to it continually a mighty concourſe of People lovers of Muſick. No part of <hi>Europe</hi> yields more pleaſing Objects, be it for the Dances, or for the Symphonie, or in fine, for the ſingularity of the Habits; but that which is moſt conſiderable, is the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful agreement of the <hi>French</hi> Muſick with the <hi>Italian,</hi> which was once thought a thing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet even in this M. <hi>de Lully</hi> hath been mighty ſucceſsful. Nor has the Age been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to his extraordinary Parts, for he draws a very great Revenue from the Repreſentations of theſe Pieces. The Verſe is ordinarily compoſed by Monſieur <hi>Quinault</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Academy: Monſieur <hi>Corneille</hi> the younger hath alſo made ſome things, and <hi>Bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The great Gate which fronts upon the <hi>Rüe Saint Honorè,</hi> is but newly built; it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of four <hi>Corinthian</hi> Pillars, that ſupport a Fronton on which are the Arms of <hi>France.</hi> The firſt Court which ſerves as a <hi>Paruis</hi> (or open Place) before the Church, is very well; and the Building over the Gate where you enter is not ill contrived. The Portal of the Church is one of the moſt Regular of all <hi>Paris,</hi> and it was the firſt Eſſay of Monſieur <hi>de Manſard.</hi> Here are two Orders of Pillars, <hi>Ionick</hi> and <hi>Corinthian,</hi> fluted and ſet off with Ornaments. Within the Church are ſome Chappels handſom enough, among others that of Monſieur the Marqueſs of <hi>Roſtaing,</hi> adorn'd almoſt like that at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main l'Auxerrois,</hi> with Pillars and Buſts of Marble. On one ſide of the great Altar you may

ſee a Tomb after the ancient manner. It is of white Marble, with a great Urn of the ſame, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly wrought; tho it has no Epitaph, yet we may conclude from the Arms in the fore part of it, that it belongs to the Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Rohan.</hi> The Quire behind the great Altar, where the Religious Sing, is adorned with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures repreſenting the Principal Actions of our Saviours Life.</p>
               <p>Theſe Fathers have very Magniſick Ornaments which with all their Plate alſo were given by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons of Quality. They have a Library, not very numerous, but however there are in it very curious Pieces. In their Cloiſter you will find divers Paintings repreſenting the Life of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> their Founder. Among theſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious there are ſome famous Preachers. As the Reverend Father <hi>Dom. Coſme,</hi> at preſent Biſhop of <hi>Lombez,</hi> the Reverend Father <hi>Hiereſme,</hi> and ſome others.

               <p>The Nuns <hi>of the Aſſumption.</hi> Theſe Nuns had their abode formerly in the Street called <hi>Ruë de la mortellerie,</hi> where they were Hoſpital-Siſters under the name of <hi>Haudriettes,</hi> their Houſe in that place having been founded by one <hi>Stephen Haudry</hi> Eſquire to the King St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and they to ſerve the poor and ſick, as Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians tell us. But being too much ſtraitned for Room in that ſtreet they removed to this place, where they changed their name as well as Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Of late years they have raiſed here ſeveral Noble buildings, eſpecially their Church, which is a <hi>Dome</hi> or <hi>Cupulo</hi> after the Roman manner, very high; the inſide of which is adorned with
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62624:21"/>
                  <hi>Corinthian</hi> Palaſters ſupporting a Corniſh, over which is a Row of Windows, between which hang certain pictures repreſenting the Life of the Holy Virgin, well painted. But the <hi>Plafon</hi> (or Painting within the Ceiling) of the Dome is that which is moſt remarkable, it was done by M. <hi>de la Foſſe,</hi> and repreſents the Aſſumption, with the Angels carrying and following the Bleſſed Virgin into Heaven, all which is both for the boldneſs of the painting, and the deſign, the fineſt that can be, and one of the moſt finiſh'd things of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Nuns Quire is very handſom, but is difficult to ſee, by reaſon of the great Grate that divides it from the Church, which Grate is no ill imitation of that at <hi>Val-de-Grace.</hi> As you go out you ought to take notice of the Portico ſupported by eight <hi>Corinthian</hi> Pillars, with a Fronton and a Corniſh, the Carving Work of which is not yet finiſhed.</p>
               <p>All this Building was deſigned by M. <hi>Herard,</hi> director of the Academy of Painters which the King maintains at <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>Having ſeen theſe things you need to proceed no further this way, there being nothing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the <hi>Fauxburgh</hi> of St. <hi>Honorè,</hi> unleſs it be the Workhouſe of Monſieur <hi>Anguerre,</hi> where you may ſee ſome works in Sculpture; and a young Garden or Nurſery which in Spring time has very curious Flowers. This laſt belongs to the King, who cauſed it to be made here, from hence to furniſh the <hi>Tuilleries</hi> with ſuch Flowers as are needful to ſet of the <hi>Parterres,</hi> there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in this place a great number of <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> well kept and preſerved.</p>
               <p>Over againſt the Nunnery of the Aſſumption is the <hi>Hôtel de Luxembourg,</hi> belonging to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62624:22"/>
the Marechal of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> who inhabits here. The Garden is extreme pleaſant.</p>
               <p>Next to this are the Capuchin Nuns, founded by <hi>Henry</hi> IV. in purſuance of the pious intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Loüiſe de Loraine,</hi> Widow of <hi>Henry</hi> III. They live very auſterely. On one ſide of their Gate, a Fountain has been erected on which are theſe two Verſes of Monſieur <hi>de Santeüil.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Hôtel</hi> of <hi>Vendôme</hi> is near this, and takes up a long Space in the Street. It was built by the Duke of <hi>Vendôme</hi> natural Son of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. who always lived here. The inſide is very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. The Front of the great Stair-caſe which is of the deſſigne of M. <hi>Manſard,</hi> is adorn'd with many Pillars which as you come in make a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſhew. The Garden is great but neglected as is all the reſt of the Houſe. The Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dôme</hi> Governor of <hi>Provence,</hi> and Grandſon of him above-mentioned lives at preſent in the Temple, with Monſieur the Grand Prior of <hi>France,</hi> his Brother.</p>

               <p>People give it that name becauſe the Duke of <hi>Amville</hi> Earl of <hi>Brion,</hi> for ſome time made his abode here. This Building is part of the Palais Royal, and was begun by the Cardinal of <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> who deſigned it for his Library. But ſome years ſince the King hath given it to two Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that of Painting, and that of Architecture. The firſt of theſe was eſtabliſhed by M. <hi>des Noyers,</hi> under the direction of M. <hi>de Chambray</hi> Brother of M. <hi>de Chant-Loup,</hi> from whoſe pen we have ſeveral excellent pieces in print, among others, <hi>The Parallel of the Ancient and Modern Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, Palladio tranſlated into French,</hi> &amp;c. This Academy was re eſtabliſhed by Monſieur the <hi>Chancelier Seguier,</hi> after whoſe death that beautiful <hi>Catafalque</hi> at the Fathers of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, was erected to his Memory as to their Protector.

Art of Painting, an Art that requires a moſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous Study.

The Repreſentations and Buſts of ſeveral perſons who have contributed to the eſtabliſhment of this Academy are here alſo preſerved.

               <p>In a lower Gallery they keep a many Buſts and ancient Statues which the King hath ſent for out of <hi>Italy.</hi> There is a very conſiderable number of them which are placed in Ranks one degree higher than another as in an Amphitheater; in which place there ſtands alſo a Model in Plaiſter of that beautiful Pillar which the Roman Senate Conſecrated to the Memory of the Emperor <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan,</hi> which is the beſt Monument that remains of the ancient Grandeur of <hi>Rome:</hi> by this we may ſee the Perfection to which the Ancients had brought the Art of deſigning. The King cauſed this Model to be made at a very great expence: It hath coſt near two hundred thouſand Franks. <hi>Francis</hi> I. had made the ſame thing with a deſign to have raiſed ſuch another Pillar at <hi>Fontainebleau;</hi> but Death preventing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Stones <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

M. <hi>Felibien</hi> hath the care and overſight of theſe things, to place them in their proper ſtations. No man underſtands theſe matters better than himſelf, as appears ſufficiently by his Works. We ſhall ſay in its proper place how much the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are obliged to him for thoſe Books with which he has enrich'd the Publick, as his Dictionary of the Arts; his lives of the Painter, which he has publiſhed in four Volumes, perfectly well writ, beſides which we have hardly any thing on that Subject in our Language: with ſeveral other pieces on divers ſubjects of Archi tecture and Painting.</p>

The other Academy eſtabliſhed in this <hi>Palais Brion</hi> is that of Architecture, which takes up all the Apartments at the further end of the Court. This Academy the King erected in the year 1672. and placed it under the Authority of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant of the Buildings, of which the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monſieur <hi>Blondel</hi> is the Director. Who had the honour to teach the Mathematicks to the Dauphin, of whom we ſhall ſpeak more at large when we come to treat of his Cabinet. It is he alſo who makes the publick Lectures of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture in this place. The Hall where the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Academy aſſemble is adorned with curious deſigns, and one may eaſily diſtinguiſh from the reſt, the Model which the Chevalier <hi>Bernin</hi> made of the <hi>Louvre</hi> when the King ſent for him from <hi>Rome</hi> on this account.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the Court is placed a Horſe of Braſs a little bigger than the life. This the King cauſed to be brought from <hi>Nancy.</hi> It ſtands upon a Pedeſtal, and remains here till it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to ſome place where it may be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to publick View.</p>
               <p>When you go from hence you ought to viſit the Houſe of Monſieur <hi>de la Foſſe,</hi> who dwells croſs the way: here you may ſee ſeveral Pieces of Painting in his way, much eſteemed.</p>
               <p>Obſerve as you go that the <hi>Rüe de Richelieu</hi> for the length, and for the beauty of the Houſes, which are all built in a ſtrait Line, is one of the moſt beautiful and regular Streets of <hi>Paris.</hi> It takes its name from the great Cardinal <hi>de Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> who during his Miniſtry, cauſed it to be conſiderably enlarged, and the Gate to be made at the end which leads out of Town on the ſide next <hi>Montmartre.</hi> In the ſame Street theſe

               <p>As you go forward you come to the houſe of M. <hi>Mignard,</hi> who has by him many Curioſities. From thence you go to</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hôtel de Jarz,</hi> ſo called from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of <hi>Malta,</hi> who bought the Ground of the Abbot of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> and built it. It is one of the beſt Works of Monſieur <hi>Manſard</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p>The Gate is a curious piece, and the Stair-caſe is very light, and conſequently pleaſant: The Apartments are large and high. But to ſay the Truth, they are not ſo convenient as beautiful. On the Garden ſide are contrived two ſmall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets (or Cloſets) ſupported with Pillars with much Art and Induſtry, but they are two ſmall for the bigneſs of the Pillars which ſupport them.</p>
               <p>Adjoyning to this is the <hi>Hôtel de Louvois:</hi> there are many things to be taken notice of in this houſe, but more eſpecially the Stair-caſe, and the Room of Audience. As for the Apartments they are contrived to the beſt advantage, and no man can deſire better Furniture than is ſeen here.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62624:26"/>
Rich Tapiſtry, Branches for Candles, Tables, Looking-glaſſes of Silver, Embroidered Beds, and in fine, all that can contribute to magnificence and neatneſs, may be here ſeen, every thing in its proper place. The face of the Building on the Garden ſide, and that next the Court correſpond and are both of a curious Symetry. You muſt not neglect to obſerve as you paſs, the Locks on the doors, which are very finely wrought, and kept with ſuch care that they ſhew like Silver.</p>
               <p>Over againſt this <hi>Hôtel</hi> is a long Gallery, in which was formerly kept the Library of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> at preſent in the College of the four Nations. The Stable was underneath. The Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> uſes the Chambers that are at the end, where you may ſee ſome Ceiling pieces well Painted. Of late this Gallery hath been broken through, to make room for a new ſtreet that runs croſs from the <hi>Rüe Vivien</hi> to the <hi>Rüe de Richelieu,</hi> to which they have given the name of Monſieur <hi>Colbert.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the further end of the <hi>Rüe de Richelieu</hi> you come into the Street of S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> ſo called from the Religious men of that Saints Order, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called <hi>les petits Peres</hi> (the little Fathers) whoſe houſe ſtands at the end and takes up part of this Street.</p>
               <p>In this Street are many very fair houſes. About three or four years ſince the Sieur <hi>Douilly</hi> Receiver of the Generalty of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> built one over againſt the Nuns of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> on which he hath laid out one hundred thouſand Crowns: there is nothing wanting but a little more Room, but it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have allotted more to the Work, it being ſhut up between the <hi>Petits-peres,</hi> and the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Vivien.</hi> Otherwiſe all is handſom. The Stair-caſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62624:27"/>
is very light and large, and the Gate contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after the manner of a Vault is very well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned; I ſay nothing of the Moveables, for one may well conclude that a houſe which appears ſo well without, wants for no Furniture, and that the beauty within is equal to that on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Street ſtands the <hi>Hôtel de Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi> This Houſe hath for a long time been juſtly eſteemed one of the faireſt of <hi>Paris.</hi> It did once belong to the Sieur <hi>Monerot,</hi> who ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no Coſt to make it Glorious. And it ſtill preſerves its Beauty, for its Furniture is moſt magnificent, ſince it came to the Duke of <hi>Gramont.</hi> It looks towards <hi>Montmartre</hi> which renders its ſituation extreme pleaſant.</p>
               <p>Near this is the <hi>Hôtel de Grantè,</hi> not all out ſo magnificent, but very commodious and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, becauſe of its Garden which is one of the neateſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> the abode of the Mareſchal of that name. This <hi>Hôtel</hi> did once belong to the Sieur <hi>Thevenin,</hi> who was a very curious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Not far from hence is the <hi>Houſe of St. Cotte-Blanche.</hi> Here was formerly a very good Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and it was once adorned with very good Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture and curious Pictures, but its Maſter having changed his Fortune, all theſe things are now diſperſed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Houſe of M. Fremont,</hi> and ſeveral others that look upon the Fields, are not unpleaſant.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of M. <hi>de Bois-Franc,</hi> Intendant of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> which is on the other ſide of the Street, is one of the moſt finiſhed things that can be ſeen. The face of the Building next the Court is extreme regular, ſet off with a kind
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62624:27"/>
of Portico whoſe Pillars are of the <hi>Ionick</hi> Order, with Vaſes on the top done about with Feſtons and other Ornaments, all which give you a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing object as you enter. Round about the Court are Buſts of Emperors placed between the Arches that ſupport the Building. The Stair-caſe is very ſpacious, with a Baluſtrade of Wood painted like white Marble, and wrought with a great deal of deſign. The <hi>Baſ-reliefs</hi> on the Doors of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Apartments, tho they be but of Plaiſter, are notwithſtanding very Ornamental. There is alſo in this Houſe a Cabinet (or Cloſet) of very choice Books. As you go out you ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the great Gate which is extremely well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived on a very odd ſort of a Foundation.</p>

               <p>The Houſe wherein this is kept hath but a very ordinary appearance; and one would hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve by the outſide, that it contains within ſo many curious things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, here is kept the Kings Library, which was heretofore at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> which <hi>Charles</hi> V. began, and which has been ſince much augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Francis</hi> I. and <hi>Catherine de Medicis.</hi>

But of late years it hath been made much more numerous, in regard that at preſent here are more than fifty thouſand Volumes, among which are twelve, or fifteen thouſand Manuſcripts in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek, Arabick, Syriack, Latin, French, and almoſt all Languages. As for printed Books, there is no rare piece that can be heard of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but you may find here a Copy.

The Duke of <hi>Bethune,</hi> hath compoſed a conſiderable number touching the moſt important Negotiations which have been from the time of <hi>Francis</hi> I. to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu.</hi> All theſe Volumes are curiouſly bound in Turkie-Leather of a Flame-colour, gilt, and the Kings Arms on the Covers. Books of Prints have here alſo their proper places, of which there are here ſeveral great Volumes Collected by Monſieur the Abbot <hi>Marolles,</hi> the moſt curious perſon of his time, in theſe matters. The ſeveral Maſters are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ſeveral Shelves, the <hi>Italians, Flemings,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> ſo that without much trouble one may obſerve their peculiar ways and fancies, and how theſe great Maſters arrived to perfection in the Art of Painting, by different Roads. Here are alſo ſeveral Ancient Volumes of Limnings or Miniatures, well and carefully preſerved, in which one may remarque the ſingularity of the Habits of our Anceſtors, and their odd fancies in deſigning; but the moſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62624:28"/>
beautiful things of this kind are certain Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Animals and Plants, deſign'd upon Vellum, after the life, by Monſieur <hi>Robert,</hi> who hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured a long time to render this Work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as we now ſee it. Here you may ſee a very great Volume in Folio, containing all ſorts of Sea-Fiſh, this the States of <hi>Holland</hi> preſented to Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> after a good Office re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from that Miniſter, in a long Negotiation; and after his death it was placed in this Cabinet. In fine you may view in this Library whatſoever Book you can deſire upon any Subject.

               <p>Books are not the only Curioſity to be ſeen in this place. The Medals here are one of the moſt conſiderable Treaſures. Here are of all ſorts, Ancient and Modern, no leſs than twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.

As for the Moderns here are all that can be met with not only of Popes, Kings, Princes of <hi>Grmany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> but of every other Nation, even the very Jettons (or Counters) which remarque any particular event of Hiſtory are here preſerved.

               <p>But one of the greateſt and moſt ſingular Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Cabinet, in the Judgment of all men, is the Tomb of <hi>Childeric</hi> the fourth King of <hi>France,</hi> who lived in the year 458. and was the immediate Predeceſſor of <hi>Clouis.</hi> This Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was diſcovered at <hi>Tournay</hi> in the year 1653. As certain Workmen were digging near the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church in an old Burial-place in order to lay a Foundation for a Sacriſty; they firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the skeliton of a Horſes Head, and after that near the ſame place a long Stone in nature of a Tomb, which Stone the Workmen were fain to break before they could remove it; But they were ſurpriſed to find under it the Bones of a Man all lying in their natural and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſituation. Curioſity urging them to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this diſcovery ſtill further, they found among the Bones a good quantity of Greek Medals of Gold, of the latter Empire, with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Flies of the ſame metal, with their wings half open, and enamelled with Cornelian. The noiſe of this ſpread over the Town immediately, and the Canons of the Cathedral Church came to the place to conſider what theſe things might diſcover. In fine, they ſtill found further a kind of Claſp, a great Buckle, and an Oxes head of Gold alſo, which laſt was apparently the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of that Divinity which they at that time Worſhiped. There was alſo a Sword garniſhed with the ſame metal. But that which effectually diſcovered this to be the Tomb of King <hi>Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric,</hi> was a Seal-Ring of Gold, on which was cut a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62624:29"/>
head, with theſe words about it, <hi>Sigillum Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derici Regis.</hi> We need not ſay that there was alſo certain Table-books, with their needle or pen, of gold, the Iron head of a Battle-axe almoſt conſumed with ruſt, with a Ball of Chriſtal ſolid and round like an egg which ſerved in his Sickneſs to cool his mouth, or for ſome other uſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Cuſtom of that age, now unknown. All theſe things were collected together with a great deal of care. And the Arch Duke who was then Governor of the Low-Countries, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to have this precious Monument for his own Cabinet, the Canons of <hi>Turney</hi> could not refuſe him; but that Prince dying, it came to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours poſſeſſion. After this the Elector of <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gne,</hi> who had uſed his utmoſt endeavours to obtain it from the Arch-Duke in his life-time, made now the ſame requeſts to the Emperour, who ſent him the Monument as ſoon as he deſired. This the Elector preſented to the King, who cauſed it to be placed in his own Cabinet, where it is now preſerved as an evidence of the high An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of the French Monarchy, and the original of the <hi>Flowers-de-Lis,</hi> contrary to what <hi>Chiflet</hi> hath writ in his Book called <hi>Anaſtaſis Childerici,</hi> to which Book Monſieur <hi>de St. Amant</hi> hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well anſwered and made it apparent that thoſe things which they found in the Tomb like Flies, were indeed <hi>Flowers-de-Lis,</hi> and not Bees, as that Author imagines.</p>
               <p>Under M <hi>Carcavi,</hi> abovementioned, M. <hi>Vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant</hi> is employed in keeping the Medals, who hath been ſeveral times in the <hi>Levant,</hi> to make Collections of ſuch things. He publiſhed in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin not many years ſince a Hiſtory of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Seleucides,</hi> collected from the Medals

in this Cabinet, in which he has diſcovered his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found knowledge in this Science, and hath at the ſame time been mighty ſerviceable to the Learned in explaining many things, which they would hardly have underſtood perfectly without his help.</p>
               <p>Here you may ſee alſo over the Chimny ſeveral other Antiquities, as <hi>Lacrimatories,</hi> ſuch as the Ancients uſed to gather the tears in of thoſe that wept at Funerals and then place 'em in the Tombs; Lamps; little Idols, and abundance of ſuch like things.</p>

The <hi>Hôtel Colbert,</hi> where dwelt the deceaſed Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> Miniſter and Secretary of State, and Controller general of the Finances (or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.) There appears in this Fabrick much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity with an excellent Guſt and very peculiar. The Court is ſquare, and the Buildings about it of ſuch a neat contrivance that you can hardly meet with the like elſewhere. The Apartments are diſpoſed with wonderful Judgment. But that which is moſt obſervable is the Portal on the Court-ſide, which is formed Vault-faſhion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme skilfully, with the Kings Buſt in the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of it, of Chevalier <hi>Bernini</hi>'s hand. This piece of Work is in its kind one of the beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and handſomeſt things that can be ſeen. The Library is none of the leaſt conſiderable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of this <hi>Hôtel,</hi> it is one of the faireſt that we have at preſent, for the number of Books, but chiefly for the very conſiderable Manuſcripts which are not to be met with elſe where. Among others there is a very Ancient Bible, of the time of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, with a great many Volumes of Negotiations in the time of Monſieur the Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> which take up all that end of the Gallery next the Houſe, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Abbot <hi>Baluze</hi> is the Library-keeper, which Learned Perſon is ſo well known through all <hi>Europe</hi> that it is needleſs to ſay any thing here in his commendation. He hath publiſhed ſeveral Works which ſufficiently diſcover his profound knowledge, among others <hi>Capitularia Regum Fancorum</hi> in three Volumes in Folio; certain Learned Diſſertations on ſeveral conteſted Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and in fine, ſome Pieces which time had concealed, and which with great Study and pains he daily brings to light under the Title of <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellanea,</hi>

to which he prefixes proper Prefaces, by which we are acquainted with the Lives and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Authors. Moſt part of theſe excellent things he draws from the Manuſcripts of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary. On one ſide of this Houſe lies</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hôtel de Boüillon la Marq.</hi> Of late this is joyned to the <hi>Hôtel Colbert,</hi> and as it is now re-built it is much more commodious and neat than formerly.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of M. <hi>de Menars</hi> Maſter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in the Generality of <hi>Paris</hi> is in the ſame Row next the <hi>Rüe du Mail.</hi> You may here ſee the famous Library of the <hi>Meſſieurs de Thou.</hi> The Name of thoſe Illuſtrious Perſons to whom it hath belonged, cannot but raiſe our eſteem and curioſity for ſuch a Collection, and by the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Catalogue we may eaſily perceive the number and rarity of the Books. M. <hi>Queſnel</hi> who hath the care of them, hath placed them in the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt order that can be deſired, and this Library hath loſt nothing of the Beauty and Reputation which it formerly had when it belonged to <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs de Thou,</hi> which makes us hope that it may alſo e're long be publick as it was formerly. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning again from the <hi>Rüe de petits-Champs,</hi> you go to</p>
               <p>The <hi>Palais Mazarin.</hi> There is no place in <hi>Paris</hi> where you will meet with more Curioſities. or ſee richer Furniture than in this Palace. The front of the Building on that ſide next the Court is of Brick and Free-Stone, with two Statues of white Marble, which ſhew curiouſly as you enter. The Stair-caſe on the right hand leads to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, compoſed of many Chambers whoſe Cielings are adorned with Gilding and Pictures of the beſt Maſters of the Age: As for the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62624:32"/>
it is in all the Rooms Magnific, and it is continually changed with the Seaſon of the year; In one of the Chambers, all the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths Work, as a great Branch for lights, the Chenets, and ſeveral other things, were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by the famous Cavalier <hi>Bernini,</hi> which is infinitely more eſteemed by the curious than the Metal of which they are wrought. After you have gone through ſeveral Chambers on the ſame floor, hung with rich Tapiſtry heightned with Gold and Silver, you are brought into a Gallery filled on each ſide with Cabinets adorned with precious Stones, and Chizil-work in Gold and Silver, placed upon Tables of Marble or inlaid Stone. You ſee there alſo Vaſes of <hi>Jaſper</hi> and <hi>Alablaſter</hi> of ſeveral ſizes, with little Statues in Braſs of delicate Workmanſhip. The floor of this Gallery is covered with a Turky-work Carpet all of one piece, and of an extraordinary length. The Apartments below Stairs are no leſs magnific than thoſe above. All the Rooms are full of <hi>Germain</hi> Cabinets, and <hi>China,</hi> with Trunks of <hi>Japan,</hi> wonderfully light and ſweet: beſides this here are abundance of Marble Statues brought out of <hi>Italy</hi> with extraordinary Coſt. In one of theſe Rooms you may ſee on a Table, a ſmall Figure of the ſame Piece; it is about half a foot high and repreſents a <hi>Cibelle</hi> holding a Book in her hand, this is mightily eſteemed. In another Room near this are ſeveral great Tables of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry and Marble; the Lower-Gallery and the Hall through which you paſs to it, are alſo full of Buſts and ancient Statues. This Galery is of the ſame length with that of which I have already ſpoke. In fine, no one place can ſhew us toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo great variety of curious things; Clocks,

Pendulums of an extraordinary nature, Statues of Silver, and Silver gilt, with Vaſes of the ſame, and all theſe things very numerous. On <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> Day ſome of the Rich Tapiſtry belonging to this <hi>Hôtel</hi> is expoſed to publick View, of which there is enough to hang a whole ſtreet.</p>
               <p>Before the Gate they place the rich <hi>Houſſes,</hi> (or Trappings) embroidered with Gold and Silver, which Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> cauſed to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cerimonies of the Kings Marriage; they are ſurpriſingly magnificent.

               <p>The <hi>Hôtel de Lionne,</hi> which the late Monſieur <hi>de Lionne,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Berni,</hi> and Secretary of State, built from the Ground, for which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the Sieur <hi>de Veau</hi> the Kings Architect.

There was a deſign of building a Library here, but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters death arriving too ſoon, put a ſtop to the performance.</p>

of that of <hi>Trajan</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> Report ſays that this was built by <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> who had great skill in Aſtrology, and that ſhe uſed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to go up to the top of this Pillar to make her Obſervations. Joyning to the Walls of this Hotel ſtands the Chappel which ſerves only for the uſe of thoſe of the Family. It is called the Queens Chappel, becauſe it was built at the ſame time with the reſt of the Houſe, and <hi>Catherine de Medicis</hi> came often hither to hear Maſs in publick. Near this is the Street called <hi>Rüe de Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelle</hi> in which ſtands</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hôtel Seguier.</hi> This was formerly called the <hi>Hôtel de Bellegarde,</hi> it being built by the Duke of that name while he was great Maſter of the Horſe of <hi>France</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. who imployed him in great Negotiations and ſent him to <hi>Florence</hi> in order to his Marriage with <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Medicis.</hi> Monſieur the Chancellor <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guier,</hi> when he came to dwell here enlarged it very conſiderably, and built that beautiful Gallery which takes up one ſide of the Garden. The inſide is extreme handſom, and the Wain ſcot Work is of the beſt kind that one can deſire to ſee, all is gilt and adorn'd with Pictures done by the Sieur <hi>Voëte,</hi> who had the Reputation in his time, of a good Painter. There are alſo ſome Landſkips done by other good Maſters, which are admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. That which was very remarkable in this Gallery during the life of Monſieur the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, was a great number of <hi>Porcelain</hi> Veſſels that were placed all round the Gallery upon the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and which made the fineſt ſhew that could be. It was difficult to find in any one place a greater quantity, and better collected. Here were alſo Cabinets placed between the Windows
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62624:35"/>
on both ſides. At the end of this Gallery you enter on the left hand into a Chamber which was richly adorned with Tapiſtry, where were ſeveral rich pieces of Goldſmiths work, among others, a great Frame curiouſly wrought in which ſtood the Picture of the late Monſieur the Chancellor done by M. <hi>le Brun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You might alſo have ſeen here a Cabinet of Ebony enriched with ancient Agates repreſenting the Emperors heads, and in a little Cabinet near this, a great number of Animals very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſome in Vaſes, and ſome in Pictures, wrought by the beſt Maſters of <hi>Italy,</hi> and by thoſe who dwelt at <hi>Limoges</hi> in the laſt Age. Madame the Chanceliere, who deceaſed not long ſince, had here a Cabinet of Cryſtal moſt delicately cut, with abundance of Watches and Clocks, enriched with precious ſtones: few Houſes in <hi>Europe</hi> had a greater quantity of Silver Veſſels. You might have ſeen here a whole Service of Silver gilt moſt magnificently, each piece being extraordinary both for the bigneſs and workmanſhip. But that which was the greateſt Ornament of this Noble Houſe was the numerous Libary, valued at near two hundred thouſand Crowns. Which Library was firſt begun by Monſieur the Preſident <hi>Seguier,</hi> and by him given in his Will to his Nephew, Monſieur the Chancellor. It was ſituate over the Gallery of which we have already ſpoken. We need not ſay that it was full of very curious Books, that may eaſily be ſuppoſed ſince it was collected by the ableſt man of his Age, and to ſay all, by him whom the French Academy made choice of for their Protector after the deceaſe of the great Cardinal <hi>de Richlieu,</hi> in whoſe Houſe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways aſſembled till ſuch time as the King ſetled
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62624:35"/>
them in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where at preſent they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. There were in this Library a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of very rare Manuſcripts, whoſe names we find cited by Authors who have here made uſe of them. We may expect one day to ſee a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of them, which was never yet made publick. But this will not be till the Inventory be finiſhed, and then all theſe choice Books which have been ſo long collecting together with ſo much pains by the greateſt men of their time, ſhall be expoſed to publick Sale, and diſperſed among thoſe who will give the prizes demanded. Such was the ſtate of this <hi>Hôtel</hi> during the life of Monſieur the Chancellor <hi>Seguier,</hi> who held that great Office for many years with univerſal applauſe, and that during very unſetled times:</p>
               <p>At the end of the <hi>Rüe de grenelle,</hi> you come into the <hi>Rüe Platriere,</hi> in which Street ſtand two fair Houſes.</p>
               <p>That of Monſieur <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> and that of the late Monſieur <hi>de Herval,</hi> Controller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Finances. The laſt of theſe was built with much care. You may ſee there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral good paintings of Monſieur <hi>Mignard,</hi> and a Bed with its Furniture extreme Rich. This Houſe ſtands in the place where were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Stables belonging to the <hi>Hôtel de Eper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Rüe Coquéron</hi> at the end of the <hi>Rüe du Bouloy,</hi> is</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hôtel de Geſures,</hi> whoſe outſide is neat and Furniture within very handſom. It did once belong to Monſieur <hi>de Fontenay-Mareüil,</hi> ſo well known for his famous Embaſſies, and above all for that to <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:62624:36"/>
Further on is the Houſe of the Sieur <hi>Monginot,</hi> built but four or five years ſince. On which he hath made a conſiderable expence. It looks very great on the Court-ſide, and the Apartments which are diſpoſed in <hi>enfilades</hi> (or through Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) are magnificently furniſhed with Tapiſtry, Chenets of Silver, and all the Furniture for the Chimny of the ſame; In fine, all is extreme neat, and nothing ſeems wanting, unleſs it were a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more light to the Stair-caſe, but as it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it is impoſſible to make it lighter.</p>

The Grandeur of the Building, the number of the Pillars which in truth are a little too thick crowded together, and the heighth of the Roof, with the Chappels that are round it, conſidered altogether, render this Edifice Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick. Among other things the two Chappels which are on each ſide of the great Gate ought to be obſerved. One of which is appropriated to Baptiſm, and Painted by Monſieur <hi>Mignard,</hi> the other for Marriage, and Painted By Monſieur <hi>de la Foſſe:</hi> Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> did contribute to their decoration. In the Chappel of Marriage ſtands the Model of the great Portal which is to be raiſed before this Church, which Work will be

very expenſive. The Pulpit is well wrought in imitation of that at St. <hi>Eſtienne du Mons,</hi> but it falls ſhort of that. Overhead is a great Picture repreſenting the Apparition of our Lord, painted after the manner of Monſieur <hi>le Brun;</hi> this Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was given by Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> as ſeems by his Arms at the bottom. Adjoyning to one of the Pillars in the <hi>Nave</hi> on the left hand as you enter, you ſee a great <hi>Baſ-relief</hi> of white Marble on a Foundation of black, which is the Epitaph of the famous Monſieur <hi>de la Chambre,</hi> ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for his Writings, this is contrived in a <hi>Medaillon</hi> held up by Immortality, and to make her more obvious and better underſtood, over head is a <hi>Cartel</hi> or Scroul with theſe words out of the Scripture graven therein</p>
               <q>Spes illorum Immortalitate plena eſt.</q>
               <q>Their Hope is full of Immortality.</q>
               <p>This curious piece is the Workmanſhip of the Sieur Baptiſt <hi>Turcy,</hi> who wrought after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Monſieur <hi>le Brun.</hi> The other things in this Church are of no great conſideration. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Chancellor <hi>Seguier,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Bullion</hi> Sur-Intendant of the Finances under the Miniſtration of Cardinal <hi>de Richolieu,</hi> were Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors to this Work. Monſieur <hi>de la Mothe le Vayer,</hi> formerly Tutor to Monſieur, and ſo well known for his rare Writings, and Monſieur the Abbot of <hi>Bourfay</hi> of the French Academy, are enterred here.</p>

The Portal, tho it makes no great ſhew outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet within it is of ſingular beauty, adorned with Corinthian Pilaſters of an admirable Guſt.

               <p>Theſe are the principal things that are to be ſeen in this Quarter.</p>
               <p>Behind St. <hi>Euſtache</hi> lies the <hi>Rüe Montmartre,</hi> near the further end of which Street ſtands the little Church of St. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in whoſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard is interred the famous <hi>Moliere,</hi> ſo well known for his Comedies.</p>
               <p>Near St. <hi>Euſtache</hi> is the great Market called <hi>la Halle</hi> which place ought to be avoided as much as may be, becauſe of the continual Crowd of People that frequent it. Formerly they executed the Criminals here as they do now at the <hi>Greve.</hi> And we read in the Hiſtory of <hi>Charles</hi> VI. that the Provoſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> named <hi>Montaigu,</hi> who was alſo great Treaſurer, had in this place by means of the Duke of <hi>Bourgoyn</hi> his head chopt off; to the great regret of the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very good man. But the King abhorring this cruel Act of Injuſtice, which had been done in his Name during the time of his diſtraction, reſtored his Memory and Family again to their former honour; and the <hi>Celeſtins</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> to whom he had given his Houſe of <hi>Marcouſſy,</hi> went and took down his Body from the Gibbet at <hi>Monfaucon,</hi> four Months after his Death, and having performed his Funeral Offices in the moſt Magnificent manner they could, they interred his Body at <hi>Marcouſſy,</hi> where they raiſed him a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, which remains at this day. This was a rare example of gratitude and generoſity in

Monks, as is well obſerved by <hi>Juvenal des <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſius</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Reins,</hi> a faithful Hiſtorian of that Kings Reign.</p>
               <p>Near the <hi>Rüe Montorgueil</hi> is the <hi>Hôtel de Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogne;</hi> which Houſe the ancient Dukes of that name formerly gaveto the Brotherhood of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>Trinity</hi>-Hoſpital in the <hi>Rüe S. Denis,</hi> on condition that they ſhould repreſent here interludes of Devotion; but ſince thoſe times Peoples Reliſh being changed, they have ſince repreſented here other Plays of Profane Subjects. And at preſent the <hi>Italian</hi> Comedians are poſſeſſed of this Houſe, ſince the union of the two Companies of French Players, which the King cauſed three or four years ago. This Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre is perhaps one of the Ancienteſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> for it is thought that there have been publick Shows in this place ſix hundred years ago. In former times Comedies were only repreſented by wandring Companies of Pilgrims of the holy Sepulchre of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who were ſince called <hi>Jongleurs.</hi> Theſe having no certain Reſidence uſed at the corners of Streets, to relate the Adventures which they had met with in their Travels, and People being concerned at their ſtories, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerating the ſeveral dangers they had paſſed through, would give them very liberally conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Alms. The ancient Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> ſeeing People take ſome pleaſure in hearing them, he gave them a Room in his <hi>Hôtel,</hi> where all people might come and hear them with better conveniency than in the Street. But in time, theſe Maſters of devout Subjects degenerated into profane Tales, and in effect ſo very profane that they became meer Farces and very irregular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations. In ſuch ſort that Chriſtianity could
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62624:38"/>
not honeſtly permit them. Thus it laſted during the ignorance of thoſe Ages. And it was this that ſtill gives occaſion to thoſe who do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the difference between this ancient ſort of Comedies and thoſe now acted, to conſound all together. Whereas in truth the nature of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is ſo far changed, by the care of the great Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> that there remains nothing of that which made it Condemned.</p>
               <p>ADjoyning to the <hi>Rüe Montorgüeil,</hi> is the <hi>Rüe Mont-martre,</hi> and divers little ſtreets run from one to the other, the Principal of which is the <hi>Rüe de Cleri</hi> in which ſtands the Houſe of M. <hi>Bertelot,</hi> Intendant of the Houſhold to Madam the Dauphineſs. It is compoſed of two joyning Courts, of a very particular deſign. The Furniture is very handſom.</p>
               <p>Near this is another Houſe belonging to the <hi>Sieur Rolland,</hi> built after the deſigns of Monſieur <hi>des Argues</hi> a famous Architect: by the outward appearance you may eaſily conclude that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to one of an excellent Judgment. But the inſide and the Front next the Court ſurpaſs all the reſt. Nothing can be more regular nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proportioned than the Staircaſe, which is raiſed upon a very odd ſort of Plan, and where the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect had need of all his Art and Study to have made it as it is.</p>
               <p>This is all of note in this Quarter. Some other things there may be of which I have not ſpoke; but they appear of ſo little Conſideration that they are not thought worth mentioning. In the next place we paſs to</p>

It did heretofore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a Community of Townſmen, who made among themſelves a kind of little Republick, which bore ſuch Credit and Authority among the Inhabitants, that often times there happened great Diſorders through the diſcontent of theſe People, who under the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> VI. took part with the Factious. At preſent this Butchery is reunited to the reſt of <hi>Paris.</hi> Further on is</p>
               <p>The Hoſpital of the Nuns of St. <hi>Catherine,</hi> Theſe are bound to entertain for one night ſuch poor Maids as are in want.

               <p>Near this is the Church of St. <hi>Opportune.</hi> This was formerly a Priory of Nuns depending on the Abby of <hi>Almaneche</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Dioceſs of <hi>Seeze,</hi> but at preſent it is a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate Church of eight or ten Chanons, who here perform the Eccleſiaſtical Offices.

Whoſe Inſtitution is to go abroad into remote Villages and there to inſtruct the poor Peaſants, and alſo to teach the young Clerks the Ceremonies of the Church; hence it is that at the four times appointed yearly for Ordination, all thoſe who are to be preſented to the Arch-Biſhop for Orders, ought firſt to paſs here eleven days in exhortations and inſtructions, during which time theſe Fathers are obliged to entertain

               <head>The Temple.</head>
               <p>This old Building ſtill keeps the name of the Knights Templers of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to whom it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly belonged. It is well known what a cruel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace befel them under the reign of <hi>Philip</hi> the fair. The <hi>Croiſades</hi> (or Pilgrimages to the Holy Land) being ceaſed, by reaſon of the Turks general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion in all parts of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> theſe Knights whoſe Inſtitution was to conduct the Pilgrims to the Holy Places, thought themſelves excuſed from that Office any longer, in which there was ſuch apparent Danger: Hereupon they amaſſed up vaſt Riches, and withal became ſo proud and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that as Hiſtorians ſay, Pope <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ement</hi> V. and <hi>Philip</hi> the fair agreed together to ruin and utterly aboliſh the whole Order, as a puniſhment for their Crimes and ſcandalous Debauchery. They began with the great Maſter, who with two of his Companions the moſt illuſtrious of the Order, the Pope under a ſpecious pretext ſent for out of the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> As ſoon as they were come to <hi>Paris</hi> they were committed to Priſon, and being cruelly tortured till they confeſſed thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Crimes which were pretended to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt them, they were at laſt condemned to be burnt alive at the place now called the <hi>Greve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is reported, but with no great aſſurance, that at the inſtant of their Execution, <hi>Molay,</hi> who was the great Maſter, cited the Pope and the King to appear before God in a years time. Whether this Circumſtance be true or not, certain it is that the Pope died in leſs then forty days and the King hardly lived to the years end.</p>
               <p>

From that time the Temple came to the Kings poſſeſſion by Confiſcation, who for ſome time kept here their Court, but afterwards gave it to the Knights Hoſpitallers of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> who at laſt made this their Provincial Houſe, for the French Province. Monſieur the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeur de Vendome,</hi> is at preſent Grand Prior, which brings him yearly a Revenue of above 20000 Crowns. This place is very ſpacious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed about by ancient Walls; ſupported with Towers; the Houſe which the Grand Prior inhabits, was built of late time by Monſieur <hi>de Souvray</hi> Grand Prior alſo; he was Son of the Mareſchal <hi>de Souvray,</hi> Governor to <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. But death prevented him from compleating the Edifice; ſo much as is done is of the deſign of the Sieur <hi>de Liſle,</hi> an able Architect, who had built quite round the Court, and made a Gallery ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Pillars, of which we ſee the beginning, had the Maſter lived; the Lodgings are at the further end of this Court, with two Stair-caſes in the two Pavilions of the two Wings. All theſe things are of a very handſom Symmetry.</p>
               <p>Within the incloſure of the Temple you ought to ſee the houſe of Monſieur <hi>Fremont de Ablan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,</hi> a Jeweller. Formerly there were many Jewellers who inhabited in this place, and made counterfeit Jewels very neatly, but of late years they have not been admitted to be here any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Yet it is ſtill to be obſerved that all the Artiſts who work here are exempt from the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the City Companies. And this is the reaſon that abundance of People who are no Free men and have not ſerved their time, take refuge within the Privilege of this Place. Over the way is the Monaſtery of</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:62624:47"/>
The <hi>Nuns of St. Elizabeth.</hi> Whoſe Portal hath two rows of Pilaſters, with Statues and other Ornaments well contrived. The inſide of the Church is very well.</p>
               <p>The Gate that leads into the Fields on this ſide the Town is taken down, and there is no doubt but another will be raiſed in the place, as handſom as the reſt which have been new built elſewhere.</p>

                  <hi>The</hi> Rue du Grand Chantier.</head>
               <p>To ſee this Street in Order you ought to begin at the little <hi>Rüe des Deux Portes,</hi> in which you will ſee a new-built houſe, belonging to the <hi>Sieur Provoſt</hi> one of the Kings Secretaries, who has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed a great deal of Care and Charges to make it ſo handſom as it is, in one of the vileſt places in all <hi>Paris.</hi> On the Court-ſide it is adorned with Ionick Pilaſters, and Sculpture well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The Stair-caſe (which ſtands in the middle of the Building, is) as light as it can be according to its Situation. But that which is moſt ſingular, and the handſomeſt thing in the houſe, is a great Cloſet, the Wainſcot of which is ſet off with Pilaſters gilt, the Pannels between which, are of inlaid Work, repreſenting Vaſes full of Flowers, and which is ſtill more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable the Cieling piece and the Parquet are of the ſame workmanſhip. All theſe pieces appear ſo much the finer as they are the ſcarcer to be met with, they being almoſt the only things of this kind in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Street at the end of this you have the Houſe called <hi>Les Billetes.</hi> Here formerly dwelt a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62624:48"/>
Jew who by a moſt execrable impiety, burnt the Conſecrated Hoaſt, having ſtrook it through in ſeveral places with a Penknife. But by a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Miracle it was gathered up by an old Woman, who unexpectedly came into his Houſe at that time, and by her was carried to the Curate of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Church, where ever after it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with great Veneration. This wicked Jew was for this Fact burnt alive, and his Houſe given to the Carmelite Fathers where they have ſince that continued. The Learned <hi>Papirius Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> whoſe Writings are ſo well known among all Scholars, is here interred. The Knights of S. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> do here uſe to make their Aſſemblies. And the Members of the French Academy perform here the Funeral Services for thoſe who die out of their Society.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rüe des Billetes</hi> ends at the <hi>Rüe S. Croix de la Bretonnerie,</hi> ſo called from a Convent that ſtands there, founded by St. <hi>Lewis</hi> in the year 1268. In which he placed Religious <hi>Mendicants</hi> of the Order of St <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> but ſince that time ſeveral eminent and pious perſons having confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon them conſiderable Maintenance, they no longer beg, becauſe they will not hinder thoſe who have greater need, but live upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues. The Wainſcot Work of their Altar is very pretty, but that which is moſt remarkable is a Baſ-relief of Marble over the Seats where the Religious ſit, this was done by <hi>Sarazin</hi> and is highly eſteemed. From hence you enter into</p>

The Gate is built after the old manner with two great round Towers. The Apartments are very handſom, ſince the conſiderable Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that have been made of late. Once we might have ſeen here moſt magnific Furniture, among which was a Suit of Tapiſtry repreſenting the twelve Months of the year, of moſt exquiſite Workmanſhip; this is at preſent at the Kings <hi>Garde-Meuble</hi> (or Wardrobe) and Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> hath cauſed it to be Copied. Madamoiſelle <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> who at preſent dwells in this Hôtel, hath one of the beſt furniſhed Cabinets in <hi>Paris</hi> for Curioſities. In it are ſeveral pieces of Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grame enriched with Jewels, and ſeveral Minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures extremely fine. You may ſee there alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers pieces of Wooden Work of St. <hi>Lucie,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting ſeveral Subjects of Devotion, cut ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fine; not to ſpeak of ſeveral other Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities little inferiour to theſe. Croſs the way is</p>
               <p>The Church of the Fathers <hi>de la Mercy,</hi> a neat place. The Portal will be very handſom when finiſhed, and the Altar is of a ſort of Wainſcot not ill wrought. The Inſtitution of theſe is to go into <hi>Barbary</hi> and redeem Captives, like the <hi>Mathurins.</hi> And this they do by the aſſiſtance of Pious People who furniſh them with conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sums for this purpoſe.</p>

               <p>It is obſervable that this Street is full of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Houſes, among which there is one at the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Rüe de Quatre-fils</hi> deſigned by <hi>Manſard.</hi> The Front is extreme handſom, and ſet off with many Vaſes.

               <p>At the end of this Street you ſee the great ſquare Tower of the Temple, with four other round ones, very high and diſcovered a great way off. They ſerved heretofore for an Arſenal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that near the Celeſtins was built.</p>

The Houſe of M. <hi>Amelot de Biſüeil</hi> Maſter of Requeſts. Here the Curious muſt reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and take time to conſider all the fine things that are here, for all that is in this Houſe deſerves to be exactly viewed and conſidered. The firſt door you come at gives you a pattern of all the reſt: It is adorned with Statues, the Joiners Work it ſelf is wrought with very good Bas-reliefs, and the Locks are of very curious and particular Art. The Court is in truth ſomething of the leaſt, but the Entry or paſſage on the right hand is extraordinary. It is adorned with Pillars and Buſts, and paved with Marble. Still the Stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe is more beautiful yet. Above it is open in manner of a Lanthorn, with a Balcony gilt and a Plafon over all full of Sculpture and the beſt deſigned Ornaments, and two great Statues in the <hi>Pallier.</hi> After this you enter into the great Hall, open on both ſides, with Pictures between Window and Window, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Flocks and Herds in <hi>Grottoes</hi> on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, of a very ſingular deſign, and very pleaſing to the ſight. That which deſerves to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered moſt attentively is the Plafon, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of which is a great Picture done by an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Maſter, about this is a Freeze full of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made of <hi>Stuc,</hi> upon a Ground of Gold, marvellouſly well wrought. Here you may ſee ancient Vaſes adorned with Triumphs, Sphinxes, Braſiers, Vizards, and in a word, all ſorts of Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſque, very odd and fanciful, and yet extreme handſom. A great Corniſh runs round this Hall, whoſe Carving is admirable, at the further end is the Chimny of the ſame Workmanſhip all gilt, and over it a great Trophy after the old Roman manner. After this you enter into an Anti Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

where are ſeveral great Looking-Glaſſes, and from thence into a Chamber whoſe Plafon and Ornaments are ſtill more rare and rich than all we have yet mentioned; the Furniture is of Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Velvet, embroidered with Gold and Silver, and the Tapiſtry within the Alcove is embroidered extremely rich. The Parquet of the Eſtade is of inlaid Work, where in the middle among di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Ornaments are the Arms of the Maſter of the Houſe. On the left hand is the Chappel, which is in Truth but little, but to make amends, it is adorned as much as poſſible with all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. The Pictures that are in it are painted by very good Maſters. On the right hand you enter into the Cabinet, the laſt Room of this Apartment, and the moſt beautiful of all. It is furniſhed inſtead of Tapiſtry with Wainſcot, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely well gilded; on the Pannels of which are Vaſes with Feſtons of Flowers after nature, and divers little Birds flying about, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Vanbouck</hi> one of the ableſt Maſters of his time for this ſort of Work.</p>
               <p>The Plafon and the Chimny are adorned after the ſame manner. All the Chambers of which we have been ſpeaking look upon a Court, whoſe ſides are adorned with Architectures, Figures and Perſpectives, painted in <hi>Freſquo.</hi> On the other ſide is the ſecond Apartment joyned to this. Where firſt you find a magnificent Chamber af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Italian</hi> manner, whoſe Plafon is opened Cupulo-wiſe, right Angular, with a Balaſtrade above, very well gilt. Over the Chimney is a Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relief painted over like Braſs, it is of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Workmanſhip, and repreſents <hi>Jaſon</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing on the Sea ſhore in order to obtain a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py return to this Country, after he had got away

               <p>On the right hand is a ſmall Library, whoſe Ornaments ſuit perfectly well with the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the place. In fine, nothing is wanting to this Houſe, all is ſurpriſingly neat, and you ſee nothing but what is Magnifick, and what deſerved admiration, for even thoſe things which in other places are of the leaſt account, have here their peculiar Beauties, as the Window-Boards, which are of Cedar inlaid with Ebony and Ivory. The Locks and Bolts are of poliſhed Steel, ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately wrought as if they were of Silver; not to ſpeak of the Moveables, as the Tables and Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſes, which are inriched with Tortoiſe-ſhell and Ivory, and adorned with Mouldings of Braſs gilt, and carved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>One cannot ſee in any other place more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Painting finiſhed with more pains than here. In ſhort thoſe who have examined all the Beauties of this Houſe do all agree that a greater number of delicacies cannot poſſibly be collected in ſo ſmall a place, and that the Maſter to whom they belong could not have brought 'em into this condition without a very conſiderable Expence, and a perfect knowledge and skill in the choice of what is truly excellent.

                  <hi>The</hi> Place Royal.</head>
               <p>This place was built in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great: The Houſes that are erected about it, are very beautiful and of the ſame ſymetry. They take up all that Ground which was formerly the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens belonging to the <hi>Palais des Tournelles</hi> which ſtood on the ſide of the Rampart, in which Palace <hi>Francis</hi> II. and ſeveral other Kings his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors kept their Courts. But after that unhappy accident which befel <hi>Henry</hi> II. who was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death by the Earl of <hi>Montgemmery</hi> in the fatal Turnament then celebrated in the <hi>Rüe St. Antoine</hi> upon the Marriage of <hi>Iſabel</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain, Catherine</hi> of <hi>Medicis</hi> Widow of the deceaſed King ſold this Palace, which had been firſt built by <hi>Charles</hi> V. to divers particular Perſons, who turned it into many Tenements; but the whole Street which runs along near the Rampart ſtill keeps the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient name.</p>
               <p>The place of which we were ſpeaking is exactly ſquare, compoſed of ſix and thirty Pavilions raiſed of the ſame Symmetry; the materials are of Brick and Free-ſtone, raiſed upon a long row of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, under the ſhelter of which one may walk round the place. In the middle of theſe Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they have left a great void piece of Ground, which at preſent is about to be converted into a Garden and is to be incloſed with a Paliſade of Iron, into which none may enter but thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Houſes about the Place, who only are to have keys. Report ſays this Work will coſt a hundred Piſtolls for every Houſe, which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62624:53"/>
we may eaſily believe, if we conſider the vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Iron which it will require. In the middle of this Garden ſtands the Statue in Braſs of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. on Horſeback raiſed on a great Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal of white Marble, on the four ſides of which you may read the following Inſcriptions.</p>

This Horſe is one of the moſt beautiful pieces that can be ſeen.

               <p>Theſe Fathers were ſetled here in the year 1590: Their Church is one of the neateſt and lighteſt in <hi>Paris,</hi> and tho the Portal is not finiſhed, yet that hinders not but that it is very remarkable, in regard the famous <hi>Manſard</hi> made the deſign. The Pillars of the firſt Order are Doricks; but theſe Fathers having occaſion for a Tribune they cauſed one to be raiſed over this Portal, and adorned it with Pillars on the outſide, which do not at all agree with that part which was begun by ſuch an able Maſter. Their Altar is alſo of the better ſort, contrived with Corinthian Pillars of black Marble, flatted, the only in all <hi>France</hi> of this manner. The Ornaments are not ſuperfluous; the Statue of the bleſſed Virgin is on one ſide of it, and that of St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Paula</hi> the Founder of this Order, on the other: both theſe Statues are well wrought. There are ſeveral Chappels in this Church well worth ſeeing, as that of M. the Duke of <hi>Vie-ville,</hi> whoſe Altar is all of Marble, in which Chappel there are ſeveral Tombs of divers Perſons of that Family, of the ſame materials; That of Monſieur <hi>le Camus,</hi> the Wainſcot in which is gilt very neatly; on one ſide of the great Altar is the Chappel of St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> where the life of that Saint hath been painted by the <hi>Sieur Viete.</hi> Over againſt this is the Chappel of Monſieur <hi>le Jay</hi> firſt Preſident of

                  <p>Here lies <hi>John Launoy,</hi> Native of <hi>Conſtance</hi> A <hi>Pariſian</hi> Divine, Who being the conſtant defender of Truth, and of the Rites of the Church and King, ſpent his life innocent and unblamable. He deſpiſed Riches, and was contented with a very little, as knowing he muſt quickly leave it. He writ many things, free from either hope or ſear. He acquired a very great Reputation and Reſpect among good men. He reſigned his Soul to his Saviour in the ſeventy ſeventh year of his age, <hi>March</hi> 10. 1678.</p>
                  <p>To his dear Friend, <hi>Nicolas le Camus</hi> Chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the Exchequer erected this Monument.</p>
               </q>
               <p>There are alſo in this Library certain pieces of Opticks made by the famous Father <hi>de Niſeron,</hi> a <hi>Pariſian,</hi> one of the moſt knowing Men in this Science that hath perhaps ever appeared in this Age. He hath left us a Volume of that Art, very much eſtemed; it was he alſo who cauſed to be painted in the Dortoir of this Houſe, the Figures of St. <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Magdelain,</hi> which Figures extend the whole length of the two Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, and which they cannot ſee in their true proportion, but from a point marked for you to ſtand in. This Learned Perſon had enriched the Publick with many other things had not death ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him from us in an Age wherein he did but begin to diſcover his wonderful wit and parts.</p>

The Refectory of this Convent is very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and of late years has been painted round about with Landskips and Solitudes, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the thoughts of the Religious while they are at their meals with Ideas remote from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this World. It is well known that theſe Fathers live in great auſterity, and that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of their inſtitution hath taken in almoſt all that is rigorous in the other Orders.</p>
               <p>Before you leave the <hi>Marais du Temple,</hi> you ought to obſerve that the greateſt part of the Houſes in this Quarter have been built within theſe fifty or ſixty years, and that the Ground on which they ſtand was formerly a mariſh and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in great Gardens which furniſhed <hi>Paris</hi> with Roots and Kitchin Herbs. At preſent it is a handſom Quarter, whoſe habitations are very conveniently built, and therein a great number of Perſons of Quality inhabit.</p>

It was through this Street that the Queen made her firſt Entry, and through which that famous Carouſel in the year 1661. made their glorious March.

               <p>This is the only place in <hi>Paris</hi> where they make the publick ſhews of Joy and Triumph. Here are made the Bonfires on the Eve of St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, and at other times when <hi>France</hi> hath gained any Victories over her Enemies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hôtel de Ville</hi> takes up one ſide of this Place. It was built in the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> I. who laid the firſt Stone himſelf. The Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is however a little Gotique; that is to ſay, it is not altogether according to the guſt of the preſent age, in which the old Roman and Greek proportions are ſtudied with more care and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, Artiſts endeavouring every day to re-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh this curious Science in the ſame perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it had under the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> The Statue of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. is placed over the Gate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented on Horſeback in <hi>Demi-boſſe,</hi> upon a Ground of black Marble. The Horſe was copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> at the Capitol. The Court is but ſmall and encloſed with Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſame ſymmetry. Under one of the Arches at the further end of the Court there is a Statue of the King in the Habit of <hi>Hercules,</hi> treading under foot that Diſcord which would have diſquieted the beginning of his happy Reign. On the Pedeſtal which is of Marble as is alſo the Statue, they have cut ſome Inſcriptions, but ſuch
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62624:58"/>
as are not thought material to be repeated here, in regard they contain nothing remarkable, nor recount any paſſage of Hiſtory that can be uſeful to the curious.</p>
               <p>In the Rooms there are ſome Pictures repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the <hi>Prevoſts des Marchands</hi> and the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chevins</hi> of the paſt Age, and of this alſo in their proper habits. At the two ends of the great Hall over the two Chimneys there are placed the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits of the King in his Royal Robes and his Scepter in his hand. In this Hall they Aſſemble to elect their <hi>Prevoſts des Marchands</hi> and <hi>Eſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins.</hi> The Windows that look upon the Greve at publick Shews and Rejoicings, are filled with Perſons of the greateſt Quality, who are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times treated here very magnificently at the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the City.</p>
               <p>To make the Entry into the <hi>Greve</hi> more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, they have within five or ſix years laſt paſt opened a way from the <hi>Pont de Nôtre-Dame</hi> to this place all along the River, which they have adorned with a very handſom Key of Free-ſtone. They have alſo built on this Key ſeveral Houſes of the ſame Symmetry, inhabited by good Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. This beautiful Enterprize was begun un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Prevoſt-ſhip of Monſieur <hi>Pelletier,</hi> at preſent Controller-general of the Finances, and all that was performed under his adminiſtration has been as well for the Publick good, as for the Beauty of the City. The People have as an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mark of their acknowledgment, given this place the new name of <hi>le Quay Pelletier,</hi> though through a modeſty that hath had but few exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he himſelf would never ſuffer his name to appear in any of thoſe Works which have been raiſed by his order.

               <p>A little further is the Church of St. <hi>Gervais,</hi> It is one of the ancienteſt Pariſhes in <hi>Paris,</hi> as may be ſeen in the Hiſtory of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> Biſhop of this Town, who lived in the year 578. In favour of which he wrought here a Miracle as <hi>Fortunatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Pottiers</hi> reports in his Hiſtory. The Body of this Church is very well built, but according to the Gothick way, with high raiſed Roofs, and Chappels round about; in one of which under the <hi>Croiſée</hi> on the left hand, you may ſee ſome Paintings after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>le Sueur</hi> who was one of the beſt Painters of this Age, next to the famous <hi>Pouſſin,</hi> and of whom we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more at large hereafter; the Paintings in the Windows which repreſent the Martyrdom of St <hi>Gervais</hi> and the Picture over the Altar are of his hand. The Tapiſtry which they expoſe here on the great
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62624:60"/>
Feaſts are very well wrought; the Originals from which theſe were Copied are in the Nave of the Church, and were painted by the ſaid <hi>le Sueur</hi> and <hi>Champaigne.</hi> They repreſent the Hiſtory of St. <hi>Gervais</hi> and St. <hi>Protais,</hi> and the manner how their holy Bodies were found at <hi>Millain</hi> through the Prayers of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who mentions this matter in his Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>But this is not that which ought moſt to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Curious, the magnificent Portal will entertain their view with much greater pleaſure, and make them acknowledge that they cannot elſewhere ſee any thing more handſom or regular. It is compoſed of three Greek Orders, one over the other, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Dorick, the Ionick, and the Corinthian, whoſe proportions are ſo handſom and ſo exact, that in the judgment of the famous Cavalier <hi>Bernin</hi> himſelf, there is nothing more finiſhed and perfect in all <hi>Europe.</hi> The Pillars are fluted, without any other Ornaments than what are proper to themſelves. Theſe three Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders compoſe a Fabrick of a very great heighth and perfectly pleaſing to the ſight: Had the place before it been larger, nothing had been wanting to ſet off this Work in all its magnificence. The Reputation of this Building belongs to the Sieur <hi>de Broſſe,</hi> he who made the deſigns for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> and the Temple at <hi>Charen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> However we muſt not think him the only Artiſt, we muſt know that <hi>Clement M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62624:60"/>
by Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> who perfectly well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Perſons merit. Monſieur <hi>de Fourcy,</hi> Counſellor in the Parliament, and Intendant-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Buildings under <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. Father to Monſieur the Preſident <hi>de Fourcy,</hi> a perſon more renowned at preſent for his Merit and Probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than for the dignity of his Charge, was at that time honorary Church-warden of this Church; It was he that undertook this great Work, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with M. <hi>de Onon</hi> and M. <hi>de Saint Genis,</hi> his Collegues in the Office. <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. laid the firſt Stone, and in a very little time this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Structure was finiſhed as we now ſee it.</p>
               <p>From this Church of St. <hi>Gervais,</hi> to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the <hi>Rüe St. Antoine</hi> is nothing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. You paſs before the Church-yard of S. <hi>John</hi> where is at preſent a Market-place. Here formerly ſtood the Hôtel of <hi>Pierre de Craon</hi> who murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Conſtable <hi>Olivier du Cliſſon</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> VI. whoſe Houſe was demoliſhed and raſed to the Ground in the year 1392. as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for that Fact. After this you come to</p>
               <p>The Hotel <hi>de Beauvais,</hi> which ſhews a very handſom Front to the Street, adorned with three Balconies. The Maſons Work is <hi>en Boſſage</hi> with very neat Ornaments. The Gate is large, and tho the Court be but very ſmall it is howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver compaſſed about with Buildings where the ſeveral Orders of Architecture are well obſerved. The Stair-caſe is ſupported with Pillars, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed with many Ornaments. As for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments they are extreme pleaſant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with a long Baluſtrade of Iron, leading quite round the Court, into which the doors open.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:62624:61"/>
As often as there hath been any great Sight to be held in the <hi>Rüe St. Antoine,</hi> this fair houſe hath been made uſe of by thoſe of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. At the famous Carouſel that was in the year 1661. a great number of Princeſſes and Ladies of the Court placed themſelves here to ſee that magnificent Train paſs by from the Place Royal where they aſſembled to go to the open place before the Palace of the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> in which they were to perform their Courſes.</p>
               <p>Over againſt this ſtands <hi>the Church of little St. Antoine,</hi> which hath nothing in it of Beauty, and its very ſimplicity hath made it ſufficiently known that it formerly ſerved for an Hoſpital; and was founded for thoſe who were afflicted with that Epidemical Diſeaſe called St. <hi>Anthonys</hi> Fire. A Diſtemper which hath been now ceaſed this two or three Ages. The Confraternity of St. <hi>Claude</hi> hath been a long time eſtabliſhed in this Church, but it is much decayed from what it was in former times, for it is evident that under the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> VI. their Founder, all the great Lords of the Court, cauſed their names to be here inrolled after his Example, and made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Preſents in favour of this Saint. The Community of theſe Fathers is but ſmall and does not ordinarily exceed the number of twenty Religious men, they are Chanons regular of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> and bear on their Breaſts the Letter T. much like a Croſs. The head of their Order is in <hi>Dauphine</hi> not far from <hi>Vicnne.</hi> On the ſame ſide of the way is</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hòtel de St. Pol,</hi> where formerly our Kings inhabited, as ſome Hiſtorians would make us believe But at the ſame time others would have it that the Palace <hi>des Tournelles</hi> was ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62624:61"/>
before it was rebuilt by <hi>Francis</hi> I. who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a great number of ſmall Towers to be placed there upon the Walls. In ſhort, this Hôtel is at preſent inhabited by Madame <hi>de Chavigny,</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Secretary of State ſo called. It is one of the greateſt Houſes in all <hi>Paris.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments look upon the Garden and are magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently Furniſhed: The Pictures and ſuch like beautiful Ornaments are here in abundance. The Court is great and can contain many Coaches. However one thing is wanting in this Houſe and that is a great Stair-caſe. Monſieur <hi>de Chavigny</hi> had a deſign to have built one, and continued ſome other Works that ſeemed imperfect, but Death ſuffered him not to perform what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. However that hinders not but this houſe is notwithſtanding one of the moſt capacious and convenient; it is alſo moſt delicious in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by reaſon of that pleaſing Odour which comes from the Orangers eſpecially in the lower Rooms next the Garden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

too low, which makes it ſad and obſcure. Yet it being on the Feſtivals enlightned with a great number of Candles the defect is the leſs taken notice of. The Tabernacle which they expoſe on ſuch days is of Silver ſet off with <hi>Feuillages</hi> and other Ornaments Silver and gilt, and the Workmanſhip is of greater value than the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.

All men know what a particular affection the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> have always had for this Society. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Uncle of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great was the firſt who eſtabliſhed them at <hi>Paris.</hi> He bought for them the <hi>Hôtel de Amville</hi> for the ſum of 13000 Livers, which the Receivers of the Abby of St. <hi>Germain</hi> advanced, and at his Death he left to theſe Fathers his whole Library which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of very good Books.

I will only acquaint the Reader that thoſe of this Houſe who are of greateſt Fame, are Father <hi>Bourdaloue,</hi> whoſe Sermons are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frequented, and heard with much profit and applauſe. His true Character is Morality, which he teaches with ſuch Eloquence, ſo delicate, ſo lively, and ſo penetrating, that he does even ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh his Auditors: Father <hi>Girou</hi> in a different way of Preaching is no leſs famous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no leſs praiſe: Father <hi>Menetrier,</hi> who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Learned manner of Preaching, enjoys ſeveral other excellent Talents; he hath publiſhed a great many Volumes upon the Art of Blazon, which he has reduced to certain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples infinitely more clear and more Methodical than ever any other Author that writ before him, expreſs'd on this Subject; Not long ſince he publiſhed the Original of Opera's, and he hath promiſed ſome other things which no doubt will be received by the Publick, with no leſs applauſe than thoſe already Printed: Father <hi>Jourdan</hi> is alſo of this houſe, he hath compoſed the Original of the Royal Family of <hi>France,</hi> conſiſting of three Volumes in <hi>quarto,</hi> and Printed by <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſi,</hi> in which one may find many particulars touching the French Hiſtory, which the modern Authors have neglected or not diſcovered,</p>

Further on you ſee</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hôtel de Carnavalet,</hi> whoſe Portal is the Workmanſhip of the famous <hi>Gougeon.</hi> It is a kind of Boſſage with two Baſ-reliefs above it. This Work hath been ſo much adorned by the skilful that the great <hi>Manſard</hi> when employed to finiſh this Portal, would not touch that which had been begun by ſuch an able Maſter, he only proceeded to make the ſecond Story to correſpond as we ſee it, but it is not finiſhed neither.

               <p>The <hi>Hôtel de Angouleſme,</hi> whoſe Architecture is compoſed of great Corinthian Pilaſters, which take up the whole heighth of the Building, and which are the firſt of this kind that have been raiſed in <hi>Paris,</hi> and have ſerved as a Model to ſome Architects that have copied from hence their Works of this kind that have been ſince made.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Nuns of St. Mary</hi> are a little further, and near the <hi>Hôtel de Maienne,</hi> which makes the Corner of the <hi>Rüe du petit Maſe.</hi> Their Church is but ſmall, but one of the neateſt in all <hi>Paris:</hi> It is a Dome of reaſonable heighth, ſupported with Corinthian Pilaſters making four Arches, the great Altar is placed under the furthermoſt Arch, oppoſite to the Door. The Tabernacle is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Workmanſhip, and the Pictures repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Viſitation is of an excellent Maſter. On Feſtival days they expoſe on this Altar a great quantity of rich Plate, and an Ornament in the middle of which is the Portrait of St. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Salles</hi> their Inſtitutor, ſet off and adorned with great Pearls. The Quire where the Nuns ſing takes up one ſide, and the Chappel of that Saint the other; the deſign of this Church being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by the famous <hi>Manſard,</hi> cannot chuſe but give great ſatisfaction to the Curious.

the middle Street, which is the faireſt, is the new Hoſpital built for expoſed Children.

Many very remarkable Stories are told of the Foundation of this Houſe, but in regard they do not ſute with the Guſt of this Age, I do not think it proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert them here. This Abby began to be built about the year 1193. and was finiſhed in the Reign of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> who was preſent and aſſiſting at its Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, together with Queen <hi>Blanch</hi> of <hi>Caſtile</hi> his Mother.

               <p>As you go into the Street beyond this Abby, is the Manufactury of Looking-glaſſes, which were formerly brought from <hi>Venice.</hi> But Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> obſerving how great a Treaſure this Trade had yearly drawn out of the Kingdom, eſtabliſhed this Manufacture, which has had a very happy Succeſs, as indeed all other matters have had which that great Miniſter hath undertaken. Here is a great number of Workmen, who are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62624:70"/>
employed, ſome in poliſhing the Glaſſes with Sand, others with Emery, and other in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Beſſil. They uſe no others at preſent at <hi>Paris.</hi> And theſe which they make here are as beautiful as thoſe which formerly came from <hi>Venice,</hi> with infinite greater Charges. Theſe Workmen are placed in long Galleries round a great ſquare Court. Which Buildings have all the Conveniencies that are requiſite, being raiſed on purpoſe for this Manufacture.</p>

               <p>Near the place where you ſee the Triumphal Arch was a magniſick Throne erected for the Queen when ſhe made her Entry in the year 1660. And in regard this place is the higheſt of all this Quarter, this beautiful Structure is placed here, though it is not yet raiſed much higher than the Pedeſtal.

The Solidity of the Work will anſwer the beauty. They make uſe of the hardeſt and greateſt Stones that can be got, which are joyned in ſuch manner that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive where unleſs you look very cloſely, and this without cement or any thing like it.

There have been ſeveral very conſiderable additions made, and the Court hath often reſided here for a long time together.

               </p>

The Chappel was founded by <hi>Charles</hi> V. and the Body of Monſieur the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who died here, is repoſited in this Chappel, till that of the Colledge of the four Nations be finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which will be raiſed a Monument for him, as he has ordered in his Will. You ought to take particular notice of the curious Windows in this Chappel, they being highly eſteemed, in regard neither <hi>Italy</hi> nor any other parts elſewhere can equal them. Many Kings have made their abode here. St. <hi>Lewis</hi> who uſed oftentimes to deveſt himſelf of the State and preſs of his Attendants at Court, that he might have the greater freedom to exerciſe his Piety, would here paſs his days of retreat. It is ſaid that not long ago there was remaining in the Park a great old Oak, under which this good Prince was uſed to hear their Complaints who reſorted to him for Juſtice; and that he himſelf would uſe to ſend abroad his Heralds about the Country to call in all ſuch who had any need of his Authority againſt the oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of great men.

On the other ſide of the <hi>Faux-bourg</hi> you ought to view the houſe of the Sieur <hi>Titen</hi> the Kings Secretary, in the <hi>Rüe de Montreüil:</hi> It is one of the fineſt you can ſee, whoſe Maſter being rich and of a delicate Guſt, one cannot but imagine that nothing can be there wanting; and in truth it is very pleaſant. Both on the Court-ſide and that next the Garden the Fronts are very Beautiful.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Rüe de Charonne</hi> you will ſee alſo an other which belongs to Monſieur <hi>de Folville,</hi> who cauſed it to be built very lately. It is flat Roof'd after the <hi>Italian</hi> manner, with Vaſes and Statues over the Corniſhes. It is a kind of great Pavilion with four Fronts. In the middle of this Building is a Hall that opens to all the four ſides, and parts the whole into four Diviſions. The Beauty of the Buildings is equal on the Garden, and on that of the Court. The Garden is great enough and very carefully kept. Strangers ought not to neglect to ſee theſe two houſes, for it is certain they can hardly ſee finer, and where the beauties of Modern Architecture have been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with more care and Judgment. And this is all that is more than ordinarily curious to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Antoine.</hi>

               <p>The firſt thing you ſee as you re-enter into the Town is the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> where you have a very handſom Garden, with a long Ally or walk of Trees which runs all along the Ditch. Near the <hi>Mail</hi> there are ſome apartments handſom enough which extend along the very ſpacious Courts, whoſe Proſpect is upon the River. Among others, the great Hall is adorned with a Plafond, or Cei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, of Monſieur <hi>Mignard</hi>'s Work.

ſurnamed the Wife, augmented the Foundation very much, and built their Church as we ſee it at preſent, himſelf laying the firſt Stone.

After his death his Body was brought to their Church, and was interred in a Chappel which he had cauſed to be built for himſelf and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Before we enter into this Church we ought to paſs through the little Cloiſter, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſquare, and built very neatly. It is all Vaulted and adorned with Sculpture.

               <p>The Church belonging to theſe Fathers is all Gothick and hath nothing Curious in relation to its Structure. The Altar is not much better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned: yet on the Feſtival days they expoſe here very rich Ornaments of an ancient ſort of Stuff of Gold and Silver Embroidered, by whoſe Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we may perceive that in the Ages paſt they had very induſtrious Artiſts, and ſuch who had a delicate Guſt in theſe matters. The Kings Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries hold their Confraternity in this Church. Their Company is one of the famouſeſt that is, as well for the number of conſiderable perſons that compoſe it, as the great Priviledges which their Office gives them, one of the faireſt of which is the Title of Nobility. They have a black Pall, the richeſt that is to be ſeen; made by an <hi>Italian</hi> whom Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> cauſed to come into

this Kingdom expreſly, to deſign the Embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he intended to make. This Pall is of black Velvet with a great Croſs of Silver, and Cartouches about the edges, in which there are ſeveral deviſes delicately wrought.</p>
               <p>You ought next to ſee the Tombs which are in the <hi>Chapelle de Orleans.</hi> As you go in, on the left hand you may obſerve a great twiſted Pillar, of white Marble, adorned with <hi>Feüillages</hi> and Mouldings let into the Work, as is alſo the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal which is of the Compoſite Order; Over which is placed an Urn of Braſs, and in that the heart of the Conſtable <hi>Anne de Montmorency,</hi> who died gloriouſly of his Wounds received at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of St <hi>Dennis,</hi> which he fought againſt the <hi>Hugonots</hi> on the fourteenth of <hi>November</hi> in the year 1567. This brave Lord received ſix ſeveral Wounds, of which the laſt only was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. It is reported of him that being in the Agony of Death, a Cordelier exhorting him to his laſt Duties with ſomething too much Violence and Importunity, he deſired him to permit him to reſt a little, ſaying that he had not lived fourſcore years, and not yet learnt what it was to die one quarter of an hour. His Funeral Pomp was Magnificent, and equal to that of Kings, his Eſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies being carried as is cuſtomary at the Obſequies of Kings or their Children. This beautiful Pillar is erected upon a Pedeſtal of red Marble, and ſet off with three Statues of Braſs repreſenting three Virtues. The Sword Royal of which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable hath the Charge with the other Marqueſs of that Dignity are alſo here repreſented in Marble. You may here read certain Inſcriptions in French Verſe, which at that time were much eſteemed but I have omitted to inſert them in this Work, they

being not at all of the Guſt of this Age. This Monument is one of the moſt beautiful and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular that is to be ſeen, the work of the Pillar is exquiſite, and it is ſaid that the Sculptor was more than fifteen years in making it. The Body of this great Conſtable is in the Church of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi> four Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> where hath been raiſed for him one of the ſtatelieſt Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoleums of all the Kingdom, of which we may ſay more hereafter.</p>
               <p>In the middle of this Chappel ſtands the Tomb of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> for whom it was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly erected, It hath nothing magnificent; only the repreſentation of four perſons in cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent poſtures, namely of <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who was murdered; and of <hi>Valentine</hi> his Wife, who died two years after her Husband of Grief and Sorrow, having done her utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to be revenged upon the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> for his Treachery, by drawing into her quarrel the Dauphin <hi>Charles,</hi> tho againſt his own Mother, and the Parliament who cited the Duke to appear perſonally before them. The Clergy and the Univerſity did commiſerate her Sorrows, and did their endeavours, tho unſucceſsfully, to comfort her. <hi>France</hi> is obliged to this Princeſs for that inconteſtable Right ſhe hath to the Dutchy of <hi>Millain,</hi> which ſhe brought by her Marriage with the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> from whom <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. and <hi>Francis</hi> I deſcended. She was daughter of <hi>John Galeas</hi> Duke of <hi>Millain,</hi> who left two Sons, but both dying without iſſue Male, this Princeſs became Preſumptive Heir to that Dutchy. Near her Statue are engraved thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</p>

               <p>The two other Figures lying on each ſide upon this Tomb are, that of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> eldeſt Son of him we mentioned before, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. and that of <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Vertus,</hi> his Brother, who died unmarried. All theſe four Figures are of Marble, and were cauſed to be made by the pious care of <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. who for the mildneſs of his Reign and the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and love which he had for his Subjects does merit to be called <hi>the Father of his People,</hi> a Title the more illuſtrious, by reaſon that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and the greateſt Kings of the Earth were ambitious to deſerve it. At one end of this Tomb, next the Altar, is placed the heart of <hi>Henry</hi> II. in an Urn of Braſs gilt, held up by three Vertues upon their heads, which Statues are of Marble, and the beſt ſort of <hi>Germain Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's</hi> Work. Men of Judgment admire this Piece for the Beauty of the Deſign. And it is ſaid that a curious Perſon of the laſt Age offered to give for it 10000 Crowns and a Copy of the ſame to be made as exactly as could be and placed in the Room. The Pedeſtal of theſe three Figures, which properly ſpeaking are but one, is triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar like a <hi>Tripos.</hi> They are as big as the Life, of one Block of Marble, and hold together by the hands. Their Drapery and the air of their heads, is admirable. One may eaſily perceive by this
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62624:75"/>
that the paſt age did equal ours in delicate Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and Beauty of Deſign.</p>
               <p>At the other end is the heart of <hi>Francis</hi> II. on a high Pillar of white Marble. Flames ſeem to iſſue out at the top, about this Pillar are three Cupids with their Torches reverſt and extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is raiſed upon a Pedeſtal of Porphyry, on the ſides of which are certain Inſcriptions, among others one that ſays that this King marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Mary Stuart,</hi> who was beheaded in <hi>England</hi> through the Jealouſie of <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> He died at <hi>Orleans, Decemb.</hi> 10. 1560. being but ſixteen years of Age. The heart of Charles IX. his Brother, who died at <hi>Vincennes</hi> on <hi>Whit-ſunday</hi> in the year 1572. is alſo in the ſame Monument.</p>
               <p>Along the Wall on the right hand, is the Tomb of a Princeſs, who was ſiſter to <hi>Valentine</hi> of <hi>Milain;</hi> that of the Admiral <hi>Chabot,</hi> the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of <hi>Paul Ponce,</hi> whoſe Labours are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily eſteemed; and that of one of the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Rohan.</hi> Theſe two laſt Tombs tho of a different ſort, are very beautiful, and the Effigies of thoſe who are there interred are well deſigned. Near the door which leads out of this Chappel into the Nave of the Church, ſtands a great Pillar of white Marble full of Cyphers and Sculptures, and belongs to the illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Coſſé-Briſſac,</hi> as appears by the Epitaph. It was raiſed for <hi>Timoleon de Coſſé-Briſſac.</hi> But that which is moſt remarkable in this Chappel, and that which ſtrikes the eye with moſt ſurprize, is the Curious Pyramid belonging to the houſe of <hi>Longueville,</hi> the Workman-ſhip of Monſieur <hi>de Augui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62624:76"/>
White Marble. On the Pedeſtal are two Baſ-reliefs gilt over, repreſenting two of the moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Actions of the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> for whom this Monument was erected at a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable expence. You ought to obſerve the Picture over the Altar, it being done by <hi>Francis Salujati,</hi> a <hi>Boulonois,</hi> who was a famous Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and whoſe Works are much ſought after in <hi>Italy.</hi> Behind this Chappel is another little one, which Monſieur the Marqueſs of <hi>Roſtaing</hi> cauſed to be built, but in it there is nothing to invite the Curious. In the Nave of this Church is a Tomb belonging to the Anceſtors of the Duke of <hi>Geſvres,</hi> where you will ſee ſome Statues of Marble, kneeling, in the habits of that Age, very well wrought, but more eſpecially that of the Duke of <hi>Tremes,</hi> his Father. In one of the Chappels is the Monument of Monſieur <hi>de la Tremoüille,</hi> and over againſt that the Tomb of Monſieur <hi>Zamet,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Langres,</hi> on one ſide of which you may ſee the Monument of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolus Magnus;</hi> he is repreſented ſitting and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head on his left arm. This is the Work of <hi>Paul Ponce</hi> a famous Sculptor, as we have already ſaid. In that Chappel where you ſee the Tomb of the Duke <hi>de la Tremoüille,</hi> there is over the Altar a very curious piece of a <hi>Magdelain</hi> done by <hi>Mignard,</hi> Nephew of <hi>Peter Mignard</hi> whom we have formerly mentioned.</p>
               <p>In the houſe it ſelf there is nothing of Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Theſe Fathers have begun a great Building of late time, which is now almoſt finiſhed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they will be extreme conveniently lodged. Their Gardens are handſom enough, in one of which near the Vineyard, you may ſee a Grotto of Shell-work, which is committed to the care
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62624:76"/>
of one of the younger Monks. The Cabinet of Father <hi>Augereau,</hi> in the little Garden adjoyning, deſerves to be ſeen; there are ſome good Pictures, and curious Prints. This Father is very skilfull in theſe matters, but he hath not the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of making any great Collection. Theſe Monks are very regular, and never eat any fleſh, unleſs they be ſick, or happen to be above two leagues from home. They obſerve much the ſame Rule with the <hi>Ciſtercians,</hi> being a branch of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Near this, on the edg of the River is the <hi>Hôtel de Fieubet</hi> belonging to Monſieur <hi>Fieubet,</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of State in Ordinary, and Chancellor to the deceaſed Queen. He cauſed it to be built about three or four years ago. One can hardly deſire a neater houſe than this both within and without. The Stair-caſe is very light and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Buſts between the Windows. The apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are contrived in <hi>enfilade</hi> as the mode is at preſent; on one ſide they look into the Garden, and on the other ſide upon the River. The Furniture is of the ſame neatneſs, as well in the Rooms above Stairs as below. The great piece of Perſpective on the adjoyning wall is very fine; it is painted in <hi>Freſco</hi> with a great deal of fancy. It repreſents a Building compoſed of two great Arches, between which are ſome Pillars and a Statue of an Hero between them. Over all there is a Sun-dial, about which are placed ſeveral Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, among others a Woman pulling Feathers out of a Cocks tail to point out the hours upon a Tablet, and Time over her head ſeems to approve the Action. All the Work keeps its Colours ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, which is not uſual in Paintings expoſed to the injuries of the Air, which laſt but a ſhort

time, eſpecially in <hi>Paris</hi> where the Air is very moiſt in Winter, and the drineſs of the Summer very great, in ſuch ſort that it is difficult for any Plaiſter to defend it ſelf againſt theſe extremities. This is the Work of Monſieur <hi>Rouſſeau,</hi> who did that at Monſieur <hi>Poüange</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Row you have the <hi>Hôtel de la Vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> whoſe entrance is but dark, yet is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide capacious and convenient enough.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church of St. Paul</hi> which is the Pariſh Church of this Quarter, is in the Street that runs along near the laſt mentioned Hôtel. Formerly this Church was the Pariſh Church of the Kings houſe while the Court remained at the <hi>Palais des Tournelles.</hi> It was built, as is to be ſeen, in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> VI.</p>
               <p>As you go towards the Iſle of <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> you come again <hi>to the Convent of the Nuns of the Ave-Maria</hi> in the <hi>Rüe des Barrieres.</hi> They are of St. <hi>Clares</hi> Order. St. <hi>Lewis</hi> had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed in this houſe certain <hi>Beguines,</hi> which were Nuns of the Order of St. <hi>Begue,</hi> a <hi>Fleming</hi> by extraction. They wore a Coif that hid almoſt all their Face, But in the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. Queen <hi>Charlotte</hi> introduced the third Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> with the Reform, and her Son King <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. built for the Friers, the houſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, ſeparated only by the paſſage that leads to the Church. There is not in all <hi>Paris</hi> any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Nuns who live more auſtere than theſe. They never eat any Fleſh, nor wear any Linnen, and beſides that, they riſe at midnight, and go continually barefoot without Sandals or Stockings, with a ſtrict obſervance of a perpetual Silence. Nor can we find in any Convent a greater Stock of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and more diſeſteem and neglect of ſecular
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62624:77"/>
affairs. Theſe good Nuns never think of the World but when they pray to God to forgive the diſorders which are committed in it. And as they have no other Subſiſtence than by Alms, ſo have they no other truſt than to the Divine Providence, which is never wanting; <hi>Paris</hi> containing ſo great a number of Pious People, by whoſe Charity they are maintained. Seldom or never are any permitted to ſpeak with them; ſo that in the midſt of <hi>Paris</hi> they are as much retired from the World as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At ſuch times as they are obliged to ſpeak to their neareſt Relations, it muſt be in the Church, they having not throughout their whole houſe any other <hi>Parloir</hi> or ſpeaking Room. The Tomb of the illuſtrious Anceſtors of Monſieur the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with honour in the greateſt Employments, ſtands in a Chappel belonging to this Church.</p>
               <p>A little further is <hi>the Hôtel de Sens</hi> with an old Gothick Gate but handſom enough. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the Arch-Biſhops of that City, who were Metropolitans of <hi>Paris,</hi> reſided here. But under the Pontificate of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. <hi>Paris</hi> having been diſmembred from that Arch Biſhoprick this Hotel hath been ſince let out to ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons who pay their Rents to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Sens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this you paſs over the Bridge called <hi>Pont-Marie,</hi> to go into the Iſle <hi>de Noſtre-Dame.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve as you go that this Bridge is not ſo full of Houſes as it might be, in regard that in <hi>March</hi> 1657. the River being extraordinarily overflown, it carried away two Arches n the night time, to a very great loſs both of Perſons and Goods,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62624:78"/>
which periſhed miſerably. This Bridg took its name from the undertaker of the Work in the year 1614 who was called <hi>Marie.</hi>

               <p>The Iſle of <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> takes its name from the Church of <hi>Paris</hi> to which it belongs as part of their Eſtate. All the houſes which we ſee there at preſent are the work of this Age. It was formerly a Meadow ground where people of all ſorts uſed to walk to take the Air, in the middle of which place ſtood a ſmall Chappel Dedicated to St. <hi>Lewis.</hi> At preſent it is all compaſſed about with a Key of Free-ſtone very firm, and filled with very handſom houſes, among which there are ſome moſt magnifick, and which may be compared with the moſt beautiful Palaces; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe which are ſituated at the corner on the Eaſt ſide, where the <hi>Seine</hi> divides it ſelf into two Arms to make the Iſle. The Streets are ſtrait, and all end upon the edge of the River.</p>
               <p>The firſt houſe which ought to be obſerved on the ſide of <hi>Pont-Marie,</hi> is that of Monſieur <hi>de Grand-Maiſon,</hi> which appears to be ſolidly built, and whoſe inſide is extreme handſom. As you paſs further, you come to the houſe of Monſieur <hi>Lambert de Terigny</hi> Preſident of the Chamber of Accounts, whoſe chief Entrance is from the <hi>Rüe St. Louis</hi> which croſſes the Iſle from one end to the other. This Houſe is magnifick in all its parts, the Gate is great and high, and the Lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths Work is very extraordinary. But this is not that which is moſt obſervable. The four
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62624:78"/>
ſides of the Court are adorned each with a Front of admirable Buildings ſet off with great Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Pilaſters, which reach from the Ground to the top of the Fabrick, with Vaſes upon the tops. The Staircaſe is placed at the bottom of the Court, with two Ranks of Pillars, directly over which the light falls full upon the Steps, without the leaſt obſtacle. The firſt Apartment is compoſed of ſeveral Chambers one beyond another, from all which you have a delicate proſpect upon the River on the Garden ſide in ſuch ſort that in a clear day one may ſee ſix or ſeven Leagues into the Country, which is a very conſiderable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. In theſe Apartments you may ſee ſome Cieling-pieces of the beſt ſort of Painting, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the laſt Chamber, which is all of <hi>le Sueur</hi>'s work, who in an age but very little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced gave great hopes in time to equal the beſt Painters of <hi>Italy,</hi> as one may perceive by the laſt Pictures which he made. Thoſe things of his which are to be ſeen in this houſe are the beſt that ever he did, chiefly the Paintings in the <hi>Alcove</hi> repreſenting the Muſes in a Conſort of Muſick, the Cieling-piece is almoſt of equal Beauty. The Moveables of this Apartment are extreme rich. From thence you ought to go into the Gallery which is on the ſame Floor. All that is deviſed ordinarily to adorn the faireſt Galleries may be found in this, gilding upon Sculpture curiouſly wrought, with a Ceiling enriched with Pictures of the beſt Maſters, among which are ſeveral of <hi>le Sueur,</hi> of whom I ſpoke before, which one may eaſily diſtinguiſh from the reſt, although thoſe which are not of his hand are not however to be neglected, being very well paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62624:79"/>
The door, by which you enter into this Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, is ſuſtained on the inſide with two Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian Pillars all over gilt, the ſides are almoſt of the ſame faſhion, with Païſages and Pilaſters of the ſame Order, between which are placed Buſts of Marble upon Tables of the ſame; the end of the Room does determine in a little Terraſe in manner of a Balcony, which commands all over the River. The Apartments below are not ſo well adorned, tho they alſo have their Beauties. In the Garden are to be ſeen ſome Statues handſom enough. And you ought not to forget to ſee the Orangerie, which in Winter is in a Hall, where one may walk about very conveniently. Near to which place there is another, ſeparated only by a great partition that is glaſed, through which one has the pleaſure in the midſt of Winter to ſee the Vertue of the Orange-trees. The face of the houſe on the Garden ſide is of the ſame Symmetry and Order of Building with that in the Court, which thing gives this houſe an air of grandeur at a great diſtance, and which ſhews extremely fine as one comes to <hi>Paris</hi> by Water from <hi>Charenton.</hi> Near this is</p>
               <p>The houſe of Monſieur <hi>de Bretonvilliers,</hi> another Preſident in the Chamber of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. This houſe is yet better ſituated than that of which I have been ſpeaking, in regard it ſtands upon the very point of the Iſle, and the River is on both ſides of it. It is alſo much more great and ſpacious. The Maſonry tho it be of no ſet Order of Architecture becauſe of the many Ornaments that are there placed, is notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreme handſom to the eye. The Stair-caſe is on the left hand in one of the Corners of the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62624:79"/>
Court: built with much ſolidity as is all the reſt of the houſe; there has been no ſparing of Vaults in thoſe places where there appeared any occaſion. This houſe is truely great and contains in it all things neceſſary for the entertainment of a great Lord. The outward Court is parted from the reſt in ſuch manner as it cannot cauſe the leaſt inconvenience. As to the beauty and delights of the inſide they are more conſiderable than that of which I treated laſt, in regard its Proſpect is farther extended, and that it ſeems from the Windows of this Houſe that all the Boats that come continually to <hi>Paris,</hi> are coming to land at its door, and here it is that they ſeparate on the one ſide or the other, to go either to the <hi>Port St. Paul</hi> or to the <hi>Port de la Tournelle,</hi> where uſually they unload their Burthens. The mova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are magniſick; conſiſting of Beds moſt rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embroidered, Chenets, Tables, Sconces, Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſes, and Ornaments for the Chimneys of Goldſmiths work, of Tapiſtry heighthened with Gold and Silver; all things are there in abundance. The Pictures are alſo of the beſt ſort, ſince they are of Monſieur <hi>le Bruns</hi> hand, who is at preſent the chief Painter of the Kingdom. The Gallery which is on the left hand is all of his Work, the ſides of which, inſtead of Wainſcot are coverd with Paintings in freſquo, ſuch as employ the Curious a long time in beholding them, who take a mighty pleaſure to diſcover in theſe pieces that which they uſually ſeek for in <hi>Italy</hi> with ſo much concern and pains. The Apartments below Stairs are very pleaſant. There are Baths, and a Hall extreme convenient for Summer, by reaſon of that freſh air which is there gathered. In fine,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62624:80"/>
nothing is wanting in this houſe, and one may find there all the conveniences that can be deſired of what ſort ſoever; he who cauſed it to be built having not ſpared the greateſt of expenſes to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſuch as it is.</p>
               <p>Leaving this houſe we ought to paſs along the Key called <hi>Quay Dauphin,</hi> otherwiſe, the Key of Balcones, almoſt all the Houſes that are built here having Balcones before the Window, among the reſt one ought to be obſerved more eſpecially, which is that in which at preſent dwells Monſieur the Abbot of St. <hi>Croix,</hi> Maſter of Requeſts, it was built with much care, by the deceaſed Monſieur <hi>Heſſelin,</hi> who was one of the moſt curious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his time, and it was deſigned by the Sieur <hi>le Veau.</hi> The Front is of a very handſom deſign, without crowding in of inſignificant Ornaments. And on the inſide there are very beautiful Ciel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with Chimney-pieces of the beſt ſort of Workmanſhip. The Court is in truth a little too obſcure, but this defect is advantagiouſly repaired by the Symmetry of the Building on that ſide, and by the curious proſpect from thence.</p>
               <p>Near this is the houſe of Monſieur <hi>Roulier,</hi> the Stair-caſe of which is extreme handſom, it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Ionick Pillars and adorned with Baſ-relieſe. The face on the ſide of the Court is embelliſhed with Architecture handſom to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. It was built by Monſieur <hi>de Aliſi.</hi> Having ſeen this Houſe we ought next to go to</p>
               <p>The Church of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> tho it be not yet finiſhed. That which is begun is of a very fine ſort of Architecture. The Porta is ſupported with Dorick Pillars. And when this Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated it will deſerve to be compared to the beſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62624:80"/>
of the kind, for the deſign and regularity with which it is carried on. The <hi>Sieur du Vau</hi> gave the firſt deſign. M. <hi>Champagne</hi> an able Painter, being Churchwarden, hath the care of the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the Architecture there, and Monſieur <hi>le Duc</hi> hath carried on the Work in ſuch manner as we now ſee it.</p>
               <p>Leaving the Iſle <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> we go over the Bridge <hi>de la Tournelle,</hi> built of Free-ſtone, after the ſame Model with that of <hi>Pont-Neuf;</hi> it hath two ways raiſed on each ſide, for the conveniency of thoſe that walk over on foot.

               <p>This is a famous Abby of Canons regular of the Order of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> of which Monſieur <hi>de Coiſlin,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> chief Almoner to the King, and Brother of the Duke of <hi>Coiſlin,</hi> is Abbot. This Abby is very ancient, of ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity that we are not well aſſured of the time of its firſt Foundation. We know only that King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Groſs in the year 1113. cauſed a great Church to be built in this place, where was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but a very little Chappel: and we read in the Church-Hiſtory of <hi>Paris,</hi> that <hi>Thomas de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaux</hi> Canon of <hi>Noſtre-Dame,</hi> and a famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Theology, having a difference with one of his Diſciples named <hi>Abaillard,</hi> retired with ſome of his Scholars to a place near the little Chappel of St. <hi>Victor,</hi> and that he took the habit of a Chanon Regular, which poſſibly might be the Original of this Abby, which from that time did always encreaſe more and more. This happened about the year 1105. The Quarrel between this <hi>Thomas de Champeaux</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Abaillard</hi> is much ſpoken of in the Hiſtories of that time, and there are many very remarkable paſſages in it which notwithſtanding are not proper to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in this Work.</p>
               <p>That which is the moſt curious thing to be ſeen in this Abby is the Library, which is very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and full of the beſt ſort of Books that can be met with.

Counſellor in the Parliament, on condition that it be publick for all ſorts of Perſons oftener than it was before, which has made it of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty advantage and wonderfully frequented by the Studious, who may come three times a Week, <hi>Monday, Wedneſday,</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> and remain there all day long if they pleaſe. It is the only Library of all <hi>Paris</hi> that is open in this manner, but we hope in time there will be others in that City that will yield the like profit. In the other parts of this houſe we find nothing very curious. There is in the Church here great Devotion to our Lady of Succour, and to St. <hi>Clair,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Autun,</hi> who is invoked for ſore Eyes. Among the Monks of St. <hi>Victor</hi> there are many Learned Perſons, ſome of which are Monſieur <hi>de Santeüil,</hi> almoſt the only man in <hi>France</hi> who underſtands to make Inſcriptions in Verſe for publick Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he is of an extraordinary ability in this Science and all things of this nature which we ſee come from him, are intirely fine. <hi>Hugh</hi> of St. <hi>Victor</hi> a famous Divine was alſo of this houſe.</p>
               <p>After you have ſeen the Abby of St. <hi>Victor</hi> you ought to go to the Kings Garden; in the way thither you paſs by</p>
               <p>The Hoſpital of Pity, which is a Limb of the great Hoſpital general; in which they harbour a great number of young Boys and Girls, whom they imploy in divers ſorts of Work, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Girls who make Point of <hi>France,</hi> from which the Houſe does eaſily draw a Profit ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to maintaian them.</p>

               <head>The Kings Garden.</head>
               <p>This Garden is filled with nothing but Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Plants of moſt choice ſorts, which are there nouriſhed and looked after at the Kings Charges. Certain Months in the Year, here are <hi>Botanick</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, to the hearing of which any one may be admitted freely. There is a Doctor of Pyhſick who hath a Sallary for this purpoſe, and who is ordinarily more eminent than the reſt for his Learning. This Lecture is made at ſix of the Clock in the morning, in thoſe parts of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den where the ſeveral Simples grow. One ought to obſerve that half this Garden is taken up by a Mount or eminent Ground, round which they have made an Ally which mounts about it in a Spiral Line, which Ally has on the outward edge a Paliſade of Buſhes, on the top of this Mount is an Accacias from whence you have a Proſpect over the River and <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> St. <hi>Antoine.</hi> On the left hand as you come into the Court, is a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratory, where they alſo work publickly in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry during certain months in the year. The Compoſitions which they make there are given freely to ſuch poor that need 'em.</p>
               <p>But that which is the greateſt Curioſity of all is the Cabinet of Monſieur <hi>du Vernay</hi> one of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and one of the prime Men of the Kingdom for Diſſections and Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Few People ever made a farther progreſs than he in this ſort of operation, in which he hath made a great number of Diſcoveries, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62624:83"/>
have gained him a mighty Reputation. In Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he reads publickly in the great Hall, which is contrived in manner of an Amphitheatre, that may contain abundance of People. Monſieur <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> the Kings chief Phyſitian hath the overſight and the adminiſtration of this Garden; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the Doctors in Phyſick and Chirurgery who read the Lectures of Chymiſtry and Diſſection, and he hath a Penſion from the King for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The Superintendant of the Buildings is the abſolute Maſter here, and it is under his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that all theſe things are tranſacted. Leaving this place you may go to</p>
               <p>The Hoſpital-general; altho for delicate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it is no very pleaſing object to ſee the poor, yet it is a curious thing, and ſurpriſing at the ſame time, to ſee ſo great a number of all ſorts and ages, whoſe miſeries are eaſed with ſo much care and Charity, that nothing is wanting to them but only Liberty. This great Building which contains in it more than ſix thouſand perſons, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as you come in like a little Town, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the quantity and diverſity of the houſes, although it be all the Work of this age, and all the poor People that are in it are maintained upon Charity only. The Church was built not above ſeven or eight years ago: It is of a very peculiar deſign; a great Dome of eight Angles raiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Arches, againſt each of which are placed eight Naves or ſpaces to contain all the poor people. The Altar is contrived juſt in the middle under the Dome, ſo that it may be ſeen on eight ſides for the conveniency of all. There is nothing mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in the Work, except only the Portico by which people enter from abroad, which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62624:83"/>
by certain Ionick Pillars, over which is placed a ſmall Attick, but this is of no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reliſh however. On the two ſides of this Entrance are placed two Pavilions where are lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Eccleſiaſticks who ſerve the Chappel, and adminiſter the Sacraments to the poor People. It is obſervable that they imploy here all the young girls of the Hoſpital, who are very numerous, in making point of <hi>France,</hi> ſome embroider, others make the Loops, others the Ground, which cauſes much work to be diſpatched by their hands in a little time, of which is made a conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The firſt Preſident <hi>de Belliévre</hi> was one of thoſe who were moſt active in the Foundation of this great Hoſpital, which at that time was thought incredible; and this was done on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that exceſſive number of Poor which were continually about the Streets and Churches of <hi>Paris,</hi> to the great incommodity of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. In the mean time this Illuſtrious Magiſtrate being aſſiſted by the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Aiguillon,</hi> and ſome others, perſons of Authority, accompliſhed his deſign, and cauſed all thoſe to be ſhut up in this Hoſpital who were found begging, or who were not able to get their Living.</p>
               <p>Almoſt over againſt the Gate of this Hoſpital, in a large place, is kept the Horſe-Market on the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> in every Week.</p>

               <head>Les Gobelins.</head>
               <p>This Houſe is almoſt behind the <hi>Faux-bourg</hi> of Saint <hi>Marcel.</hi> Here it is that the Curious ought to apply themſelves with their utmoſt diligence to obſerve all the Rarities that are to be ſeen in this place, in regard there is no part of <hi>Europe</hi> that produces ſo many. But to give you a juſter Idea, I ſhall make a Deſcription.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, it is not unuſeful to obſerve that this place has been always inhabited by excellent Artiſts: and that heretofore it was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the famous Dyers of Wood, the firſt of which was one <hi>Giles Goblin,</hi> who, as report ſays, found out the ſecret of dying the beſt Scarlet, or at leaſt that he firſt brought it to <hi>Paris,</hi> from whence it comes that ever ſince it hath been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Scarlet <hi>des Gobelines.</hi> This Houſe hath ſtill kept the old name as well as the little River that runs behind it, which Water hath a peculiar Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue for the dying of this Colour, and before that time it was called the River of <hi>Bieure.</hi> The Dutch have made it their utmoſt endeavour to diſcover this ſecret, but they could never do it with all their induſtry and expence, however they come pretty near, but they cannot arrive to that Degree of perfection, which our Dyers have in making this Beautiful colour, which makes ſo great a Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize through all <hi>Europe,</hi> nay in a manner through the whole World, for much goes into the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> But not to ſay more of this houſe and River called the <hi>Gobelins,</hi> let us now
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62624:84"/>
ſpeak of the things that are there to be ſeen. It is to be obſerved that all the Artiſts that work here are employed only for the King, and that their Works which they perform here are for the Decoration and Ornament of the Royal Palaces. Some years ſince the number of the Workmen was much greater than at preſent; but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious quantity of Work which they did is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that they are now much retrenched, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Repoſitories where the Kings moveables are kept are ſufficiently filled, in ſuch ſort that one may ſay at this time there is no Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> that hath more Goldſmiths work or Tapiſtry.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that is to be viewed are the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, which are, in a manner, all of the hand of famous Monſieur <hi>le Brun,</hi> the ableſt Painter of <hi>France,</hi> and whoſe Works are ſo much ſought after and admired by all thoſe who are skilled in Painting. As a reward for whoſe great pains which he is continually engaged in, and for the Emulation of thoſe who have any Genius in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning, the King hath been pleaſed not only to give him large Penſions, to declare him Overſeer of all the Works in Painting and Sculpture which are done for him, and to name him Director of the Academy-Royal of Painting, but he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ennobled him by his Letters Patents. The Principal Pieces of this excellent Maſter are at <hi>Verſailles.</hi> The great Stair-caſe is almoſt all of his hand, and he is working at preſent in the great Gallery, which takes up all that ſide that looks upon the Garden. In the Louvre there are alſo divers Cieling-pieces of his deſign. In the Church of <hi>Nôtre-dame</hi> are two Pieces, one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the other
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62624:85"/>
the Cruciſying of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> both which Pieces are in the Quire on each ſide of the high Altar, and which one may eaſily diſtinguiſh from other Pictures, at the <hi>Carmelites</hi> in the <hi>Faux-bourg</hi> St. <hi>Jacques.</hi> The ſecond great Piece which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents a <hi>Magdelain</hi> at the feet of our Saviour in the Houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Leper,</hi> is of his hand, ſo alſo another Piece of the ſame Saint, in one of the Chappels of the ſame Church, which was much admired by the Queen Mother, who began firſt from the ſight of this Piece to have an eſteem for M. <hi>le Brun,</hi> whom ſoon after ſhe made known at Court by the means of the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>Seguier,</hi> by whom he was mightily eſteemed. Moſt of the Works which are wrought in the <hi>Gobelins</hi> are of his deſign, and it is he that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Performance. His Cabinet is one of the moſt curious that can be ſeen; in which he has collected the Paintings of the moſt excellent Maſters that have been, and ſeveral other rare Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which have a Relation to Painting. I will ſay one thing more to the Glory of M. <hi>le Brun</hi> that he hath under him ſeveral other Painters who do nothing elſe but Copy his Draughts and work after his Deſigns.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which one ought to ſee in this Place, is the Tapiſtry Works. Among that great number of Artiſts that work here in this Manufacture, there are ſome <hi>Flemings,</hi> who are equal to the moſt Renowned of the laſt age at <hi>Anvers.</hi> Nothing can be ſeen finer than what comes from their hands, be it in Hiſtory or Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip, in both which Gold and Silver are imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even to profuſion, and they have ſome pieces there that are all over heighthned after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62624:85"/>
When we have well examind theſe things we muſt conclude that there is no part of the World where they make better Work, or better underſtand the perfect way of Shadowing the Wool. It is however Monſieur <hi>le Brun,</hi> who gives them the Deſigns, and for the moſt part they Copy his Paintings. Of late they have alſo copied ſome of the beſt things of <hi>Pouſſin,</hi> (the greateſt man of our age without contradiction) among others, the little <hi>Moſes</hi> which they had from the Cabinet of the lately deceaſed Madam <hi>Leſcot:</hi> The Rock in the Wilderneſs with the Fountain of Waters flowing from it, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the deceaſed Monſieur <hi>Dreux</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of the great Council, and two other Pictures from the Cabinet of Monſieur the <hi>Chevalier de Lorraine,</hi> one of which repreſents the paſſage through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and the other the Worſhip of the Golden Calf. They have made alſo many Pieces from <hi>Raphael</hi> and <hi>Michael Angelo.</hi> But one of their moſt beautiful and curious things is the Hiſtory of the King repreſented in divers Pieces, of which ſubject may be made divers Suits of Hangings, in which are contained the principal Actions of his Life, as the Battels he hath gained, the Towns he hath taken, the Ceremonies of his Marriage, the renovation of the Alliance with the Deputies of the thirteen Cantons of <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> and many other Paſſages of ſuch like nature, the Borders of theſe Pieces have the Ground-work of Gold, with Groteſques, and ſeveral Devices and Cyphers at the Corners and in the middle which things are of coloured Silk, and ſhew delicately upon the Gold ground. The Sieur <hi>Gens</hi> and <hi>le Fevre</hi> have the overſight and direction of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62624:86"/>
thoſe who work at that ſort of Tapiſtry which is called the high Liſts, and the Sieurs <hi>Mozin</hi> and <hi>de la Croix,</hi> thoſe who work at the low Liſts.</p>
               <p>After you have ſeen the Tapiſtries you ought to ſee the place where they carve and engrave up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Copper and Braſs for Cloſets and ſuch like matters. It is here that they made thoſe curious Locks that are to be ſeen at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and the <hi>Louvre,</hi> which are wrought with ſuch delicate Workmanſhip.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Court through which you paſs to ſee the things of which we have been ſpeaking, you ought not to forget to viſit the houſes of <hi>le Sieur Loir</hi> and <hi>le Sieur Villiers,</hi> two famous Goldſmiths, who are imployed continually for the King: You will find often under their hands Works of mighty value. Here it was where they made thoſe two Baluſters for the Alcove, which are at <hi>Verſailles</hi> before the Kings Bed, and the Queens. One may know of what Beauty, Workmanſhip, and Riches they are, ſince the price of each amounted to two hundred thouſand Crowns. They are all of ſolid Silver without any thing to help out, either within the Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals or Rails, other than the thickneſs of the metal it ſelf, which has been employed with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>Near the Goldſmiths, in the ſame Court on the right hand, you may find certain Works of an extraordinary nature performed by the <hi>Sieur Branquier,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur Ferdinand de Meliori,</hi> who were both invited out of <hi>Italy</hi> to make here a kind of <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work; which will coſt much time and expence. They are a ſort of Pictures, the different colours of which are made of inlaid
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62624:86"/>
Stones, which repreſent Figures extreme like, and very well deſigned. Theſe Pieces are moſt commonly compoſed of <hi>Agate, Lapis Lazuli, Jacinth,</hi> and <hi>Cornelian,</hi> which makes a colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more lively and brillant than ordinary Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which Stones are joyned together with a ſort of <hi>Maſtick</hi> very hard. They are ordinarily placed upon Ebony Cabinets, or Tables of great price. At the habitation of one of theſe Artiſts there is a little Garden behind his houſe, which is very pretty and in which are divers Ornaments of artificial Rocks and Shell-work.</p>
               <p>After you have examined theſe things, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn by the ſame way to viſit other Curioſities that are to be ſeen in another Court. There are two Workhouſes for Carvers and Statuaries, the one of which is governed by the <hi>Sieur Baptiſte,</hi> in which is the Statue of Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> in white Marble, which is to be placed at St. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> upon the Tomb which the King hath there cauſed to be raiſed for him; here is alſo a great Muſe, bigger than the life, of excellent Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, which is intended to be placed at <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles</hi> with divers other Statues of the ſame big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The other Workhouſe is governed by the <hi>Sieur Coeſvau,</hi> who for the moſt part works af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the life. He hath made ſeveral Buſts and other Figures of repreſentation. This is he that made the Kings Buſt which ſtands in the great Stair-caſe at <hi>Verſailles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this you ought to ſee the Embroiderers, who are in a Hall near which you paſs to go to the great Court. They are employed upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Pieces, in which the richneſs of the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als does moſt commonly vie with the beauty of the Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:62624:87"/>
Near this place here are ſtill two Statuaries more in two Low Rooms, where you may ſee ſome Pieces in Marble and ſome in Lead for the Fountains at <hi>Verſailles.</hi> Beſides thoſe things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed, there are many other Curioſities in this great Houſe, which the Curious may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and which would be too long to treat of in particular. We have already ſaid that here are all ſorts of excellent Artiſts who have been invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hither from different Parts. Among whom we ought not to forget M. <hi>Audrean,</hi> one of the ableſt Gravers of his time: he hath etcht and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all the great Pieces of M. <hi>le Brun,</hi> as the Triumph of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, the Battel of <hi>Maxentius,</hi> all the Hiſtory of <hi>Alexander,</hi> in five great Pieces, and divers other things of that great Painter. All that comes from his hand, is of a ſingular beauty, and moſt exact deſign, the moſt correct that can be: which occaſions that all his Work ſells much dearer than others, nay often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is difficult to get them at any rate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard all the beſt Proofs are reſerved for the Kings Cabinet. He hath alſo graved ſeveral Pieces from the famous <hi>Pouſſin,</hi> which all Curious Perſons treaſure up in their Cloſets. The Sieur <hi>le Clere</hi> dwells here alſo who is very able and well eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Art. And theſe are the moſt curious things at the Houſe called <hi>les Gobelins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence we return again into the Town by the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> St. <hi>Marcel,</hi> and we paſs before the Church of that name, which was firſt found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Roland</hi> Earl of <hi>Blare</hi> Nephew of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne,</hi> who was a great Benefactor to it, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring great Priviledges upon the Canons who ſerved there. This Church did heretofore bear
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62624:87"/>
the title of S. <hi>Clement.</hi> But the Body of S. <hi>Marcel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> being found here it took his name, which it hath kept ever ſince. The famous <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> ſurnamed the Maſter of the Sentences, is here interred. And this is his Epitaph,</p>
               <q xml:lang="lat">Hic jacet Magiſter <hi>Petrus Lombardus, Pariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis</hi> Epiſcopus, qui compoſuit Librum Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiarum, Gloſſas Pſalmorum, &amp; Epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum: cujus obitus lies eſt <hi>13.</hi> Cal. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſti</hi> Anno <hi>1164.</hi>

               <p>There are alſo in this <hi>Fauxbourg,</hi> the <hi>Cordelier</hi> Nuns. Whoſe Convent was firſt built at <hi>Troyes</hi> by <hi>Thibaut</hi> VII. Earl of <hi>Champagne</hi> and of <hi>Brie,</hi> but they were removed to <hi>Paris</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe of the inconveniency of the place where they were firſt founded. <hi>Margaret de Provence</hi> Wife to St. <hi>Lewis</hi> cauſed the Church to be begun as we now ſee it, and <hi>Blanch</hi> her Daughter Widow of the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Nun there, and gave a conſiderable Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to the Eſtate of this Houſe, She built the Cloiſter where are yet remaining her Arms in ſeveral places.

Friers of the great Convent in <hi>Paris;</hi> there is nothing of ſingular note in their Church, no more than in that of</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Medard,</hi> the Pariſh-Church of this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; where there hapned in the laſt Age a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tumult, raiſed by the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> who came flocking with Arms in hand to Maſſacre the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks being then at <hi>Veſpers;</hi> the cauſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended was that the noiſe of the Bells of this Church did diſturb them in hearing their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which at that time was in a houſe cloſe by. But they were puniſhed for their Raſhneſs; for the Citizens taking Arms, killed all thoſe that fell in their power. This was the firſt occaſion of that hatred which the <hi>Pariſians</hi> bear to thoſe of the pretended Reformed Religion; and the Hiſtorians obſerve that from that time the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> threw off their Mask and went arm'd in the Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> but the Catholicks not being able to endure this, it was the occaſion of many Diſorders which hapned afterwards.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Patru</hi> from whom we have a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of Pleadings extremely fine, is interred in this Church. Monſieur <hi>d'Ablencour</hi> had ſo great an eſteem for his Judgment that on his death-bed he recommended his Works to his Correction.</p>
               <p>In this Quarter near the little Church of S. <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> is an ancient houſe built in the time of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> which is not far from the River <hi>des Gobelins,</hi> where that good King would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſe to paſs his hours of Solitude, in Prayer. It is ſaid that under <hi>Charles</hi> VI. there happened here a very unhappy accident, which was partly the cauſe of the diſtraction with which that Prince was afflicted the greateſt part of his Reign.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62624:88"/>
The Story is thus reported. The <hi>Pariſians,</hi> who always made it their glory paſſionately to love their King, being deſirous to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Charles</hi> VI. with a Ball in this houſe, upon his return from a great Victory which he had gained over the Revolted <hi>Flemings;</hi> The King was at this Entertainment with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lords diſguiſed like Salvages, and apparelled in Linnen pitcht over and covered with Flax, like hair, and ſo cloſe fitted to the Body that it ſeemed to be the natural skin; as he was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with the young Lords one of the Company approaching too near, a Flambeau held by a Prince who was deſirous to diſcover the King from the reſt, it hapned that the Flame caught the Flax and burnt furiouſly; and they being all faſtened to one another, the King could find no ſecurity but by caſting himſelf all covered with Flames as he was, into the Arms of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> who very happily being then preſent extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the Flame by covering him all over with her great Gown. The other Maſquers were all either ſtifled or roaſted alive and died within two days after, the King and <hi>Mantoüillet</hi> only eſcaping, which laſt caſt himſelf headlong into a Tub of Water, which he hapned to light of not far from the place. After this ſad accident <hi>Charles</hi> began to fall extreme Moroſe and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and the Idea of ſo great a peril prepared his brain for that madneſs which ſeized upon him near the Town of <hi>Mans,</hi> in ſuch manner as is recorded by Monſieur <hi>de Mezeray.</hi> And this is all that is to be ſeen in this <hi>Fauxbourg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gates by which you go into the Town are two, that of St. <hi>Victor</hi> near the Abby of that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62624:89"/>
name, of which Abby we have already ſpoken. This Gate was lately repaired but not with ſo great expence as the others. There is only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in Baſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>taille over the Arch, a great Ship of War, which are the Town Arms, with this Inſcription beneath it,</p>
               <q xml:lang="lat">QUAE NON MARIA?</q>
               <q>What Seas does ſhe not Sail through?</q>
               <p>The other Gate is that of St. <hi>Marcel,</hi> behind St. <hi>Geneviéue du Mont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Near this on the <hi>Foſſe</hi> between the two Gates lives Monſieur <hi>de Troyes,</hi> whoſe Pictures you ought not to ſail of ſeeing. He was ſent by the King into <hi>Bavaria</hi> to take the Picture of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame the Dauphineſs. Few Painters have been more ſucceſsful than he after the Life. This hath attained him the Practice of moſt Perſons of Quality, who cauſe themſelves to be drawn by his hand.</p>
               <p>We ſhall ſay nothing of the Convent of Engliſh Nuns, nor of the Houſe of the Fathers of the Chriſtian Doctrine, which are alſo upon the ſame Foſſe, there being nothing curious about them to remark, unleſs it be one of the beſt Proſpects that we can ſee, by reaſon of the high ſituation of the Place where theſe two houſes ſtand.</p>

               <head>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity Quarter.</head>
               <p>THIS Quarter is one of the antienteſt and beſt Peopled of all <hi>Paris.</hi> It takes up a very great ſpace of Ground, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the fourth part of the Town. <hi>Philip Auguſtus,</hi> at ſuch time as he went to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> with <hi>Richard</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> againſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62624:90"/>
the <hi>Sarrazins,</hi> gave order that during his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (which laſted a whole Year) this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be incloſed with Walls; ſome Remains of which one may perceive at this Day.</p>
               <p>The Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> is ſo antient, that, as ſome hold, <hi>Charlemagne</hi> was its Founder. This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is built upon certain old Titles, which are preſerved with great care. Notwithſtanding there are many Learned Men, who are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion; among others Monſieur <hi>Joli,</hi> Grand Chanter of <hi>Noſtre-Dame,</hi> who has clearly proved his Sentiments, in his <hi>Little Tract of the Epiſcopal Schools.</hi> But if it be doubtful, whether it were founded by that Great Emperor; it is however moſt certain, that it began to appear in a very little time after his Reign, which was in <hi>France</hi> a Glorious one, for Learning and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, to whom this great Prince ſhewed all the Favour that could be. And in Gratitude, they have rendered him famous to Poſterity, not only as the moſt knowing Emperor of that Age; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Braveſt and moſt Glorious. In the mean time, the Univerſity have taken him for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, and on the Day of his Feaſt, the Exerciſes ceaſe in all Colledges. We ſhall ſay nothing of its antient Splendor, nor of the Credit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which it formerly enjoyed. It is well known, that moſt of the great Affairs, have been tranſacted by the advice of this Univerſity, and that Kings have not diſdain'd to Conſult it, in their moſt preſſing Occaſions. Popes themſelves have in a manner appeal'd hither, and have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſued for the Suffrages of this Univerſity, to authoriſe their Elections, and ſupport them againſt Competitors.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Duboulay</hi> in the Hiſtory which he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62624:90"/>
hath made of this Univerſity in three Volumes, in Folio, makes mention of many Illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who have iſſued from hence. It hath been ſo numerous and ſo full of Scholars, that we ought not to omit obſerving here, one ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing, which happened under <hi>Charles</hi> VI. That Prince being fallen into a Diſtraction, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers and Proceſſions were appointed to be made for his Recovery. All the Companies and Communalties went afoot, in Proceſſion to St. <hi>Denis</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and the Parliament, as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Body of the Kingdom, begun this Act of Piety. The Univerſity had alſo their appointed day to go thither, and <hi>Juvenal des <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſins</hi> records. That all the Scholars were obliged to aſſiſt with their ſeveral Heads and Members, who belonged to them: He adds, That they all made ſo great a number of Men, that the beginning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, was entering into the Church of St <hi>Denis,</hi> when the Rector, who went laſt, was hardly gone out of the Church of the <hi>Mathu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins,</hi> where they firſt met together. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Scholars and Colledges is now very much diminiſhed. Formerly one might have reckoned one Hundred, at preſent you can hardly find Thirty: Among which there are only nine that maintan Exerciſes <hi>(Des baſſes Claſſes)</hi> of the lower Claſſes, and they are</p>

               <p>It is needleſs to inſert the names of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where they do not teach; they are but little known, and ſerve only for the Lodgings of certain Scholars, called <hi>Bourſiers,</hi> who live there upon the Penſions which the Colledge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them yearly. The Univerſity had alſo its own Juriſdiction apart, and if any of its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers had committed any Crime, it was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for the Publick Judge to condemn them. Of this you may read an Example in an Epitaph, in the <hi>Mathurins</hi> Cloiſter. Two Scholars having done certain Crimes worthy of Death, were Executed by Sentence of the Provoſt of <hi>Paris:</hi> The Univerſity conceiving themſelves wounded in this Sentence, ſuſpended their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and by this means obliged the Provoſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> to bring back the Bodies of theſe two Scholars to the <hi>Mathurins,</hi> after he had himſelf taken them down from the Gallows at <hi>Montfau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> where they there hung; and after he had kiſt their Cheeks, tho they had been Executed above four Months. There are many Examples of this ſort. But ſince that time things are very much changed; and though at preſent the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity is full of Perſons of great Learning, yet her Credit and Authority are mightily diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; eſpecially ſince about the middle of the laſt Age, ſhe has ſuffered ſome Loſſes, which ſhe will have much ado ever to repair.</p>
               <p>In the mean time this hinders not, but that the Sciences flouriſh here, more than in any other part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and are here taught with much
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62624:91"/>
Succeſs and Profit. The Univerſity is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four Faculties, and over them all they have for their Head, a Rector, who is choſen every three Months. Formerly they choſe him every ſix Weeks, but of late four times a Year hath been thought often enough. The four Faculties are</p>
               <p>DIVINITY,</p>
               <p>LAW,</p>
               <p>PHYSICK,</p>
               <p>The ARTS.</p>
               <p>Divinity is profeſt only in the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and in the Colledge of <hi>Navarre.</hi> For the Law, as it is divided into the Civil Law, and the Canon Law, ſo there are Profeſſors for both in a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which ſtands in the <hi>Rue Saint Jean de Beauvais.</hi> About two years ſince, the King hath founded a new Chair for the <hi>French</hi> Law, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt by Monſieur <hi>de Launay,</hi> who makes his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in the Colledge of <hi>Cambray</hi> near St. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s Fountain. There is but one Colledge for Phyſick, and that is in the <hi>Rue de la Bucherie;</hi> where there is an Amphitheater (as the Phyſick Bills call it) in which they often make Diſſections of humane Bodies.</p>
               <p>As for the Faculty of the Arts, which is the laſt, that is ſubdivided into four Nations: The Nation of <hi>France,</hi> the Nation of <hi>Picardy,</hi> the Nation of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Nation of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> the laſt of theſe was put in the room of that of <hi>England,</hi> excluded by reaſon of thoſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Wars, which have been between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Theſe four Nations are again ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into other Provinces, which would be too long to recite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62624:92"/>
This is what may be ſaid in general of the Univerſity, of which I ſhall ſay more in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing the remarkable Places therein.</p>
               <p>I begin this Quarter at the Key called, <hi>Quay de la Tournelle,</hi> from whence you paſs before a Houſe built by the late Monſieur <hi>Martin.</hi> In which Madam <hi>de Miramion,</hi> ſo well known by all pious People, hath about eight years ſince ſettled a new Company of Nuns, who live under the Rule of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> of the Congregation of St. <hi>Geneviéve.</hi> Of this new Company ſhe is the Foundreſs. The Houſe is well built and deſerves to be ſeen. Near this is</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hôtel de M. de Nemond,</hi> one of thoſe Preſidents, who are called <hi>Preſidents a Mortier,</hi> in which Houſe you will ſee very good Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but above all a Library well furniſht, which this Illuſtrious Magiſtrate often viſits. From hence you paſs into</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rüe de Bernardins,</hi> which lies on the left hand, in which Street are ſeveral very pretty Houſes; among others, one wherein lives Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>du Vaurouy.</hi> Here are ſome Paintings of the laſt Age well eſteemed. A little further you will enter into</p>
               <p>The Colledge of the <hi>Bernardins,</hi> which ſerves for all thoſe who are of the Order of <hi>Ciſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi> It is an antient Foundation, but that which is moſt obſervable, is the great deſign of Pope <hi>Bennet</hi> XII. who was formerly a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man of this Order, and who deſired to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his name Illuſtrious, in building this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Surpriſing Magnificence. The Walls that encloſe the Ground, are of a wonderful thickneſs and ſolidity; and one would think, that the Holy Father would rather encloſe a Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62624:92"/>
than a Colledge of Religious Men; the Chapter-Houſe is perfectly well Vaulted over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and at preſent ſerves for their School. But that which is more Beautiful is the Structure of their Church, which ought to be conſidered as one of the faireſt <hi>Gothick</hi> Buildings in all <hi>France;</hi> its Roof is of an extraordinary heighth, with Chappels on each ſide. True it is, that but part of this great Work is finiſht, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Holy Father's Death, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened too ſoon; however by his Laſt Will be appointed, That what he had begun ſhould be compleated, and to that end he left a Summ of Money; but that falling into the Hands of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers on the way, as they conveyed it into <hi>France,</hi> during thoſe Troubles, which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> VI. the Work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained imperfect as it now is. One the ſide next the Sacriſty, you ought to ask to ſee a little turning Stair-Caſe, very curiouſly contrived, in which two People may at the ſame time aſcend and deſcend, without being ſeen to each other. This is by two winding Aſcents, like a Snails Shell, managed one upon the other in the ſame round Space or Room. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s piece is admired by ſuch Curious Perſons who have ſeen it, in regard there are but very few Parallels. When the General of the <hi>Ciſtertians</hi> comes to <hi>Paris,</hi> he uſually makes his abode in this Houſe.</p>
               <p>We ought to obſerve, that ſeveral Religious Orders have a right to have Colledges in this Univerſity, whoſe Members may take Degrees, and paſs Doctors; but ſome others have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this advantage, or the Univerſity hath not granted it to them for ſpecial Reaſons.</p>

As you go out of the <hi>Bernardins,</hi> on the left Hand, you find the Church of St. <hi>Nicolas du Chardonnet,</hi> newly Rebuilt of a very handſom De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. This Church is ſo called, in regard it ſtands on a piece of Ground, formerly over-run with Thiſtles (in <hi>French</hi> called <hi>Chardons.)</hi> Which Ground the Monks of <hi>Victor</hi> gave for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Pariſh Church, much wanting in this Quarter. The Church is not yet quite finiſht. All that is Curious here, is a Chappel where <hi>Monſieur le Brun</hi> hath begun to Work. You may here ſee the Tomb of his Mother, deſigned by himſelf, and wrought in Marble by the Sieur <hi>Baptiſte,</hi> on which there are very delicate Figures.</p>
               <p>All this Quarter hath nothing very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. From hence you go to the <hi>Carmes,</hi> at the Entry of St. <hi>Geneviéve's</hi> Hill, near the <hi>Place-Maubert,</hi> which is one of the greateſt Markets of all <hi>Paris.</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62624:93"/>
other things, ſhe gave them her Crown of Gold, ſet about with divers Precious Stones of conſiderable Value; alſo the Flower-de-Lys of Gold, which ſhe received at her Coronation, her Girdle ſet with Pearis, and all her Silver Veſſels; together with the Summ of Fifteen Hundred Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins of Gold, which in thoſe days amounted very high. They made uſe of all this to build their Church, and their Covent, which have nothing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry handſom. There is in this Church a great Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Lady of <hi>Mount-Carmel,</hi> to which reſort a very great number of People, who are devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Holy Virgin, in order to gain certain Indulgences, and this is every ſecond Sunday of the Month. Not long ago they Rebuilt their Great Altar, after a deſign very ſingular; it is ſupported with Pillars of Free-ſtone, Painted like Marble, which make a very handſom ſhew.</p>

Note that this Hill was formerly called <hi>Mons Locutitius,</hi> but for what reaſon is not known. Higher on the Hill, where this Colledge ſtands, is the Abby of St. <hi>Geneviéve,</hi> and next to it</p>
               <p>The Church of St. <hi>Eſtienne du Mont,</hi> a Pariſh Church. This Church is of ſo old a Foundation, that it is not certainly known in what time it was firſt Built. That Building which we ſee at preſent, was undertaken in the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and after it had remain'd a long time imperfect, it was not finiſhed till under <hi>Henry</hi> IV. Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> his firſt Wife, gave a Summ of Money for making the Portal, herſelf laying the firſt Stone, on the Twelfth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1610. This Portal is curiouſly wrought, and they have beſtowed there a profuſe number of Sculptures, which had made a much better ſhow, if they had been manag'd and diſpoſed with more care. The inſide of this Church is very neat, and lightſome; the Roof is very high and well extended. There are between Pillar and Pillar, certain Arches that ſupport Galleries of Communication, and turn about each Pillar with much Art. The Tribune over the entrance into the Quire is very hardy, as are alſo the little Stairs that go up thither, which wind about the thick Pillars of the <hi>Croiſée.</hi> The Chapel of the Holy Virgin, behind the great Altar, is alſo well Built. But that which the Curious ought to obſerve more carefully than all, is the Pulpit, which is of excellent Workmanſhip, adorn'd with Sculptures and Bas-reliefs, of a wonderful Deſign and Performance. The Statue of <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſupports the whole Body of the Work, about whom are placed ſeveral little Figures of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Virtues: Upon the Canopy over-head, is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62624:95"/>
a great Angel, holding Two Trumpets. All theſe things are perfectly well deſign'd; and this Pulpit, is, without contradiction, the moſt Beautiful of all <hi>Paris.</hi> It ought to be known, that Monſieur <hi>Paſcal,</hi> one of the greateſt Wits that <hi>France</hi> ever had, Author of that Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Book, called <hi>Penſeés ſur la Religion,</hi> (Thoughts upon Religion) and of ſeveral others of the ſame Beauty and Learning, is Buryed in this Church. <hi>La Sueur</hi> a famous Painter, of whom I have already often made mention, is alſo here interr'd.</p>

               <p>BEfore we write of the Curioſities in this Houſe, ſomething ought to be ſaid of its Foundation. <hi>Clovis,</hi> as ſome believe, was the firſt Founder, and Dedicated it to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe names it bore a long time. He placed here Secular Canons, who inhabited this Houſe till the Reign of <hi>Lewis the Young,</hi> in the Eleventh Age, at which time the King conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to take the Rule of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and to live in Community, they having till then led very irregular Lives. To eſtabliſh this new Reform, ſome Perſons were brought over from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62624:96"/>
St. <hi>Victors,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Mezeray</hi> acquaints us with the Reaſons, which occaſioned that King to do this. He ſays, That of old time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Memory, there were certain Secular Canons in this Houſe, who had been by the Solicitation of King <hi>Robert the Religious,</hi> freed from the Viſitation of the Biſhop, and placed immediately under that of the Holy See: But it happenning that Pope <hi>Engenius</hi> the Fourth, flying for refuge into <hi>France,</hi> and Lodging in this Houſe, there happened a Diſpute between the Canons and the Holy Father's Officers, on occaſion, that the Canons would have taken to themſelves an Imbroidered Carpet, which the King preſented to his Holineſs, to hang before his <hi>Prie Dieu</hi> (or Seat in the Church) they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that it ought to belong to, and remain in their Church. The Controverſie was ſo hot, that they fell from Words to Blows, and the Canons being the ſtronger Party, aſſaulted the Pope's Officers ſo home, that they were ſome of them Kill'd. The King himſelf coming thither to appeaſe the Tumult, thought he ſhould have been Wounded in the diſorder: To puniſh the Canons for this their inſolence, the King agreed with the Holy Father to Expel them from this Houſe, and to give the care of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to <hi>Suger,</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Denis;</hi> who thereupon drew off 12. Canons Regular from St. <hi>Victors,</hi> and placed them here in the room of the others. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, the Chapter was changed into an Abby, whoſe firſt Abbot was called <hi>Odo.</hi> Since that time the Rule of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath always been obſerved here with much Purity, and this Houſe is become the Chief of all the Congregation in <hi>France:</hi> The Abbot of which, with his four Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62624:96"/>
is the Head of the Order. This Abby had formerly a peculiar Juriſdiction, like that of St. <hi>Germain des Prez;</hi> but in regard this was found to be the cauſe of much Diſorder and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, they were all united to the Body of the <hi>Châtelet.</hi> Many Kings have been Benefactors to this Houſe, but the greateſt was King <hi>Robert,</hi> who built the old Cloiſter, which was taken down under <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, who incloſed for them 17 Arpens (or Acres) of Land. The Houſe hath been often ruined by the <hi>Normans</hi> and the <hi>Danes,</hi> while it was out of the Town; but the Devotion which the <hi>Pariſians</hi> had for St. <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viéve,</hi> their Patroneſs, was the occaſion that the Ruines made by thoſe Barbarous People, were repaired again in a very little time after. The Body of St. <hi>Geneviéve</hi> is in the Shrine behind the great Altar, ſupported by 4 Ionick Pillars, of an extraordinary ſort of Marble. The Cheſt is of Silver-gilt, enricht with Precious Stones of very great value. Father <hi>du Breüil,</hi> who hath Compoſed a Volume <hi>Of the Antiquities of</hi> Paris, tells us, That this Shrine was made by the Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities of ſeveral pious Perſons, and that the Goldſmiths Work came to, One hundred four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and thirteen Marks of Silver, and Eight Marks and an half of Gold to gild it. The Queen Mother, deceaſed, whoſe Piety will be a long time remember'd, in divers Parts of <hi>Paris,</hi> enricht this ſhrine with Noſegays compoſed of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, of a very conſiderable price. There hang round about ſeveral Lamps of Silver, and divers Figures of the ſame Mettal, which are all ſo many Vows made by ſundry People to this Saint.</p>
               <p>All that is of more than ordinary Curioſity in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62624:97"/>
this Church, is the Tomb of <hi>Clovis</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King; it ſtands in the middle of the Quire; his Figure which lies along upon the Tomb, is the ſame which was made for him after his Death. Some years ſince they have raiſed it two Foot and a half, to make room for this Inſcription.</p>

doubt of the Antiquity of the Flower-de-Lys, if they could but believe the Crown on this King's Head, to have been made in his time; but the Flower-de-Lys's are too well faſhioned for that, and have not at all the Ayr of antient time. The Altar is <hi>Iſolé,</hi> that is, ſo contrived, that one may go round it. The little Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is a very Beautiful thing. It is of White Marble, in form of a Dome of Eight Angles, with four Porticos, ſupported with ſmall <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Pillars of <hi>Sicilian</hi> Marble, whoſe Capitals are of Braſs gilt, very well carved, and Figures of Angels on the Pedeſtals, with other Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the ſame. The Body of this Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is inlay'd with divers rich Stones, as <hi>Lapis Lazuli, Agate,</hi> and ſuch like. All the Work ſtands upon a Foot <hi>(en cul de Lampe)</hi> like the bottom of a Lamp, of a blew Marble extream rare. On each ſide are two Statues, of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Denis</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> theſe are of a kind of material Reſembling Marble for its whiteneſs, but much lighter.</p>
               <p>In the Nave of the Church are ſeveral Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, very well adorned with Marble Pillars. The Door that leads into the Quire, over which is the <hi>Jubé,</hi> is of Marble alſo, with Bas-reliefs upon the Attick. The Organs are extream handſom, and the Wainſcot exactly well wrought.

               <p>In the Vault under this Church, you may ſtill ſee the Tomb of St. <hi>Geneviéve,</hi> tho there remains therein nothing of her Body, which is all entire in the Shrine, with the very Boards of her Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin. This Tomb is of Marble without any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament. At one end, upon an Altar which ſtands between two Pillars, is a Croſs adorn'd with certain Agates, with an <hi>Ecce Homo</hi> at the Foot of it, of one intire piece of Coral, very well wrought. Theſe things come from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of the Rev̇erend Father <hi>du Molinet,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62624:99"/>
Preſent it was. There are two other Tombs very antient, of two Biſhops of <hi>Paris,</hi> who dyed with the reputation of Sanctity, and who are invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on the account of ſome particular Diſtempers.</p>
               <p>From hence you ought to go and ſee the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> which you will find very well furniſht with Ornaments of divers Colours very rich, and with a great quantity of Plate. There is no place in this Kingdom, and perhaps in all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> where the divine Offices are Celebrated with more Devotion and Majeſty, than in this Church: All the Religious are extreamly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and one is much Edified to ſee them in the Ceremonies of the Church.</p>
               <p>In the inward parts of the Houſe there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny curious things, particularly as to the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture; about ten years ſince they have made conſiderable Reparations. The great Gate was very inconvenient; and they have built another in the place, after the manner of a double Portico, ſupported by Pillars of the Dorick Order, very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly proportioned, with two Square Pavilions at the Extremities. Over againſt this Gate is a Fountain at the Feet of a Figure of St. <hi>Geneviéve,</hi> in a kind of Niche or Arch, ſet off with two Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Pillars. After this we enter into the Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or rather under a kind of Portico, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on both ſides with Dorick Pillars, like thoſe at the Entrance, but of a handſomer Orderance. At the further end of this Portico, about thirty Paces long, ſtands the great Stair-caſe, which leads to the <hi>Dortoirs,</hi> at the further end of which is a Figure of the Holy Virgin, holding the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>JESUS</hi> in her Armes; it is of Excellent Workmanſhip, as one may eaſily perceive. The Dortoirs have nothing of Magnificent. Their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62624:100"/>
only care is, that all things throughout the place ſhould appear neat, as well as in the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Rooms, in which you may ſee ſeveral Pictures of the antient Abbots of this Houſe. The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is very pleaſant, it is the greateſt of all thoſe that were within the antient Walls of <hi>Paris.</hi> On that ſide next the Portico, of which we have been ſpeaking, you may go into a Chappel dedicated to the Holy Virgin, round which are hung ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pictures of Devotion well Painted. In the middle of this Chappel is a Tomb about a Foot high, on which is the Figure in Braſs of an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Biſhop, in his Pontificial Habits. After you have ſeen theſe things, you ought to viſit tho Apothecary-Room, which is extraordinary neat, and where there are ſeveral Curioſities, for thoſe who are knowing in theſe matters.</p>
               <p>From hence you ought to go up to the Library, which at preſent is eſteemed one of the faireſt and beſt furniſht of <hi>Paris.</hi> It takes up the upper Room of one of thoſe four great Wings, which compoſe this building. It is, in truth, a little too high ſcituated, but in recompenſe of that it is ſo much the lighter. You have there a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Books, placed in Preſſes of very handſom Wainſcot, with the buſts of all the great Men of Antiquity, Coppied from thoſe at <hi>Verſailles.</hi> The Reverend Father <hi>du Molinet,</hi> one of the moſt Learned and able Men of this Age, in the knowledge of Books, and in the curious ſearch of Antiquity, hath the over-ſight and care in theſe matters. They preſerve here a great quantity of Prints, part of which came from one called Monſieur <hi>Hacart,</hi> who was a very curious Perſon, and dying left all that he had Collected to St. <hi>Victors,</hi> St. <hi>Germains des Prez,</hi> and S. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neviéve</hi>'s,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62624:100"/>
but they have here a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more rare and better kept.</p>
               <p>At the end of the Library you enter into the Cabinet of the foreſaid Father, which is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily well furniſhed with Curioſities; you may there find all ſorts, but chiefly Meddals of Gold, Silver and of Braſs bigger and leſſer, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well choſen, and ſome of them extream rare. We ought to conſider this ſett of Meddals, which this Father himſelf hath Collected, as the fulleſt and moſt Compleat, in all <hi>France,</hi> next to that in the King's Cabinet.</p>
               <p>Among other Extraordinary things, in a little Preſs you may ſee certain conſecrated Knives, with which the Antients uſed to cut the Throats of their Victims; a great Platter in which they mixt Wheat, Flower, Oyl and Wine, with which they uſed to rub the Beaſts they Sacrificed; certain Sphinxes or Idols, found among the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; Antique Keys; Stiles, or ſteel Pens, which the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed to write with; a Copper Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to which are faſtened ſeveral little Balls of the ſame Mettal, which may be placed as a Man pleaſed, theſe the Antients uſed to caſt account with; ſeveral ſorts of Lacrimatories, or Glaſs-Viols, in which they uſed to preſerve the Tears of thoſe, who they hired on purpoſe to Weep at Funerals, with ſeveral little Copper Spoons that they made uſe of to gather the Tears up with, from Leather Aprons, which they wore before them at that time, on purpoſe for the Tears to fall in. In another little Preſs on the Right Hand, are all ſorts of Meaſures for Liquids, and Weights to weigh things ſold, according to the uſage of the Antients. In another, he keeps all the Graving Tools of <hi>Parmezan,</hi> with which that

Famous Graver uſed to Counterfeit the old Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of the Antients ſo exactly, that the moſt ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this Art have been deceived, and have taken the Counterfeit Medals, made by that able Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for true ones, and ſtampt in the times of thoſe Men which they repreſent. This was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one of the Curiouſeſt Actions that could be done,. and thoſe who are ſkilful in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters eſteem them much. Together with theſe things, you may ſee here ſeveral Peices of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, invented by Father <hi>Niſeron,</hi> a Minim, of whom we have formerly made mention; the Poot of a ſmall Mummy, very well preſerved; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain extraordinary Fiſhes; and another Rarity, which in the Ages paſt, was eſteemed an entire Treaſure of it ſelf, and that is a great Unicorn's Horn, white as Ivory, five or ſix Poot in heighth, and of a conſiderable thickneſs, it is no leſs Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful than that in the Treaſury at St. <hi>Denis;</hi> for which, as it is ſaid, the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> did once offer, One hundred thouſand Crowns, to have Preſented it to a King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> In another ſmall Cabinet, there are all ſorts of Rich Stones, Shells and Minerals exceeding rare, and ſuch like things. Over againſt the Door, where you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are divers kinds of Habits, made of the Feathers of Paroquets, and other Birds, wrought together with great Art, and brought from <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;</hi> a Cuiraſs and a Corſelet of <hi>Japan,</hi> made of Verniſh, and of an unuſual ſhape; a Sheild made of Silk, probably coming from the ſame Country; and that which can hardly be ſeen elſewhere, a great number of Shoes belonging to almoſt all Nations in the Levant, extreamly different in Shape, from what we wear. There is alſo a Chain made of Wood, very light and very long,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62624:101"/>
all made out of one piece; ſeveral petrified things very curious; and among the reſt one Stone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of divers Pieces, in ſuch manner, that we cannot diſcern, whether it be the production of Art or Nature. There are many other Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to obſerve, as the Jaw of a Fiſh, of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary greatneſs, having in it ſeveral Rows of ſharp Teeth; ſeveral good Pictures, with divers other rare and well Collected things. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father is not only knowing in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but he hath Written ſeveral Learned Pieces, as, <hi>A Defence of</hi> Thomas a Kempis; <hi>A Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the Braſs-Head, which was found at Monſieur</hi> Berrier<hi>'s; The Hiſtory of the Popes by their Medals; The Works of</hi> Stephen de Tourney, augmented very conſiderably with divers Pieces, never. yet Printed; and a learned Commentary, which clears many obſcure places, which would have ſcarcely been underſtood without his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and in fine, <hi>The Hiſtory of the Roman Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There have been many able Men of this Abby, among others Father <hi>Lalleman,</hi> who lived not long ago, and gain'd to himſelf great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by his Books of Devotion, namely, <hi>The Death of the Righteous, and the Saints deſire of Death,</hi> the Reading of which is extream mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. The Reverend Father <hi>de Creil,</hi> now Living, paſſes for one of the beſt Architects that are, and the Deſigns which he has invented, have been followed with good ſucceſs; among others, thoſe in the New-buildings of this Houſe.

                  <hi>The Church of Saint Severin,</hi> which is very Antient, and one may think ſo, in regard the Patron himſelf was the Founder: Who lived in the Reign of <hi>Clovis,</hi> and was by him invited out of <hi>Savoy,</hi> where he was at that time a Hermite, to come into <hi>France,</hi> and cure him of a grievous Fever, with which that King was afflicted; and was at laſt cured through the Prayers of this Holy Man. During his abode at <hi>Paris,</hi> he dwelt in this place, at that time very ſolitary; where there had been already built a ſmall Chappel in a Wood, Dedicated to St. <hi>Clement:</hi> Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd here ſome time, he reſolved to return to his former dwelling; but as he paſt by <hi>Château-Landon,</hi> a ſmall Village in <hi>Gatinois,</hi> he met with two Prieſts, who dwelt there in the reputation of Sanctity; he ſtopt his Journey, and after two years abode with them, he dyed there. <hi>Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>

There is nothing to be ſeen in it of Curioſity, it being but an old Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick Building, not very regular, and very dark in ſome places. The great Altar was finiſht but a while ago; it is compoſed of eight ſmall Marble Pillars, diſpoſed in form of a Semi-Circle, which ſupport a Dome cut in half, as it were, with ſome Ornaments of Braſs gilt, which ſhew very handſomly; it is the Workmanſhip of Monſieur <hi>le Brun.</hi> In the Church-Yard, the ſide next the Church, is raiſed a Tomb, upon which in a demicumbent Poſture, is the Figure of a Young Lord of <hi>Eaſt-Friſeland,</hi> who dyed here, being a Scholar of this Univerſity.

Laſtly, here is the Tomb of the two Scholars, named <hi>Leger Mouſſel,</hi> and <hi>Oliver Bourgeois,</hi> who were hang'd at <hi>Montfaulcon</hi> in the Year 1408, on the 17th. of <hi>May,</hi> by Sentence of the Provoſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> without regard to the Priviledges of the Univerſity; who afterwards demanded that famous Satisfaction, which we have already ſpoken off in the 4th. Folio of this Second Part. Of late they have made many Conſiderable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations in this Church. The great Altar is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with Pillars of a kind of reddiſh Marble, very rare. The little Tabernacle upon that Altar is alſo very Beautiful: So are the two leſſer Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars on each ſide of the great one, adorn'd with Pillars very well wrought. The Quire of this Church is ſeparated from the Nave by a kind of Baluſtrade, or rather by ſix Ionick Pillars of Marble, ſupporting a Corniſh, on which there are ſeveral little Figures of Angels, very well deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The reſt of the Church is Wainſcoted with Joyners Work, full of Sculpture, with a great number of Grenades, which are the Arms of the preſent General of the Order, who hath been at the Expence of all theſe new Reparations. The Univerſity aſſemble in the Chapter-Houſe of this Convent, when they make their Proceſſions; which uſually happens every three Months, at which the Rector is conſtantly preſent. He is alſo obliged to give a Summ of Money to all thoſe that aſſiſt at the Ceremony. Theſe Proceſſions ought to be ſeen and obſerved by Strangers, and are well worth their Curioſity; the Show being very numerous, and diſpoſed in excellent Order. The four Faculties are obliged to appear there, in the proper and peculiar Habits belonging to them. The Money which the Rector diſburſes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62624:106"/>
on this occaſion, ariſes out of the Revenues of the Univerſity, which amount to the Summ of Fifty thouſand Franks, ariſing out of the Meſſageries (or Carriage of Goods) between certain Towns of this Kingdom, and alſo from ſeveral Houſes Situated in divers places of <hi>Paris.</hi> Formerly they poſſeſt much greater Revenues, but they have been loſt by the negligence of thoſe, who of late Years have had the Adminiſtration of their affairs. From hence you paſs before</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Church of Saint Benoit,</hi> ſuppoſed to be Founded by St. <hi>Denis,</hi> who Dedicated it to the Holy Trinity; if ſo, none can doubt it to be of very great Antiquity. It is poſſeſt by Canons Secular, who are obliged on the great Feaſts to accompany the Canons of <hi>Noſtre-Dame,</hi> when they make their grand Proceſſions. The Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Structure of this Church is nothing Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, as being carried up at ſeveral times and by pieces. The Nave was built in the Reign of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the Firſt, and four years ſince the Quire was Rebuilt anew very handſomly. The inſide is embelliſht with Corinthian Pilaſters, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a Corniſh of a very good Guſt. This Church is very lightſome, and has not now the defect which it ſometimes had; which was, that the great Altar was contrived on the Weſt ſide; ſince, when it was new built in the laſt Age, they quite changed that Diſpoſition; which occaſion'd that it has been call'd, <hi>St. Benoiſt le bien tourné,</hi> or <hi>St. Bennet's the well contrived.</hi> For in thoſe days they were very exact, in contriving the Churches Eaſt and Weſt, even to a kind of Scruple.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide of the Street St. <hi>Jacques,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt the hinder part of the Quire of this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62624:107"/>
Church is a ſmall open-place, or Court, at the Entrance into which ſtands a Fountain which bears its name. The place is called <hi>La Terre de Cambray,</hi> from the Colledge of that Name there Situated. You have there alſo</p>
               <p>The <hi>Colledge Royal,</hi> whoſe original Founder was <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, the Father and Reſtorer of Learning in <hi>France.</hi> 'Twas he that inſtituted moſt of the Lectures in Law and Phyſick in this Univerſity, and invited hither the ableſt Men he could find, to teach here the Mathematicks, Philoſophy, and the Greek, Latin, Syriack, and Hebrew Tongues. He intended to have raiſed here a great Building, but his deſign being never executed, becauſe of his great Expences in the Wars, which he had on all the Frontiers of his Kingdom, eſpecially in <hi>Italy;</hi> he left the Work to be done by his Son <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, who neglected, or at leaſt had not a Conveniency of doing it. The Profeſſors all the while read their Lectures in the Colledge of <hi>Cambray,</hi> and remain'd in this Condition till under the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, who in the Year 1609. on the 23. of <hi>November,</hi> ſent the Cardinal <hi>du Perron,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Suilly,</hi> firſt Miniſter, the Preſident <hi>de Thou,</hi> and a Counſellor of Parliament named Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>Gillot,</hi> to view the Situation of the place, and if there was ſufficient Room, to raiſe the Building projected. It ſhould have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a main Front, and on each Hand two Wings, with a Court, in the midſt of which ſhould have been a Fountain. The lower Rooms were deſigned for Schools, and the firſt Story on one ſide, for the Royal Library, which was then at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> and is at preſent kept in the <hi>Rué Vivien.</hi> The Profeſſors alſo ſhould there
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62624:107"/>
have had their Lodgings, which would have been of great advantage; but theſe excellent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were never executed, by reaſon of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Death of that great King, of whom <hi>France</hi> was rob'd in a time when ſhe leaſt expected it. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Medieis</hi> his Illuſtrious Wife, to ſecond the Zeal of the King her Husband, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to finiſh what he had begun; and to that purpoſe ſhe her ſelf with her Son <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. at that time but nine Years old, went to the place. The Young King laid the firſt Stone, and the Work was carried on with fervency; but in the end it was once again broke off, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains as we ſee it, having never been thought of, to be continued, from that time to this. There is but one ſide finiſht, and that ſtands in the ſame place, where formerly ſtood the Colledge called <hi>de Treguier.</hi> The Profeſſors are paid by the King, and are a kind of Body diſtinct from the Univerſity, to which, however, they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. They enjoy the ſame Priviledges with the Officers of the King's Houſehold; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Univerſity is not permitted to diſpoſe their places, nor to prohibit their Exerciſes, which he may do to all other Profeſſors. They have always been perſons of ſingular Note, and extraordinary Merit.</p>
               <p>The moſt Famous have been; in the Greek Tongue <hi>Adrian Turnebe,</hi> Native of <hi>Andeli</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> who dyed in the Year 1565, being but Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three Years of Age. <hi>Denis Lambin</hi> ſucceeded him, and hath left behind him many excellent Works.</p>
               <p>In the Hebrew Tongue, <hi>Francis Vatable,</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally of <hi>Picardy;</hi> he hath writ ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon divers Authors, much eſteem'd.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62624:108"/>
                  <hi>Gilbert Genebrard,</hi> Doctor in Divinity, of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and Prior of St. <hi>Denis de la Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi> near the <hi>Pont Noſtre-Dame.</hi> He was Elected Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> and dyed in <hi>March</hi> 1597. There are extant ſeveral Works of his, the Catalogue of which are at the end of the Book Entituled <hi>La Liturgie Sainte.</hi> The formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Calignon</hi> was another Profeſſor here for this Tongue; he hath compoſed a Grammar which is much eſteemed. <hi>Ralph Baines</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, who writ three Books of Commentaries on <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> according to the Hebrew Phraſe, which he Dedicated to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second.</p>
               <p>In the Mathematicks there have been <hi>Oronce Finé,</hi> Native of the Town of <hi>Briançon</hi> in <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiné;</hi> and <hi>Paſchal du Hamel,</hi> who ſucceeded him.</p>
               <p>In the Latin Eloquence <hi>Barthelemy Latomus,</hi> and <hi>John Paſſerat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two moſt famous among thoſe who have taught Philoſophy here, were <hi>Francis Vicomereat,</hi> originally of <hi>Verona,</hi> and <hi>Peter de la Ramée</hi> of <hi>Cuth</hi> in <hi>Vermandois,</hi> who lived about the Year 1568.</p>
               <p>Finally, thoſe who have moſt excelled in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick are, <hi>Vidus Vidius, Jacques Silius</hi> of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and <hi>John Rioland.</hi> Theſe are thoſe whoſe Names are of greateſt Note, on the account of the Learned Works which they have left behind them. One can hardly find out any one Colledge, that has produced more Learned Men than this, although it be of no great Antiquity.</p>
               <p>Over againſt this laſt mentioned Colledge, is, The <hi>Commandery of St. John de Latran,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the Order of <hi>Malta.</hi> It is a great piece of Ground full of Houſes ill built, in which lodge
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62624:108"/>
all ſorts of Workmen, not Maſters, who may here manage their ſeveral Trades, without being diſturb'd by the Jurates of the City. That which is here worth ſeeing, is the Tomb of Monſieur <hi>de Souvré;</hi> this is he who dyed Grand Prior of <hi>France,</hi> and who built ſome years before his Death, that fine Houſe at the Temple. While he was only Commander of <hi>St. John de Latran,</hi> he cauſed this Tomb to be raiſed in the Church. It is all of Marble, his Effigies lying upon a great Urne of the ſame, accompanied with two <hi>Terms</hi> riſing out of their <hi>Guénes,</hi> which are Channell'd and very well wrought. All this Monument is exactly Beautiful, and of a very ſingular Deſign. It is the Work of Monſieur <hi>Anguerre,</hi> one of the ableſt Sculptors that <hi>France</hi> ever produced. The Body of Monſieur <hi>de Souvré,</hi> is not interr'd in this place, but only his Heart. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe remarkable. The Church in which this Monument is Erected, is very antient and ill built.</p>
               <p>As you leave this place and go on in the <hi>Ruë Saint Jacques,</hi> you come to</p>
               <p>The Colledge <hi>du Pleſsis,</hi> which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd, the Colledge of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that its firſt Founder <hi>Geoffrey du Pleſsis,</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to Pope <hi>John</hi> XXII. had a very great Devotion to that Saint But the Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> to Eternize the Founder's Memory, reſtored it to his Name; and after he had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built it magnificently, he cauſed it to be called The Colledge <hi>du Pleſsis de Richelieu.</hi> This Colledge hath the beſt contrived and handſomeſt Lodgings of all the Univerſity, and is alſo the fulleſt of Penſioners and Scholars. The Doctors of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> have the Direction of this Colledge, and place the Principal and Regents. A little higher in the Street is</p>

               <p>There is nothing of ſingular Remark in the Building belonging to this Colledge; yet there are here many Obſervable things, which you can hardly meet with elſewhere.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62624:110"/>
The great number of Penſionaries, moſt of which are of conſiderable Quality; beſides the multitude of Scholars that come from abroad, which ſometimes amount to Two or Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. Theſe ſtudy together in the moſt regular Order and Diſcipline of the World. The Schools are Six in number, beſides thoſe ſet apart for the Study of Philoſophy, Divinity and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks: Which laſt are not uſed, but only by Young Jeſuits, who ſtill purſue their Courſe of Studies, or at leaſt by ſome Penſionaries, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign not to take any Degrees in the Univerſity; for thoſe who propoſe to themſelves to be Maſters of Arts, or Doctors, are obliged to ſtudy Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy in ſome of the Colledges of the Univerſity. One thing extream laudable among theſe Fathers is, that all their Scholars are obliged to go to Confeſſion every Month; ſo that at the ſame time the Parents are freed from the Care, both of their Childrens Conſciences, as well as Studies. The Chappel of this Colledge is ſmall and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure: It ſtands on the Right Hand as you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: There is nothing to be ſeen there but upon Feaſt days, and at ſuch time the Altar is one of the richeſt and beſt furniſht. They have there an Antipendium all of Silver, and another of a rich Embroidery of Gold, very high raiſed upon a Ground of Silver. The Apartments in the hinder part of the Houſe, are more convenient than thoſe in the fore part; the Armes of Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> in their Front, ſpeak him to be the Builder of that part; as alſo of the main Body of the Edifice, which is at the further part of the Garden, near the little Colledge <hi>de Marmoutier,</hi> which has been annext to this to augment it. In this apartment they have placed their Library, which, beyond
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62624:110"/>
all contradiction, is one of the faireſt and moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous of all <hi>Paris,</hi> as well for the Quality, as Quantity of Books, there to be ſeen. There is alſo a good number of antient Manuſcripts, and of Heretical Books, chiefly of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> which fill almoſt a little Room themſelves. Beſides this a very excellent Collection of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Hiſtory, as well general as particular Hiſtories of the ſeveral Provinces of that Kingdom, and of the Famous perſons who have therein inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; theſe Authors are either in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> There is alſo a great quantity of Mathematicians and Humaniſts, which take up a little Gallery, which they have contrived into ſeveral Preſſes: for altho this Library does conſiſt of two long Wings of building; yet it is all too little, and they are forced to employ this Gallery, for the receit of the leſſer Volumes. At one end of this Gallery hangs a piece of <hi>Baſſan,</hi> repreſenting the Combat of the <hi>Centaures</hi> and the <hi>Lapithites,</hi> this Monſieur <hi>Fouquet</hi> gave, having firſt built the Library where it hangs, and endowed it with a Thouſand Livres of Rent, for its Maintenance and Augmentation. They preſerve here an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sett of Antient Medals, but being not diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into order, they ſeldom are willing to ſhew them. In this Colledge are many able Perſons, among whom may be reckoned a conſiderable number of Authors; ſuch as are now living, are Father <hi>Bouhours,</hi> Author of <hi>The Entretiens d Ariſte &amp; d'Eugene,</hi> in which you find ſo much Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſuch Purity of Language, that it ſeems a Man that would ſpeak as an accompliſht Perſon, muſt be ſure to imitate his ſtile; his other Works are <hi>The Doubts and Remarks on the French Tongue; The Hiſtory of</hi> Peter d'Aubuſſon, <hi>Grand Maſter</hi>

They ſometimes make Publick Actions in this Colledge, which draw a prodigious number of People. At the Carnaval they repreſent ſome little Latin Tragedy. After <hi>Eaſter</hi> they expoſe Enigmatical Queſtions to be explained, for which they have certain Prizes. They have alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Theſes</hi> to be maintained, to which Perſons of Quality reſort; but their greateſt Bravery of all is, the Grand Tragedy which they repreſent yearly in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> on a Theater raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on purpoſe, which takes up all the bottom of the Court. The Actors are always Penſionaries, and Sons of Perſons of Quality. The fineſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Tragedy are the Balets of the <hi>Sieur de Beauchamp</hi>'s Compoſition, which are danced between the Acts. When all is done they make a

diſtribution of Prizes to thoſe that merit beſt, without any regard to the Quality of the Perſon; which occaſions great Emulation among the Youth, and makes them uſe the utmoſt of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to gain a Prize, which the King gives, in the View of ſuch an Aſſembly.</p>

               <p>This Church hath nothing but what is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet is the great Altar very handſomly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62624:112"/>
it is adorn'd with black Marble, and the Armes of the Cardinal of St. <hi>Cecily,</hi> Brother of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> which you ſee about it, ſpeak it to be built at his Coſts; and this he did in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he was of this Order. Over the Door go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Sacriſty, is a Picture of <hi>Valentine's,</hi> repreſenting the Nativity of the Holy Virgin; which Piece Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> gave, to be placed over the great Altar; but when he perceived it to be too little, he left it to the Church, and it hath been placed here ever ſince. It is one of the moſt Beautiful pieces in all <hi>France,</hi> and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eſteem it highly. <hi>Felibien,</hi> in his Book which he Compoſed of the Lives and Works of the moſt Famous Painters, tells us, it is one of the beſt Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures that ever came out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> On one ſide of the great Altar, ſtands the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of our Lady of the Roſary. The Wainſcot Work of which is very handſom. Here is a very great Devotion, by reaſon of the Indulgences, which are here to be gain'd every firſt Sunday of the Month. In the Cloiſter are ſeveral Paintings, but they are of no great Note; ſo alſo is their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, which is not very numerous, yet it hath been made uſe of by very Famous Doctors. They preſerve here one thing of great Curioſity, and that is the Pulpit of Great St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquiu,</hi> the Angel of the Schools. It is made of Wood, and incloſed in another of the ſame material, that it may not be injured by time. A General of this Order was at the charge of making that in which it is incloſed; and not along ago theſe Fathers have cauſed a ſmall Room to be made, at the end of the Library, where this Pulpit is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently expoſed to ſight. 'Tis well known that St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi> formerly profeſt Divinity in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62624:113"/>
this Convent, and in the great School, which we ſee at this day, he made his Lectures. It hath been Rebuilt at the beginning of this preſent Age, through the Alms which theſe Fathers collected in a Jubilee. Several Preachers of this Houſe have acquired great Reputation in the World. Among others Father <hi>Chauſsemer,</hi> who is eſteemed one of the moſt Profound and Eloquent that we have at preſent; he Preached this <hi>Lent</hi> at <hi>Noſtre-Dame,</hi> after he had perform'd the like at the <hi>Louvre.</hi> The deceaſed Monſieur <hi>Coëffeteau,</hi> who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a very Curious Roman Hiſtory, paſt here the greateſt part of his Life; with many others, whoſe names would be too long to inſert here.</p>
               <p>Before you leave the <hi>Rüe Saint Jacques,</hi> you ought to know, that here inhabit many Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, who ſell almoſt all of them, the Works of the <hi>Meſſieurs du Port-Royal,</hi> all the Works of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Arnault,</hi> generally eſteemed by all Learned Men: Here you will find the ſeveral pieces of the <hi>French Academicians;</hi> many Foreign Books; the ſeveral pieces that concern the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church; all Monſieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi>'s Writings; here alſo are ſold Father <hi>Bouhour</hi>'s Books; thoſe of Father <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin;</hi> of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux;</hi> of the Abbot <hi>Flé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier,</hi> Almoner to Madam the Dauphineſs, who Tranſlated the Life of Cardinal <hi>Commendon,</hi> and compoſed for Monſeigneur the Dauphin, the Hiſtory of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great, and four Funeral Orations. Many other Books proper for the peruſal of curious Perſons, are here alſo to be met with. In this Street alſo are many Gravers and Sellers of Prints, who have in their Shops great ſtore of Maps, and Printed Pictures. Of which I ſhall ſay no more in this place. At the end of this Volume I may (perhaps) ſet down
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62624:113"/>
a Catalogue of ſuch Books as are beſt Writ in our Language, for the uſe of Strangers, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes for want of better information, buy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſcurvy Books, inſtead of ſuch as may be of uſe and advantage to them in their ſtudy of the French Tongue.</p>
               <p>Without the <hi>Porte St. Jacques,</hi> in the <hi>Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> of that name, you may obſerve many fine things, and in a greater number than in any other <hi>Faux-bourg</hi> about the Town.</p>
               <p>On the left Hand, as you enter, is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the <hi>Nuns of the Viſitation,</hi> which makes no great ſhew. The Church it ſelf is no bigger than an ordinary Hall. Yet is their Altar one of the richeſt that can be ſeen on the Feaſt Days, theſe Nuns ſparing no Coſts to adorn it with Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, Lamps, Veſſels, Figures, and a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch like things, which are all of Silver, and moſt of them very weighty. But the place being none of the beſt contrived, theſe rich things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not ſo well as they might do elſewhere. Going ſtill forward, you paſs before</p>
               <p>The Pariſh Church of St. <hi>James,</hi> from which all this Quarter takes its name. It hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd in ſuch manner as we now ſee it by the late Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville</hi> Siſter of Monſieur the Prince, who was one of the moſt pious and Charitable Princeſſes of this Age. The Portal is of the Dorick Order, very well perform'd; and had that Virtuous Princeſs lived, ſhe had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs given wherewithal to finiſh the Work: But ſhe dyed about four years ago in the Convent of Carmelite Nuns, to the regret of abundance of poor People, who ſubſiſted by her Almes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Seminary of St. Magloire,</hi> is near the laſt mentioned place. This was formerly an Abby of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62624:114"/>
St. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Order, which was firſt Founded in the ſame place, where at preſent ſtands St. <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew</hi>'s Church, near the Pallace. But thoſe good Religious Men, being troubled with the noiſe and Clutter of that place, changed their habitation in the Year 1138. and came to dwell here, which was at that time a good way out of the Town, where there was already a Chapel built and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to St. <hi>George.</hi> After that in the Year 1549. The Monks of St. <hi>Bennet</hi> did altogether quit this Houſe, and transfer'd themſelves to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſes of the ſame Order, the Revenue of this being given to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris.</hi> And in the Room of the Monks they placed here certain <hi>Penitent Nuns,</hi> but they continued not long. In fine, the Prieſts of the Oratory were introduced here in the beginning of this preſent Age, whoſe Inſtitution is to inſtruct the Young Eccleſiaſticks in the Functions of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>

Over the great Altar is a very good Copy from <hi>Raphael,</hi> of the <hi>Holy Family,</hi> the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of which is in the King's Cabinet. The Grate of their Quire is adorn'd with Copper gilt.</p>
               <p>Nor far from thence are <hi>the Engliſh Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines,</hi> who have alſo built a new Church, which is really ſomething of the leaſt, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of that, it is very well adorn'd.

               <p>THis was ſometimes call'd <hi>Noſtre-Dame des Champs.</hi> The Church belonging to theſe Nuns is one of the oldeſt in <hi>Paris;</hi> moſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries believe it to be one of thoſe which St. <hi>Denis</hi> Founded. Some modern Authors write that it was formerly a Temple of the Goddeſs <hi>Ceres,</hi> or elſe of <hi>Mars;</hi> but for this opinion they have no very good Foundation: For we find nothing in the antient Hiſtorians to warrant ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. It is much more certain, that it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a long time to the Order of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and that it was a Priory depending on the great Abby of <hi>Marmoutier,</hi> near the City of <hi>Tours.</hi> Whoſe antient Title to this place is ſtill in being; and the Biſhop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who is Abbot there, receives from hence Four or Five thouſand Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres <hi>per annum.</hi> In the Year 1604. were placed here certain <hi>Carmelite Nuns</hi> of St. <hi>Tereſa</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, whom the Cardinal <hi>de Berulla</hi> fetch'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of <hi>Spain,</hi> at ſuch time when this Reform began to be ſo famous in Chriſtendom, for its great auſterity. This Houſe was the firſt in all the Kingdom, that took the Rule of St. <hi>Tereſa,</hi> and from hence it is that all the other Convents of <hi>Paris,</hi> and in the other parts of <hi>France,</hi> took their original. At preſent this Nunnery is very numerous, and there are in it many perſons of the greateſt Quality, who quitting the World, come to end their days here.</p>
               <p>Their Church is one of the faireſt, and moſt magnificent that can be ſeen, the main Body of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62624:115"/>
the Building is, in truth, very antient, but the modern Ornaments within it make ſufficient amends for that. As you go in you may obſerve, that it is all painted in imitation of black Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vein'd with White; and that the Baluſtrades or Partitions of the Chapels are of a Wainſcot, extraordinary finely gilt: But the moſt curious things of all are the great Pictures placed under every Window, in Frames richly Carved and gilt. There are ſix of theſe Pictures on each ſide, each repreſenting ſome principal Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the New Teſtament. They are the Work of the famouſeſt Painters of this Age. The Firſt, on the left hand as you enter, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Miracle of the Five Loaves, was done by <hi>Stella.</hi> The Second repreſents the Feaſt at the Houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper, where the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> perfum'd our Lord's Feet, and this was done by Monſieur <hi>le Brun.</hi> The Third repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the triumphal entry of our Lord into <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> is the Work of <hi>de la Hire.</hi> The Fourth is the Story of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, and is alſo done by <hi>Stella;</hi> the Colours and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery of this Picture is excellent. The Fifth is Monſieur <hi>le Brun</hi>'s; and the Sixth repreſenting the Transfiguration, is <hi>de la Hire</hi>'s. Thoſe on the other ſide were all done by <hi>Champaign,</hi> and that able Maſter never made any better Pieces than theſe, as one may eaſily obſerve. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of this Church ſtands very high, and is all of Marble, as well the body of the Work as the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which are of the Corinthian Order, their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals of Braſs gilt. The Tabernacle is all of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and repreſents the Ark of the Covenant; on the forepart of which there is a great Baſ-relief very well Carved. On Feaſt Days
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62624:116"/>
this Altar is adorn'd with Vaſes, Candleſticks, and divers things of that ſort, which make a very handſom ſhew without Confuſion. Over againſt the Grate of the Quire, where the Nuns ſing, is a great Picture repreſenting the Angelick Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. It is the Work of <hi>Guido,</hi> and ought to be eſteem'd as one of the beſt pieces that can be ſeen, even in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf. The ſeveral Chapels correſpond to the magnificence of the Church, eſpecially that which is dedicated to the <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> in which there hangs an excellent Picture of that Saint, done by Monſieur <hi>le Brun,</hi> one of the beſt, perhaps, that ever he made. The Saint is repreſented weeping under a Rock, tearing her Hair and Ornaments, and trampling them under Foot, her Eyes are all drown'd in Tears, through which her Complection but faintly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; briefly, one cannot imagine a piece of Painting more feelingly expreſt and none can ſee it without more compaſſion for ſuch a Penitent. Over againſt the Altar in this ſmall Chapel is placed, in a kneeling poſture, the Statue of Cardinal <hi>de Berulle,</hi> Inſtitutor of the Prieſts of the Oratory, to whom theſe Nuns are much obliged, as hath been already ſaid. His Statue is of white Marble, and made by <hi>Sarazin,</hi> in the Year 1657. It is raiſed on a Pedeſtal of four ſides, on which are ſeveral very good Baſ-reliefs, wrought by an able Sculptor named <hi>To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

the Religious Women come to hear the Sermon, when the Preachers preach in the Nave of the Church. In the fore part of this Gallery are placed two Statues, one of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and on the top, the repreſentation of St. <hi>Michael</hi> overcoming the Devil, which is of a very curious Invention: It was the Work of <hi>Stella,</hi> before mentioned. All the Roof is very well Painted after the manner of Cartouches: Between the Cordons you ought to take notice of a Crucifix, accompanied with the Holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and St. <hi>John,</hi> which are wrought with ſo much Art, that the Figures ſeem to ſtand upon a real bottom. This is a pleaſing fallacy to thoſe that mind it. Finally, the laſt remarkable thing to be obſerved in this Church, is the Crucifix of Braſs over the Baluſtrade, that divides the Quire from the Nave. The Curious eſteem it highly; it was made by <hi>Sarazin,</hi> who had the reputation of one of the ableſt Men of his time.</p>

               <p>It ought to be obſerved that the Nuns of <hi>Val de Grace</hi> were formerly Founded near the Village of <hi>Bierre,</hi> about Three Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> in a very incommodious place by reaſon of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Grounds, called there <hi>le Val profond,</hi> or the deep Vale; being very Sickly in this place, they Petition'd <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. for his permiſſion to come and inhabit in <hi>Paris.</hi> Queen <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> his Illuſtrious Wife, being acquainted with their merit, chiefly from one of their Company, named <hi>Margaret d'Arbouſe,</hi> by whoſe means ſhe took a particular affection to them, declar'd her ſelf their Foundreſs.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62624:118"/>
who was at that time the moſt eſteemed Architect of <hi>France,</hi> was made choice of for this Work, and the deſigns which he drew were admired by all Men. He carryed up the work as high as the firſt Floor, but then for ſome Reaſons he was changed, and other Architects employed in his place, to wit, <hi>le Due, le Muet,</hi> and <hi>du Val,</hi> who perform'd their parts ſo well, that <hi>Manſard</hi> was not miſt, tho' ſo great a Maſter. In diſguſt to be thus uſed he undertook to build the Chapel at <hi>Château de Freſne,</hi> ſeven Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> for Monſieur <hi>de Guenegaud,</hi> Secretary of State; where he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in little that magnificent deſign, which he drew out at firſt for <hi>Val de Grace,</hi> and thereby made that Chapel one of the fineſt Structures in the Kingdom, as all who have ſeen it unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agree. But though the building at <hi>Val de Grace,</hi> is admirable in its preſent condition, yet it hath been effected with abundance of pains, and with exceſſive Charges, chiefly in laying the Foundation, by reaſon of the Quarries which they met with in digging. The preſent condition of this place is as follows:</p>
               <p>Firſt you enter into a great Court, which lies before the principal Door; this Court is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Street by a Palliſade of Iron, at the extremities of which are two ſquare Pavillions; on the right Hand and on the left it is bounded with certain Stone Works, adorn'd with ruſtick Pillars, which make a very handſom Shew. At the further part of this Court is the great Portal, raiſed upon Six ſteps. But that which makes it moſt remarkable, is, that it is after the manner of a Portico compoſed of Four great Corinthian Pillars, with Niches on each ſide, in which are placed St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and St. <hi>Scholaſtica,</hi> of white
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62624:118"/>
Marble. On the Friſe is this Inſcription in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Gold:</p>

               <q>To the Child JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, and his Virgin Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>
               <p>The Front of the Portal is of two Orders of Pillars, the Corinthian and the Compoſite, with all their proper Ornaments. If the outſide appears great, the inſide is ſtill infinitly more magnificent. All the Church is paved with Marble of divers Colours. And the compartments are correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the <hi>Cartouches</hi> of Sculpture, and to the <hi>Guillochis</hi> (or Flouriſhings) in the Roof, where there are ſeveral Baſ-tailles of admirable Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. This Roof is of Stone as white as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and it is throughout enriched with Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the beſt ſort, in which Monſieur <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerre</hi> has ſurpaſt all. On each ſide of the Nave are Three Chapels, divided aſunder by Two great Pilaſters, which ſupport the Corniſh that runs round the Church, and ſupports the Arches of the Roof. The Quire is directly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dome at the further end of the Nave, from which it is parted only by a grate of Iron gilt. Four great Arches ſupport the Dome; and the great Altar is placed under the futher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Arch. It is of a very ſingular deſign, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Six great twiſted Pillars of the Compoſite Order. They are of black Marble vein'd with

white; of which ſort there are hardly any others to be found in <hi>Europe;</hi> they are raiſed upon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtals of Marble alſo, and they are all over en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with Palms and <hi>Feüillages</hi> of Braſs gilt, which make a wondrous beautiful Show. One may truly ſay that the contrivance of theſe Pillars is, in ſome reſpects, more magnificent, than thoſe of the great Altar at St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s in <hi>Rome,</hi> which were deſigned by the Cavalier <hi>Bernin.</hi> Theſe excel in number and in the beauty of the Workmanſhip. They ſtand in a great Circle, raiſed about two Foot, and make a kind of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villion open on all ſides, forming Six <hi>Conſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The whole is of the beſt ſort of gilding without any Colours Upon the Altar, which is placed in the middle of theſe Pillars, the Infant <hi>JESUS</hi> is repreſented lying in his Cradle, all of white Marble, accompanied by the Holy Virgin and St. <hi>Joſeph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>On the right Hand and on the left of the great Altar, are the two Grates which take up all the void ſpace between the ſide Arches. They are of an extraordinary greatneſs, and the like were never made of the bigneſs, beſides they are wrought with ſuch delicate Art, as if the Iron had been as ſoft and eaſie to form as Lead. That on the right ſide encloſes the Nuns Quire from the Church, which is large and well Wainſcot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They have in it a ſmall Organ which they uſe on Feſtivals, at ſuch time as they ſing their Service Muſically, which they perform to the great pleaſure of their hearers, they having among them ſome very excellent Voices. On the other ſide is a great Chapel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all hung with Mourning, in the middle of which is erected a Hearſe of black Velvet upon Four or Five Steps; here are repoſited the Hearts of the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Illuſtrious Benefactreſs, the Queen whom we have ſo lately loſt, with others of ſeveral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the Blood Royal, among the reſt that of Madam the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we leave this place we ought to obſerve the Cyfer, which is at the bottom of the ſteps of the Altar, compoſed only of two Letters L. and A. encompaſſed about with Palms, and other <hi>Feüillages</hi> of white Marble. There are here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

other things worth obſervation, which would be painful to ſet down in writing, but the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous when they come hither will eaſily find 'em out. The inſide of the Convent correſponds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly well to the magnificence of the Church.

               <p>As you go from hence you muſt not forget to obſerve the outſide of the Church, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments about the Dome, which appears of a very great height: it is cover'd with Lead, with great Bands gilt; and on the top a Baluſtrade of Iron, round about the little Lanthorn open on all ſides; over that is the great Ball, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Croſs.

               <p>After you have ſeen <hi>Val de Grace,</hi> you ought next to go to</p>

               <p>THE King who takes no leſs care to make the Arts flouriſh, than to extend the Limits of his Kingdom, cauſed this Structure to be erected in the Year 1667. for the Habitation of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62624:121"/>
Mathematicians. It conſiſts of a great Body of Stone-work two Stories high; the Windows of which are round at the top, and about fourteen Toiſes high (a Toiſe is Six Foot.) The forepart of the Building is made with Towers Eight An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular of the ſame height, with a great Eſplanade in manner of a Tarraſs, with fronts about the whole Building. The Tower on the Eaſt ſide is open at the top, and without any Roof, that ſo one may ſee the better from the bottom. Between theſe two Towers are ſeveral great Rooms, which are not yet furniſht with ſuch things as are to be there. But that which is moſt remarkable in this Building, is, that there is not uſed about it either Iron or Wood, and yet the Roof of it is extreamly ſolid. The Stair-caſe is the fineſt that can be imagined; it is all of Stone laid after a way extraordinary, hardy and bold from the bottom to the top; and the Iron Rail that winds the whole length of theſe Stairs is very well wrought. It is 156 Steps high and leads to the Tarraſs. In regard this Building conſiſts of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtories, it hath ſeveral vaulted Roofs one over the other, the uppermoſt of which conſiſts of an Arch of a large extent, flat on the outſide, and paved with Hint-ſtones, cut exactly and bound together with Cement, that the Rain may not penetrate and damnifie the Vaults be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. The Curious may if they pleaſe go down into the Caves or Grotto's which are extream deep, ſince the Stair-caſe that leads down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains One hundred threeſcore and eleven Steps; in the middle of which they have contrived a void hollow ſpace in manner of a Well, which pierces through all the Rooms, and extends up to the top of the Tarraſs, ſo that through this hole you
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62624:122"/>
may ſee the light to the very bottom of the Cave. It is ſaid that this was made on purpoſe to ſee the Stars at Noon-day. But it ſeems it fails of effect, for no body has yet ſeen them, tho' it hath been often endeavour'd. This place which they call <hi>le Puits</hi> (the Well) contains 28 Toiſes (56 yards) from the bottom of it to the vent at the top.</p>
               <p>In the ſeveral Apartments, eſpecially in thoſe belonging to M. <hi>Caſsini,</hi> are ſeveral curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mathematical Inſtruments, as Globes, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulums, and chiefly Glaſſes of very great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, with which theſe Learned Men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the courſe of the Stars. There are only Four Mathematicians who lodge in the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, part of thoſe who compoſe the Academy of Sciences, eſtabliſhed at the King's Cabinet, as we have formerly noted; and they are M. <hi>Caſsini,</hi> originally an <hi>Italian,</hi> and formerly one of the great Dukes Academy at <hi>Florence,</hi> where he had attain'd great Reputation. He takes here a great deal of pains in Aſtronomy, and hath made many diſcoveries in that Art, for which the King gives him a conſiderable Penſion. M. <hi>de la Hire,</hi> M. <hi>Couplet</hi> who teach the Mathematicks to the Pages belong-to the great Stable; the Deceaſed M. the Abbot <hi>Picard</hi> was one of thoſe, but his place is not yet ſupply'd, and M. <hi>Hugens,</hi> a <hi>Hollander,</hi> hath here alſo an Apartment, tho' he doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly abide in it. Theſe Gentlemen meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon certain days, and communicate the Obſervations which they have ſeverally made, and ſometimes they Print them alſo for publick ſatisfaction. Every Year M. <hi>Caſsini</hi> publiſhes about <hi>Newyearstide</hi> a ſmall Volume, called <hi>La Connoiſſance des temps,</hi> by which one may know
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62624:122"/>
the Courſe of the Planets, and other Curioſities of that nature, much more exact and regular than any thing hitherto ſeen on the ſubject. They have here a ſmall ſquare Chamber over the forepart of the Tarraſs, in which thoſe who ſpeak at the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Corners may eaſily underſtand one another, and yet thoſe in the middle not perceive it. This is occaſion'd by reaſon the Roof is Vaulted hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the Angles are continued along the Roof from one ſide to the other, without any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. After you have ſeen the <hi>Obſervatory,</hi> as you go out you ought to take notice of</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Water-Houſe,</hi> which ſtands near the Gate as you go out next the <hi>Ruë d'Enfer.</hi> This Houſe was built to receive the Water that comes from the Village of <hi>Rongis</hi> in that Curious Aqueduct, which Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Medicis</hi> cauſed to be built at <hi>Arcüeil,</hi> which the Curious ought to viſit as one of the fineſt in all <hi>France.</hi> You ought to know that moſt of the Fountains in <hi>Paris</hi> come from this Receiver or Conduit, which makes its firſt diſcharge at <hi>Luxembourg-Houſe,</hi> from whence afterwards the Waters divide themſelves to all parts of the City.</p>
               <p>As you return back to the Town again, through the <hi>Ruë d'Enfer,</hi> you firſt come to <hi>The Houſe of the Fathers of the Oratory,</hi> which they call <hi>The Inſtitution,</hi> and ſerves them as a Noviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate.

               <head>The Convent of the <hi>Carthuſians.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Monaſtery was built by the King St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who gave to the Religious of St. <hi>Bruno's</hi> Order, the old Houſe or <hi>Château</hi> of <hi>Vauvert,</hi> where at that time, as Hiſtorians ſay, Devils did inhabit, and cauſed there ſo many diſorders, that by Arreſt of Parliament the Town Gate which led into that Street was wall'd up. The Street which lies before the Houſe does ſtill retain the old name, and it is for this reaſon that it was firſt; called the <hi>Rüe d'Enfer</hi> (or Hell Street.) But ſince theſe good Fathers became poſſeſt of the place, they quickly expell'd the evil Spirits; and St. <hi>Lewis</hi> having a great eſteem of the Auſtere and Holy Life that they led, made them a Viſit with his whole Court, and confer'd upon them ſufficient Lands and Demeſnes for their Subſiſtence. Many perſons did contribute to the building of their Houſe, which takes up more Ground than any other Religious Houſe does at preſent in all the Town and Suburbs of <hi>Paris.</hi> Beſides that the Cells are large, and that they have each a ſeparate Garden; they have alſo a great Cloſe containing many <hi>Arpens</hi> of Land, which encompaſſes the whole Houſe. The Church hath nothing in it extraordinary, except the Seats of the Religious, which were made about two Years ago, and are the fineſt wrought that were ever yet ſeen. The Wainſcot is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly handſome, and adorn'd with Sculpture that makes a delicate appearance: Theſe are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62624:123"/>
compoſed of ſmall Corinthian Pilaſters which ſupport the Corniſh; one of the Fathers of the Houſe deſigned them and managed the Work. They now begin to place ſome Pictures between the <hi>Croiſées.</hi> The firſt which hath been placed here is done by M. <hi>Audran,</hi> the ſecond by Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>Coipel,</hi> and in time the whole Quire may be furniſht in this manner, which will conſiderably beautifie the Church.</p>
               <p>The little Cloiſter which lies on one ſide of this Church, is the only thing that is rare and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar belonging to theſe fathers. It is adorn'd with a Dorick Architecture of Pilaſter faſhion. Between the Arches are ſeveral Pictures repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Life of St. <hi>Bruno</hi> their Founder, and in certain <hi>Cartouches</hi> adjoyning to each Picture, the Life of that Saint in <hi>Latin</hi> Verſes. The Pictures which hang at the Corners of the Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, repreſent the views of ſeveral remarkable places, among others of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the <hi>Grand Chartreuſe</hi> near <hi>Grenoble,</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> on the Louvre ſide as it ſhew'd before the old Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was taken down, and the <hi>Port-neuve,</hi> which ſtood not far from the <hi>Pont-rouge;</hi> the reſt are only fancies of the Painter. All the Painting of this Cloiſter was done by <hi>Le Sueur,</hi> who never did any thing finer than theſe Pieces here. Of late days they have contrived Wooden Shuts in which they ſhut them up, that they may not be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as certain perſons who envy the Merit and Reputation of that incomparable Man, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to do. They do not open theſe Pictures but upon certain Days, or when Curious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple deſire to ſee them. It is apparent that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Paintings than theſe cannot be; yet had he lived we ſhould have had from him things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62624:124"/>
more perfect; but his fate was like that of <hi>Raphaël,</hi> who dyed in an Age when his admirable Genius began to make him known. That which remains to be ſeen in this Houſe is the Refectory, which is very lightſom. Here the Religious never Eat but upon Feſtivals, Sundays and Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days; upon other days they take their repaſts in their ſeveral Cells, which are diſpoſed in a ſquare place round about their Church-Yard or Cemetery. Theſe Cells are compoſed of Four or Five ſmall Rooms all on a Floor, Boarded throughout, and very ſimply furniſht. Some of theſe Fathers have by them very curious Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Father <hi>Vicar</hi> hath one which is much eſteemed. Some of them employ themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly in divers Works, thereby to paſs more eaſily their time of Solitude, which is very rigorous in regard they are never permitted to go out of the Houſe, nor to receive any Viſits but at certain hours. And it is well and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved by one of our Hiſtorians, that the principal reaſon why theſe Fathers have preſerved the purity of their firſt Inſtitute better than the other Orders, is becauſe they have always ſhun'd with extream care the great Commerce of the World, and the Viſits of Women: Two Dangerous Rocks for the Monaſtick Life.</p>
               <p>Near the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> ſtands the little Convent of <hi>the Feüillans,</hi> in which is nothing extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But not far from this Convent dwells M.—who hath a very neat Garden of the deſign of M. <hi>le Noſtre.</hi>

The Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> who took all occaſions to Immortalize his Name, cauſed this Colledge to be Rebuilt, and ſpared no Coſts to make it truly magnificent. For this purpoſe he employed the Sieur <hi>Mercier</hi> an able Architect, who after ſome Years time brought the work almoſt to the point of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as we ſee it; however it was not quite finiſht by him, for he dyed before he could give it his laſt Hand. That which we are firſt to obſerve is the ſquare place before the Church Door, and hath a Paſſage into the <hi>Ruë de la Harpe.</hi> This place is, in truth, not large, by reaſon of ſome Houſes built before it, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Colledge <hi>des Treſoriers,</hi> however this hinders not but that it is very handſom. On both hands it is fronted with very fair Houſes. On one hand is a great Body of Lodgings ſtone built of Two Stories high, in Boſſage Ruſtick; and here is the Divinity School for thoſe Scholars who come from abroad to hear the Lectures which are made here by Six Doctors, Three in the Morning and Three in the Afternoon, who change from hour to hour. This School is great and high, and it is ſometimes made uſe of when a Theſis is maintain'd by ſome Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. On the Right Hand in this Court is the Chapel belonging to the Colledge of <hi>Clugni.</hi> It takes up almoſt one ſide of this Court, and makes no unhandſom Show, although it be of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick building; but gives the Beholder occaſion to obſerve with pleaſure, the difference between that groſs and Ruſtick ſort of building in the Ages paſt, and the regular and ſtudied manner now uſed in this.

The proportions are ſo true, and the points of the view ſo well contrived, that the diſtant parts of this Edifice ſeem to ſtand over the Portal, and to be placed in the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where they are, to ſerve for a greater Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to the Front. The Dome is none of the higheſt. It is accompanied like that of <hi>Val de Grace,</hi> with Four little ones, with Statues, with bands of Lead gilt, and with a Baluſtrade of Iron about the little Lanthorn which is on the top of all the work. All theſe different things do agree ſo well one with another, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wiſh to ſee a more beautiful piece of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture. The Portal of the Church conſiſts of Two orders of Pillars, Corinthian, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite. The ſecond Story are only Pilaſters. Both above and below, between the Pillars, are Niches, in which are placed Statues of very good Workmanſhip; as alſo are thoſe on the outſide, and thoſe within, between the Corinthian Pila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that ſupport the Roof. The inſide of the Church is but ſmall, and is not altogether ſo light as it might have been; however, all things there are well diſpoſed: The Pavement is of Marble: The Dome is very well painted, and ſo are the Four Fathers of the Church which are between the Arcades that ſuſtain it; theſe are in Freſquo, and of colours very ſhining. The great Altar is not yet begun; but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it will be magnificent, if they follow the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns which are ſhewn: It is to be all of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, compoſed of Six great Pillars of Jaſper, with their Capitals and other Ornaments gilt. The leſſer Altars, which are already finiſhed, do promiſe, that if the great Altar be of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62624:126"/>
ſame guſt, one cannot ſee any thing more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. The Altar of the Virgin was finiſh'd not long ago; it is of white Marble, with Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Braſs gilt, which ſhew admirably. From hence we ought to go into the inward parts of the Houſe, in the midſt of which is a ſquare Court encompaſt about with Buildings, part of which are higher than the reſt, which gives an air of Grandeur and Majeſty to the Portico of the Church. As you ſee it on this ſide, hardly can any thing appear better: At the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this Court it appears raiſed upon Fifteen ſteps, and conſiſts of ten great Corinthian Pillars, diſtant from the building more than Six Foot: Theſe Pillars ſupport a Fronton in which are the Armes of Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> with two Statues on each ſide. On the Freeſe you read this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription:</p>

               <p>Under this beautiful Portico you ſee the Door into the Church, which is of the ſame diſpoſition
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62624:126"/>
with that of the <hi>Rotundae</hi> in <hi>Rome:</hi> The Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect has imitated it as near as he could. All the Apartments about this Court are inhabited by the Doctors of this Houſe, who have a particular right to dwell here. Some of theſe Doctors have very pretty Libraries of their own, but theſe are not ſo eaſie to be ſeen as the great Library which is common to all the Houſe, where all the Doctors ſtudy. It is very long and very high, and runs over the head of two great ground Rooms, in which the Sorbonniſts maintain their Theſes and Diſputations. M. <hi>le Maſle,</hi> Prior <hi>des Roches,</hi> and Secretary to Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> gave the greateſt part of the Books you ſee here, which are very good ones. Monſieur the Cardinal gave his alſo, among which are ſome very rare Manuſcripts, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from others by his Armes on the Covers; among the reſt, there is one of <hi>Titus Livius</hi> in two great Folio Volumes, written in Parchment, it is of an old Tranſlation into French about the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, adorn'd with Mineatures at the beginning of every Chapter, and with Flouriſhes in the Margin, which are curiouſly Painted with that delicate Gold colour, the ſecret of which has been loſt for theſe two laſt Ages, it having been formerly uſed as an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Colour, and is of ſuch an admirable brightneſs that it never ſullies. Beſides this there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other very rare Manuſcripts in one of the Preſſes at the end, on that ſide next the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, moſt of them bound in red Turkey Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In this Library are a greater number of Divinity Books than of any other ſort. Beſides you may may ſee here a great quantity of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of different ſorts, which have been Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62624:127"/>
together with great care. At each end there is a Chimney, over which are placed the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of Monſieur the Cardinal in his Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious habit, and of Monſieur <hi>le Maſle,</hi> both in their full length; over that next the door is a Buſt of the Cardinal, in Braſs, wrought by the Sieur <hi>Varin,</hi> which came from among the Goods of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Aiguillon,</hi> who after her death bequeath'd this, with other Goods, to this Houſe, ſhe having had the uſe of them during her Life, by the Will of the Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> her Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. There is alſo another leſſer Library in a private place of the Houſe, but it contains only thoſe Books of which there has happen'd to be two of a ſort in the great Library, or ſuch as the other Library cannot hold, in regard the number does increaſe daily, becauſe moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors preſent their Works here. The King himſelf hath preſented to this place all the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prints which he has cauſed to be graved, of which there are four or five great Volumes in Folio, neatly bound, which are the Carouſel, the Tapiſtries, the curious Diſſections which have been made at the Academy of Sciences, and ſome others; in ſuch ſort as this Library ought to be eſteem'd as one of the beſt and moſt numerous that can be ſeen, tho' it be not yet quite perfected. But it is with this as with others which are in greater eſteem, it being almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to render any one Library compleat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the difficulty of recovering ſome ſcarce Books, which oftentimes make the chief beauty of a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Library, and which cannot be met with without mighty pains. Beſides ſince Printing, the number of Books is ſo increaſt, and there are ſo many publiſht in all parts of the World, that all cannot be had.</p>

               <q xml:lang="lat">DEO OPT. MAX. <lb/> 
ARMANDUS CARDINALIS DE  <lb/> RICHELIEU.</q>
               <q>To Almighty God,  <lb/> 
                  <hi>Armand</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>After you have ſeen the moſt Remarkable things in the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> you paſs forward in the <hi>Rüe de la Harpe;</hi> turning back again through the open place before the Church, you come next to</p>
               <p>The <hi>Colledge d'Harcour,</hi> one of the beſt of the Univerſity, in which they keep Exerciſe for the lower Schools, which are full of Penſioners, and ſuch as come from abroad. The Gate is fair and of a very regular deſign, it is Vault faſhion, adorn'd with Boſſages, with a great Corniſh, and an Attique over that. If they had contrived a Court before it, it would have appear'd with more advantage.</p>
               <p>As you deſcend lower you paſs by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> of <hi>Baïeux,</hi> of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> and that of <hi>Séez,</hi> in which the Schools have been laid down for ſome years paſt.</p>
               <p>Lower is the Church of St. <hi>Coſmus,</hi> in which there is nothing remarkable unleſs it be the Epitaph of Monſieur <hi>Dupuy,</hi> ſo well known to all Men of Learning. The Houſe of St. <hi>Coſmue</hi> ſtands near this Church, in which Houſe the Chirurgions do ordinarily meet to make their
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62624:128"/>
Diſſections in relation to the Anatomy of humane Bodies, upon which ſometimes they make Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lectures.</p>
               <p>Over againſt the <hi>Rüe de Sorbonne,</hi> in the <hi>Rüe de Mathurins,</hi> ſtands the <hi>Hôtel de Cluni,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Abbot of that name. This <hi>Hôtel</hi> was formerly call'd the <hi>Palais des Termes,</hi> becauſe of ſome old Ruines here remaining of the <hi>Thermae</hi> or <hi>Baths,</hi> as ſome thought, of the Emperor <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate. And you ought not to neglect going for this purpoſe to a Neighbouring Houſe in the <hi>Rüe de la Harpe,</hi> at the ſign of the Iron-Croſs, where the Meſſenger of <hi>Chartres</hi> lodges; you will ſee there ſeveral old Arches, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue great Antiquity, and within them a kind of Hall whoſe Roof is very high, and contrived without <hi>Cordons;</hi> this is very likely to have been uſed for ſome profane Temple. The three Niches in the South Wall ſorve to ſupport this Conjecture, in regard they might have been ſo contrived for Statues, but we cannot determin any thing, and the ſilence of Hiſtorians in this matter leaves People at Liberty to make what Conjectures they pleaſe. The other parts are very well built, and aſſure us it was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome great Houſe. The Roof is ſo ſtrong that they have laid upon it ſo much Earth as to make a little Garden, in which are Flowers and ſmall Trees growing; and thoſe who dwell in the <hi>Hôtel de Cluni,</hi> come and walk here as on a Tarraſs made on purpoſe.</p>
               <p>This is all that is to be ſeen in this Street. Further on, and at the end of the <hi>Rüe de la vielle Bouclerie,</hi> which determines at the little open place before the <hi>Pont St. Michael,</hi> near to a Houſe which almoſt makes the very Corner of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62624:128"/>
Street, you may obſerve a great ſtone, which ſerves for a Boundary, upon which is cut after an ugly faſhion the Figure of a Man; but as ill as it is one may eaſily diſtinguiſh the Head. Hiſtorians tell us, That this is the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one call'd <hi>John le Clerc,</hi> a Lockſmith by trade, and Porter of the Gate <hi>de Buſſi;</hi> who in the time of thoſe Troubles which happen'd in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth, after the <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> had expel'd the <hi>Burgundians</hi> out of this City, where they had committed a thouſand Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, had the Treachery to open to them that Gate in the night time, which put the <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> into an Alarm. After all theſe troubles were over, the <hi>Pariſians</hi> intending a revenge upon the Author of them, and not able to apprehend his perſon, he being fled, they cauſed his Eſfigies to be made in ſtone, and by Sentence of the Provoſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> all the Inhabitants were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to caſt ſomething in his Face, in deteſtation of his Treaſon, and this was accordingly executed. Since that time this Statue has been removed to this place to keep off the Wheels of Coaches and Carts, from injuring the Houſe where it ſtands. Turning on the left Hand you enter into</p>
               <p>The <hi>Street of St. Andrew des Arcs.</hi> The Pariſh Church which gives name to this Street is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for ſeveral things, which the Curious will meet with in it. It was formerly but a ſmall Chapel, and ſtood in the middle of a Field, planted with Vines or Fruit-Trees, belonging to the Monks of St. <hi>Germain des Prez.</hi> But all theſe things have been alter'd a long time. Some think that this Church is called <hi>St. Andrew des Arcs,</hi> by reaſon of ſome old Arches that were
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62624:129"/>
hereabouts. The building it ſelf hath nothing ſingular, but you ought not to neglect to go into this Church to ſee the Tombs of ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous perſons; ſuch were <hi>Meſſieurs de Thou,</hi> whoſe Monuments are in the Chapel of <hi>St. Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> which they built from the Ground. The name of theſe great Men hath attain'd ſo great veneration among the Learned, that moſt of them make no difficulty to ſay, That <hi>France</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver produced more Illuſtrious Perſons. And the Hiſtory which was writ by one of them, is look'd upon as the very Model and beſt thing of the kind in theſe laſt Ages. It is writ in Latin, which has occaſion'd Strangers not only to read it, but to have ſo great an eſteem for it, that they apply themſelves to this Hiſtorian more than any. In this Chapel you may ſee a Buſt of Monſieur <hi>de Thou</hi> in Marble, with his Epitaph, which recites at large the great Imployments which he enjoy'd.</p>

               <p>THis Monaſtery was built about the Year 1217. in the Pontificate of Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the III. while St. <hi>Francis</hi> was yet living at <hi>Aſſiſium</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> Some of the Religious Men of the new Order, which that great Saint did inſtitute, came into <hi>France;</hi> the firſt who arrived at <hi>Paris</hi> were Lodged in the Houſes of certain <hi>Burgeſſes;</hi> but afterwards at the Solicitation of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Pope, who writ to <hi>William</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of this City in their behalf, they were taken notice of; and in the Year 1230. <hi>Eudo,</hi> Abbot of <hi>St Germain des Prez,</hi> gave them the place where they now inhabit at this day. The Kings of <hi>France</hi> did after this become great Benefactors to them, St. <hi>Lewis</hi> gave more than all; he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Church to be built, not as we ſee it at preſent, but as it was before the Fire which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened here in the Year 1580. and reduced all into Aſhes, and part alſo of the Convent, ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Marble Tombs of ſeveral Princes and Princeſſes of the Blood-Royal, which then ſtood in the Quire, but can hardly now be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd.

               </head>
               <p>KIng <hi>Childebert,</hi> Son of the Great <hi>Clouis</hi> was the Founder. Monſieur de <hi>Mezeray</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the particulars of the Foundation, and tells us, That that King being in <hi>Spain</hi> in the year 543. in a War againſt the <hi>Viſigoths,</hi> he laid Siege to the Town of <hi>Sarragoſſa</hi> in which they were refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: the Inhabitants finding themſelves ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſt by the <hi>French,</hi> and thinking in imitation of the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> to move their Enemies by ſome ſurprizing Action, they concluded to make a Proceſſion about their Walls, in which they carried the Coat and other Reliques of St. <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> At this ſight <hi>Childebert</hi> was ſo effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd, that he yeilded ſo far, that he was contented to depart with certain Preſents which the Biſhop made him, among other things that Coat, and thoſe Reliques of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> which he brought with him to <hi>Paris,</hi> and to the honour of them built the Church, of which we are now about to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>This Abby hath had ſeveral Names; it was ſometime called St. <hi>Croix,</hi> becauſe of a piece of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62624:134"/>
that Holy Wood placed here among the other Reliques which he brought with him: at preſent it bears the name of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> who was Abbot here, and Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and is here interr'd. On his Feſtival day, which is the 28th of <hi>May,</hi> they expoſe to publick view his Shrine, which is of Silver gilt, adorn'd with a great quantity of Precious Stones: It is of a Gothick kind of Work, but as curious and handſome as one can ſee. All that remains of <hi>Childebert</hi>'s Building is the principal Gate at the end of the Church, and the great Steeple over it, which appear ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ancient. The Statues of the Kings and Queens which are on the ſides of this Gate, are of ſuch a deſign as diſcovers that in that Age the Guſt of good Sculpture was not known; for we can hardly diſtinguiſh whether the Statues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Men or Women. The Tomb of the aforementioned King is in the middle of the Quire, raiſed about two foot and an half, with ſome Inſcriptions added to it when they removed it hither from St. <hi>Germain</hi>'s Chapel, where it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was behind the Quire. This tranſlation hapned about thirty or forty years ago, when the Church was Repair'd and Beautified as it now is. At the ſame time they made over it a Vault of Stone inſtead of one of Wainſcot as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and adorned the Pillars that ſupported it with <hi>Corinthian</hi> Capitals. This Church is not lookt upon at preſent, as any Curioſity, yet is the Diſpoſition of its parts well enough. The Great Altar is in the middle of the <hi>Croiſée;</hi> and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, that one may go round it: In the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of this Altar is a Table of Silver gilt, which is a great Ornament, and is ſhewed only on Feſtival Days. It is adorn'd with the Figures
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62624:134"/>
of the Apoſtles, and a Crucifix in the middle, of an ancient ſort of Work, not unhandſom. This was the Gift of <hi>William,</hi> Abbot of this Houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe Body was found intire not long ago, tho' he had been buried ſeveral Ages. The Quire where the Religious ſing is behind, in which their Stalls or Seats are of a very handſom Workmanſhip. At the Feet of <hi>Childebert</hi>'s Tomb you may read the following Epitaph of Monſieur the Duke of <hi>Verneüil,</hi> natural Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, who before he marryed with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Sally,</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Metz</hi> and Abbot of St <hi>Germains.</hi> The Epitaph was made by the Learned <hi>Dom.

He dyed the Tenth of <hi>January,</hi> in the Year  <lb/> M. DC. LXXXIII. <lb/> 
He was taken away that he might not be injur'd by <lb/>  the iniquity of the times; but that his <lb/>  memory might be immortal. <lb/>

That of Queen <hi>Fredegonde,</hi> which is compoſed of a kind of Moſaick, of pieces laid in with Veins of Braſs couched in the Stone. This Queen is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented holding in her hand a Scepter with a double Flower de Lis at the end of it, which makes one believe that in thoſe ancient times the Flowers de Lis were in uſe; the Crown on her Head may further authoriſe this Opinion. She deceaſed at <hi>Paris</hi> in the year 601. <hi>Clotaire</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son of <hi>Childeric</hi> the Second, and of his Wife <hi>Fredegonde,</hi> with his Wife <hi>Bertrude</hi> are alſo here interr'd: ſo likewiſe are <hi>Childeric</hi> the Second, and his Wife.

               <p>Before the <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> ruin'd this Church, here were many other Monuments of famous perſons whoſe memory now is loft. The Kings of the Firſt Race did affect to be buryed here, in like manner as thoſe of the ſecond and third Races made choice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of St. <hi>Denis</hi> for the ſame purpoſe. They have lately built here two very handſom Chapels of the ſame Symmetry, in the two Wings of the Church: they are adorn'd with Compoſite Pillars of Marble vein'd, with Pedeſtals of the ſame, ſo alſo the Friſe. That on the right hand is dedicated to St. <hi>Margaret,</hi> whoſe Girdle theſe Fathers keep here; and Women with Child, who have a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to this Chapel, are uſually girded with it. The Tomb belonging to ſome of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Caſtelan</hi> is over againſt this Chapel, and is of the deſign of M. <hi>Girardon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Chapel is dedicated to St. <hi>Caſimir,</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:62624:136"/>
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> Patron of King <hi>Caſimir,</hi> who dyed here in <hi>France,</hi> Abbot of this Abby, and whoſe heart is under the Monument, which ſtands on one ſide of this Chapel. This King is repreſented kneeling, in white Marble, apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his Royal Robes, and offering his Crown and Scepter to God, on a Tomb of black Marble, ſupported with a great Pedeſtal; in the fore part of which is placed a Baſ-relief in Braſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting a victory by him gain'd over the Turks. This Monument is one of the fineſt that can be ſeen, and one can hardly meet with the like. A Lay Brother of this Houſe named Brother <hi>Jean Thibaut,</hi> who paſſes for one of the moſt able men that are in theſe Works, did erect it. On each ſide are repreſented Captive Turks in Chains, ſitting on heaps of Arms, in manner of Trophies.

               <p>Having ſeen theſe things, there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of ſingular note in the Church. On Feſtival Days the divine Office is here Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with great Pomp and Majeſty, and there is ſcarce any Company of Regulars who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form better. The Order of St. <hi>Benet</hi> hath been in the Poſſeſſion of this Houſe, ever ſince it was firſt Founded by King <hi>Childebert.</hi> And the Church, according to the opinion of ſome Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, ſtands in the ſame place where was formerly a Temple dedicated to the Goddeſs <hi>Iſis,</hi> whoſe Statue remain'd here till the laſt Age; at which time an old Wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the inward parts of this Convent the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectory is worth ſeeing, which is great, and one of the faireſt of the Kingdom. It hath lights on both ſides: The Glaſs of which is very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, tho' old. At the end of this Room is a Stair-caſe that leads up to the great Dortor: which Stair-caſe is a hardy piece of Building. And you muſt not neglect to viſit the Chapel of our Lady; behind which is ſomething of the ſame deſign with the <hi>Holy Chapel</hi> at the <hi>Palais.</hi>

                  </gap> things, you ought to go to the Library, which takes up all the upper Room of that Arm of the Cloiſter next the Church. It is, in truth, none of the fulleſt, but in recompence of that, all the Books are the choiceſt and of the beſt Editions that can be met with. In the laſt Age, when there was not ſuch plenty of Libraries as at preſent, this here, was eſteemed the principal Library of <hi>Paris.</hi> And at this day, if it doth not continue all out of the ſame reputation for Printed Books, yet for Manuſcripts none will diſpute the precedency, of which we can no where meet with ſo great a Quantity nor ſuch Choice ones, unleſs it be in the King's Library. Theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts are kept at the further end, in a little Chamber by themſelves; which Room is full of them from the top to the bottom. Here are ſome of all Subjects, but chiefly of Religion; by means of which great Lights, ſeveral faults of Printers and ill Copiers have been diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and amended. In a little Preſs in the great Library, they preſerve ſeveral Volumes more choice and rare than the reſt; amongſt which is one called <hi>The Pſalter of St.</hi> Germain; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed to have been uſed by that Saint, who lived about the Year 560. in the Reign of <hi>Childebert,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in the Eaſt. Formerly this Book was kept in the Sacriſty, among the Reliques; but in regard it was ſo often deſired to be ſeen by curious perſons, it was removed hither: It is written in Letters of Gold and Silver, upon a Purple coloured Velom; and contains all the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62624:140"/>
Pſalms of <hi>David.</hi> There is alſo in the ſame place a very ancient Miſſal, which according to all appearance, is more than 900. Years old: Certain Tablets of the Antients, made of ſmall Boards of Cedar, with a kind of Wax or Varniſh finely ſpread over them, upon which they writ with their Stile (or Steel Bodkin); and ſeveral other ſingularities of ſuch ſort, which deſerve to be conſidered; above all, one great Volume, full of Atteſtations of the Belief of ſeveral Greek Biſhops, touching Tranſubſtantiation: Which Atteſtations the Learned M. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> with much pains, procured from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by the means of Monſieur <hi>de Nointel,</hi> Ambaſſador from <hi>France</hi> to the <hi>Port,</hi> for Authorities againſt thoſe of the pretended Reformed Religion, who maintained that the Greek Church was of their Opinion.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid thus much of the Library, the Reader will not be diſpleas'd if I give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe Excellent Works, which the Learned Monks of this Houſe have lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht; of which the moſt uſeful and moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable is St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Works, which they have interpreted and corrected according to the moſt antient and authentique Manuſcripts in all the Libraries in <hi>Europe,</hi> of which they have had an account. We have already received five great Volumes, to which the publick have given an univerſal applauſe, and they are continually employ'd about publiſhing the reſt with the ſame Purity. One may juſtly ſay, That there has not been any thing undertaken in this Age, of greater importance and advantage to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; in regard all the Diſputes that of late Years have happen'd among Divines on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62624:141"/>
of Grace, have riſen from the different interpretation of that Father. The Church is obl ged to theſe Learned Monks, who deſerve no leſs Glory for their Pains, than they have had Trouble in the undertaking, before they could bring the Work to this Condition. Father <hi>Dom Luc d'Achery,</hi> a Monk of this Houſe, hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht the <hi>Spicilegium,</hi> and hath continued it to the Thirteenth Volume in <hi>Quarto,</hi> in which he hath collected together ſeveral antient Pieces, hitherto hid in the Libraries of his Order, and which had been loſt in oblivion, without his care in thus ſhewing them to the light; to theſe Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes he hath added learned Prefaces, which are a great help to the Curious.</p>
               <p>But after the incomparable Book, which Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dom Jean Mabillon</hi> has publiſht two Years ago, nothing further can be wiſht for; it is Entituled, <hi>De Re Diplomatica,</hi> in Folio, with a great number of Figures of antient Charters, which this Learned Author has deci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe who have peruſed it can never ſufficiently admire the Pains and Patience of the Author, in making ſuch Learned Diſcoveries as are in it; and there is hardly any Work in which there appears more ſolid Judgment than in this; which is the cauſe that of the ſmall number of Authors which we can reckon among the Learned, he is one of thoſe who is moſt eſteem'd and hath the greateſt Reputation. We have alſo from his hand ſeveral Volumes of <hi>Analects</hi> (or <hi>Fragments)</hi> in <hi>Octavo,</hi> which he continues daily, with much care.</p>

There are alſo in this Society, many other Learned Men who are continually employed upon divers ſubjects, from whoſe hands we ſhall have in a little time the Works of St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> One may ſay further, to their Commendation, that there is not any Religious Houſe where Idleneſs is more ſtrictly avoided than in this.</p>
               <p>We muſt know, that this Abby hath been in former times often Ruin'd, at the Incurſions of Foreigners, it then ſtanding out of the Town. The <hi>Normans</hi> and the <hi>Danes</hi> have Pillaged and Burnt it three or four times, and it hath ſtood out ſome Sieges like a Fortified Town. It was at that time encloſed about with deep Ditches and ſtrong Walls, which from one ſpace to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were defended with round Towers, moſt of which, of later time, have been pulled down to build the Houſes round about it; and there remain but two which are at the Gate, on that ſide next the <hi>Rile St. Benoiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In regard it is difficult to obſerve the courſe of the Streets in St. <hi>Germains</hi> Quarter, as we have done in other parts of the Town; becauſe things are not here in a Row as elſewhere: We ſhall therefore ſpeak of the obſervable places ſeverally, endeavouring, however, as near as we can, to deſcribe them to the Curious in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

That great Queen ſpared no Coſts to leave Poſterity a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of her magnificence. All Foreign Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers do agree, that in all <hi>Italy,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be ſeen, where Art hath been obſerved with more exactneſs, and where more Grandeur and Majeſty appears, than in this building. It is compoſed of a great Square Court, at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of which is the main Body of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, accompanied at the ends with four Pavilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in the middle the <hi>Avant-corps,</hi> which makes a fifth, ſet off with Pillars. On each ſide of the foreſaid Court are two long Galleries a little lower than the reſt of the Building, each ſupported with 9 Arches, under which one may walk dry round about the Court. The Front of all this Palace is after the manner of an open Gallery, with a kind of Dome in the middle ſupported with Pillars, under which is the great
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62624:142"/>
Door butting upon the <hi>Ruë de Tournon;</hi> at the upper part of which Street this Palace is ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which adds much to the beauty of its <hi>Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> At each end of the Galleries, and alſo of the two Tarraſſes, which run along the fore-part of the Court, are two other great Pavillions, which ſtand in the ſame Line with the Face of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Architecture of this Palace conſiſts of Pilaſters, except about the great Portal, and on the Garden ſide before a little Dome, which ſerves for a Chapel, where are ſome Pillars which ſtand off from the Work. The Orders obſerved in this Work are the Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, and the Dorick, with an Attique above; and on the Garden ſide over the Tuſcan and Dorick, is an Ionick, which makes a third Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der compleat, with Baluſtrades round about the top; as alſo Frontons and Faces, on which are great Statues in cumbent poſtures, ſupporting Crowns. This excellent Architecture is ſtill more beautiful, by reaſon of the <hi>Boſſage</hi> that runs all over the Work, no other Ornaments being neceſſary. All that you ſee here is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the plain and true Rules of Art, which is the cauſe that all thoſe who are any thing knowing in Architecture, take more delight in conſidering this Palace, and obſerve more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in it, than thoſe who regard only the things without knowing the true value. This Palace is at preſent inhabited by two illuſtrious Princeſſes, Daughters of the late Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> only Brother of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. On the left hand as you come in are the Apartments of <hi>Mademoiſell d'Orleans,</hi> and on the right thoſe of Madam the Dutcheſs of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> her Siſter. In the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned are ſeveral excellent <hi>Plaſons,</hi> and very

rich Furniture; in the laſt among other things, you ought to ſee the Gallery painted by the Famous <hi>Rubens</hi> of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> who was invited from <hi>Flanders</hi> on purpoſe to paint it. Theſe Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are great Pictures on the Pannels between the Diviſions, in which are repreſented the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal actions of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV his Life, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe in which <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Medicis</hi> had any concern. No Man can deſire to ſee any thing more exactly deſigned or better perform'd: but that which is moſt to be admired is the excellent Colouring which this famous Maſter uſed in his Works, in which thing he ſurpaſt all others. Often do the Young Painters come and ſtudy in this Gallery, and in regard it is all throughout of his manner, they may eaſily here learn the Ideas of Excellent <hi>Peinture.</hi> The Garden was formerly very beautiful, and full of little Groves and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd Walks; but ſeveral hard Winters having killed many of the Trees, it hath been thought neceſſary to cut up the reſt to make room for others, which they have already begun to plant; at the end of the great Walk, before the <hi>Parterre,</hi> they deſigned to make a Fountain; ſo much of it as is already made, is of a very good kind of Architecture. It is a kind of <hi>Niche,</hi> adorn'd in the fore-part with four great Tuſcan Pillars, charg'd with Congelations, on which are Sea-Gods holding Vaſes, with a great <hi>Cartouche,</hi> in which are the Armes of <hi>France,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis</hi> impaled.</p>

               <p>Chancellor <hi>Seguier</hi> declared himſelf their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and became a great Benefactor; among other things he gave them wherewithal to build their great Altar; which is of a very handſome deſign, adorned with Corinthian Pillars of black Marble, and ſeveral Figures repreſenting the principal Saints of this Order. All the Church is of the Tuſcan order of building; yet, in truth, it is none of the moſt regular. In the middle there is a Dome, painted in the top by a Chanon of the Church of <hi>Leige,</hi> named <hi>Bertolet,</hi> who was no bad Painter, as one may well judge by this Work; which repreſents the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of <hi>Elias,</hi> in a Chariot of Fire, and his Mantle falling on his Diſciple <hi>Eliſha,</hi> who receives it with open Arms.</p>
               <p>There are in this Church two Chapels that deſerve a particular conſideration. The firſt of which is on the left hand, under the Dome, and Dedicated to the Holy Virgin; in which there is a Statue of white Marble, the fineſt that can be ſeen: It was made at <hi>Rome,</hi> by a Diſciple of the Famous Cavalier <hi>Bernin,</hi> and coſt a great expence to bring it from thence. It is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62624:145"/>
not eaſie ever to meet with a better figure than this. It repreſents the Holy Virgin ſitting and holding her Infant on her Knee, who ſmiles and extends his little Arms to embrace her. All that one can wiſh to ſee in a compleat and finiſht Statue, is to be found in this; and all Men ought to conſider it as the beſt Piece in the Kingdom. The Niche in which it ſtands over the Altar is of the Deſign of Cavalier <hi>Bernin,</hi> it is adorn'd with four Corinthian Pillars of a vein'd Marble. The other Chapel is over againſt this, and dedicated to St. <hi>Tereſa,</hi> as appears by the Picture in the middle. This Chapel is adorn'd with Marble Pillars, of a compoſite Order, but very ſingular, with Feſtons on the Freeſe; but this is the Architects own fancy, and there are but few examples of ſuch Work. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the whole is very handſom and pleaſing to the view. The Baluſtrades of theſe two Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and that alſo of the great Altar which ſtands between 'em, are of a choice ſort of Marble. The reſt of the Church hath nothing at all extraordinary, unleſs it be the white painting, with which it is all over painted, which has a Gloſs, and ſhines like Marble. It is ſaid that theſe Fathers have a Secret to make it thus, and that they are not willing to diſcover the myſtery to any.</p>
               <p>In the inner part of the Houſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable but the Library, which tho' it be but little, and the number of Books very ſmall, yet it ought to be ſeen if it were only for the delicate proſpect which it hath over the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Fields.

This Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being conſulted with about the work of this Church, would not meddle till the General had given him permiſſion to do what he thought proper, without being obliged to obſerve the orders of any one whatſoever of the Society. After this he undertook the building, which is not ſo big as the other, but it infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes it in Regularity. The Portal is of Pila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Dorick Order, and over them the Ionick Order. The inſide is alſo of Dorick Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſters ſupporting a Corniſh, between the <hi>Trig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifes,</hi> of which are ſeveral Ornaments repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Inſtruments of our Lord's Paſſion. The great Altar is but very plain of Jovners Work, adorn'd with two Corinthian Pillars. But that which ſets off this Altar infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the faireſt of the Kingdom, is the great Picture which you ſee there of the famous <hi>Pouſſin,</hi> one of the beſt which that able Maſter ever did.

               <p>After you have ſeen the Church, you ought to ask to ſee the Chapel of the Congregation, which lies on the left Hand of the Door, as you come in.

               <p>OF all the King's Buildings, there is not any in which there appears more of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and piety together than in this, ſince all that prodigious expence which hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on this Work is ſolely intended for the maintenance of crippled Souldiers; who being diſabled to ſerve any longer in the Army, would be forced to lead a Languiſhing and Miſerable life, were it not for the ſupport which they find in this Houſe, where they are ſupply'd with all things, and may end the courſe of their Lives in the Exerciſe of Chriſtian Piety. But that which is not a little ſurpriſing is, that all this vaſt Edifice was compleated, as it now is, in leſs than Eight Years, and in the height of the War.</p>
               <p>About the Year 16**. they began to lay the firſt Foundations of this curious Structure, which at preſent makes one of the Chief Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Paris.</hi> It is exactly ſquare, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in its Circumference five Courts of the ſame Figure, one great one in the middle, and two leſſer on each ſide, all which are compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t about with Apartments, in which the Souldiers have their ſeveral Lodgings. That in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is much greater than the reſt, and the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings about it are of a handſom Symmetry. They are compoſed of two rows of Arches, one above the other, which makes ſo many Corridors or
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62624:150"/>
Galleries, by means of which you may walk dry round the Court. The top of the Buildings are adorn'd with Ornaments, repreſenting Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of Armes, and ſuch like things, which make a very handſom Show. At the end of the Court, juſt oppoſite to the principal Entry, is the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the Church, compoſed of two ranks of Pillars, the firſt or lowermoſt of the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite order, and the ſecond of the Corinthian. Here you may enter into that part of the Church which is appointed for thoſe of the Houſe: as for thoſe who come from abroad they are building another part already ſomewhat advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and this will be incomparably more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent. The Model in little may be ſeen in a Pavillion raiſed on purpoſe; if it be performed according to this Model, nothing can be ſeen more glorious or of a greater deſign. It will be a Dome very high raiſed, under which the great Altar is to be placed, which will be enricht with all the moſt beautiful Ornaments, which the moſt ſtudied Architecture can produce. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is to be gilt like that at <hi>Val de Grace,</hi> but they intend this to be more regular, and better perform'd, both for the diſpoſition and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments. You ought to ſee the Infirmaries, which are divided from the reſt of the Houſe, but not far off. The Beds are neat, and the Sick receive there all the help and aſſiſtance that is neceſſary, they are ſerved by the <hi>Siſters of the Charity of St. Lazar</hi>'s, who make it their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular profeſſion to wait upon the Sick in all parts of the Town, as well as in this Houſe. But that which Strangers ought to obſerve more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, are the four great Refectories which are on each ſide of the middle Court, where you will
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62624:151"/>
ſee painted in <hi>Freſquo,</hi> the principal Sieges and Battels which <hi>France</hi> has gain'd againſt her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Few Pictures are more exactly deſign'd, or can ſhew more variety and life than theſe; the ſight of which things cannot chooſe but give a very great pleaſure, to thoſe who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Actions repreſented. There is in this Houſe a certain Souldier works in Tapiſtry, whom you ought not to forget to viſit. As you go out you may obſerve the Front of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with the great Court before it, compaſt about with a dry Ditch, and a Wall of Freeſtone, from which you have a delicate Proſpect. They keep Guard at the Gates here in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as in a Citadel, thereby to preſerve the Souldiers in Health, and free from Idleneſs. The Diſcipline which they obſerve in this Houſe is admirably exact; and the Fathers of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who have the Care and Conduct of the place, acquit themſelves very worthily.</p>
               <p>All that remains of Note in this Quarter, after you have ſeen the <hi>Invalids</hi> is</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hôtel,</hi> in which dwells Monſieur <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeur de Haute-Feüille,</hi> Embaſſador from <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> in a Street behind the <hi>Peutes-Maiſons.</hi> Here you may ſee very Curious Pictures, with many other great Rarities, which can hardly be met with elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Near this, in the <hi>Rüe du Bac,</hi> is the <hi>Seminary of the Foreign-Miſſions,</hi> where of late they have built a Church, the Roof whereof is very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, it is indeed but low, becauſe they deſign to raiſe a ſecond Church upon this. It is the Invention of the Sieur <hi>du Buiſſon,</hi> an able Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect. From this Houſe are ſent Miſſionaries into the <hi>Indies</hi> to Preach the Goſpel there to Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62624:151"/>
in which office they acquit themſelves with a very great Zeal, and their endeavours are bleſt with marvellous Succeſs, as we perceive by the Relations of Monſieur the Biſhop of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> and all the other Travellers that come from thoſe parts, who relate moſt ſurprizing things.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Rüe St. Dominique</hi> is the <hi>Noviciat of the Reformed Jacobins,</hi> whoſe Church is now build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and will be none of the leaſt handſom of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Sieur <hi>Bulet,</hi> who is the City Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect, hath undertaken the building of this Church, as alſo of the Houſes round about; which bring theſe Fathers a conſiderable Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and are well built. On the other ſide of the way is</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hôtel de Luines,</hi> heretofore call'd the <hi>Hô<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel de Chevreuſe,</hi> whoſe name has been changed ſince the death of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevreuſe,</hi> on whoſe account it was firſt built. The Apartments are very handſom and convenient, and the Sieur <hi>le Muet</hi> made the deſign.</p>
               <p>In the ſame <hi>Rüe Saint Dominique,</hi> you may perceive a new Houſe built by order of the <hi>Hôtel-Dieu,</hi> whoſe Porch is very pretty, it ſtands at the further part of the Court, and is ſupported by Dorick Pillars, which ſhew curiouſly as you enter. The whole Houſe is of the deſign of the Sieur <hi>le Duc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Petite Rüe Guillaume,</hi> ſtands a large Houſe in which dwells Monſieur <hi>Talon,</hi> Advocat General; the Structure is extream handſom, the Apartments very pleaſant, having all their proſpects upon the adjoining Gardens, the Court is great, and, in fine, it appears that there were no coſts ſpared in the building; but that which gives it the beſt Ornament is the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62624:152"/>

               <p>THis Hoſpital is ſituated in the outermoſt part of the Town, in which the Curious muſt not expect to find any pleaſing Sights; but Poor Sick People, who are ſerved very neatly by the Brothers of the Order of St. <hi>John of God,</hi> who mind no other buſineſs but to aſſiſt and comfort theſe poor People, and to procure for them freely all ſuch things as they need. Here are three or four great Rooms full of Beds on each ſide. In their Church you may ſee the Tomb of <hi>P.

               <p>A Second Edition of <hi>Francis Savot</hi>'s <hi>French</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, augmented with a great number of Notes.</p>
               <p>But Books are not the only things that have made M. <hi>Blondel</hi> famous, the great Exploits which he hath perform'd in the Wars as well by Sea as Land: The Negotiations in which he has been employed with Foreign Princes; and in fine, the long Voyages which he has performed in the four parts of the World, wherein he has ſeen all that is obſervable, and thereby attained ſo perfect a Knowledge in all things, that the reputation of his Experience and Abilities hath juſtly acquired him the quality of a Counſellor of State.</p>
               <p>He hath here one of the moſt curious Cabinets that is at preſent in <hi>Paris,</hi> in which are ſeveral Rarities of all the beſt and choiceſt kinds, and no leſs choicely preſerved. Among other things, he hath here ſeveral original Pictures of <hi>Palma,</hi> of <hi>Paul Veroneſe,</hi> of <hi>Guido,</hi> and of the famous <hi>Pouſſin,</hi> ſeveral Land-ſkips of <hi>Paul Bril,</hi> of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille,</hi> of <hi>Breugle,</hi> of <hi>Fouquiere,</hi> of <hi>Lucas,</hi> and of divers others. Pieces of Fruit of <hi>Labrador,</hi> of <hi>Sommes;</hi> and of Flowers of <hi>Picard,</hi> of <hi>Mariv Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiori,</hi> and of others: Alſo a great number of Limnings and Miniatures after the beſt Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; as <hi>Raphaël, Carache,</hi> and <hi>Pouſſin.</hi> Here are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62624:155"/>
alſo 200. Leaves of the ſame Work repreſenting Birds, beſides thoſe of Animals, which they made at <hi>Limoges</hi> in the laſt Age upon Gold and Silver; the ſecret of which work is at preſent loſt, and which things are now ſold at exceſſive Rates. Here are ſome Pictures of inlaid Wood, whoſe Colours are as beautiful as if they had been wrought with a Pencil.</p>
               <p>But that which is infinitely more curious than all the reſt, is the great number of Agates, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which there are 40 greater than the reſt, moſt of them are antique, and repreſent Deities, Emperors Heads, and Sacrifices, and are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well cut: Thoſe which are modern are graved by <hi>Coldoré,</hi> a famous Lapidary, and by ſeveral others as great Artiſts; with theſe a ſmall Chain of ſix great grains of Agate alſo.</p>
               <p>Still theſe are not the moſt precious things of this Cabinet, there are ſome things of greater eſteem, as 12 Bracelets compoſed of Agates, Cornelians, Onyx, Jaſper, and of prime Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds adorn'd with Gold, which altogether make 150. antique Gravings, repreſenting <hi>Roman</hi> Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all the Emperors from <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> to <hi>Labienus Poſthumus,</hi> with 36. Empreſſes; among the Emperors the Heads of <hi>Peſcenius Niger,</hi> and the 2 <hi>Africans</hi> are very curiouſly cut in Onyx. This Suit is lookt upon as one of the moſt ſingular Rarities that is at preſent, and it is without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the only thing of this kind in the whole World. For we never yet knew of any Man who collected a Suit of antique graved Stones as has been uſually done of Medals; and this here hath been the Work of four of the moſt famous <hi>Vertuoſi</hi> that ever were in <hi>France,</hi> who have above 50 Years uſed their endeavours to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62624:155"/>
render this Collection compleat as it now is. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe there are four other Agates graved hollow repreſenting the Hiſtory of the <hi>Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> the Heads of <hi>Caeſar, Mark Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> are upon the three principal, and that of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> on the other. On a green Oriental Jaſper of an Oval Figure which is placed in the middle, is repreſented a Pillar, at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This Pillar was taken down by <hi>Dolabella.</hi> The Inſcription graven about this curious Agate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the Hiſtory, and is this,

               </p>
               <p>The other things are ſeveral Rings of Gold, adorn'd with precious Stones, as Rubies, Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, and Oriential Topazes, a great Diamond
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62624:156"/>
in manner of a Button, very perfect; another Yellowiſh but very lively; an Aigue of the Sea, oriental; a great Violet-colour Ruby of 28. grains; an Opal of the Eaſt in the form of a little Lion; three great Boxes full of Stones graved of the antique, ſome hollow'd, and ſome in relief; ſeveral rare Shells of ſtrange faſhions; a Suit of one hundred Imperial Medals of Silver, and one hundred others of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> the beſt choſen of <hi>Padoüan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As there want no Rarities in this rich Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, you may ſee here alſo ſeveral <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Armes, as Cimeters, Daggers, and Knives of Damask't Steel, whoſe hilts and handles are of Stone inlaid with Gold, and enricht with Jewels. There are alſo Japan Works, and the beſt ſort of Porcelains; curious Books; ſome pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ivory wrought in Sculpture, with a good quantity of Roſary-Beads of Agate; and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other things of ſuch ſort, which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a long deſcription, if we ſhould mention all in particular.</p>
               <p>All that you ſee in this Cabinet is of unuſual Beauty, the Collection having been made by one who was perfectly knowing in theſe matters, and who ſpared no Coſts to attain the thing which pleaſed him. On this account you will find in this Houſe ſufficient to ſatisfie any Mans Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. And the Civility with which they are ſhewn gives no leſs ſatisfaction to the Beholders, than the Rarities themſelves occaſion Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Beyond this on the ſame ſide of the way in the <hi>Rüe de l'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſité,</hi> ſtands the <hi>Hôtel Tambon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neau,</hi> perfectly well built, and deſigned by the Sieur <hi>le Veau.</hi>

               <p>You muſt not neglect to viſit M. <hi>Pelitot,</hi> over againſt the <hi>Hôtel Tambonneau;</hi> he is one of the ableſt Enamellers in <hi>Europe,</hi> and makes thoſe curious Pictures in Enamel, which are ſet about with Diamonds, and preſented to Embaſſadors; and ſometimes they are ſet in Bracelets, being commonly no bigger than a Shilling, and often much leſs: One may confidently affirm that no Man did ever better underſtand this Art, nor has made his Pictures more like.</p>
               <p>At the end of this Street in a Houſe near the <hi>Hôtel de les Mouſquetairs,</hi> you may ſee a Burning Glaſs which does wondrous things when expoſed to the Sun, ſo far as to diſſolve the hardeſt and the moſt incombuſtible Bodies that are. It is greater than any we have yet ſeen; and the Foot on which it ſtands is no leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, it being alſo of Steel, and wrought with much Art and Patience.</p>

She hath named this Monaſtery from the Holy Trinity, and this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Chapel of Praiſes, and ſhe hath here placed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62624:158"/>
the barefooted Fathers of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Order.</q>
               <p>One may perceive by this Inſcription that theſe Fathers were formerly more auſtere than they are at preſent, in regard they were then <hi>Dé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cháuſſez</hi> or barefooted. That Queen built this Monaſtery in favour of her Confeſſor who was of this Order; his name was <hi>Francis Amet,</hi> origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Town of <hi>Montargis.</hi> You ought to ſee their Library, which is very neat. Among theſe Fathers is Father <hi>Lubin,</hi> who is eſteem'd one of the moſt ſkilful Geographers that we have. This is he who Tranſlated the Relation of <hi>Lapland,</hi> which is ſold at the Widow <hi>Varenne</hi>'s at the <hi>Palais.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Ruë de Seine,</hi> behind the Colledge of the four Nations, is the <hi>Hôtel de la Roche-foucault,</hi> which was formerly known by the name of <hi>Hô<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel de Liancourt,</hi> whoſe building is very regular, and of a beautiful Ordinance. Here were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly very excellent Pictures, but they have been diſperſed ſince the Death of the Duke of <hi>Liancourt</hi> who made the Collection.</p>
               <p>Parallel to this Street lies the <hi>Ruë Mazarin,</hi> ſo call'd, ſince the building of the Colledge of the four Nations which takes up part of the Street, of which Colledge Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> was the Founder. In the middle of this Street is the Theater of <hi>French Comedies</hi> over againſt the end of the <hi>Rüe Guenegaud;</hi> this is the only place where at preſent they act <hi>French</hi> Plays. Former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there were three places in <hi>Paris,</hi> where you had ſuch Spectacles, at the <hi>Palais Royal,</hi> at the <hi>Marais du Temple,</hi> and at the <hi>Hotel de Bourgogne;</hi> but ſince the Invention of <hi>Opera's,</hi> theſe things
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62624:158"/>
have been changed, and theſe here are the only Company of <hi>French</hi> Comedians that remain at preſent. They often Act here new Pieces that are very pleaſant, but are not of equal Beauty with thoſe of M. <hi>Corneille,</hi> nor of M. <hi>Racine</hi> for ſerious Matters, no more than they are equal to thoſe of the famous <hi>Moliere</hi> for Comick. All Strangers agree however that the <hi>French</hi> Scene is the handſomeſt and moſt magnificent of <hi>Europe,</hi> as well for the decoration of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as for the Beauty of the Pieces there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; the Comedians moreover ſpare no Coſts to ſatisfie the Spectators in the richneſs of their habits. There are ſome among them who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Plays themſelves, which makes them more expert, and enables them more thorowly to underſtand the Character which they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>From the <hi>Ruë Mazarin</hi> you may turn into the <hi>Ruë de Guenegaud,</hi> in which dwells Monſieur the Abbot <hi>de la Roque,</hi> Author of the <hi>Journal des Sçavans,</hi> which he publiſhes every Fifteen days: The Curious receive this piece with extream ſatisfaction, ſince he ſhews ſo great care to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich it with all the fine things he can collect. M. <hi>de Salo,</hi> Counſellor in the Parliament, was the firſt who began this Journal in the Year 1665. and gave the Idea to Strangers, who found the invention ſo profitable and ſo pleaſant, that they have imitated the ſame thing in divers parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> M. the Abbot <hi>Gallois</hi> continued the Journal for ſome years after, from 1666. to 1674. at which time M. the Abbot <hi>de la Roque</hi> undertook the Work, in which he hath always labour'd ſince then, with ſuch ſucceſs as has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him a very great Reputation in the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62624:159"/>
World. He holds at his Houſe every Thurſday Conferences, at which many Learned Perſons meet, and propoſe to him the Diſcoveries they have made in the Arts and Sciences.</p>

               <p>THE Houſe of theſe Fathers is of no greater Antiquity than that of the other <hi>Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,</hi> of which I have already ſpoken. Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians ſay, that they came to <hi>Paris</hi> about the Year 1270. and that they were then call'd the <hi>Hermites</hi> of St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Their firſt Habitation was near the Gate of <hi>Mont-martre,</hi> in the Street call'd <hi>Rüe des Vieux Auguſtines,</hi> which ſtill keeps that name, and while they dwelt in that Quarter they made uſe of the Church of St. <hi>Mary Aegyptian,</hi> which is ſtill remaining. They changed their abode ſome years after, and came into the <hi>Rüe des Bernardins,</hi> where there is at preſent St <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las du Chardonnet:</hi> but finding that place no more Commodious than the former, they ſhifted once again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and came at laſt to this place, intending to aſſociate with the Penitents called <hi>Sachets,</hi> who were apparel'd in a kind of Sackcloth, and were placed by St. <hi>Lewis</hi> on the Bank of the <hi>Seine,</hi> in the ſame place where the Convent ſtands at this day. This habitation the <hi>Sachets</hi> left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to them, and became themſelves diſperſed
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62624:159"/>
into divers places.

               <p>The Church was dedicated by <hi>William Chartier,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the year 1453. aſſiſted by a great number of Prelates, who performed this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony with much Solemnity. The Great Altar is a modern Work; it is but two years ſince it was finiſht. M. <hi>le Brun</hi> made the Deſign, which is not much different from that of St. <hi>Severin:</hi> you may obſerve that the Joyners Work of the Quire, is of the beſt ſort in <hi>Paris,</hi> as is alſo the Tribune between the Quire and the Nave adorn'd with black Marble Pillars of the Corinthian Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62624:160"/>
Virgin, and the other to St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Tolentin.</hi> The Pulpit is alſo adorn'd with certain Carvings gilt, and the Bas-reliefs which are round about, are carefully preſerved, they being wrought by <hi>Germain Pilon,</hi> yet theſe Fathers have been not long ſince perſwaded to gild them.</p>
               <p>In this Church are ſeveral Tombs of illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons, among which <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> is the moſt famous; he lived under <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh, and was his principal Secretary. The Memoires which he hath left us are ſo excellent and ſo profitable, that they have been tranſlated into Latin, with Commentaries and Notes upon them: And M. <hi>Godefroy,</hi> Hiſtoriographer of <hi>France,</hi> hath printed a <hi>French</hi> Edition of them at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> according to the Original, in the Language of the time, which he hath illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with many curious Remarks. That learned Man is buried with his Wife in a little low Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel behind the Altar belonging to the Knights of the Holy Ghoſt, and one cannot ſee his Tomb unleſs the Sacriſtan open the Door of the place in which it is, it not appearing outwards. You muſt not forget to obſerve the great Picture in this Chapel, repreſenting the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Holy Virgin, and the Apoſtles; it is the Work of—a Famous Painter. There is another Picture on the ſide of the ſame bigneſs, repreſenting <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth in his Ceremonial Robes giving the Collar of the Holy Ghoſt to a Lord, aſſiſted with the principal Officers of the Order, in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Habits alſo.

But the greateſt Rarity of all is a Marble Buſt of the famous Cavalier <hi>Bernin,</hi> made at <hi>Rome</hi> a little before his Death; and another Buſt of Chriſt, made by the ſame Maſter; with another of M. <hi>de la Chambre,</hi> his Father, whoſe name is ſo famous among all Men of Learning, for thoſe many excellent Works which he hath publiſh'd, and for that particular Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which he hath, of treating of the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Matters, with a ſtile ſo neat and polite.

               </q>
               <p>The inner part of this Colledge is very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; it is compoſed of two Courts, the firſt of which and alſo the leaſt, is adorn'd with two Portico's, one of which leads to the Church, in the other is the Stair-caſe that goes up to the Apartments of the foremoſt buildings. The other Court is very great and all the buildings run along one ſide only, in which are convenient Lodgings for a very great number of People. The Schools are below in the Ground Rooms, level with the Court. But theſe things ought not to detain you long, you ought to ſee the Library which is compoſed of Thirty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Volumes, collected together by Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> with great Care and Charges. They are placed in excellent order, and the Preſſes are wrought of Wainſcot adorn'd with Pillars and Sculpture. This Library is of great length, and it takes up one of the Pavillions that runs out upon the Key. Monſieur <hi>de la Potrie</hi> one of the moſt intelligent men of the Kingdom in Books, hath the care of this Library, and ſhews it to the Curious very obligingly. It is ſaid that it will be made publick, and that people will have allowance to ſtudy there on certain days every Week, as is done in that of St. <hi>Victor</hi>'s, but no body knows when this will be. The Revenue which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62624:164"/>
for the maintenance of this Colledge is conſiderable: For beſide the Abby of St. <hi>Michael en Herme,</hi> which is of a great Rent; there are ſeveral Houſes in the <hi>Rüe Mazarin,</hi> from which ariſes a very great Summ of Money. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> was to entertain here the Gentlemen of thoſe four ſeveral Nations, whoſe Country hath been ſo long time the Theater of War, and that they might be here Inſtructed in all thoſe Exerciſes that are proper for Perſons of Quality. Here are to be Sixty in all; Fifteen from the parts about <hi>Pignerol,</hi> for <hi>Italy;</hi> as many out of <hi>Alſatia</hi> for <hi>Germany;</hi> Twenty out of the Catholick Low Countrys; and Ten from <hi>Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillon;</hi> that ſo theſe people being acquainted with the French manners, may have an affection for that Nation from whom they have received ſuch Benefits. The Doctors of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> are to have the Government of the Colledge, and to teach here Humanity. Here is alſo to be taught the Riding the great Horſe, and there is already a place ſet out for a <hi>Manege</hi> (or Rideing School.) They are alſo to be taught to Dance, to handle their Armes, to Vault; the Mathematicks, and all <hi>belles Lettres,</hi> (or Polite Learning.)

nothing but a little more Room, to make it lighter.</p>
               <p>Further on is the Houſe of the late Preſident <hi>Perault,</hi> Intendant of Monſieur the <hi>Prince,</hi> which has been built with much Coſt.

               <p>The laſt houſe that you ſee in this Row, on the ſide of the River, is the <hi>Hotel de Mailly,</hi> now building.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cours de la Reine,</hi> is on the other ſide of the River, at the end of the <hi>Tuilleries;</hi> it was planted with four rows of Trees, as we ſee it, by the care of <hi>Mary of Medicis,</hi> who gave the publick this agreeable Walk: The <hi>Marechal de Baſſompierre</hi> has been at the charge to encloſe it on that ſide next the River, all along with a Wall of Freeſtone. It is in length a Roman <hi>Stadium,</hi> and at each end hath a Door of Iron, ſupported with certain Stone Works of a Ruſtick Order, which make a very handſom effect.

               <p>THis Church is the Cathedral of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Seat of an Arch-Biſhoprick, which was erected in the Pontificate of Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the VIII. in the Year 1622. It was before that only a Biſhoprick, but that very ancient; ſince St. <hi>Denis</hi> who lived but a little time after the Apoſtles, was the Founder. This Church, in the firſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Ages, was call'd by the Chriſtians of thoſe times, by the name of that Saint its Founder; but it being rebuilt in the Reign of <hi>Childebert,</hi> eldeſt Son of <hi>Clovis,</hi> about the year 522. it was then dedicated to the Holy Virgin, whoſe name it has ever ſince retain'd. King <hi>Robert</hi> one of the moſt pious and wiſeſt Princes that <hi>France</hi> ever had, perceiving the antient Building not to have all that Beauty and Magnificence, which it might have; begun another, but the deſign being a vaſt undertaking, it was not brought to perfection till many Years after. <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt his Son, <hi>Philip</hi> the Firſt, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Groſs, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Young, and <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, did all aſſiſt in the Work, and it was finiſht under the glorious Reign of the laſt, as we may preſume, becauſe he is the laſt of thoſe 24. whoſe Statues are ſet up on the great Frontiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece.</p>
               <p>The Structure of this Church is of the <hi>Gothick</hi> manner, but the handſomeſt and beſt perform'd in <hi>France.</hi> It is very remarkable for its Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and Solidity. The Vaults are very high
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62624:167"/>
raiſed, and contain 17. <hi>Toiſes</hi> (a <hi>Toiſe</hi> is ſix Foot) in height, the breadth is 24. and the length 65. The 2. great ſquate Towers in the Front, are 34 <hi>Toiſes</hi> high, flat on the top, ſo that from this place one may eaſily and conveniently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all <hi>Paris.</hi> The Bells that hang in the Towers are very fair ones, the biggeſt of them was caſt but a while ago, for which purpoſe the Chapter hath been at a very conſiderable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and yet it hath no very pleaſing Sound. All the Body of the Church is cover'd with Lead, and it is eaſie to judge what a prodigious quantity there goes to cover ſo great a Roof.</p>
               <p>As for the inſide of the Church, the Curious who are Lovers of Painting, will here find ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſatisfaction in viewing thoſe great Pictures which all the Pillars are adorn'd with.

On <hi>Whit-ſunday</hi> they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe here a Suit of Ornaments of Crimſon Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, Embroidered with Pearls, ſome of which are very large.

                  <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> who was choſen in his ſtead. The Tomb of Copper raiſed about one Foot from the Ground, near the Quire Door, belongs to a Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> named <hi>Odo de Sulli,</hi> in whoſe Pontificate this Church was finiſh'd; he lived in the Reign of <hi>Philip Auguſtus,</hi> and died in the year 1208.</p>
               <p>In the Chapels behind the Quire there are more Tombs, the moſt conſiderable of which are thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Gondi,</hi> originally of <hi>Italy,</hi> who came into <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Catharine de Medicis,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>de Retz,</hi> who died about 3. years ſince Abbot of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and had been Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> was the ſecond Cardinal of this Family. The Chapel of the Virgin, which is on one ſide of the Door that leads into the Quire, is adorn'd with many Silver Lamps, and abundance of other curious Offerings that have been made here. Some years ago they placed before the great Altar, that huge Lamp of Silver, given by the late Queen-Mother, which weighs 120. Marks, (a Mark is 8 Ounces) and is ſix Foot in Diameter. This Chapel of the Virgin, has been ſometimes called the Sluggards Chapel, becauſe of the very late Maſſes which were ſaid here for ſuch as lay long a bed: It was the only place in <hi>Paris</hi> that enjoyed this priviledge, contrary to the Cuſtom of the paſt Ages, when it was forbid to ſay Maſs after 10. a Clock. Over againſt this is the Statue of <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back Armed, and Capariſon'd as the faſhion was in his time. He is repreſented in ſuch manner, as when he came into this Church, to return his Thanks for a Battel gain'd over the <hi>Flemings</hi> near <hi>Caſſel;</hi> a Battle ſo Bloody that he ſaw 22000. of his Enemies dead upon the place.

               <p>The Cloiſter where the Canons live is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with ancient Walls, within which they have their ſeveral Apartments. Formerly when they lived in Community like the Religious, Women were not ſuffered to dwell here; but ſince they have been Secularized, they have had diſtinct Lodgings, and it hath been permitted to thoſe who have room to ſpare, to let out their Apartments, which has been the occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce here all ſorts of People.</p>

From hence, you paſs before the <hi>Hôtel-Dieu.</hi> This Hoſpital is the principal and greateſt of all <hi>Paris;</hi> they receive here indifferently all poor Sick People, and you may ſometimes reckon here to the number of 4000. who are all enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and nouriſhed with exceeding great Care. They are ſerved by Nuns of St <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Order, whoſe Rule is the more ſevere, in regard they are to ſpend their whole Life in this Exerciſe, which they could never undergo without admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Virtue and Patience, by reaſon of all thoſe incommodities which they paſs through, near ſo many poor Sick People, whoſe Miſeries and Diſeaſes render them equally froward and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. This Hoſpital hath very great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and they encreaſe daily more and more, by reaſon of the gifts that are continually given to it. The building is not handſom, nay it is very incommodious, becauſe it is ſtraitned for Room; the Ground on which it ſtands being ſhut up on all ſides. They have been therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to extend their buildings upon the very River, and to erect a great Room upon a long Vault, under which the Stream runs. Tho' there be here a very great number of Beds, they are not ſufficient for that greater quantity of Sick which are brought hither every day; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are conſtrained to put 3. or 4. in the ſame Bed. They have ſeveral and diſtinct Rooms, where they lodge thoſe who are afflicted with like Diſtempers, that ſo the Diſeaſe may not ſpread. The Hall on that ſide next the <hi>Petit-Pont,</hi> whoſe outſide is adorn'd with Figures, was built by <hi>Cardinal Anthony du Prat,</hi> Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of <hi>France,</hi> and Legate of the Holy See, about the Year 1535. It is thought that the firſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62624:171"/>
Foundation of this great Hoſpital was laid by St. <hi>Landri,</hi> the 28<hi>th.</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who lived under <hi>Clovis</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> in the Year 660.

For this reaſon they built Hoſpitals near their Cathedral Churches, to the end that ſo they might be the principal Adminiſtrators themſelves; as at this Day the Arch-Biſhop hath the chief direction here, with the Primier Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and the Procurer General; the Canons of <hi>Noſtre-Dame</hi> have the Direction of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals.</p>

I will only ſay to the honour of thoſe who compoſe this great Body, that <hi>Pepin</hi> Father of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> did firſt Inſtitute it; and that it was ambulatory till the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> the Fair, who, as <hi>Belforeſt</hi> reports, was the firſt who made it Sedentary, in quitting his own proper Palace to the Officers of Juſtice. To make it the more ſpacious, he cauſed to be built the greateſt part of the Chambers, and the whole work was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht in the year 1313. Notwithſtanding it is certain that there were in this place ſeveral great Buildings before that time, in regard ſeveral Kings made this place their uſual abode. <hi>Clovis</hi> himſelf kept his Court here; but St. <hi>Lewis</hi> dwelt here longer than any, for finding the Situation commodious in the middle of <hi>Paris,</hi> he made here ſeveral great Works, eſpecially the Holy Chapel, of which more by and by.</p>
               <p>The chief remarks in this great building is, firſt, the great Hall, admired by the Cavalier <hi>Bernin,</hi> as one of the handſomeſt things in <hi>France.</hi> It is built upon the ſame <hi>Plan,</hi> with another very old which was burnt down in the beginning of this Age, in which the Statues of all our Kings were placed round about the Walls, as big as the Life. In this Hall the Kings did uſe to receive Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and made publick Feaſts on certain days in the year, and alſo here they celebrated the Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of the Sons and Daughters of <hi>France.</hi> At the Marriage of <hi>Iſabel</hi> of <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, King of <hi>England,</hi> there was in this place ſo great a Croud of People, that many perſons were ſtifled. <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth who Reign'd at that time, was himſelf in danger of his Life.</p>
               <p>This Hall is all Vaulted with Freeſtone, with a row of Arches in the middle, ſupported with
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62624:175"/>
great Pillars, round which are ſeveral Shops employed by divers Tradeſmen; the Dorick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Pilaſters run round the Hall. At one end is a Chapel where Maſs is ſaid every day; the <hi>Procureurs</hi> (or Attorneys) to whom this Chapel belongs, have about a year ſince laid out 40000. <hi>Francs</hi> to beautifie it as we now ſee.</p>
               <p>Above this is the Clock, according to which the Hearings or Audiences in the ſeveral Courts are regulated. At the bottom of the Dial, you may read this neat Verſe made by M. <hi>de Montmort,</hi> one of the <hi>French</hi> Academicians.</p>
               <p>SACRA THEMIS MORES UT PENDULA DIRIGIT HORAS.</p>
               <p>Juſtice does guide us, as the Ballance this.</p>
               <p>The inſide round about this Chapel is adorn'd with Gilding, and painted like Marble of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Colours, which makes the place very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</p>
               <p>You muſt not neglect to ſee the ſeveral Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers where they plead. The great Chamber is on one ſide of the great Hall; it was built in the time of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who uſed here to give his Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences, in which, with the kindneſs of a Father, and the Majeſty of a great King, he endeavoured to pacifie the diſorders that riſe among his Subjects, or received the Embaſſadors ſent from the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes. <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. repair'd it as it is at preſent. The <hi>Plafon</hi> compoſed of <hi>Culs de Lampe</hi> (Work in the Ceiling ſwelling down with knobs) was heret fore eſteemed as an excellent piece of Work; but time has decayed a great part of that which made it eſteem'd. This is the Room
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62624:175"/>
where all the Parliament aſſemble when the King comes hither to ſit on his Tribunal of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or at ſuch times when there is any great Affair for them to deliberate upon. In this place alſo the Dukes and Peers of <hi>France</hi> come and demand to have their Patents Regiſter'd, which they obtain'd of the King, for the Erection of their Dignities. The other Chambers are much handſomer than this, and in ſome of them the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fons</hi> (or Ceilings) are gilt and painted very richly. The 2<hi>d.</hi> and 3<hi>d.</hi> Chambers of Inqueſts, and the Chambers of Requeſts are the beſt adorn'd.</p>

               <p>OF all the Monuments of Piety which St. <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> raiſed, there is none more beautiful or more magnificent than this. Who making his uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al aboad in this Palace, cauſed this Chapel to be erected for the conveniency of his own Devotion. In the ſame place where it now ſtands there was formerly a ſmall Church Founded by King <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> under the title of <hi>The Adoration of three Kings,</hi> in which Church <hi>Robert</hi> his Son did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute an Order of Knights, called <hi>Knights of the Star.</hi> This Order was of great Reputation in the beginning of its Inſtitution, and the greateſt Lords accepted of the Collar. But in proceſs of time it became ſo vilified, that it came to be confer'd on the Town Watch, who go about in the Night time to prevent diſorders, that might happen in the Streets from Thieves and Robbers. From whence it comes, that at this day, the Captain who commands that Watch is called the <hi>Chevalier du Guet</hi> (the Knight of the Watch). This little Chapel remain'd in ſuch Eſtate till the time of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> who built the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62624:176"/>
Structure which we now ſee, a building of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Delicacy. The Vaults are very high, and the Windows of it paſs for the handſomeſt that can be ſeen, by reaſon of their bigneſs and almoſt infinite Variety of Colours, repreſenting ſome particular Hiſtory of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, the Glaſs of which is of ſuch thickneſs, that it hath reſiſted the injuries of time down to this day. This beautiful Work was but five years in doingand was finiſht in the year 1247. In a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time after which, they brought hither the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques which are kept here. Theſe were redeem'd by that holy King out of the hands of the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to whom <hi>Baldwin</hi> Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> had engaged them for a very conſiderable Summ of Money, which they lent him to carry on his War againſt the <hi>Bulgarians.</hi> This Redemption of theſe precious Pawns by St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> was not done without the Emperors knowledge and conſent to take them, upon paying to the <hi>Venetians</hi> the Moneys for which they were engaged. They were as follows, A great piece of Wood, part of the true Croſs; our Lord's Crown of Thorns, and certain drops of his precious Blood; ſome of the Cloths which belonged to his Infancy; another piece of the true Croſs, ſome Blood which bled Miraculouſly from an Image of our Lord ſtruck by an Infidel; one link of Iron, part of the Chain wherewith he was bound; the Napkin or Towel with which he waſhed his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Feet; a piece of the Stone of his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; ſome of the Holy Virgins Milk; the Iron head of the Lance that pierced our Lord's ſide; the Purple Robe with which they Clothed him; the Spunge which they uſed in giving him Vinegar and Gall to Drink; a piece of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62624:177"/>
Shroud in which he was wrapped: Together with theſe things there is kept in the ſame Treaſury, a Croſs which our Anceſtors uſed to carry with the <hi>Oriflame,</hi> which is at St. <hi>Denis,</hi> when they marched out to any Wars of Conſequence, which Croſs was call'd on that account <hi>The Croſs of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph;</hi> and many other things beſide, as <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod; the upper part of St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Head: all which things are encloſed in the great Shrine of Copper gilt, which you ſee raiſed upon four Pillars, ſupporting a little Vault behind the great Altar: But with the ſight of theſe things one muſt not expect to ſatisfie his curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, for theſe precious Reliques hardly ever are expoſed, but when ſome Queen deſires to ſee them, which happens very rarely. Upon the great Altar, in a kind of Tabernacle or Box of Wood, gilt and powder'd with Flowers-de-Lis, is the model of the Holy Chapel in little of Silver gilt, and of moſt excellent Workmanſhip, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richt with Stones of conſiderable value. It is ſhew'd only on Feſtival Days. There are alſo in the Sacriſty other things to be ſeen that are very rare, eſpecially a great number of Reliquaries of Gold and Silver; a great Croſs all of Gold, in which is encloſed a piece of the Wood of the true Croſs, which is expoſed every Friday in <hi>Lent.</hi> You may here alſo ſee the Chanters Staff, on the top of which is placed a great Agate, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing St. <hi>Lewis</hi> to the Waſt, holding in one hand a little Croſs, and in the other our Lord's Crown of Thorns. Here are alſo ſeveral Books whoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are enricht with great Pearls and precious Stones.</p>
               <p>But that which is extraordinary rare is a great antique Oriental Agate, very fine, of Figure
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62624:177"/>
almoſt Oval, a little bigger than an ordinary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trencher-Plate; it is cut in Bas-relief, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the <hi>Apotheoſis</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip is really moſt admirable, by reaſon that the deſign is ſo contrived, that the Natural Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the Stone ſerve for Shadows in their proper places, where they ſhould be according to Art, and make the ſame effect as if the Work of the Pencil. Monſieur <hi>de St. Avant,</hi> a Famous Antiquary, hath explain'd all the Figures in this Piece, and diſcovered to us very curious things, which may be read in his great Treatiſe of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals. This fair Agate was a Preſent made by an Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> VI. in order to obtain ſome Succors from him againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> but this he could not have, by reaſon of thoſe Troubles which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> then cauſed in this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Ornaments of the Altar in this Church are magnificent, eſpecially thoſe which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the Feaſt of <hi>St. Lewis,</hi> whoſe Head you ſee of Silver gilt ſupported by two Angels of the ſame materials formerly kept in the Treaſury of St. <hi>Denis.</hi> As you go out you ought to obſerve a handſom Figure of our Lady of Pity, placed under the Organs on the left hand as you enter; 'tis the Work of the famous <hi>Germain Pilon,</hi> who lies buried in the lower Holy Chapel: this is eſteemed as one of his beſt pieces. The Chapter of this Church is not numerous, yet are the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons places of a good Revenue and enjoy fair Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges. They have for their Superiour a Treaſurer, whoſe place is double the Revenue of the other Canons. The Abby of St. <hi>Nicaiſe</hi> at <hi>Reins,</hi> worth 3000.

               <p>I might here name many other Learned Men, who have drawn great Light for Hiſtory out of the <hi>Chamber of Accounts;</hi> among others the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs <hi>Godefroy,</hi> who have made publick a great many of our old Hiſtorians, now lately Printed at the Royal Preſs in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> with excellent Commentaries at the end.

Man, they may be read in <hi>French,</hi> Tranſlated with all the Elegancy and Fidelity that can be expected, in a piece writ on purpoſe for the Language only.

               <p>In the middle of this Bridge are erected two Machins, which draw up the River Water for the uſe of thoſe Quarters of the Town which are far diſtant.

               <p>THis is the next Bridge to the <hi>Pont-Neuf.</hi> It has this name becauſe formerly there were a great many Money-Changers, or Banckers, who inhabited the Houſes on this Bridge, and made a kind of Exchange or <hi>Bource</hi> in this place. It has been alſo formerly called the <hi>Pont aux Oiſeaux,</hi> or Bridge of Birds, becauſe no doubt of Birdſellers here dwelling. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Year 1629, burnt down by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Fire, it being then of Wood, it was afterwards rebuilt of Freeſtone, as we now ſee it, with ſo much ſolidity, that they have erected upon it two Rows of double Houſes
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62624:182"/>
four Stories high, all of them arched with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. Theſe Houſes are inhabited by Traders, who have their Warehouſes on the ſide next the Water, and their Shops in the forepart. This Bridge has the moſt Paſſengers of all in <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Palais</hi> which ſtands at the end of it.</p>
               <p>At one end, over a houſe which fronts the Bridge, you may ſee the King's Statue about the Age of 10. years old, Crown'd with Laurel by the Figure of a Victory. This Statue is raiſed on a little Pedeſtal; and on each ſide of it are the Statues of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13<hi>th.</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> as big as the Life, in Braſs. Theſe Statues are very well deſign'd, and very like.</p>
               <p>The Key or Wharf, called <hi>Qua de Geſvers,</hi> leads from this Bridge, to the Bridge of <hi>Noſtre-Dame,</hi> under cover all the way. It is ſupported by Vaults, whoſe Foundation is in the River, of a ſort of Work extraordinary hardy, thoſe who affect ſuch things ought to go down and obſerve it.</p>
               <p>At the other end of the <hi>Pont au Change,</hi> at the Corner of the <hi>Quay de Morfondus,</hi> is the Clock belonging to the <hi>Palais;</hi> the Dyal of which is adorned with certain figures of one of the moſt famous Sculptors of the laſt age.

               <p>The <hi>Pont St. Michel</hi> is alſo near the <hi>Palais'</hi> and oppoſite to the <hi>Pont au Change.</hi> It takes its name from the little Church of St. <hi>Michel,</hi> which ſtands within the Incloſure of the <hi>Palais;</hi> or perhaps becauſe it leads to the Gate of that name, which once ſtood at the upper end of the <hi>Ruë de la Harpe,</hi> and was not long ſince demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, as we have already ſaid in the page of this Second Part. This Bridge is alſo built upon; the Houſes are of Brick and Freeſtone. Formerly it was of Timber only, like thoſe of which we have already ſpoken; but it being broke down by a high flood, in the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. it was in a little time after re-built as we now ſee it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Petit Pont,</hi> one of the oldeſt Bridges of <hi>Paris,</hi> is on the ſame arm of the River that runs under the <hi>Pont St. Michel;</hi> the Houſes on each ſide of it and the <hi>Little Châtelet</hi> at the end of it, hinders you from perceiving that you go over Water when you paſs this way.</p>
               <p>Within the limits of the <hi>Hôtel Dieu,</hi> are two other Bridges built: One of which is wholly belonging to that Hoſpital, the other is partly uſed for a conveniency of paſſage on foot to the Church of <hi>Nôtre-Dame,</hi> every one that goes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that way paying a <hi>Double</hi> for paſſage.

               <p>IN fine, we are now arrived at the laſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of this Deſcription, which cannot be better concluded than with the <hi>Pont-Neuf,</hi> from which one may diſcover part of the moſt magnificent objects of all <hi>Paris.</hi> The <hi>Pont-Neuf</hi> was begun under <hi>Henry III.</hi> who laid the firſt Foundation in the Year 1578. and gave the conduct of the Work to a famous Architect, named <hi>du Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceau.</hi> That King being accompanied with <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine de Medicis,</hi> his Mother, (who as ſome ſay did firſt think of this great Work) the Queen his Wife, and with all the illuſtrious Perſons of his Court, at that time laid the firſt Stone, with a great Show and Ceremony, upon which Stone this Inſcription is graved:</p>

                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:62624:183"/>
They began the Work with much eagerneſs at that end next the <hi>Great Auguſtins;</hi> but the Troubles of that King's Reign prevented this great Enterpriſe from being finiſh'd in his time. It remained imperfect from its firſt undertaking in the Year 1578, as I have ſaid, till the Year 1604, when <hi>Henry the Great,</hi> of happy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, compleated the Work, by the means of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Marchand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is obſervable that this Bridge is one of the moſt beautiful that can be ſeen for its length, which extends over the two arms of the <hi>Seine,</hi> which unite here into one Channel; for its breadth, which is divided into three ways, one in the midſt for Coaches and great Carriages, and two on each ſide raiſed higher for thoſe who go on foot; and laſtly for its ſtructure, which is of ſuch ſolidity and of ſuch an ordinance, that has but few equals.</p>
               <p>Among theſe advantages one may alſo add the delicate Proſpect which the Paſſenger has from it: A view which paſſes for one of the moſt pleaſing and fineſt of the World; and if we may believe thoſe who have ſeen foreign parts, and the report of one of the greateſt Travellers in this age, he tells us, That he never obſerved any Proſpect more magnificent, naming this for the third of thoſe which he hath obſerved, to wit, That of the Port at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> that of the Port at <hi>Goa</hi> in the <hi>Indies;</hi> and this of the <hi>Pont-Neuf</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> which extends on one ſide over the <hi>Louvre</hi> which runs along the <hi>Seine,</hi> with a long row of magnificent buildings; and on the other ſide the <hi>Hôtel de Conti,</hi> the Colledge of the <hi>Quatre-Nations,</hi> which is very remarkable for its Dome, and for the two great ſquare
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62624:184"/>
Pavillions which ſtand before it; and in fine, for many other great Houſes which extend a great way, with the <hi>Cours de la Reine,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines this Proſpect, and Mount <hi>Valerien</hi> which appears over all; which Views altogether make a moſt beautiful Proſpective as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend into a Landskip. I ſay nothing of the continual preſs of People paſſing over this Bridge, by which one may gueſs at the infinite number of Inhabitants in <hi>Paris.</hi>

                  <hi>The</hi> Statue <hi>of</hi> HENRY IV.</head>
               <p>THis Monument ſtands at the middle of the <hi>Pont-Neuf,</hi> at the corner of the <hi>Iſle du Palais:</hi> It was ſet up in the Year 1635, by <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. to the memory of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. who is repreſented on Horſe-back, as big as the life, all of Braſs, and raiſed upon a Pedeſtal of White Marble; where the principal Actions of that great King are repreſented in <hi>Bas-Reliefs</hi> of the ſame Metal alſo, theſe are placed two and two of every ſide. At the four corners of the Pedeſtal are placed four Slaves of Braſs alſo, treading upon certain Antique Arms, All theſe pieces, except the Horſe, were deſigned and caſt by one named <hi>Francheville,</hi> originally of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray;</hi> who was eſteemed as one of the beſt Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptors of his time, of whoſe hand you may ſee ſeveral other Works, much eſteemed: among others, the Marble Statue repreſenting Truth, in the <hi>Tuilleries.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:62624:184"/>
But the Curious will not be offended perhaps if I ſet down here the particular Hiſtory of the Horſe, which was made in <hi>Italy</hi> by the famous <hi>John de Bologne,</hi> or as the Painters commonly call him, <hi>Bologneſs. Coſmus</hi> the Second, great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> gave it as a Preſent to <hi>Mary de Medicis,</hi> during her Regency, <hi>Lewis the</hi> 13<hi>th.</hi> being then under Age.</p>
               <p>The Chevalier <hi>Peſcholini,</hi> was appointed to come into <hi>France</hi> to Preſent this Horſe, in the name of the great Duke <hi>Coſmus</hi> the Second. The care of Imbarking at <hi>Legorn</hi> was committed to him; but it met with ſeveral accidents at Sea: A horrible Tempeſt forced the Veſſel, in which it was, with ſo much impetuoſity againſt a Bank of Sand, that it was Wrackt, and all its Freight loſt; however this Statue was recover'd from the Sea, with much pains and coſt, and once again it was Shipt in another Veſſel; this laſt unhappily met with Pirates on the Coaſt of <hi>Spain;</hi> but in fine, after all theſe Troubles and Labour, it arrived at <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> 1615. And on the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> following, King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13<hi>th.</hi> laid the firſt Stone of the Pedeſtal, accompanied with Monſienr <hi>de Liancourt</hi> Governor of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſeveral other Perſons of Quality. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Ornaments and all the outward parts of the Work were not quite finiſht, till the Year 1635.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, that Poſterity may be fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed of all that paſt, the Inſcriptions on the four ſides of the Pedeſtal were not thought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient alone; they writ another upon Vellom, which they incloſed in a Pipe of Lead, and put that into the Belly of the Horſe, which they
