            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving paſt the greateſt part of my long Exile at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> one of the fineſt Cities in the World, whoſe Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are deſervedly Famous, for their extraordinary Civilities to Strangers, of which I must acknowledge to have receiv'd a great many from them: I did, during that time, Publiſh, in <hi>French,</hi> a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Horſe-manſhip;</hi> and having again, ſince my Return to my Native Country, had much leiſure, in my ſolitary Country Life, to recollect my Thoughts, and try new Experiments about that <hi>Art;</hi> I now, for the more particular Satisfaction of my Country-men, Print this ſecond <hi>Book,</hi> in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Tranſlation of the firſt, nor an abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:52970:4"/>
Addition to it, may be of uſe by it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, as the other hath been hitherto, and is ſtill, without this; but both together will queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs do beſt.</p>
            <p>I cannot mention <hi>Antwerp,</hi> upon the ſcore of my <hi>Book,</hi> but I muſt alſo take notice of the Honour I have receiv'd there, from many Noble great Perſons, who did me the favour to ſee my <hi>Mannage;</hi> and of the things they was pleaſed to ſay, upon occaſion of what they ſaw there; which will be in lieu of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums,</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Horſes,</hi> and of <hi>Horſe-manſhip,</hi> very proper in this place.</p>
            <p>When I had the honour to wait on <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> brought to him by my Lord of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> his Highneſs was pleaſ'd to uſe me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Civilly; and to ask both then, and at ſeveral other times, for my <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Horſe-manſhip,</hi> before it was Printed; and to receive it with great Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, when I preſented his Highneſs with One: But he did not ſee my <hi>Horſes,</hi> which, in above <hi>20.</hi> Coaches, all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of his Court, went to my <hi>Mannage</hi> to ſee; with many Noble-Men of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> as the Duke of <hi>Aſcot,</hi> and others, before
<pb facs="tcp:52970:4"/>
whom I <hi>Rid</hi> my ſelf, three <hi>Horſes,</hi> and my Eſquier, five. Being return'd to <hi>Don John,</hi> He ask'd them, <hi>Whether my</hi> Horſes was as Rare, as their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation was Great:</hi> To which they anſwer'd, <hi>That my</hi> Horſes <hi>was ſuch, that they wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Reaſonable Creatures, but Speaking.</hi> And the Marqueſs of <hi>Seralvo,</hi> Master of the <hi>Horſe</hi> to his Highneſs, and Governour of the Caſtle of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> told his Highneſs, <hi>That he had ask'd me, What</hi> Horſes <hi>I lik'd beſt: And that I had anſwer'd, There were Good and Bad of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but that the</hi> Barbes <hi>were the Gentlemen of</hi> Horſe-kind, <hi>and</hi> Spaniſh-Horſes <hi>the Princes.</hi> Which Anſwer did infinitely pleaſe the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> And it is very true, That <hi>Horſes</hi> are ſo as I ſaid.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Caraſena</hi> was ſo civilly earneſt to ſee me <hi>Ride,</hi> that he was pleaſ'd to ſay, <hi>It would be a great Satisfaction to him, to ſee me on Horſe-back, though the</hi> Horſe <hi>ſhould but Walk.</hi> And ſeeing that no Excuſes would ſerve, (though I did uſe many) I was contented to ſatisfie his ſo obliging a Curioſity; and told him, <hi>I would obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, though I thought I ſhould hardly be able
<pb facs="tcp:52970:5"/>
to Sit in the Saddle.</hi> Two dayes after he came to my <hi>Mannage,</hi> and I <hi>Rid</hi> firſt a <hi>Spaniſh-Horſe,</hi> called <hi>Le Superbe,</hi> of a <hi>Light-Bay,</hi> a beautiful <hi>Horſe;</hi> and though Hard to be <hi>Rid,</hi> yet when he was Hitt Right, he was the <hi>Readieſt Horſe</hi> in the World: He went in <hi>Corvets</hi> forward, backward, ſidewayes, on both Hands; made the <hi>Croſs</hi> perfectly upon his <hi>Voltoes;</hi> and did <hi>Change</hi> upon his <hi>Voltoes</hi> ſo Juſt, without breaking Time, that no <hi>Muſitian</hi> could keep Time better; and went <hi>Terra a Terra</hi> Perfectly. The ſecond <hi>Horſe</hi> I <hi>Rid,</hi> was another <hi>Spaniſh Horſe,</hi> call'd <hi>Le Genty;</hi> and was Rightly named ſo, for he was the fineſt Shap'd <hi>Horſe</hi> that ever I ſaw, and the neateſt; A <hi>Brown-Bay,</hi> with a <hi>White-Star</hi> in his <hi>Forehead;</hi> No <hi>Horſe</hi> ever went <hi>Terra a Terra</hi> like him, ſo juſt, and ſo eaſie; And for the <hi>Piroyte</hi> in his <hi>Length,</hi> ſo juſt, and ſo ſwift, that the Standers by could hardly ſee the <hi>Rider</hi>'s Face when he went; And truly, when he had done, I was ſo Dizzey, that I could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sit in the <hi>Saddle:</hi> He went alſo ſo exactly in <hi>Corvets</hi> forwards, as no <hi>Horſe</hi> can goe better, and yet he had no great <hi>Strength;</hi> whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb facs="tcp:52970:5"/>
That a <hi>Horſe</hi> of <hi>Agility, Lightneſs, Spirit, Well-temper'd,</hi> and of a <hi>good Diſpoſition,</hi> is much better than a <hi>Horſe</hi> that hath only <hi>Strength;</hi> And that a moſt mighty and great <hi>Dutch-Brewer's Horſe,</hi> wanting <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Agility,</hi> can never goe well in the <hi>Mannage.</hi> The third and laſt <hi>Horſe</hi> I <hi>Rid</hi> then, was a <hi>Barbe,</hi> that went a <hi>Metz-Ayre,</hi> very High, both <hi>Forward,</hi> and upon his <hi>Voltoes,</hi> and <hi>Terra a Terra.</hi> And when I had done <hi>Riding,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Caraſena</hi> ſeem'd to be very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; and ſome <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were with him, croſs'd themſelves, and cried, <hi>Miraculo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen, and Perſons of the greateſt Quality of that Nation, did me the favour to ſee my <hi>Horſes;</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> himſelf, with ſeveral Noble-men, and Officers, was pleaſed to take the pains to goe twice to my <hi>Mannage:</hi> And though the <hi>French</hi> think, That all the <hi>Horſe-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> in the World is in <hi>France;</hi> yet one of them, and he a very great Man in his Country, was heard ſay, directing his Speech to me: <hi>Par Dieu (Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur) il eſt bien hardi qui monte devant vous</hi>: And another ſaid, at another time: <hi>Il n'y a plus de Segnieur comme vous en Angleterre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52970:6"/>Among many great Perſons, of which the vaſt Country of <hi>Germany</hi> affords abundance, who, for the moſt part, delight to travel; the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> did not only do me the honour to Viſit me, and ſee my <hi>Horſes;</hi> but, being return'd to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was pleaſed to ſhew, by a very kind Letter, That he had not forgotten me, nor the Love he had obſerved I have for <hi>Horſes;</hi> being pleaſed to promiſe, He would ſend me two of his own Breed; but ſoon after, he was Kill'd in the Warrs the King of <hi>Swede</hi> made with the King of <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As poor as I was in thoſe dayes, I made ſhift to buy, at ſeveral times, four <hi>Barbes,</hi> five <hi>Spaniſh-Horſes,</hi> and many <hi>Dutch-Horſes;</hi> all the moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Horſes</hi> that could be; and among them a <hi>Grey Leaping-Horſe,</hi> the moſt beautiful that ever I ſaw; and who went exceeding High and Juſt in <hi>Leaps,</hi> without any <hi>Help</hi> at all; as alſo upon the <hi>Ground;</hi> and <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> beyond all other <hi>Horſes;</hi> and he did look as if he had been above the Rate of <hi>Horſe-kind.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> hearing of him, Two Gentlemen, a <hi>French-Rider,</hi> and an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> wrote to me, <hi>That if I would part with him, the Duke of</hi> Guiſe <hi>would give me 600. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolls
<pb facs="tcp:52970:6"/>
for him</hi>; but he was Dead three dayes before I receiv'd their Letter; and had he Liv'd, I would not have taken any <hi>Money</hi> for him; for he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Price: And beſides, I was then too great a <hi>Beggar,</hi> to think to be made Rich by the Sale of a Horſe: I have beſtow'd many Thouſands of Pounds in <hi>Horſes,</hi> and have given many; but never was a good <hi>Horſe-Courſer; Selling</hi> being none of my <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</hi>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> brought an <hi>Italian</hi> Rider, one <hi>Signior Romano,</hi> to teach his Nephew <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> afterwards <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Pembrook</hi>; and the ſame Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> brought alſo over an other <hi>Italian Rider,</hi> call'd <hi>Signior Proſpero:</hi> The old <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> ſent for an Excellent <hi>Rider</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> call'd <hi>Signior Claudio Curtio,</hi> who writ a Book of <hi>Horſe-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and is quoted by ſeveral <hi>Italian</hi> Writers; but I think, that very much of his Book is ſtolen out of <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

purpoſe; though they ſeem to be Great Curioſities. But the moſt Famous man that ever was in <hi>Italy,</hi> was at <hi>Naples,</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> call'd <hi>Signior Pignatel</hi>; but he never Writ: <hi>Monſieur La Broue</hi> Rid under him five years: <hi>Monſieur De Pluvinel</hi> nine years: And <hi>Monſieur St. Anthoine</hi> many years. The <hi>Liberty,</hi> which is the beſt for <hi>Bitts,</hi> at this Day, we call <hi>A La Pignatel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe three aforementioned <hi>French-men</hi> that Rid under <hi>Signior Pignatel,</hi> fill'd <hi>France</hi> with <hi>French Horſe-men</hi>; which before were fill'd with <hi>Italians. Monſieur La Broue,</hi> I believe, was the Firſt that ever Writ of <hi>Horſe-manſhip,</hi> in the <hi>French Language</hi>: and the firſt <hi>French-man</hi> that ever Writ in that Art; His Book is very Tedious, many <hi>Words</hi> for little <hi>Matter</hi>; and his firſt Book is abſolutely all Stolen out of <hi>Griſon</hi>; and his ſecond Book from <hi>Signior Pignatell</hi>'s <hi>Leſſons</hi>; But <hi>La Broue,</hi> to ſeem wiſer than he was, and to make up a Book, divides a Circle into ſo many parts, to bring a <hi>Horſe</hi> to a whole Circle, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds a <hi>Horſe</hi> more, and is harder for him, than to Work him upon a whole Circle at firſt: And for <hi>La Broue</hi>'s third Book of <hi>Bitts,</hi> there is no great
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52970:9"/>
Matter in it. As for <hi>Pluvinel,</hi> no doubt but he was a Good <hi>Horſe-man</hi>; but his Invention of the <hi>Three Pillars,</hi> of which his Book Pretends to be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Method, is no more than an abſolute <hi>Routine</hi>; and hath ſpoyl'd more <hi>Horſes,</hi> than ever any Thing did; for <hi>Horſes</hi> are not Made to the Hand and the Heel at all with them; nor will they go from the uſual place where they are Ridden, nor well there neither. But my Book is ſtolen out of no Book, nor any mans Practice but my own, and is as True as it is New; and if any Man do not like it, it is a great Signe he underſtands it not: for there is no way for Dreſſing <hi>Horſes</hi> like it; If it be not Good, I am ſure it is the Beſt that hath been VVrit yet; what will be VVrit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I know not.</p>
                  <p>I muſt tell you that the <hi>Italian</hi> Writers are Tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and write more of Marks, Colours, Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Elements, Moon, Stars, Winds, and Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, than of the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Rideing</hi>; only to make up a Book, though they wanted <hi>Horſe-manſhip.</hi>

                  <p>MAny ſay, that all things in the <hi>Mannage</hi> is nothing but Tricks, and Dancing, and Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls, and of no Uſe: But by their Leave, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſayes ſo, is very much Deceived; for a <hi>Horſe</hi> that is well ſettled upon the Hand, and firm
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52970:10"/>
and Obedient to the Hand and Heels, Gallops the Field, and Changes as often, and juſt as you will, either without the Circle, or within the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>Serpiger, Terra a Terra,</hi> the <hi>Piroite,</hi> or what you will; and all is this upon the <hi>Ground,</hi> and every thing and <hi>Particle</hi> of it Uſeful; and ſo Uſeful, that a Good <hi>Horſe-man,</hi> upon ſuch a Horſe, would have too much Advantage, in Conſcience, of him that Talks againſt it, either in a ſingle Combat, or in the VVarrs; for <hi>A Ready-Horſe</hi> will Run, Stop, Turn, go Back; and if he Riſe, he knows how to come Down again, and is ſo well on the Hand, as you cannot pull him Over with both your Hands; and ſo Obedient, that I will Run him on Fire, Water, or Sword, and he ſhall Obey me: And all This cannot be done but by the Art of <hi>Ride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and that in the <hi>Mannage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, What makes theſe <hi>Men</hi> ſpeak againſt it? The firſt Reaſon, is, Becauſe they are Ignorant, and ſo ſpeak, as the Wiſeſt men in the world muſt do, when they will ſpeak of any thing they Know not, and think that <hi>Talk</hi> will carry it: But the <hi>Main Reaſon</hi> is this; They find they cannot <hi>Ride</hi> well;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52970:10"/>
nay, indeed not at all, <hi>A Horſe</hi> of <hi>Mannage,</hi> and they would be the Fineſt men in the world, for All things, though they will take Pains for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and becauſe, forſooth, they cannot Ride by Inſpiration, without taking Pains, therefore it is worth Nothing, and of no Uſe: But if every thing was Naught that they cannot do, there would be very few things Good in the World.</p>
                  <p>The next thing, is, That they think it a Diſgrace for a Gentleman to do any thing Well. What! Be a <hi>Rider.</hi> Why not? Many Kings and Princes think themſelves Graced with being Good <hi>Horſe-men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Gracious and moſt Excellent KING, is not only the Handſomeſt, and moſt Comely <hi>Horſe-man</hi> in the World, but as Knowing and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the Art as any man; and no man makes a Horſe go Better than I have ſeen ſome go under His MAJESTY the firſt time that ever He came upon their Backs, which is the Height and Quinteſcence of the Art; and yet I dare ſay the KING takes it for no Diſgrace to be ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a <hi>Horſe-man:</hi> The Duke of <hi>YORK</hi> is alſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52970:11"/>
a very Good <hi>Horſe-man,</hi> and Both take it for an Honour, and no Diſgrace; and think it a moſt uſeful and noble Quality for Princes.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Mommorancy,</hi> Coneſtable of <hi>France,</hi> and the firſt Gentleman of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> was the Beſt <hi>Horſe-man</hi> in the World, and to this day the beſt <hi>Branches</hi> for Bitts was of his Invention, called <hi>A La Coneſtable</hi>; and ſo he Deviſed the Beſt Spurrs; and never any <hi>Eſquier</hi> Ridd like him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certainly the Beſt <hi>Horſe-man</hi> in the World, which he thought a Grace to him: The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> his Grand-childe by the Princeſs his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is an Excellent <hi>Horſe-man,</hi> and thinks it no Diſgrace to him.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of the Princes in <hi>France</hi> highly Eſteem it, and are good <hi>Horſe-men:</hi> nay, their King, at this preſent time, highly Eſteems it, and is a Good <hi>Horſe-man</hi>; nor is any Gentleman in <hi>France</hi> Eſteem'd that is not a good <hi>Horſe-man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great King of <hi>Spain</hi> Deceaſed, did not only Love it, and Underſtand it, but was abſolutely the Beſt <hi>Horſe-man</hi> in all <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I may therefore deſire Theſe men to be more
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52970:11"/>
                     <hi>Merciful,</hi> and to think it no Diſgrace, to Them, to be <hi>Horſe-men</hi>; but ſtill the Old buſineſs will ſtick with them, which is, They cannot do it, and therefore it is Naught: A very good and ſenſleſs Reaſon! He that will take Pains for Nothing, ſhall never do any thing VVell; for Arts, Sciences, and good Qualities, come not by Inſtinct, but are got by great Labour, Study, and Practice; wherefore <hi>Theſe Men</hi> will none (I thank you) till they be as Eaſily learnt, as the <hi>Seven Deadly Sins, Railing,</hi> and wearing <hi>Fine Cloaths</hi> and <hi>Feathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us ſee now, how <hi>Theſe Men</hi> are on Horſe-back, and what their Horſes do under them. This <hi>Cavalier</hi> Seats as far Back in the Sadle as he can, his Leggs ſtretcht as far Forward before the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Horſe, with his Toes out, that he may Spur him in the Shoulders; and Stoops in the Back, which they call a Comely Seat; not Knowing how to hold the Bridle in his Hand, nor Gheſs at any Helps at all; and appears on Horſe-back as if he were three quarters Foxt, ſo Ridiculous is that Seat: and having Sent to a Sadler, or a Bitt-maker, to Bitt his Horſe, all is Well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52970:12"/>Being Mounted thus, as I tell you, you ſhall ſee his Ready <hi>Horſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> and his <hi>Horſe-manſhip:</hi> When he would Turn him on the Right Hand, the Horſe doth Turn on the Left; and when he would Turn him on the Left Hand, the Horſe doth Turn on the Right: When he would Stop him, the Horſe runs Away: When he would Put him Forward, the Horſe runs Backward: When he would Put him Back, the Horſe Riſes, and comes Over with him, and there the Good <hi>Horſe-man</hi> Lies, and muſt ſend for a Surgion, or a Bone-Setter, if he be not Kill'd: Nay, his Horſe ſhall neither come neer Drum, Trumpet, or Colours, Piſtol, or Sword; but he fetches Forty Figaries to Endanger him and his Horſe: And this is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Horſe-man,</hi> and the Ready <hi>Horſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> How is it Poſſible to be Otherwiſe, when the Horſe knows not how to Obey either Hand or Heell, and the <hi>Horſe-man</hi> is as Ignorant as he? Whence it followes, That there is Nothing to make a Sure Horſe, but the <hi>Mannage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would have every <hi>Horſe</hi> (that wears a Bitt) Gelding, or Nagg, wrought in the <hi>Mannage,</hi> to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52970:12"/>
be firm on the Hand, both for Readineſs, and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were it for a <hi>B: B: Judge,</hi> or <hi>Lady</hi>: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſetling of the Hand, they are very Unuſeful, and Dangerous.</p>
                  <p>I wonder how men are ſo Preſumptious, to think they can Ride as <hi>Horſe-men,</hi> becauſe they can Ride forward from <hi>Barnet</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> which every body can do; and I have ſeen VVomen to <hi>Ride</hi> Aſtride as well as they: They do not think of any Art, or Trade, as they do of <hi>Horſe-manſhip,</hi> where they are all <hi>Maſters</hi>: Which doth not Prove ſo, when they <hi>Ride.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I think I have Proved ſufficiently their Errour, and Ignorance; and as fully Proved, That there is no <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Horſe</hi> but thoſe that are <hi>Made</hi> in the <hi>Mannage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next thing, is, to tell you, That <hi>Corvets,</hi> and other <hi>Ayres,</hi> ſettles a Horſe very well upon the Hand; makes him Leight before, and puts him upon the Hanches, which are all Uſeful for a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Horſe; and makes him Stop upon the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which is very Uſeful for a man in Armes; for, did the Horſe ſtop upon the Shoulders, he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52970:13"/>
would give his <hi>Rider</hi> (being Armed) ſuch a Shock as would make his Bones Ake, was he never ſo Sound: Nay, to make a <hi>Horſe</hi> go in Leaps, firms him on the Hand, which is Good for a Souldiers Horſe.</p>
                  <p>But, ſayes a Gallant, when I ſhould have Uſe of him in the Field, then he will be playing Tricks: That Gallant is Deceived; for, the Helps to make Horſes go in <hi>Ayres,</hi> and to make them go upon the <hi>Ground,</hi> are Several; and Good <hi>Horſe-men</hi> have much ado to make them go in <hi>Ayres,</hi> with their beſt Helps; ſo that, if you let them alone, they will not trouble you; beſides, two or three dayes March will make them, that they will not go in <hi>Ayres,</hi> if you would have them; and they are much the Readier to go on the <hi>Ground:</hi> Whereby you ſee, that there is no <hi>Horſe</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be a good and uſeful <hi>Horſe,</hi> in any kind, with a Bitt, but what is Wrought in the <hi>Mannage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore I adviſe you, for your Safety, and Uſe, to Ride all <hi>Horſes</hi> in the <hi>Mannage,</hi> and you will find it very True, That there can be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52970:13"/>
no <hi>Horſe</hi> elſe Safe and Uſeful; nor can any <hi>Horſe</hi> go well in a Snaffle, except he be formerly Ridd with a Bitt.</p>
                  <p>As for Pleaſure and State, What Prince or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch looks more Princely, or more Enthroned, than Upon a Beautiful <hi>Horſe,</hi> with Rich Foot-clothes, or Rich Sadles, and Waving Plumes, making his Entry through Great Cities, to Amaze the People with Pleaſure and Delight?</p>
                  <p>Or, What more Glorious or Manly, than, at great Marriages of Princes, to Run at the Ring, or Tilt, or Courſe at the Field? What can be more Comely or Pleaſing, than to ſee <hi>Horſes</hi> go in all their ſeveral <hi>Ayres</hi>? and to ſee ſo Excellent a Creature, with ſo much Spirit, and Strength, to be ſo Obedient to his <hi>Rider,</hi> as if having no Will but His, they had but one Body, and one Mind, like a <hi>Centaur</hi>? But above all, What ſets Off a King more, than to be on a Beautiful <hi>Horſe</hi> at the Head of his Army?</p>
                  <p>Thus it is Proved, That there is nothing of more Uſe than <hi>A Horſe of Mannage</hi>; nor any thing of more State, Manlineſs, or Pleaſure, than <hi>Ride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52970:14"/>
and as it is the Nobleſt, ſo it is the Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt Exerciſe in the World. In Hunting, Hawking, Bowling, Shooting, Cocking, Cardes and Dice, and many ſuch things, there is no Uſe at all, but meerly Pleaſure: But in <hi>A Horſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,</hi> both Uſe and Pleaſure. It is True, that if there was nothing Commendable but what is Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſtrictly Examined; we muſt have nothing but Hollow Trees for our Houſes, Figg-leaf-Breeches for our Clothes, Acorns for our Meat, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our Drink; for certainly, moſt things elſe are but Superfluities and Curioſities.</p>
                  <p>I find Fault with no mans Delights, and do only Vindicate (with Truth) my own, ſince I have been ſo Preſt to it with odde Diſcourſes; but I leave every one to his own VVayes, and his own Delights, deſiring they will do the like by Me, which I ſhall take for a great Favour: But if it Chances they will not be ſo Gracious, and Juſt to me, it will Grieve me ſo Extreamly, that, in my Conſcience, I ſhall Sleep never the VVorſe.</p>

But they muſt Learn, That a Good <hi>Horſe-man</hi> may be Thrown Down ſooner than Ill ones; becauſe Good <hi>Horſe-men</hi> little think of <hi>Sitting,</hi> and ſo may be Surpriſed, their Thoughts being all how to make their <hi>Horſes</hi> go Well, and never doubt Throwing; whereas an Ill <hi>Horſe-man</hi> thinks of nothing but Sitting, for Fear he ſhould be Thrown, and never thinks how to make his <hi>Horſe</hi> go Well; for he Knows not how to Do it: But Holds by the Main, and the Pomel, and his Head at the <hi>Horſes</hi> Head, ready to Beat out his Teeth,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52970:15"/>
and his Leggs holding by the Flank; and is ſo Deformed on <hi>Horſe Back,</hi> as if he were a Strange <hi>African</hi> Monſter; and the <hi>Horſe</hi> ſo Diſordered, that to ſee him Sit in that <hi>Manner,</hi> is the moſt Nauſeous Sight that can be, and the moſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to the Beholders; and were much Better for the Spectators to ſee him Fall, and for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, ſo he received no Hurt by the Fall.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, That any Groom, or Tinker, may Sit, and yet be no <hi>Horſe-man,</hi> which is a Greater Buſineſs than only Sitting; for a <hi>Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anapes</hi> in <hi>Paris Garden,</hi> when he is Baited with <hi>Muſled Maſtiffs,</hi> the Gentleman Sits very Sure, but not very Comely, and in my Conſcience is no Excellent <hi>Horſe-man</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sitting is but One thing in <hi>Horſe-manſhip,</hi> and there are Thouſands of things in the Art.</p>
                  <p>So if a Good <hi>Horſe-man</hi> be Thrown by Chance, Hath he Loſt all his <hi>Horſe-manſhip,</hi> becauſe he was once Thrown? And is an Ignorant Fellow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired preſently with <hi>Horſe-manſhip,</hi> becauſe he can Ill-favouredly Cling to the Horſe, and Hold on? No, ſitting Faſt is the meaneſt thing in <hi>Horſe-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52970:15"/>
which Comprehends many more of greater Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>But yet I muſt Tell you, I never knew in my Life, a good <hi>Horſe-man</hi> Thrown, but I have known many Preſumptuous ignorant Fellows get Falls; but, as, if a good <hi>Horſe-man</hi> by Chance be Thrown, he doth not Loſe all his <hi>Horſe-manſhip</hi> with that Fall, if he be not Kill'd; ſo an Ignorant man, if he Sits, is not Preſently infuſed with <hi>Horſe-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:</hi> For it is a Miſtake as Ridiculous as it is Common, to take Sitting Faſt on Horſe-back for the whole Art of <hi>Horſe-manſhip.</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52970:16"/>
Hills, to Stop him; which is to Leſs Purpoſe, and more Loſs of Time.</p>
                  <p>They would have a Circle; or Ring, as they call them, of an Acre of ground in Plow'd Land, to make a Horſe go a Hundred Turns in it, which is worſe than to Ride a Journey of Thirty miles; and I wonder what <hi>Horſes</hi> they had in thoſe Dayes; for I am ſure, Thoſe we have now, are not Able to do it.</p>
                  <p>They Teach to Ride one Horſe two or three Hours at a time, when one may well Ride half a Dozen at leaſt in an Hour, and give them ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Enough.</p>
                  <p>For their Single Turns, and Double Turns, call'd <hi>Radopiare,</hi> they are Ridiculous, and ſo is the <hi>Repolone,</hi> which is to Gallop him Half a mile, and then Turn him Ill-favouredly and Falſe: And their Several <hi>Mannages</hi> of <hi>Metzo Tempo, Tutto Tempo,</hi> and <hi>Contratempo,</hi> are no Better.</p>
                  <p>For a <hi>Reſty Horſe</hi> they Raiſe a whole Town with Staves to Beat him, with many Curious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, with <hi>Squirts, Fire, Whelps, Hedg-hoggs, Nailes,</hi> and I know not What. And the ſame they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52970:16"/>
do Before a <hi>Horſe</hi> that Runs Away, as well as to the <hi>Reſty Horſe</hi> Behind.</p>
                  <p>Then for Spurring, the <hi>Bunching Stroke,</hi> and the <hi>Clinching Stroke</hi>; and if he will not Endure the Spurs, <hi>Boots</hi> ſtufft with <hi>Straw,</hi> and <hi>Spurs</hi> at them, to Hang at his Sides, (which is not worth a Straw); and the <hi>Chambetta,</hi> which ſignifies nothing.</p>
                  <p>For a Horſe that is Afraid, and Starts, they appoint <hi>Whirlegiggs</hi> of ſeveral Colours, which will make him Ten times Worſe. And to lay Stones in his Way, and a Hollow Ditch to Ride him in, are Lamentable buſineſſes in <hi>Horſe-manſhip:</hi> And they have as many Fooliſh Wayes for the <hi>Credenſa,</hi> which ſhall never Cure him of that Vice.</p>
                  <p>They Bid us take Heed, by any Means, Not to make the <hi>Horſe</hi> too Weak-Neckt; which is a Prime Note! But Mr. <hi>Blundevile</hi> did not Know, that all Horſes are a Stiff-necked Generation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Pagano</hi> would never Uſe his <hi>Horſe</hi> to any thing but a Walk, or a Trot at the moſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (I am ſure) he ſhall never Dreſs a <hi>Horſe</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; and yet (ſayes Mr. <hi>Blundevile</hi>) it was a

Wonder to all Beholders, to ſee, That in Eight Dayes, he would make him Run a <hi>Carreer</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, which I will Undertake to have done the Firſt Morning that ever he Ran.</p>
                  <p>Speaking of his <hi>Capriole,</hi> he miſtakes the <hi>Ayre,</hi> as well as the making of the <hi>Horſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Corvets,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blundevil</hi> did not Underſtand it (nor his Maſter <hi>Griſon</hi> belike) when he ſayes, The <hi>Spaniards</hi> take Delight to make their <hi>Horſes</hi> go in <hi>Corvets,</hi> which never <hi>Spaniard</hi> yet could do; but he takes <hi>Trampling,</hi> and <hi>Prauncing,</hi> for <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets,</hi> wherein he is much Deceiv'd; for <hi>Corvets</hi> is the Hardeſt <hi>Ayre</hi> in the World, which no <hi>Horſe</hi> can go, unleſs he be perfectly within the Hand, and the Heels, and upon the Hanches; which is not <hi>Trampling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Ride Short, he calls after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Faſhion, wherein he is Deceived; for it is <hi>A La Genette,</hi> which is the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faſhion too; and to Ride Short in <hi>Corvets</hi> is his Miſtake, for I would Ride Longer in <hi>Corvets</hi> than any other <hi>Ayre.</hi> He is alſo Miſtaken, when he ſayes, He would not have above Two <hi>Horſes</hi> in Her <hi>Majeſties</hi> Stable to go
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52970:17"/>
in <hi>Corvets</hi>; for it is of no Uſe (ſaith he) and ſuch Delighting Toyes of <hi>Prauncing</hi> up and down they will do, when they ſhould go upon the Ground: For firſt, There is nothing makes a <hi>Horſe</hi> Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the Hand, than <hi>Corvets,</hi> and that's Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; then, there is nothing puts a <hi>Horſe</hi> ſo much upon the Hanches, and Firms him there, as <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets,</hi> and that is Uſefull too; and Mr. <hi>Blundevil</hi> is mightily Deceived, to think, that he will go in <hi>Corvets,</hi> when he ſhould go upon the <hi>Ground</hi>; for the Helps are ſeveral: And let a Horſe be never ſo Apt, or Perfect in <hi>Corvets,</hi> and made upon the Ground too, (which is the Firſt thing muſt be done) I dare ſay he ſhall never offer at <hi>Corvets</hi> with me, but go juſt upon the <hi>Ground</hi> as I would have him; becauſe the Helps are ſeveral.</p>
                  <p>He ſayes, That in five or ſix Months he can make a <hi>Horſe</hi> to Gallop the Field, (a Neceſſary thing for a Souldiers Horſe); which is no more, as he Underſtands it, than in an Acre of Ground to <hi>Gallop</hi> and <hi>Change,</hi> ſtill upon a <hi>Gallop</hi>; and that I will Undertake to make a <hi>Cart-Horſe</hi> do in three Dayes.</p>

                  <p>For <hi>Mr. Blundevils</hi> Bitts, The are very Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; the Eyes are Naught, the Cheeks as ill, and the Mouths Worſt of all; with Catts Feet, Up-ſets, Portes, and Broken Portes; Catts Feet, and Up-ſets, with a Revet Nayl; and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Bitts, are compleatly Abominable, with their Water-Chain and Trench, the Mouth of the Bitt too being as Bigg as my Wriſt, and the Branches as Long as my Arm; and the Curb as Bigg as a Chain for a Horſe Noſe, with Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries flying Trench, which is a Snaffle tyed to the Bitt, and ſuch other Tormenting ignorant Follies: The Leggs of it are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

the Head; which is Abominable, though he thinks it a Rare Secret. And thus much of Mr. <hi>Blunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> Riding, which is <hi>Griſon</hi> Tranſlated into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blundevils</hi> Breeding, To turn the <hi>Stallion</hi> looſe to the <hi>Mares,</hi> is indifferent Well, but not Right; and to put him to them again at <hi>Holland-Tide,</hi> ſtark Naught. To <hi>Cover</hi> in <hi>Hand</hi> is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and you ſhall not have half of them (ſo <hi>Covered</hi>) prove with <hi>Fole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To have a <hi>Horſe-Fole,</hi> or <hi>Mare-Fole,</hi> by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Right, or Left <hi>Stone</hi>; to Obſerve the Moon, and the Wind, to ſail to <hi>Procreation,</hi> or get a <hi>Fole</hi> by the <hi>Almanack,</hi> is very Ridiculous, and to put Painted Clothes before the <hi>Mares,</hi> to make the <hi>Foles</hi> of what Colour you would have them, is no leſs Ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>That, if the <hi>Horſe,</hi> as ſoon as he hath <hi>Covered,</hi> come Down on the <hi>Right Side,</hi> it is a <hi>Horſe Colt</hi>; and if of the <hi>Left Side,</hi> it is a <hi>Filley:</hi> And if, ſo many Dayes after the <hi>Mare</hi> is <hi>Mounted,</hi> her Coat look Sleek, and Shines, then ſhe hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved; if it do not Shine, ſhe hath not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52970:19"/>
are all <hi>Tales</hi> to <hi>Tell</hi> to <hi>Children,</hi> rather than to <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion</hi>; all <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank-ſhip</hi> and <hi>Fooleries:</hi> and to make the <hi>Horſe</hi> Luſty, and the <hi>Mares,</hi> there is little or nothing in it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blundevil</hi> Reaſons thus: That for as much, as all <hi>Mares</hi> do Fole <hi>Standing.</hi> Wherein cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he took his Note out of ſome Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or the like; for I will Aſſure you, That never any <hi>Mare</hi> in the World did <hi>Fole Standing</hi>: If ſhe did, the <hi>Fole</hi> would break his Neck; For, he comes into the World with his Head firſt, and his two Feet on both ſides of his Head. No! The <hi>Mare</hi> is in too great Pain to <hi>Fole Standing,</hi> and therefore ſhe Lies Down, and <hi>Foles</hi> ſo.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blundevil</hi> ſayes, There is a thing Growes in the <hi>Foles</hi> Fore-head like a <hi>Figg,</hi> which the <hi>Mare</hi> commonly Bites off, which is called <hi>Hippomenes</hi>; and if it be <hi>Taken,</hi> it doth <hi>Miraculous Things</hi> in <hi>Love-Matters,</hi> which he was Loath to Write of. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was Over-careful, with all his <hi>Old Writers</hi>; and, in my Conſcience, if it could be Got, it would
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52970:19"/>
do <hi>Miraculous Things,</hi> not only in <hi>Love,</hi> but in every <hi>Thing</hi> elſe. But the Truth of this Buſineſs, is, That never any ſuch thing did Grow upon any <hi>Foles</hi> Fore-head; and therefore could never be Bitt off by the <hi>Mare.</hi> No doubt but that <hi>Miſtake</hi> is cauſed by the <hi>Secondine,</hi> or <hi>Clean,</hi> or <hi>Bagg,</hi> in which the <hi>Fole</hi> Lies, whereof all the Strings meets at the End, which looks like a little Knot, and that hangs Looſe upon the <hi>Foles</hi> Head; but when the <hi>Fole</hi> is Foled, That, and the Bagg, goes together; for it is all one Thing.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blundevil</hi> bids us take Heed, That the <hi>Mare</hi> do not Eat that <hi>Bagg,</hi> or <hi>Secondine,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Country Wives <hi>Kye</hi> do ſo. But I have Enquired of the Country-Men, and they ſay, Not one <hi>Cow</hi> in a Hundred does do it: And for <hi>Mares,</hi> I will aſſure you, They Never do it: And if you Ask, What they do with it? I ſay, They let it Lie there, and trouble themſelves no more with it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blundevil</hi> condemns thoſe that Take the <hi>Foles,</hi> to be taken Off at <hi>Martlemas</hi>; Becauſe, according to his old Learned Authors, he would
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52970:20"/>
have them Suck two Years at leaſt: That is, he would have them Heavy, Flaby <hi>Jades,</hi> beſides the Loſs of the Fruitfulneſs of his <hi>Mares</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his old Authors are very much deceived.</p>
                  <p>Then he ſayes, That the <hi>Foles Leggs</hi> are as <hi>Long</hi> when they are <hi>Foled,</hi> as ever afterward; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is very much Deceived: Does he think, that the <hi>Body</hi> only Grows, and the <hi>Leggs</hi> not at all? A very Ridiculous Opinion! For, look at the <hi>Foles Leggs,</hi> and the <hi>Mares,</hi> and you ſhall find the <hi>Mares Leggs</hi> are <hi>Longer</hi> a great deal. Can any man think, That a <hi>Gray-Hounds-Whelp,</hi> as ſoon as he is <hi>Whelpt,</hi> hath his <hi>Leggs</hi> as Long as when he is a Dogg? It is Ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>To know, Which <hi>Fole</hi> will have the Beſt Spirit, by Running fore-moſt, and Leaping of Hedges and Rayls; is quite contrary to the Experience I had once of a Colt, that Nothing would keep in, Leaping over all things he came near; and when he came to be Ridd, the Dulleſt Jade that could be.</p>
                  <p>To know by their <hi>Feet,</hi> and much of <hi>White,</hi> That they are not <hi>Long-Lived,</hi> is as falſe a Rule, as any He hath ſet down.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:52970:20"/>His Reckoning <hi>Horſes Teeth,</hi> is beyond the Number of what ever any <hi>Horſe</hi> had; and that every <hi>Horſe</hi> hath two <hi>Tuſhes</hi> Below, and two Above, is, I aſſure you, <hi>True.</hi> Some <hi>Horſes</hi> (ſay they) have no <hi>Tuſhes</hi> at all, and they commonly ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, being ſomething of the <hi>Mare</hi>; but as there is not One in a Hundred but have <hi>Tuſhes,</hi> ſo there is not One <hi>Mare</hi> in a Hundred that have Any; and thoſe that have, are ill-natured, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating too much of the <hi>Horſe</hi>; and both are a kind of <hi>Hermaphroditical</hi> Compoſitions.

                  <p>He ſayes they have ill Feet: It is true, ſome have, and ſo have Horſes of all Countries; <hi>Dutch</hi> the Worſt, and ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> very Bad: He ſayes alſo, <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſes are Weak; but there are more Weak <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſes than <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have Had many <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſes with good Buttocks, good Feet, and Strong; and if ſome ſhould be Weak, yet their Spirits make them go much Better, than any other <hi>Horſes</hi> that are Stronger.</p>
                  <p>He ſayes, They are Gentle in their <hi>Youth,</hi> and grow Vitious in their <hi>Age</hi>: But I aſſure you,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52970:22"/>
there is no ſuch thing; for they are as Gentle in their <hi>Age,</hi> as they are in their <hi>Youth,</hi> and very Loving Horſes: So <hi>Mr. Blundevil</hi> is very much Abuſed by his old Authors whom he Reverences ſo much.</p>
                  <p>He ſayes, The <hi>Gennet</hi> hath a Comely going, like the <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> which is neither <hi>Amble,</hi> nor <hi>Trot.</hi> I would Know of Mr. <hi>Blundevil,</hi> What ſtrange kind of Going that is, which is neither of thoſe Two: But I will aſſure him, That there is no <hi>Horſe,</hi> that hath Four Legs, can go, but it muſt be the Action either of an <hi>Amble,</hi> or of a <hi>Trot</hi>; for <hi>Gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Running,</hi> is another thing, and ſo are all <hi>Ayres</hi> in the <hi>Mannage.</hi> Mr. <hi>Blundevil</hi> appears by this, to be a Better Schollar, than a <hi>Horſe-man</hi>: and was indeed a fine Gentleman, Well Travelled, an Excellent Schollar, a Good Tranſlator, and puts things into an Excellent Method, but Tyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too much to Old Authors, who knew as little as he in <hi>Horſe-manſhip</hi>; and ſo Authority Abuſed him, having no Knowledge himſelf in the Art, and totally wanting Experience in it.</p>
                  <p>His Treaty for <hi>Dyeting</hi> of Horſes, is as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52970:23"/>
Learned as any Phyſitian can Write; but yet is nothing as it Ought to be; for he wanted Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                  <p>His Cures of Diſeaſes are moſt Admirable; and indeed, he is the Father of all that Buſineſs, and the Rareſt that hath Writ upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. <hi>Markham</hi> is but, <hi>Blundevil</hi> with other Names, and will not Acknowledge it: He hath many new Medicines, but they are worth Nothing; as his <hi>Oyle of Oats.</hi> Nor was he a <hi>Horſe-man</hi> at all, but only took Notes of Medicines, and ſet them down <hi>Methodically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After him comes <hi>De La Gray,</hi> which is but, <hi>Blundevil,</hi> with ſome New Medicins that are but Indifferent: And for his <hi>Breeding</hi> of <hi>Horſes,</hi> it is the moſt Ridiculous thing that ever was known Writ.</p>
                  <p>The Beſt <hi>Medicins</hi> of <hi>Mr. Blundevils,</hi> are thoſe of <hi>Martine,</hi> who was Prime <hi>Marſhal</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; And, as I take it, an <hi>Alman,</hi> and an Excellent <hi>Farrier</hi>: Yet, even he, was extreamly Miſtaken about the <hi>Glaunders,</hi> and <hi>Mourning</hi> of the <hi>Chine,</hi> as by my Woful <hi>Experience</hi> in <hi>Horſes</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52970:23"/>
I know, and will better Inform you, when I ſet out my Book of <hi>Marſhalry,</hi> and <hi>Shooing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blundevil</hi> ſayes, That <hi>Barley</hi> makes a <hi>Horſe</hi> Piſs <hi>Red,</hi> like Bloud; but he did not Underſtand it perfectly. It is True; In <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> they Feed their Horſes all with <hi>Barley</hi>; which is, Becauſe they have no <hi>Oats</hi>: For, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Excellent <hi>Oats</hi> is the beſt Feeding for a Horſe in the World. But you muſt Know, that of <hi>Barley</hi> there are Two kinds; The <hi>Common Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> that they make Beer of, which makes a Horſe Piſs a little <hi>Red</hi>; and of that <hi>Barley</hi> they never Give to their Horſes in <hi>Spain,</hi> but of the other <hi>Barley,</hi> which is called by the Name of <hi>Bigg,</hi> and that never makes them Piſs <hi>Red,</hi> and is the beſt Feeding for Horſes, where there Wants <hi>Oats: Rye</hi> Scoure's too Much, and <hi>Wheat</hi> is too Fatning, and Good <hi>Bread</hi> too Purſey, and Foggy. In <hi>Spain</hi> they give <hi>Barley-Straw,</hi> (as my Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> told me;) but firſt; they Tread it with Oxen, and then it is as Soft as Silk. And thus for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Authors, of whom I have told you the Truth.</p>

                  <head>The <hi>Opinion</hi> of a GREAT MASTER.</head>
                  <p>A Great Maſter, held the moſt Excellent <hi>Horſe-man</hi> beyond the <hi>Sea,</hi> being Bred four or five Years under the Beſt <hi>Horſe-man</hi> there, and had Practiced this <hi>Art</hi> from his <hi>Child-Hood,</hi> did me the Honour, To come to <hi>Antwerp</hi> of a Viſit to me from <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and Brought with him four or five <hi>Horſes:</hi> I Treated him the Beſt I could, and ſhewed him my <hi>Horſes,</hi> both Led Out, and Rid.</p>
                  <p>He had a Young Man with him (his <hi>Nephew</hi>) who had Ridd under him for the ſpace of <hi>Seven</hi> Years: And though he had ſeen Rid, before him, the Day afore, Three of the <hi>Readieſt</hi> Horſes that ever I had; yet when he Ridd them, he could not Encounter them, or make them Go at all; and truly, to my Thinking, (I might ſay to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) he had neither <hi>Hand, Heel,</hi> nor <hi>Seat,</hi> as he ſhould have had; and ſo it was impoſſible to make them Go Right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52970:24"/>His Maſter told me, He had found a <hi>New Method</hi> for <hi>Dreſſing of Horſes</hi>: Which was; firſt, Never to <hi>Trot</hi> a Horſe, (that was his <hi>Maxim</hi>:) Next, Never to Uſe the <hi>Cavezon,</hi> nor pull the Horſes Head into the <hi>Turn.</hi> This is, What he would Not have Done: And, What he would have Done, is; To put the <hi>Horſe</hi> to the <hi>Single Pillar,</hi> with a Long Rope, and there Pinch him with the Spurs, which, ſayes he, Puts him upon the Hand: Then to Whip him About with the <hi>Shambriere,</hi> to make him Go half <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> and half in <hi>Corvets,</hi> and then to make him Go in <hi>Corvets</hi>; which ſettles him on the <hi>Hand</hi>: And this is the New Way of Dreſſing; Indeed, of Not Dreſſing <hi>Horſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To take in Pieces, and <hi>Anatomize</hi> this New Way: And firſt, of what he will Not have Done; which is, Never to <hi>Trot</hi> a Horſe, and <hi>Stop</hi> him; which is certainly the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all Things in the <hi>Mannage,</hi> either to ſettle him on the <hi>Hand,</hi> or to put him on the <hi>Hanches.</hi> Next, Never to Uſe the <hi>Cavezon,</hi> without which no <hi>Horſe</hi> can be Dreſt, for many Reaſons. Then,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52970:25"/>
Never to Pull the Horſes Head into the <hi>Turn</hi>: By which means the <hi>Horſes</hi> Leggs, and Body, ſhall never go Right, or ſupple either to <hi>Hand</hi> or <hi>Heel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, of what he will have done to <hi>Work</hi> his <hi>Horſe</hi>: Firſt, To put him to the <hi>Single Pillar,</hi> with a Long Rope, and there <hi>Pinch</hi> him with Spurs; which will do Bravely with a <hi>Colt,</hi> that never knew the Spurs; he will ſurely Throw him rather than be put upon the <hi>Hand</hi>: Nay, a <hi>Horſe</hi> that knows the Spurrs, will never be put upon the <hi>Hand</hi> with that <hi>Invention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then to VVhip him about with the <hi>Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briere,</hi> to make him go half <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> and half <hi>Corvets</hi>; which is impoſſible, for they are two ſeveral <hi>Actions</hi> with his Leggs: Beſides, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Leſſon is in <hi>Pluvinels</hi> Book; which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed, but to a <hi>Horſe</hi> that was <hi>Almoſt Dreſt</hi>; and it is Naught, then: Put him in <hi>Corvets,</hi> to ſettle him on the Hand, ſayes he, which is in <hi>La Broues</hi> Book, only for a <hi>Horſe</hi> that is near Dreſt, and not for a <hi>Colt</hi>: Beſides, ſome <hi>Horſes</hi> will never go <hi>Corvets,</hi> do what you can: So this

                     <hi>Method</hi> may Spoyl <hi>Horſes,</hi> but ſhall never Dreſs them, I aſſure you; and you may take my Word for it. He will (by his <hi>New Method</hi>) never Trot, Gallop, or Walk a <hi>Horſe</hi>; but no <hi>Horſe</hi> in the World can be <hi>Made</hi> without <hi>Theſe Three,</hi> nor without a <hi>Cavezon, Stopping,</hi> and having his Head Pull'd into the <hi>Turn.</hi>

                  <p>THere was a Great Maſter, that would Ride his <hi>Horſes Twice</hi> a Day; ſaying, That if he could Dreſs a <hi>Horſe</hi> in <hi>Six</hi> Months, <hi>Once</hi> a day Riding of them, he was ſure he could Dreſs a <hi>Horſe</hi> in <hi>Three</hi> Months, Riding them <hi>Twice</hi> a Day; Wherein he is much Deceived: For a <hi>Horſe</hi> being Fleſh and Blood, cannot indure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Travel</hi> with little <hi>Reſt</hi>; and no Exerciſe is more Violent for a <hi>Horſe</hi> than in the <hi>Mannage.</hi> Nay, of Neceſſity, Riding ſo much <hi>One Morning,</hi> he will not Recover it of a Day or Two: And if a

                     <hi>Horſe</hi> Oppoſe the <hi>Man,</hi> which all <hi>Horſes</hi> will do at Firſt, and are Vitious, one muſt <hi>Correct</hi> him Soundly; and, How will you Ride him in the <hi>Afternoon</hi> again? Dull him you may, and take off his <hi>Spirit,</hi> make him Hate the <hi>Mannage,</hi> and make him like a <hi>Vaulting</hi> Horſe, rather than like a <hi>Live</hi> Horſe. Nor can you ever Give him his Meat, VVater, or Reſt, in <hi>Order</hi>; the Want of which muſt make him Sick, and ſubject to many Diſeaſes; and Shortly after, Death will follow: and there is your <hi>Twice</hi> a day Riding him, which <hi>Makes</hi> him fit for the <hi>Hunts-Man</hi> to Dreſs him for his <hi>Doggs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some ſay again, That they will Ride no Horſe <hi>Twice</hi> a Day, but Horſes that are very <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> and of great <hi>Strength</hi>: I have ſeen many Horſes that are <hi>Vitious,</hi> but few of ſuch great <hi>Strength.</hi> For, if the <hi>Horſe</hi> be very <hi>Vitious,</hi> you muſt Correct him <hi>Soundly,</hi> and Ride him ſo Long until he Obey you, in ſome ſmall <hi>Meaſure</hi>; and then I am ſure you have Ridd him ſo Violently, and ſo Long, as he will Hardly be to be Ridd the next <hi>Morning</hi>; and Leſs, to be Ridd any

more that Day: And if the Horſe be ſo <hi>Docil</hi> as to <hi>Obey</hi> you in Every Thing, certainly the Beſt way is to take but a Little of him that <hi>Morning,</hi> to Encourage him to do ſo again; and the more to Encourage him, not to Ride him until the next <hi>Morning</hi> again: ſo he will be Pleaſant, Lively, and in Luſt, and take Pleaſure in you, and the <hi>Mannage</hi>; and Learn more <hi>Thus</hi> in a Months <hi>Riding</hi> him but <hi>Once</hi> a day than he ſhall in three Months, <hi>Riding</hi> him <hi>Twice</hi> a day.</p>
                  <p>Have not all <hi>Schollars</hi> Play-dayes? and certain Hours of Reſt in their daies of <hi>Study</hi>?

And ſhall only Horſes of <hi>Mannage</hi> be <hi>Galley-Slaves</hi>? There is no Reaſon for that.

                  <p>Juſt like the <hi>Polander,</hi> being Sick, whoſe <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian</hi> gave him <hi>Nine</hi> Pills to be taken, <hi>Three</hi> every Night, for <hi>Three</hi> Nights together; who very Wiſely conſidered, That if <hi>Three</hi> Pills every Night, for <hi>Three</hi> Nights together, would Recover him; That then, taking <hi>All</hi> the Pills <hi>One</hi> Night, would <hi>Make</hi> him <hi>Well</hi> Preſently.

wherein he is Deceived; for a <hi>Ready Horſe</hi> is the Hardeſt of all to Ride, becauſe the Leaſt motion is an Abſolute Command unto him, and an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant gives him ſuch <hi>Counter-times,</hi> as he puts him quite Out.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Germain,</hi> a Fine Gentleman, and the Beſt Scholler <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> had in all his <hi>Academy,</hi> knew well the Difficulty of Riding a <hi>Ready Horſe:</hi> For, to Perſwade him to Ride one of <hi>Mine,</hi> which he would not Do; I told him, If you will but <hi>Sit Still,</hi> I warrant you the <hi>Horſe</hi> will go Well with you. <hi>But a Man</hi> (ſaid he, with a great Oath) <hi>cannot Sit Still.</hi> Which was ſaid Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and like a <hi>Horſe-man</hi>; for, to <hi>Sit Still,</hi> belongs only to a <hi>Great Maſter.</hi>

                     <p>If he be <hi>Well Choſen,</hi> I aſſure you, He is the <hi>Nobleſt</hi> Horſe in the World: Firſt, There is no <hi>Horſe</hi> ſo <hi>Curiouſly Shaped,</hi> all over from Head to Croup: He is the moſt <hi>Beautiful</hi> that can be; For he is not ſo <hi>Thin,</hi> and <hi>Lady-like,</hi> as the <hi>Barb</hi>; nor ſo Groſs as the <hi>Neapolitan</hi>; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Both.

                     <p>He is as Fine a <hi>Horſe</hi> as can be, but ſomewhat Slender, and a little <hi>Lady-like</hi>; and is ſo Lazy and Negligent in his <hi>Walk,</hi> as he will <hi>Stumble</hi> in a <hi>Bowling-Green</hi>; he Trots like a <hi>Cow,</hi> and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops <hi>Low,</hi> and no <hi>Action</hi> in any of thoſe Actions: But commonly he is <hi>Sinewy,</hi> and <hi>Nervous,</hi> and hath a clean Strength, is excellently Winded, and good at Length, to Endure great <hi>Travel</hi>; and very Apt to Learn, and Eaſie to be Dreſt, being (for the moſt part) of a good <hi>Diſpoſition,</hi> excellent <hi>Apprehenſion, Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi>; and when he is Searcht, and Wakened, no <hi>Horſe</hi> in the

                     <p>The <hi>Mountain-Barbs,</hi> they ſay, are the Beſt; I believe they are the Largeſt, but, for my part, I rather deſire a <hi>Midling</hi> Horſe, or a <hi>Leſs</hi> Horſe, which are Cheap enough in <hi>Barbery,</hi> as I have been Informed, both by many Gentlemen, and many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; for they ſay, that in <hi>Barbery</hi> you may Buy a very Fine <hi>Barb</hi> for Twenty, Twenty Five, or Thirty Pounds at the moſt; but then your Journey is ſomewhat Great; not by Sea; for, from <hi>Tunis,</hi> to <hi>Marſelles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> is no great Voyage; but from <hi>Marſelles</hi> to <hi>Calais</hi> by Land, you go all the Length of <hi>France,</hi> and at <hi>Calais</hi> they are Shipt for <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt have an excellent <hi>Eſquier,</hi> a <hi>Farrier,</hi> and one <hi>Groom,</hi> and Hire other <hi>Grooms</hi> as you Go; but take heed, That thoſe <hi>Mean Rogues</hi> Run not Away with ſome of your Horſes; and becauſe there is no Truſting of them, your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Farrier, and your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Groom, muſt alwayes Lie in the Stable, and none of thoſe Fellows;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52970:34"/>
but the Gentleman of your Horſe, which ought to be a Good Horſe-man, muſt order that Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                     <p>If you would go another Way to work, and a Shorter Voyage, then ſend into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> where many Gentlemen Buy <hi>Barbs</hi> of two, three, and four Years old at <hi>Marſelles,</hi> and Keep them two or three Years, and then Sell them; which <hi>Barbs</hi> you may Buy for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Fifty Piſtols a Piece, and as Fine Horſes as can be: But he whom you Send, muſt be very Skilful to chuſe Well, and to take heed that <hi>They</hi> be Right <hi>Barbs</hi>; For I have Heard, that many in thoſe Countries, about <hi>Marſelles,</hi> when many <hi>Barbs</hi> come out of <hi>Barbery,</hi> thruſt in <hi>Colts</hi> of their own Breed amongſt them for <hi>Barbs,</hi> and ſo Sell them.</p>
                     <p>When I was at <hi>Paris,</hi> there came Twenty Five <hi>Barbs</hi> (as they ſaid) nothing but Skin and Bones, and they were Sold for Twenty Five Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols a <hi>Horſe:</hi> My Lord Viſcount <hi>Mountague</hi> bought Nine, as I Remember; for I was with him, and helpt to Chuſe ſome for him, and one
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52970:35"/>
of them did Win <hi>Many Matches</hi>: But truly, if I had had a <hi>Million,</hi> I would not have Bought one of them, for they were very <hi>Ordinary</hi> Horſes; Nor do I think they were <hi>Right Barbs,</hi> neither by their <hi>Shape,</hi> nor <hi>Price,</hi> but Bred in ſome <hi>Iſlands</hi> there-abouts; for, if a <hi>Man</hi> be at Great Charges, I would either have an <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Horſe, or <hi>None.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I had lately a Letter from a <hi>Horſe-man</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> a <hi>French-Man,</hi> that gives me Intelligence of Horſes, That a Merchant at <hi>Paris</hi> had two <hi>Barbs,</hi> the Fineſt that ever he ſaw, Six Years old a piece, but not <hi>Drest</hi> at all, and held them at Two Hundred Piſtols a piece: By which, you may ſee, that <hi>Right Barbs,</hi> and Fine ones, are very <hi>Dear,</hi> as all Good Things are.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Barb</hi> is not ſo Fit a <hi>Horſe</hi> for a <hi>Stallion</hi> for the <hi>Mannage,</hi> as for <hi>Running-Horſes</hi>; for he Gets <hi>Long</hi> and <hi>Looſe</hi> Horſes, therefore do not <hi>Breed</hi> of him for the <hi>Mannage,</hi> except he be a Short <hi>Horſe</hi> from the Head to the Croup, ſtrong <hi>Ramaſe,</hi> and <hi>Racourſy,</hi> and of a <hi>Superfluity</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which few <hi>Barbs</hi> have; and therefore Breed

of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, with Choiſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mares; and if you have a Delicate well-choſen <hi>Dutch</hi> Mare or two, that makes an excellent Compoſition for the <hi>Mannage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am of Opinion, and Believe, that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came out of <hi>Barbery,</hi> The beſt <hi>Horſes</hi> that <hi>Country</hi> affords; not but that they may be had: But the Caſe is this; Thoſe that bring <hi>Barbs</hi> out of <hi>Barbery,</hi> are either <hi>French</hi> Horſe-Courſers that Trade in <hi>Barbery,</hi> or Merchants.</p>
                     <p>To begin with the <hi>Horſe-Courſers,</hi> They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>Buy</hi> thoſe Horſes that are <hi>Cheapest</hi> for their Advantage: For if they Bought of <hi>Great Prices,</hi> it would not quit Coſt, and ſo they Buy the Worſt, and Meaneſt, of <hi>Barbs:</hi> And as for the <hi>Merchants,</hi> They want Skill; Beſides, they will <hi>Buy</hi> the <hi>Cheapeſt</hi> too, for their Advantage, becauſe they know not Well, how to put off <hi>Horſes of Price</hi>; and ſo they <hi>Buy</hi> but the Worſt and Meaneſt of <hi>Barbs</hi>; which makes me Believe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, that the Beſt <hi>Barbs</hi> do not come Over: For, did not I ſee dayly at <hi>Antwerp</hi> the Horſe-Courſers of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> that go into

                        <hi>England</hi> every Year to Buy <hi>Horſes,</hi> that they bring Over the <hi>Meaneſt</hi> and <hi>Worſt</hi> Horſes and Geldings that are in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and meerly to Buy at <hi>Eaſie Rates,</hi> that they may put them Off with Advantage? For, if they ſhould Buy in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Horſes of One Hundred, One Hundred and Fifty, and Two Hundred Pounds a Horſe, which Price hath been Given both at <hi>Malten</hi> and <hi>Pank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich</hi> Fayres, thoſe Great Prices would not go off there, where <hi>Money</hi> is ſo Scarce; and ſo they would be Undone; and therefore they Buy of Small Prices.</p>

                  <head>OF WHAT STATURE A Horſe is Beſt, EITHER FOR The WAR, or for a SINGLE-COMBAT, OR FOR ANY THING ELSE.</head>
                  <p>THere are Great Diſputes amongſt <hi>Cavaliers</hi> about this Buſineſs: I will not trouble you much about their <hi>Arguments,</hi> but only Deliver unto you my <hi>Opinion.</hi> Thoſe that are for <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Large</hi> Horſes, ſay, They are <hi>Strong</hi> for the Shock: But they muſt Know, that all <hi>Large</hi> Horſes are not <hi>Strong</hi>; nay, for the moſt part they are not only the <hi>Weakeſt</hi> Horſes, but commonly of no <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Put the Caſe, a <hi>Great</hi> Horſe were <hi>Strong,</hi> yet he is ſo <hi>Tall,</hi> and his <hi>Strength Diffuſed,</hi> and indeed ſo out of his <hi>Strength,</hi> that a <hi>Midling</hi> Horſe

(<hi>Entre deux ſelles</hi>) or rather a <hi>Leſs</hi> Horſe, being Under him, and in his <hi>Strength,</hi> would certainly Overthrow him: So that a <hi>Midling</hi> Horſe, or a <hi>Leſs,</hi> is Beſt for the <hi>War,</hi> or a <hi>Single-Combat,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Doubt.</p>

                     <hi>Midling-Horſes,</hi> and <hi>Leſs</hi> Horſes have, for the moſt part, both <hi>Strength, Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Agility,</hi> and not one in an Hundred but proves Well; when of <hi>Large</hi> Horſes not one in a Thouſand does: Nay, the <hi>Midling,</hi> or <hi>Leſs</hi> Horſe, is Beſt for All Things; for the <hi>Padd, Buck-Hunting, Hawking-Naggs,</hi> or <hi>Geldings</hi>; for <hi>Hunting-Horſes,</hi> Horſes for <hi>Winter-Gallopping</hi> on the High-Way many <hi>Miles</hi>; for the <hi>Coach,</hi> for the <hi>Cart,</hi> for Any Thing.

                  <head>THAT THERE ARE FEW GOOD HORSES.</head>
                  <p>NOw I muſt Tell you, That there are <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Badd</hi> Horſes of all <hi>Countries</hi> in the World; but there are more <hi>Badd</hi> than <hi>Good,</hi> as there are of <hi>Men:</hi> And though there be <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions</hi> of <hi>Painters,</hi> yet there was but one <hi>Vandike</hi> in many <hi>Ages,</hi> or, I believe, ſhall be: The like in <hi>Muſick,</hi> in <hi>Horſe-manſhip,</hi> in <hi>Weapons,</hi> and in <hi>Horſes</hi>; for a Rare <hi>Horſe</hi> in any Kind, is a Difficult buſineſs to find, I aſſure you: It is a Hard thing to find <hi>Fit</hi> Horſes for the <hi>Mannage,</hi> either upon the <hi>Ground,</hi> or in <hi>Ayres.</hi> It is true, <hi>Art</hi> doth much, but <hi>Nature</hi> is the Ground for Art to Work on; for, without it, <hi>Art</hi> can do but Little.</p>
                  <p>I dare Undertake to Make a <hi>Cow</hi> go Juſt in the <hi>Mannage,</hi> but when I have Done that, it is but a <hi>Cow:</hi> And ſo a <hi>Jade</hi> that is Dreſt, he is but a <hi>Jade</hi> when you have done all you Can.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:52970:47"/>I aſſure you, it is a very Hard thing to find a Good <hi>Padd-Nagg,</hi> or a Good <hi>Padd-Gelding,</hi> to <hi>Amble</hi> finely upon the Hanches, and from his Amble to his <hi>Gallop,</hi> or from his Amble to his <hi>Trot,</hi> and firm on the Hand: Upon the Bitt I have ſeen very Few worth any thing, and as few Good <hi>Buck-Hunters,</hi> or <hi>Hawking-Naggs,</hi> or <hi>Winter Hunting-Geldings,</hi> or Horſes to <hi>Gallop</hi> or <hi>Run</hi> ſurely upon All Grounds, <hi>Plowed Lands, Moors, Parks, Forreſts,</hi> and every where, with a <hi>Snaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle,</hi> and a <hi>Scotch Saddle,</hi> the Rains ſlack in his Neck, which makes him very much the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for his Rider, becauſe he Gallops upon the <hi>Hanches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me Tell you, That Running-Horſes are the moſt Eaſily found, and of the leaſt Uſe; commonly they Run upon <hi>Heaths,</hi> (a Green Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet) and muſt there Run all-upon the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> which in <hi>Troubleſome Grounds</hi> is ready to Break ones Neck, and of no Uſe; Though I Love the Sport of a <hi>Running-Horſe</hi> very Well, and think I am as Good a <hi>Jockey</hi> as any, and have Ridden many Hundred <hi>Matches,</hi> and Seen the

Beſt <hi>Jockeys,</hi> and Studied it more than, I think, they have Done.</p>
                  <p>You ſee how Difficult a thing it is to Have a Good Horſe in any Kind, for Any thing: Therefore I conclude, That a <hi>Knowing Horſe-man</hi> is not ſo Happy for Horſes, as a <hi>Citizen</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> that knows Nothing, more Than to Buy a Horſe in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> for Eight Pound Ten Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or there-abouts, to Carry him to <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or to <hi>Salisbury</hi>; and let him have never ſo many Faults, his Ignorance finds none: Wherein he is very Happy.</p>

                  <head>MORE OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING HORSES.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Turks</hi> are the moſt <hi>Curious</hi> in Keeping their <hi>Horſes</hi> of any <hi>Nation</hi>; and Value them, and Eſteem them moſt: They have all the Wayes of Dreſſing them, and keeping them Clean, that can be Imagined. They Cloath them firſt with a Fine <hi>Linnen Cloth</hi> and <hi>Hood</hi> next their Skin; then with a <hi>Hair-Cloth</hi> and <hi>Hood,</hi> Lined with Felt, over their Linnen Cloth and Hood: And all theſe are made ſo Fit, as to Cover their Breaſts, and to come pretty low down to their Leggs. There cannot be a Better Way than this for their Cloathing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are alſo very <hi>Curious</hi> about their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52970:48"/>
                     <hi>Horſes</hi> in all things; and their Grooms ſo Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, as they never Stay long Out of the Stable, but are Alwayes doing ſomething about them; and eſpecially are <hi>Curious</hi> about their <hi>Manes, Toppings,</hi> and <hi>Tayles,</hi> making them Clean divers Ways; Waſhing them, and Pleating them. They eſteem Highly their <hi>Horſes,</hi> and no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Loves them Better. The Maſter is Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in the Stable, to ſee the Grooms do their Duty; but, for all that, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> are none of the Beſt <hi>Horſe-men</hi>; they Ride Short, have Strange <hi>Spurrs,</hi> and <hi>Saddles,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Bitts,</hi> which are moſt Abominable.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> are very Careful and Neat about their <hi>Horſes</hi>; but they have of late Loſt their <hi>Latine</hi> in <hi>Riding,</hi> or elſe they never Had it; and our Ignorance made us Think they did Rarely.</p>
                  <p>Some of the <hi>French</hi> are <hi>Curious</hi> in Keeping and Dreſſing their <hi>Horſes</hi>; but, for the moſt part, Not: They highly Eſteem <hi>Horſes,</hi> and will give great
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52970:49"/>
                     <hi>Prices</hi> for them. But <hi>French</hi> Grooms never Rub a <hi>Horſes</hi> Leggs well.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Almains,</hi> or <hi>High-Germans,</hi> Love <hi>Horſes</hi> well: Some ſay, They are very <hi>Curious,</hi> but Me-thinks not. They Commend their <hi>Grooms</hi> Extreamly, but I think they do not Deſerve it. Certainly the Beſt <hi>Grooms</hi> are <hi>Engliſh Grooms</hi>; but no <hi>Grooms</hi> are Good, Except the <hi>Maſter</hi> looks ſtrictly after them; for, The <hi>Maſters Eye</hi> makes the <hi>Horſe</hi> well Dreſt, as according to the Proverb, <hi>The Maſter's Eye makes the</hi> Horſe <hi>Fat.</hi>

                  <p>For <hi>Iſeland</hi> Horſes, they are all <hi>Curlled</hi> like their <hi>Doggs,</hi> and ſo <hi>Curled,</hi> that no Curry-Comb can Dreſs them, nor any thing Elſe: And they are but <hi>Dull Jades.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:52970:52"/>When he hath <hi>Covered</hi> them All, then he Tryes them all Over again, and thoſe that will Take the <hi>Horſe,</hi> he <hi>Covers</hi> them; and thoſe that will Not, he lets them Alone: And when he Knows he hath Finiſhed his <hi>Work,</hi> he Beats the <hi>Pale</hi> to be gone, which is Time for him; then you muſt take him Up, and you ſhall find him Lean enough, nothing but Skin and Bones, and his Mane and Tayl will <hi>Moot Off</hi>: If you give him too many <hi>Mares,</hi> then he will Serve you the Leſs time; be ſo Lean and Weak, that you will very hardly Recover him againſt the next Year, or <hi>Covering-time.</hi> Therefore ten or twelve <hi>Mares</hi> is Enough.</p>

                  <p>I muſt Tell you, That you muſt Never have a <hi>Stallion</hi> of your Own Breed, becauſe they are too Far removed from the <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Head,</hi> of the <hi>Fountain,</hi> which is a Pure <hi>Spaniſh Horſe</hi>: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſhould the <hi>Stallions</hi> be of your Own Breed, in Three or Four <hi>Generations</hi> they would come to be Cart-Horſes; ſo Groſs, and ill-Favoured would they be: or at leaſt, juſt ſuch Horſes as are Bred in that <hi>Country,</hi> ſo ſoon will they Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate: Therefore, have ſtill a freſh <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe for the <hi>Stallion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you cannot Breed Better, than to Breed of your <hi>Own Mares</hi> that you have Bred; and let

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52970:55"/>
hath <hi>Dry Feeding</hi>; for there is not much <hi>Graſs</hi> in many Places. <hi>Barbery</hi> is very <hi>Hot,</hi> and little <hi>Graſs. Turkey</hi> is very <hi>Hot,</hi> and <hi>Dry Grounds.

muſt Gallop him an Hour before you can take him Off his <hi>Fury</hi>; and ſuch <hi>Counter-times</hi> of <hi>Leaps,</hi> do <hi>In-commode</hi> the Rider, to no Purpoſe: And when you would make him Go, he ſhall not Go ſo Well, as a <hi>Horſe</hi> of Half his <hi>Strength</hi>: and though he <hi>Leaps</hi> in ſuch a Manner, that will Diſorder an <hi>Armed-Man</hi>; yet the Beſt <hi>Horſe-man</hi> in the World ſhall not make him a <hi>Leaping-Horſe:</hi> Therefore the Beſt for the <hi>Mannage,</hi> and the <hi>War,</hi> is a <hi>Horſe</hi> that hath ſo much <hi>Strength</hi> as to Indure a <hi>Stopp,</hi> and no more, to make him Eaſie for an <hi>Armed-Man.</hi> And Certainly a <hi>Weak</hi> Horſe with <hi>Spirit, Docil,</hi> and of a <hi>Good Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is much Better, and will go Beyond a huge <hi>Flanders</hi> Horſe, of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Brewer, that hath no <hi>Spirit</hi>: And I muſt Tell you, That the Greateſt and Largeſt <hi>Horſes</hi> are not commonly the <hi>Strongeſt,</hi> but for the moſt part the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for that which makes them <hi>Draw,</hi> is their <hi>Waight,</hi> and not their <hi>Strength,</hi> nor their <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>; for they have none.

Theſe are the very Words of Mr. <hi>Blundevil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:52970:61"/>Let us ſee the Probability of it, and the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Rule, in a Horſe whoſe <hi>Mark is Out of his Mouth</hi>; for many Horſes that are many Years Older, if they be Healthful, and Sound, and in good Caſe, Wanton, and full of Blood, their <hi>Skin will Return to the ſame Place again Preſently,</hi> when a Younger Horſe by many Years, that is Sickly, Lean, and Faint, his <hi>Skin will not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſo ſoon</hi>; and then your <hi>Old Obſervation</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives you, and is a great Folly. And when he will Know a Horſes <hi>Age</hi> by his <hi>Tayl,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at the Wrong end; which is moſt Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blundevil</hi> ſayes alſo, That when a Horſe <hi>Waxeth Old, his Temples will wax Hollow,</hi> and the <hi>Hair of his Browes Hore and White,</hi> &amp;c. This is, for the moſt part, ſomewhat Probable. But yet I have Known a young Fellow of Seventeen all <hi>Gray</hi>; Why may it not be ſo in Horſes? Nay, I have Known ſome ſo. But though I Grant, That <hi>Gray Hairs ſhewes Age,</hi> for the moſt part; yet, I believe, you do not know <hi>How Old a Horſe is</hi> for all that Obſervation, but only in general, <hi>That he is Old.</hi>

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:52970:62"/>So that there is no Sure way to <hi>Know</hi> his <hi>Age,</hi> but by his <hi>Teeth</hi>; and that is a certain Rule, but Laſts no longer than Seven years Old. Captain <hi>Mazine</hi> ſayes, That a Horſes Years may be <hi>Known</hi> until he is Fourteen, by his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Teeth</hi>; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth not Hold in all Horſes, I forbear to Write it. There is ſome Difference between Horſes and Mares, to <hi>Know</hi> their <hi>Age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For any Man that would have a Horſe of Uſe in his ordinary Occaſions; as for <hi>Journeys, Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>Hunting</hi>; I would never Buy a Horſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the <hi>Mark be Out of his Mouth</hi>; and if he be <hi>Sound</hi> of Wind, Limb, and Sight, he will laſt you Eight or Nine Years with good Keeping, and never Fail you; when a Young Horſe will have many <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> as Children have, and you muſt leave him with your Hoſt at <hi>Harborow,</hi> or <hi>Northampton,</hi> or ſome Inne, and Hire another Horſe for your Occaſion, and have your Hoſt's Bill, and the Farriers, which will come to more than your Horſe is Worth; and there's your Young Horſe; but your Old Horſe ſhall never Fail you.

Purpoſes, an Old Nagg of ſome <hi>Hunts-Man,</hi> or <hi>Falconer,</hi> that is <hi>Sound,</hi> and that's the Uſeful Nagg; for he Gallops on all <hi>Grounds,</hi> Leaps over <hi>Ditches,</hi> and <hi>Hedges</hi>; and this will not Fail you in your <hi>Journey,</hi> nor any where; and is the only Nagg of <hi>

                  <p>For the <hi>Girthes,</hi> I muſt Adviſe you to have one Girth as <hi>Broad</hi> as two, only at each End ſeparated, as if they were Two, though it is but one Girth; and an <hi>Italian Surcingle</hi> over them; which is ſo excellent a thing, that if the <hi>Girths,</hi> or <hi>Straps,</hi> ſhould Break, yet the <hi>Surcingle</hi> will not fail to Hold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:52970:63"/>You muſt fit your Horſe with a Bitt proper for him; that is, a Cannon, or a Scatch, <hi>A la Pignatel,</hi> and Branches <hi>A la Coneſtable</hi>; and the ſame Bitt I will alwayes Ride my Horſe with I give him at firſt; for they are Ridiculous with their <hi>Piſtol Cannons,</hi> and not to fit a Horſe for two Years, and then to Bitt him up. But I will alwayes Bitt and fit my Horſe at the firſt, with what he ſhould alwayes Wear, or ſuch Another when that's Broke, or is worn in Pieces.</p>
                  <p>Your Horſe ſhould be <hi>Girt</hi> as Hard as you can; for the <hi>Italian</hi> ſayes, He that <hi>Girds</hi> well, <hi>Rides</hi> well. But a <hi>Groom</hi> may Gird well, and yet not Ride well. But they <hi>Mean,</hi> No Man can Ride well, that doth not Gird well: For, How can he Ride well when the Saddle turns Round? <hi>Horſes of Mannage</hi> force the <hi>Girths</hi> much with Violent <hi>Ayres,</hi> which an <hi>Ambling Horſe</hi> doth not. But I muſt Tell you, That you ſhould never <hi>Gird</hi> your Horſe up <hi>Hard</hi> and <hi>Straight,</hi> but juſt before you <hi>Ride</hi> him; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hard Girt</hi> in the <hi>Stable</hi> Long before you

                  </p>
                  <p>But I will Tell you a great Truth in <hi>Horſes</hi> that are uſed to be <hi>Girt Hard:</hi> When the <hi>Groom</hi> comes to <hi>Gird</hi> them up, the Horſes will ſo <hi>Stretch</hi> their <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Bellies Out,</hi> with holding their <hi>Breath,</hi> that the <hi>Grooms</hi> have much ado to <hi>Gird</hi> them: And this is <hi>Craftily</hi> done of them, that they may have <hi>Eaſe</hi> after they are <hi>Girded,</hi> and then they let their Bodies <hi>Fall</hi> again. And yet, ſayes the Learned, <hi>Like to the</hi> Horſe <hi>that hath no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another thing I am to Advertiſe you of; and that is, To make the <hi>Noſe-Band</hi> as <hi>Straight</hi> as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible you can; becauſe it <hi>Hinders</hi> him, as they ſay, to make <hi>Sheeres</hi> with his <hi>Mouth,</hi> or to <hi>Gape</hi> to Diſorder the <hi>Working</hi> of the <hi>Bitt,</hi> or to <hi>Bite</hi> at the <hi>Rodd</hi> when you help him, or to <hi>Bite</hi> at your <hi>Feet.</hi> But the <hi>Noſe-Band,</hi> being very <hi>Straight,</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:52970:64"/>
makes the <hi>Bitt</hi> lie in his due Place, and Works orderly, as it Ought, both upon the <hi>Barrs,</hi> and the <hi>Curb,</hi> and firms and ſettles his <hi>Head:</hi> And I aſſure you, there is nothing Better than this, for many things; and therefore I would have alſo the <hi>Cavezone</hi> as ſtraight as you could, for many Reaſons; and Remember that your <hi>Cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone</hi> be never <hi>Sharp</hi>; but always Lined with double Leather at the leaſt, for fear of Hurting him: Though the Old ſaying, is, <hi>A Bloody Noſe makes a good Mouth</hi>; I would neither Hurt his Mouth, nor his Noſe, nor any thing elſe about him, if I could Help it; and then I am ſure he will have a Better Mouth, when his Noſe is not Hurt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sakers, Dockes,</hi> or <hi>Trouſe Ques,</hi> (which is all one) is a great Grace for a <hi>Leaping-Horſe</hi>; for it makes him appear <hi>Plumper,</hi> and more To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Racourſi,</hi> and makes him appear to go <hi>Higher</hi> too; therefore I would uſe <hi>Sakers</hi> for all Kinds of <hi>Leaping-Horſes,</hi> whether for <hi>Croupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, Balotadoes,</hi> or <hi>Caprioles</hi>; but then the Horſes <hi>Tayles</hi> muſt be Tied ſhort Up, upon the <hi>Saker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:52970:65"/>For Horſes that go the <hi>Mannage de Soldat, Terra a Terra,</hi> in <hi>Corvets,</hi> or <hi>Demy-Ayres,</hi> there is nothing Handſomer, than to ſee a Horſe with a good Tayl Down, without any thing; no <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> or any thing, but Naturally; and to ſee him Lay his Tayl on the Ground, is Graceful, and ſhewes that he Goes upon the Hanches; which is the Perfection of the <hi>Mannage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Beautifie their <hi>Manes</hi> before great Princes, or Perſons of Quality, there is nothing more Graceful, than to Tye their <hi>Manes</hi> with ſeveral <hi>Coloured Ribbons,</hi> or all of <hi>One Colour,</hi> in many ſeveral Wayes; either Pleating their <hi>Manes,</hi> or letting them be Looſe.</p>
                  <p>I never ſaw any Horſe Go ſo well with <hi>Rich Saddles,</hi> as with <hi>Plain Leather Saddles,</hi> and <hi>Black Bridles:</hi> The <hi>Leather Saddles</hi> ſhould be plain White <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Leather, ſtitcht with <hi>Silk</hi>; with Silver <hi>Nayles,</hi> and a good Black Leather <hi>Slap-Cover</hi> over it, and the <hi>Bridle</hi> Soft black Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Small; by no means too Great: <hi>Two Girthes</hi> in <hi>One,</hi> to part at both Ends, like Two Girths; and a good <hi>Italian</hi> Surcingle, which is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52970:65"/>
Worth both the Girthes for ſure Holding.</p>
                  <p>You muſt be very Careful, to ſee that nothing that is about the Horſe ſhould Hurt him; as his <hi>Saddle, Bitt, Cavezone,</hi> or any thing elſe: For, I aſſure you, as long as any thing Hurts him, he will never go Well.</p>
                  <p>No Horſe goes Well in a <hi>Wind,</hi> it doth ſo Whisk about him, and in his Ears, and makes ſuch a Noiſe, as it Diverts him from the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi>; and ſo doth any new Help, or any new Thing that they are not Accuſtomed to: Horſes are very Senſible, and Tickle; and no Strangers muſt come near them.</p>
                  <p>There is one Thing that is the moſt Uncomly, and the Diſgracefulleſt thing a Horſe can do; and that is, <hi>To Whisk his Tayl</hi> in all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he makes. The common Remedy they Uſe, is, <hi>To Tie his Tayl with a Quinſel</hi>; which doth Remedy that Vice, as long as it Holds: But the Beſt thing in the World, is, <hi>To Cut Croſs the great Nerve that is under his Tayl,</hi> and then he ſhall never Whisk or Shake it again; and it will do him no Hurt in the World, more
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52970:66"/>
than when it is Cut. There is no Remedy like unto this.</p>

And it is very True. Then theſe Horſes of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,</hi> which are extreamly Heated, and often muſt, of Neceſſity, <hi>Melt</hi> their <hi>Greaſe.</hi> If you give them <hi>Graſs</hi> to <hi>Cool</hi> them, and <hi>Purge</hi> them (as they ſay) to bring it away, it being Hardned
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52970:66"/>
like Tallow, <hi>Graſs</hi> is too Gentle to do it Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually: But I Confeſs it Diſſolves ſome ſmall part of it, which it doth not Bring away; and that which is Diſſolved, runs into their Veins, and Arteries, and makes them remain <hi>Sick</hi> Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo that they will never <hi>Thrive.</hi> Therefore, at the time of <hi>Soyl,</hi> let them <hi>Blood</hi> once or twice, and give them <hi>Pills</hi> of <hi>Alloes Sicatrina</hi> two <hi>Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> lapped up in <hi>Freſh Butter</hi>; and after that, give them <hi>Cooling Julips</hi> twice or thrice a Week, for a Fortnight, or Three weeks together; and let them Reſt, or but Walk gently out, and no <hi>Graſs</hi> at all: During the great Heats, ride Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, by no means Violently.</p>
                  <p>Horſes of great Exerciſe muſt have Dry Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for Moiſt Feeding ſpoyls them, and fills them full of Diſeaſes and Corruption; therefore never give them <hi>Graſs,</hi> and but very little <hi>Hay.</hi> The <hi>Method</hi> thus: Before their <hi>Water,</hi> give them but a Handful of <hi>Hay,</hi> only to make them <hi>Drink</hi>; and after their <hi>Water,</hi> another Handful of <hi>Hay,</hi> to be a <hi>Barricado</hi> between their <hi>Water,</hi> and their <hi>Oats,</hi> that they ſhould not <hi>Shoot</hi> their

                  <p>A Horſe muſt ever be <hi>Empty</hi> before you Ride him, and ſtand ſome three or four Hours, both Morning, and Afternoon, upon the <hi>Watering-Bitt,</hi> to turn him from the Manger, to get him a better <hi>Appetite</hi>; which is excellent Good.</p>

Lapt up in Butter, and made into two Pills, and ſo give it your Horſe after he hath Reſted awhile; then give him this Following and Refreſhing Drink, which is the beſt <hi>Julip</hi> in the World:</p>
                  <p>Take <hi>Mel Roſatum,</hi> or <hi>Honey</hi> of <hi>Roſes.</hi> Conſerves of <hi>Damask-Roſes.</hi> Conſerve of <hi>Burrage.</hi> Sirrup of <hi>Violets.</hi> Of each four Ounces.</p>

                  <p>Then you are to Uſe both theſe <hi>Conſerves</hi> and <hi>Waters,</hi> Thus:</p>
                  <p>Put all the <hi>Conſerves</hi> into a <hi>Morter,</hi> and Beat them, or Pownd them together, and then Mix them by Little and Little, with the Waters, till they be well Mixt together; and then give them

all together in a <hi>Horn,</hi> to the Horſe, without Straining: Do not give it <hi>Cold</hi> by any means. <hi>Hott</hi> Sirrup of <hi>Lemmons</hi> added to it, is very Good: Give it twice or thrice a Week for a Fortnight at leaſt, and let the Horſe Reſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>Feed your Horſe all the time of this great Heat within him, with <hi>Wheat-Brann</hi> amongſt his <hi>Oats,</hi> and Waſh them in a little Beer, if he Likes it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> For an <hi>Amble,</hi> he Removes both his <hi>Leggs</hi> of a Side: As for Example; Take the <hi>Farr-Side,</hi> he removes his <hi>Fore-Legg,</hi> and his <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> of the ſame Side at one time, whilſt the other Two <hi>Leggs</hi> of the <hi>Near-Side</hi> ſtand ſtill; and when thoſe <hi>Leggs</hi> are upon the <hi>Ground</hi> which he firſt Removed, at the ſame Time they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Ground</hi> the other Side; which is, The <hi>Near-Side</hi> removes <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> and <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> on that Side, and the other <hi>Leggs</hi> of the <hi>Farr-Side</hi> ſtand ſtill.</p>
                  <p>Thus an <hi>Amble</hi> Removes both his <hi>Leggs</hi> of a Side, and every Remove <hi>Changes</hi> Sides; Two of a Side in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> and Two upon the <hi>Ground</hi> at the ſame time. And this is a Perfect <hi>Amble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly.</hi> A <hi>Gallop</hi> is another <hi>Motion</hi>: For, in a <hi>Gallop</hi> he may Lead with which <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> you Pleaſe; but then the <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> of the ſame Side muſt Follow it, I mean when he <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops</hi> Straight Forwards; and then this is a perfect <hi>Gallop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:52970:82"/>But to Underſtand what is Meant by his <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> Leading, and his <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> on the ſame ſide Following; that <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> is thus. As for Example: If the <hi>Farr-Fore-Legg</hi> Lead, by that <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> Leading, is meant, That <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> muſt be Before the other <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> alwayes, and the <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> to Follow it on the ſame Side; which <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> muſt alwayes be Before the other <hi>Hinder-Legg:</hi> And this is a True <hi>Gallop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now to Shew you, that the <hi>Motion</hi> of a <hi>Gallop</hi> is thus: The Horſe <hi>Liffts</hi> Both his <hi>Fore-Leggs</hi> Up at a Time, in that Action that I told you, which is one <hi>Legg</hi> before the other; and as his <hi>Fore-Leggs</hi> are Falling, I ſay before they Touch the <hi>Ground,</hi> his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> in that Poſture I formerly told you, Follow his <hi>Fore-Leggs,</hi> being once All in the <hi>Ayre</hi> at one Time; for as his <hi>Fore-Leggs</hi> are Falling, his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> Moves at the ſame Time, and then he is All in the <hi>Ayre:</hi> For, How is it Poſſible elſe, that as a Horſe is <hi>Running,</hi> he ſhould ſpring Forward twice his <hi>Length,</hi> were not the <hi>Motion</hi> of a <hi>Gallop</hi> a Leap froward?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:52970:82"/>And this <hi>Deſcription</hi> is moſt True both in the <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Poſture</hi> of a Horſes <hi>Leggs</hi>; when he <hi>Gallops:</hi> In a Soft and Slow <hi>Gallop</hi> it is hardly Perceived, though it be True; but in <hi>Running,</hi> where the <hi>Motion</hi> is more Violent, it is eaſily Perceived: for there it is Plain; you ſhall ſee all his <hi>Four</hi> Feet in the <hi>Ayre</hi> at one time, (<hi>Running</hi> being but a Swift <hi>Gallop</hi>;) for the Motion and Poſture of his <hi>Leggs</hi> are all one. But you muſt Remember, that <hi>Galloping</hi> upon Circles, the Horſe always ought to Lead with his Two <hi>Leggs,</hi> within the Turn; <hi>Fore-Legg,</hi> and <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> within the Turn. And this is a True <hi>Gallop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly.</hi> When a Horſe Runns, the <hi>Motion</hi> he makes, and the <hi>Action</hi> of his <hi>Leggs,</hi> are all One with a <hi>Gallop</hi>; only a Swifter <hi>Motion,</hi> which you may call a Swift Gallop; and a Gallop a Slow Running: And this is the Truth of the <hi>Motion</hi> of Running.</p>
                  <p>Now I muſt Tell you of that which every body Speaks of, and no body Tells what it is: For, they ſay, A Horſe may Gallop with the wrong <hi>Legg</hi> Before, which is Impoſſible. For,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52970:83"/>
if the <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> of the ſame ſide Followes, it is a Right Gallop; ſo that rather it is the wrong <hi>Legg</hi> Behind. But that which they call the wrong <hi>Legg</hi> Before, is <hi>Thus</hi> a True Gallop, if that <hi>Legg</hi> which Leads Before, is Follow'd by the <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> of the ſame Side; and as the Horſe Falls with his two <hi>Fore-Leggs,</hi> his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> Follow them, before his <hi>Fore-Leggs</hi> touch the Ground; ſo that at that very time all the Horſes Four <hi>Leggs</hi> are in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> and it is a Leap for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. That which they call the Wrong <hi>Legg</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is this, When the Horſe is upon the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in the Swiftneſs of a <hi>Gallop,</hi> he Changes his <hi>Leggs Croſs</hi>; which is the Action of a <hi>Trott,</hi> two <hi>Leggs</hi> in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> and two upon the <hi>Ground</hi>; and that is ſo Contrary to a <hi>Gallop,</hi> and is ſuch a Croſs <hi>Motion,</hi> as makes the Horſe ready to Fall: and this is one Way of that which they call, The Wrong <hi>Legg</hi> Before.</p>
                  <p>Another Way is this, That when the Horſe is upon the Action of a <hi>Gallop</hi>; as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Swiftneſs of a <hi>Gallop,</hi> where he ſhould keep alwayes Two <hi>Leggs</hi> of a ſide Forward, he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52970:83"/>
Changes Sides every time, <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> and <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> of a Side; and Changing Sides every time, that is the Action of an <hi>Amble,</hi> which is Two <hi>Leggs</hi> of a Side in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> and Two <hi>Leggs</hi> of the other Side upon the <hi>Ground</hi> at the ſame Time, and Changing Sides every Time. This Action of an <hi>Amble,</hi> upon the Swiftneſs of a <hi>Gallop,</hi> Differs ſo much from the Action of a <hi>Gallop,</hi> as it makes the Horſe ready to Fall: And theſe two, the Action of a <hi>Trott,</hi> and the Action of an <hi>Amble,</hi> upon the Swiftneſs of a <hi>Gallop,</hi> is that which their Ignorance calls, The Wrong <hi>Legg</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>It is True, that though a Horſe do <hi>Gallop</hi> Right, which is his <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> to Follow his <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> on the ſame Side; yet if he be not Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to that Side, he will <hi>Gallop</hi> neither ſo Nimbly, nor ſo Faſt, as with that Side he is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to Lead withal: For, it is Juſt as a Left-Handed, or a Right-Handed Man; Cuſtom having a very great Power over Man and Beaſt: Elſe, when the Horſe <hi>Gallops</hi> Forward, never ſo little a Gallop, his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> go beyond the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52970:84"/>
Print of his <hi>Fore-Leggs,</hi> and that <hi>Legg</hi> that he Leads withal. For Example; If the Inward <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> Lead, the Inward <hi>Hinder-Leg</hi> Follows; ſo thoſe are Preſt, and his Outward <hi>Leggs</hi> at Liberty: So that in the Action he makes, his Outward <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> is ſet to the <hi>Ground</hi> firſt, and is at Liberty; that's one Time: And then his Inward <hi>Fore-Legg,</hi> which is Preſt, and Leads, makes a Second time; that's Two: And then his Outward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> which is at Liberty, is ſet Down; that's Three times: And then his Inward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> which is Preſt, and Leads, is ſet Down; and that makes a Fourth time. So that a <hi>Gallop</hi> Forward is 1, 2, 3, and 4. which is the juſt Action and Time of a <hi>Gallop</hi> Forward, and is a Leap forward. Now upon <hi>Circles,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> Out upon a <hi>Gallop,</hi> he muſt alwayes Lead with his Inward <hi>Leggs</hi> to the <hi>Turn,</hi> and ſtrikes Over but ſometimes; not ſo much, but that the Action of the <hi>Gallop</hi> is all One; which is 1, 2, 3, and 4. and a Leap for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                  <head>The Ordering of the <hi>CAVEZONE</hi> MY WAY, And the Operation and Uſe of it.</head>
                  <p>TAke one of the <hi>Reins,</hi> which muſt be Long, and a little Ring at one End, and put the other End into that Ring, and ſo put it about the <hi>Pommel,</hi> and then put the reſt Down by the Fore-Bolſter of the <hi>Saddle</hi> under your <hi>Thigh</hi>; and the reſt of the <hi>Rein</hi> put through the Ring on the ſame Side of the <hi>Cavezone,</hi> and ſo bring it Back again, either to be in your Hand, or Tie it to the <hi>Pommel</hi> Straight; and do the ſame with the other <hi>Rein</hi> in All things, as I told you with This.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cavezone</hi> is to Stay, to Raiſe, and to make the Horſe Leight; to Teach him to Turn, to Stop, to Firm his <hi>Neck,</hi> to Aſſure and Adjuſt his <hi>Head,</hi> and his <hi>Croup,</hi> without Offending his <hi>Mouth,</hi> or the place of the <hi>Curb</hi>; and alſo to Supple and Help his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and his <hi>Leggs</hi> and <hi>Feet</hi> Before.</p>

                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:52970:86"/>Therefore I would Uſe it to all Horſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; for they will go much Better with the <hi>Bitt</hi> alone, having their <hi>Mouth</hi> preſerved, and made ſo Senſible, as they will be Attentive to all the Motions of the <hi>Hand:</hi> So that there is nothing for the Exerciſe of the <hi>Mannage</hi> like it, with a Canon <hi>A la Pignatel,</hi> the Branches <hi>A la Cone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,</hi> and the <hi>Cavezone</hi> together: But then the <hi>Cavezone</hi> muſt be <hi>My Way,</hi> as I Told you; and that doth ſo Supple them, and is ſo Right, as it makes All Horſes whatſoever, if you Work them upon their <hi>Trott, Gallop, Stopping,</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Back,</hi> with <hi>Paſſeger,</hi> and <hi>Raiſing</hi> them as you Ought, and according to the Rules of <hi>Art:</hi> For this makes them Subject to the <hi>Senſe of Feeling,</hi> which is the Sence we ought to Work on; to Feel the Hand, and to Feel the Heels, which is All; and not to the <hi>Senſe of the Sight,</hi> which is the <hi>Routin of the Pillars,</hi> or the <hi>Senſe of Noiſe,</hi> which is the <hi>Routin of Hearing,</hi> but only the <hi>Senſe of Feeling,</hi> and only of thoſe two Places, which is the <hi>Mouth</hi> and the <hi>Sides.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52970:87"/>
                     <hi>Gambals,</hi> like <hi>Bankes</hi>'s Horſe; and though the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Admire them, yet thoſe Perſons ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Teach a Horſe to Go Well in the <hi>Mannage.</hi> There are many Things in the <hi>Senſe of Feeling,</hi> which are to be Done with ſo great <hi>Art, Witt,</hi> and <hi>Judgement,</hi> and require ſo great Experience of the ſeveral <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> of Horſes, that it is not every <hi>Mans Caſe</hi> to be an <hi>Horſe-man,</hi> as it is to make a Dogg or a Horſe <hi>Dance:</hi> But I am Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to let the Ignorant Talk, and Think what they will, for I am not Concerned with their Folly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cavezon's</hi> inward <hi>Rein</hi> tyed ſhort to the <hi>Pommel</hi> My Way, is Excellent to give a Horſe an <hi>Apuy,</hi> and Settle him upon the Hand, and make him Firm, and his <hi>Head</hi> Steady: So it is Excellent for a Horſe that is too Hard on the Hand; for the <hi>Cavezon's Rein</hi> being always within the <hi>Turn</hi> tyed very Straight to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> keeps him from Reſting too much on the <hi>Bitt,</hi> which makes him Leight, and Firm on the Hand. The Inward <hi>Cavezone's Rein</hi> tied ſhort to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> is Excellent alſo to Supple a Horſe's
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52970:87"/>
                     <hi>Shoulders,</hi> which is the Beſt thing that can be; for it gives <hi>Apuy</hi> where there is none, and where there is too much <hi>Apuy,</hi> it takes it away, and Supples his <hi>Shoulders</hi> extreamly, which is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing; it alſo makes a Horſe <hi>Gallop</hi> very Right, with his <hi>Leggs,</hi> as alſo his <hi>Leggs</hi> very Right for <hi>Terra a Terra</hi>; for it Lengthens his <hi>Leggs</hi> within the <hi>Turn,</hi> and Shortens his <hi>Leggs</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Turn,</hi> which is Right as it ſhould be. So it is Good for Working his <hi>Shoulders</hi> in all Kindes, and his <hi>Croup</hi> laſt, <hi>Legg</hi> and <hi>Rein</hi> of a Side, as alſo to Work <hi>Legg</hi> and <hi>Rein</hi> Contrary, in all Kinds of ſeveral <hi>Leſſons.</hi> And this is the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety of Tying the inward <hi>Cavezone's Rein</hi> ſhort to the <hi>Pommel.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Cavezone</hi> (My Way) works Powerfully upon the <hi>Noſe,</hi> and ſo hath the greater Pull to give the Horſe the greater <hi>Ply</hi> and <hi>Bent,</hi> being the part the Fartheſt off from your <hi>Hand.</hi> And this <hi>Ply,</hi> or <hi>Bent,</hi> is from his <hi>Noſe</hi> to his <hi>Withers,</hi> which is to Bend his <hi>Neck,</hi> and Works too on the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> this is to <hi>Bent</hi> into the <hi>Turn</hi>; it Pulls his <hi>Head</hi> down too, and makes him Look

So that the Inward <hi>Cavezon</hi>'s <hi>Rein</hi> Tyed to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> or elſe in your <hi>Hand,</hi> is, For <hi>All</hi> things whatſoever; <hi>Croup,</hi> In or Out; <hi>Trott, Gallop, Paſſager</hi>; all <hi>Ayres, Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52970:89"/>
Going Back, Paſſadoes</hi>; or any thing in the World that is in the <hi>Mannage:</hi> For without it no Horſe can be Perfectly Dreſt, in any Kind, to have the <hi>Ply</hi> of his <hi>Neck,</hi> and to <hi>Supple</hi> his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> to <hi>Look</hi> into the <hi>Turn,</hi> to have his <hi>Leggs</hi> go <hi>Right,</hi> as they Ought to do in all Actions; his Body rightly <hi>Bent,</hi> to be part of the <hi>Circle</hi> he goes in, and <hi>Bent</hi> that Way. So it is All in All for every <hi>Thing,</hi> every <hi>Ayre,</hi> and every <hi>Action</hi> the Horſe can make.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cavezone</hi> being upon the <hi>Noſe,</hi> preſerves the Horſe's <hi>Mouth,</hi> and Barrs, and place of the <hi>Curb</hi>; and it is ſo Effectual, as it will Dreſs a Horſe without the <hi>Bitt,</hi> which the <hi>Bitt</hi> ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Do without the <hi>Cavezone</hi>; for the <hi>Barrs</hi> and the <hi>Curb</hi> are too Tender: Beſides, the Reins of the <hi>Bitt</hi> can never give him the <hi>Ply,</hi> nor <hi>Bend</hi> him Enough, nor <hi>Supple</hi> his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> becauſe it is ſo Near you, and Works upon the Barrs and the Curb; which cannot <hi>Bend</hi> him poſſibly ſo, as that upon his <hi>Noſe,</hi> becauſe the Branches of the Bitt are ſo Slow, and the Barrs and the Curb ſo Low, that there is not Room enough to Pull as with a <hi>Cavezone,</hi> that is ſo much Higher; and hath ſo
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52970:89"/>
much Room to Pull, and pulls and <hi>Plyes</hi> him, all from his <hi>Noſe</hi> to his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> when the other can do little more than Pull his Muſle, and his Head, and goes no further: The <hi>Cavezone's</hi> Rein within is for every Thing, the <hi>Bitt</hi> otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>To Supple his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> you muſt Help with the Outward <hi>Rein,</hi> and to Stay his Outward <hi>Shoulder</hi> with the Inward <hi>Rein</hi>; which hath not near the Force the <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s <hi>Rein</hi> hath for every Thing: Therefore Uſe it in All things, and with all <hi>Horſes, Colts,</hi> Half-Dreſt <hi>Horſes,</hi> Ready <hi>Horſes,</hi> Young, Middle-Age, Old, and every <hi>Horſe,</hi> and all <hi>Horſes</hi>; for there is no <hi>Dreſſing Horſes</hi> Without it, and with it you will <hi>Dreſs</hi> all Horſes whatſoever, and of what Diſpoſition ſoever; Weak, Middle-Strength, or Strong, and Reduce all Vices with it; and when you Uſe the <hi>Bitt,</hi> they will go much the Better, for having been wrought Continually with the <hi>Cavezone.</hi>

which is another Engine, that Works upon the Horſes <hi>Barrs,</hi> and the <hi>Curb</hi>; and the two <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> are like <hi>Leavers</hi> to Work on thoſe two Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: as the <hi>Reins</hi> pull the <hi>Cheeks,</hi> either the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cheek, or the outward Cheek; The <hi>Barrs,</hi> and the place of the <hi>Curb,</hi> is much Lower than his <hi>Noſe,</hi> on which the <hi>Cavezone</hi> Works; and the <hi>Rings</hi> where the <hi>Reins</hi> of the <hi>Bridle</hi> are Faſtned, at the Ends of the <hi>Cheeks,</hi> are much Lower than the <hi>Barrs,</hi> or the <hi>Curb</hi>; but as the <hi>Cheeks</hi> are pull'd by the Reins of the <hi>Bridle,</hi> ſo doth the <hi>Bitt</hi> Work upon the <hi>Barrs,</hi> or the <hi>Curb,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                  <p>As for Example; On the <hi>Right Hand,</hi> the <hi>Reins</hi> ſeparated in both your <hi>Hands,</hi> if you pull the inward <hi>Rein</hi> from his <hi>Neck</hi> on the inſide, then you pull the Inward <hi>Cheek</hi> into the <hi>Turn,</hi> and then the Mouth of the <hi>Bitt</hi> goes Out, and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Horſe on his <hi>Barrs,</hi> without the <hi>Turn</hi>; and makes the Horſe Look Out of the <hi>Turn,</hi> and Preſſes the <hi>Curb</hi> on the Outſide, and muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity do ſo; for when the <hi>Cheeks</hi> are pulled In, the Mouth of the <hi>Bitt</hi> muſt go out: For of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52970:93"/>
what Side ſoever the <hi>Cheeks</hi> are pulled, the Mouth of the <hi>Bitt</hi> goes ſtill contrary to the <hi>Cheeks,</hi> and muſt do ſo in all Reaſon; the <hi>Bitt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Inſtrument that is Made ſo to do, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Operation it hath for the <hi>Left Hand</hi>: if you pull the Inward <hi>Rein</hi> from his <hi>Neck,</hi> the Mouth goes ſtill Contrary to the <hi>Cheek</hi>; the <hi>Cheek</hi> goes Inward, and the <hi>Mouth</hi> goes Outward, and the Horſes <hi>Leggs</hi> are Preſt on the Inſide of the <hi>Turn</hi>; therefore in <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> the <hi>Reins</hi> Separated in both my <hi>Hands,</hi> I pull the Inward <hi>Rein</hi> beyond his <hi>Neck,</hi> my <hi>Knuckles</hi> towards his <hi>Neck,</hi> which pulls the Inward <hi>Cheek</hi> to me, and then the Mouth goes Contrary; that is, The <hi>Cheek</hi> is put from the <hi>Turn,</hi> and the <hi>Mouth</hi> bends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Turn,</hi> and the Horſe Looks into the <hi>Turn</hi> as he ſhould do, and the Horſes <hi>Leggs</hi> preſt on the Outſide of the <hi>Turn,</hi> on the <hi>Left Hand:</hi> The Inward <hi>Rein</hi> pull'd thus, hath the ſame Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; your <hi>Hand</hi> being on the Outſide of his <hi>Neck,</hi> and your <hi>Knuckles</hi> towards his <hi>Neck,</hi> pulls the Inward <hi>Cheek</hi> from the <hi>Turn,</hi> and the

                     <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Bitt</hi> goes into the <hi>Turn,</hi> alwayes Contrary, and cannot be Otherwiſe; it Preſſes the Horſe on the Inſide of the <hi>Barrs,</hi> and on the Inſide of the <hi>Curb,</hi> and ſo Looks into the <hi>Turn</hi>; and his <hi>Leggs</hi> are Preſt on the Outſide of the <hi>Turn,</hi> which is Proper for <hi>Terra a Terra.</hi> And thus Working with the <hi>Bitt,</hi> Produces many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things, for <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> as I have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſet down afore.</p>

                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:52970:101"/>And now you ſee, <hi>Corrections</hi> are Better than <hi>Helps,</hi> and of what great Efficacy the <hi>Spurrs</hi> timely and diſcreetly given, are for the Dreſſing of Horſes; for there is but the <hi>Hand</hi> and the <hi>Heels,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Spurrs</hi> are Half the Buſineſs in Dreſſing Horſes; only the <hi>Hand</hi> hath the Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence: Though there be two <hi>Spurrs,</hi> and but one <hi>Bridle,</hi> becauſe the Horſe hath but one <hi>Mouth,</hi> and two <hi>Sides</hi>; yet, if the Horſe be not Settled upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> you cannot make him Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Heels.</hi> But the <hi>Correction</hi> of the <hi>Spurrs</hi> is ſo Neceſſary, and Effectual, as no Horſe can be made a <hi>Ready-Horſe</hi> without them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Eſteem them Highly, next ſetling a Horſe upon the <hi>Hand</hi>; which muſt be Firſt.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Helps</hi> are to Prevent Faults, and to go before Faults; as <hi>Corrections</hi> come after Faults, to Puniſh for Offending. The <hi>Spurrs</hi> are to be uſed as a Help thus; When the Horſe goes <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> your outward <hi>Legg</hi> cloſe to him when he Slacks, turn your <hi>Heel</hi> to him to Pinch him with the <hi>Spurrs</hi>; which you may eaſily do, even to Blood, and no Body perceive it; for that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52970:101"/>
ought to be done Neatly, and Delicately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Spurrs</hi> are a Neat, and moſt Excellent Help, and the Quinteſſence of all Helps in the <hi>Mannage</hi>; and if the Horſe Suffer and Obey this, whilſt you ſtay him on the <hi>Hand,</hi> you may ſay, He is an Excellent Horſe.</p>
                  <p>This Quickens him, and puts him Forward; but yet let me Tell you, Though this is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Help for <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> yet it is not ſo good a Help for <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> as it is for all <hi>Ayres</hi>; either to <hi>Pinch</hi> him with both the <hi>Spurrs,</hi> or but with one: And the Reaſon, is, Becauſe it makes him <hi>Croup</hi> more, and puts him Together on his Hinder-parts, than puts him Forward; and therefore more proper for all manner of <hi>Ayres,</hi> than for <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> though very good for both.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for that Excellent Help with the <hi>Spurrs,</hi> call'd <hi>Pinching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another Help with the <hi>Spurrs,</hi> which I call a <hi>Help,</hi> becauſe it is not ſo Violent as a <hi>Correction,</hi> and is not ſo Preſſing as <hi>Pinching</hi>; but
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52970:102"/>
between <hi>Spurring</hi> and <hi>Pinching</hi>; And that is thus: When the Horſe Gallops his <hi>Croup</hi> In, or <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> if he Obeys not the <hi>Legg</hi> enough, being cloſe to him, or very near it, then make the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with your <hi>Legg,</hi> as if you did <hi>Spurr</hi> him, and Hit him with your <hi>Spurr,</hi> with as gentle a Touch as can be; and no more than to let him Feel it a little; and this is the Gentleſt of all things, with the <hi>Spurrs,</hi> which makes him Obey the <hi>Spurrs,</hi> and puts him Forward, and is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> or <hi>Le petit Gallop his Croup In,</hi> and much Better than Pinching; for it puts him Forward, and makes him Obey the <hi>Spurrs</hi> at the ſame time; but it is not good for <hi>Ayres</hi>; for there he ſhould Leap Upwards, and go Forward, but very Little; and therefore <hi>Pinching</hi> is Beſt for <hi>Ayres,</hi> becauſe it Raiſes his <hi>Croup,</hi> and therefore goes not Forward; and that little Touch with the <hi>Spur,</hi> like <hi>Spurring,</hi> is good for <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> and <hi>Le petit Gallop his Croup In,</hi> becauſe it puts him Forward, and makes him Obey the <hi>Spur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If your Horſe underſtands this <hi>Correction,</hi> and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52970:102"/>
the two ſeveral <hi>Helps</hi> with the <hi>Spurrs,</hi> being made Senſible to him, you may be well Aſſured he will Need none of them after a while, but be ſo Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as he will go Freely, and Obey you Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, only with the <hi>Calf</hi> of your <hi>Legg</hi>; for the Help of the <hi>Thighes</hi> is a Ridiculous conceit: for indeed, there is no <hi>Helps</hi> but the <hi>Spurrs,</hi> and the <hi>Calf</hi> of the <hi>Leggs,</hi> that the Horſe can poſſibly Feel.</p>

                  <p>I would have you <hi>Trott</hi> him without Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of him upon his <hi>Trott</hi>; but from his <hi>Trott</hi> to <hi>Gallop</hi> him, <hi>Le petit Gallop</hi> Gently; and from his <hi>Gallop</hi> to his <hi>Trott</hi> again; and though of the ſame <hi>Hand</hi> ſtill, yet Change him from <hi>Trott</hi> to <hi>Gallop,</hi> and from <hi>Gallop</hi> to <hi>Trott,</hi> until you think it Sufficient, and then Stop him, either upon a <hi>Trott,</hi> or <hi>Gallop,</hi> which you pleaſe: This is a moſt Excellent Leſſon; not only to Supple his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> but to make him Attend, and Obey the Will of his <hi>Rider</hi>; having no continued
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52970:119"/>
Rule to Fix his Mind on, to go by <hi>Rote,</hi> either in <hi>Trotting,</hi> or <hi>Galloping,</hi> but ſtill to Obey the Man, as he <hi>Helps</hi> or <hi>Commands</hi> him to either; and not Knowing when it is, he muſt abſolutely Obey both the <hi>Hand</hi> and the <hi>Heel</hi>; and ſo Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſometimes upon a <hi>Trott,</hi> and ſometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Gallop</hi>; not Knowing when he ſhould be Stopt, nor where he ſhould be Stopt, makes him ſtill to Obey the Man's both <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Heel</hi>; and therefore a Better Leſſon cannot be in the World; and therefore Uſe it: For, all our End, is, To make a Horſe Obey the <hi>Hand</hi> and the <hi>Heels</hi>; And this Leſſon doth it, as much as any Leſſon can do.</p>
                  <p>If the Horſe Retain his Forces, then <hi>Gallop</hi> him Faſt, and Quick; and then Softly again, and then Faſt again, as Occaſion ſerves: And this Softly, and Quick, upon his <hi>Gallop,</hi> (not Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he muſt do Either) makes him Obey both his Riders <hi>Hand,</hi> and <hi>Heels</hi>; which is the End of our Work, and the Quinteſſence of the <hi>Mannage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you have Suppled the Horſe ſufficiently
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52970:119"/>
on the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and find him Hard on the <hi>Hand,</hi> in not being upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; then <hi>Trot</hi> him <hi>Large D'une piste,</hi> and Stop him Often, and good Hard Stops with your outward <hi>Legg</hi>; and pull him down, your <hi>Body</hi> back, and when he leaſt Thinks of it; but if he would Stop of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, put him Forward without Stopping of him, and Stop him when he Thinks not of it, and do the ſame upon a <hi>Gallop:</hi> Stop him Often, and Hard, and put him Back ſometimes, and you will find him very much upon the <hi>Hanches.</hi> This is an Excellent Leſſon, both to Settle him on the <hi>Hand,</hi> and to put him upon the <hi>Hanches:</hi> But when you have done that, you muſt not Continue this Leſſon long, for it Pinches a Horſe very much on the Back; beſides, it makes him Fearful to go Forward, and ſo may make him Reſty, and many Inconveniencies may come of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your own Judgment muſt Work according to Occaſion, when you do Stop him (as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly have Told you:) You muſt Stop him upon a <hi>Walk</hi> too, as well as upon a <hi>Trott,</hi> or a <hi>Gallop.</hi>

                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:52970:120"/>All theſe Leſſons are only to Supple a Horſes <hi>Shoulders</hi>; and ſee that you Uſe no other Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than Theſe, until the Horſe be extreamly Supple of his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and be Firm on the <hi>Hand:</hi> Theſe are Rare Leſſons, To ſettle a Horſe upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> to Supple his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> to make him Look into the <hi>Turn,</hi> to <hi>Trott</hi> and <hi>Gallop</hi> Right, (as he ſhould do) both <hi>Leggs, Head, Neck, Body,</hi> and all: And, beſides theſe, if you Work, as I have Told you, the Horſe ſhall never be <hi>Entier</hi>; which the <hi>Italians</hi> call the <hi>Credenza,</hi> which is the Worſt Vice a Horſe can have, and the moſt Dangerous. And theſe Leſſons, with the <hi>Cavezone</hi> (My Way) hath theſe Rare Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p>You muſt alwayes Uſe theſe Leſſons, until the Horſe be extreamly Supple of his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principal Thing in Dreſſing Horſes, and the Firſt of our Work: Horſes doth nothing but by Cuſtom, and Habit, with often Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Fortify their Memories; and by good Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Methodical; and ſo do all Men in all Things that they do, Good or Bad: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52970:120"/>
give theſe Good Leſſons, and Repeat them Often to your Horſe, and you will find by them Benefit, and Contentment: And Remember, that I Work upon the Underſtanding of a Horſe, more than the Labour of his Body; for I aſſure you, he hath Imagination, Memory, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Let the Learned ſay what they Pleaſe: I Work upon Thoſe three Faculties; and that is the Cauſe my Horſes go ſo Well.</p>
                  <p>Here is now the End of all my Leſſons, in Working a Horſe to Supple his <hi>Shoulders</hi>; which if you can do, according to thoſe Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, then I will Aſſure you, you have done the better Half of the work, in Dreſſing, and Making up a perfect Horſe.</p>
                  <p>The next Leſſons are the other Half, and the Eaſier; which is, To make him Senſible to the <hi>Heels</hi>; and thoſe ſhall follow, after ſome certain Maxims, which I will Inſert here, and pray you to <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Remember</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>The moſt Certain means to Unite a Horſes Forces; to Aſſure, and Settle his <hi>Head,</hi> and his <hi>Hanches</hi>; to make him Leight on the <hi>Hand</hi>; and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52970:121"/>
to make him Capable of all Juſtneſs and Firmneſs in all ſorts of <hi>Ayres,</hi> and <hi>Mannages</hi>; Depends abſolutely on the perfection on the Stop (as I have Told you;) but firſt he muſt be Looſen'd and Suppl'd upon the <hi>Trott.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Going Back is a Remedy, to put him upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; to Accommodate, and Adjuſt his <hi>Hinder-Feet</hi>; and Settle him on the <hi>Hand</hi>; and to make him Leight <hi>Before</hi>; to Stop Leightly, and in juſt Proportion.</p>
                  <p>You muſt never <hi>Gallop</hi> your Horſe, until he be ſo Leight upon his <hi>Trott,</hi> as he begins to <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop</hi> of himſelf: For the Exerciſe of the <hi>Trott,</hi> is the firſt, and moſt neceſſary Foundation to make him Leight; and is the Ground of every Leſſon, which can make the Horſe <hi>Adroit,</hi> and <hi>Obedient</hi>; and on which muſt be the Foundation of all ſorts of <hi>Mannages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Property of the <hi>Gallop,</hi> is, To give him a good <hi>Apuy,</hi> and to Settle his <hi>Head</hi>; and if he have too much <hi>Fougue,</hi> or Fire, <hi>Le petit Gallop</hi> will Appeaſe him, and give him Patience; and if he Playes too much on the <hi>Back,</hi> it will take it off:

                  <p>To Work the Horſes <hi>Croup</hi> and <hi>Shoulders</hi> together, is, With the Inward <hi>Reyn,</hi> and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Legg</hi>; the inward <hi>Reyn</hi> of the <hi>Cavezone</hi> in your <hi>Hand,</hi> and pull'd on the Inſide of the <hi>Turn,</hi> to bring In his Outward <hi>Shoulder,</hi> and to Preſs the Horſe on the Inſide of the <hi>Turn,</hi> that his <hi>Leggs</hi> without the <hi>Turn</hi> may be Free, and at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to lapp over his inward <hi>Leggs</hi>; which we call <hi>Paſſager,</hi> or <hi>En-Cavalier,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> In. This <hi>Paſſager,</hi> though it is the Action of a <hi>Trott</hi> with his <hi>Leggs,</hi> yet it is leſs Violent than a <hi>Trott,</hi> and more than a <hi>Walk</hi>; which is the beſt Action to Teach a Horſe any thing of a Short <hi>Trott,</hi> and Together.</p>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>Leſſon</hi> therefore that you muſt give him, upon this Action, is, His <hi>Head</hi> to the <hi>Wall,</hi> pulling the Inward <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s Reyn hard to you, on the Inſide, and Helping at the ſame time, with your outward <hi>Legg,</hi> the Horſe to go <hi>Byas,</hi> his <hi>Shoulders</hi> before his <hi>Croup</hi>; which makes him Narrow behind, and ſo upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>;

                  </head>
                  <p>WHen he Obeys perfectly the <hi>Heel,</hi> upon this <hi>Leſſon</hi> of <hi>Byas</hi> in <hi>Paſſager,</hi> then put him upon his <hi>Voltoes,</hi> or <hi>Circles,</hi> upon <hi>Paſſager,</hi> pulling the inward <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s Reyn on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of his <hi>Neck,</hi> hard to you, to bring in his outward <hi>Shoulder</hi>; and your Contrary <hi>Legg, Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> contrary, bending his <hi>Neck</hi> extreamly; and if he do not Obey the <hi>Heel,</hi> give him the <hi>Spurr</hi> with your outward <hi>Legg,</hi> and then do as much on the other <hi>Hand</hi>; and when you find him very Obedient, upon <hi>Paſſager,</hi> a little <hi>Large,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> In, which puts him upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; Becauſe his <hi>Croup</hi> is In, and becauſe it is upon the Action of a <hi>Trott,</hi> and the <hi>Leſs Circle,</hi> he is alwayes the moſt Preſt, and therefore upon the <hi>Hanches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, When he is perfectly Obedient to your <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Heels,</hi> upon his <hi>Voltoes</hi> ſomewhat <hi>Large,</hi> then make him go upon his <hi>Paſſager,</hi> in little
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52970:123"/>
more than his Length; and if he be Obedient to your <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Heel</hi> there, on both Hands, he is Advanced very Far towards a <hi>Ready-Horſe:</hi> For, if a Horſe Obey my <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Heel</hi> upon <hi>Paſſager,</hi> which is a gentle Motion, and therefore proper to Learn a Horſe, becauſe it makes him Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and fortifies his Memory the Better. I ſay, if he be Obedient to me upon this Action, which is the Quinteſſence of Dreſſing Horſes, then I can make him do Any thing, that his Forces will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him.</p>
                  <p>When the Horſe is Perfect in the aforeſaid Leſſons, then put him upon his <hi>Voltoes,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> In; upon <hi>Le petit Gallop,</hi> thus: Pull the Inward <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s Reyn hard to you on the Inſide of his <hi>Neck,</hi> and your outward <hi>Legg</hi> to Help him, Poyſing more on the outward <hi>Stirrup,</hi> than on the Inward; and Bend his <hi>Neck</hi> extreamly, that he may be Preſt on the Out-ſide of the <hi>Turn,</hi> which is proper for <hi>Le petit Gallop his Croup In</hi>; and Help him with your <hi>Tongue,</hi> and he will go preſently very Perfectly; and giving him good Stops, he is advanced very far towards a <hi>Ready-Horſe.</hi>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:52970:124"/>
There is no Difference here between <hi>Le petit Gallop,</hi> and <hi>Terra a terra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When your Horſe Obeys all theſe <hi>Leſſons</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; which is, To obey your <hi>Hand,</hi> and the <hi>Heels,</hi> Teach him to Advance; which is, to Riſe <hi>Before</hi>; without which no Horſe can be a <hi>Ready-Horſe:</hi> You may do it when you Stop him, or upon Large Circles, ſtaying him upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> helping him with your <hi>Tongue,</hi> and your <hi>Leggs,</hi> and <hi>Rodd,</hi> if there be cauſe; and put him Forward ſtill after it, and <hi>Raiſe</hi> him again. But if he <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of himſelf, put him Forward, and let him not <hi>Riſe,</hi> but when you would have him; and he will very ſoon Obey you.</p>
                  <p>When he <hi>Riſes</hi> perfectly (when you would have him) upon Large Circles, then put his <hi>Croup</hi> In upon his <hi>Voltoes,</hi> and <hi>Raiſe</hi> him ſo; and then Feel him upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> and Stay him a little when he is Up; and this will both put him upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> and upon the <hi>Hanches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why I would not have you <hi>Raiſe</hi> him before now, was, Becauſe it would Diſorder his <hi>Mouth,</hi> and put him Off of the <hi>Hand,</hi> and make him <hi>Resty</hi>;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52970:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for many Horſes Riſes <hi>Reſtily,</hi> becauſe they would not go Forward, nor Turn; for, until they <hi>Obey</hi> the <hi>Hand,</hi> and <hi>Fly</hi> the <hi>Heel,</hi> there is no Raiſing of them.</p>
                  <p>I would have you always begin upon Large Circles his <hi>Croup</hi> Out, and then put In his <hi>Croup</hi> afterward; and ſo End.</p>
                  <p>When the Horſe is perfect in all theſe former Leſſons, then I would have you Tie the inward <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s <hi>Reyn</hi> hard to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> and Work him upon all former Leſſons ſo, with the inward <hi>Reyn,</hi> and inward <hi>Legg</hi>; and the outward <hi>Reyn,</hi> if need be, his <hi>Croup</hi> Out. Upon Large Circles, his <hi>Croup</hi> In, the inward <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s <hi>Reyn</hi> Tied to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> and Help'd with the inward <hi>Reyn</hi> of the <hi>Bridle,</hi> to preſs him on the outſide of the <hi>Turn,</hi> for <hi>Paſſager:</hi> But when you Raiſe him in <hi>Paſſadoes,</hi> then the inward <hi>Reyn</hi>; when the inward <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s <hi>Reyn</hi> is Tied to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> then you Work moſt on the <hi>Bitt</hi>; for you have nothing elſe in your <hi>Hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Help, with the <hi>Bridle</hi> alone, upon Large Circles, his <hi>Croup</hi> Out, inward <hi>Reyn,</hi> and inward
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52970:125"/>
                     <hi>Legg</hi>; or outward <hi>Reyn</hi> and inward <hi>Legg,</hi> if his <hi>Shoulders</hi> come not In enough; but upon <hi>Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> with the <hi>Bridle</hi> alone, the inward <hi>Reyn,</hi> and outward <hi>Legg,</hi> for the Reaſons I have told you.</p>
                  <p>It is an Excellent Leſſon to <hi>Gallop</hi> a Horſe forth Right, and to Stop him, and to Raiſe him only with the <hi>Bitt,</hi> and then to Turn him, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the outward <hi>Reyn,</hi> which will prepare him for <hi>Paſſadoes</hi>; of which we will Talk hereafter.</p>
                  <p>There is an Excellent Leſſon, the inward <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vazone</hi>'s <hi>Reyn</hi> Tied to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> which is this: To Gallop <hi>D'une piſte</hi> a Narrow Circle, and ſo Four of them, and ſtill put him Forward to take the other Circle; and afterward to do the ſame upon every Circle, his <hi>Croup</hi> in, <hi>Le petit Gallop,</hi> or <hi>Terra a terra</hi>; and put him Forward to take the next Circle, and ſo as often as you think good to Repeat all the Four: And this makes him Attend the <hi>Hand</hi> and the <hi>Heel,</hi> and moſt Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to both.</p>
                  <p>The inward <hi>Reyn</hi> puts the Horſe on the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, indeed all his Body, and Leans on his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52970:125"/>
                     <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> and Weighs his <hi>Fore-Parts</hi> up; and therefore on the <hi>Hanches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The outward <hi>Reyn</hi> puts the Horſe on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and Weighs him down; and therefore on the <hi>Shoulders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You muſt have a Method to be often Repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all theſe good and Excellent Leſſons; Leſſon after Leſſon, or elſe you will never Dreſs any Horſe perfectly for <hi>Terra a Terra.</hi>

                  <head>Needful OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>NAturally whenſoever a Horſe's <hi>Shoulders</hi> come In, his <hi>Croup</hi> goes out; and when his <hi>Croup</hi> is put In too much, his <hi>Shoulders</hi> go out. As for Example; Upon Large Circles his <hi>Shoulders</hi> come In, his <hi>Croup</hi> goes out; and when his <hi>Head</hi> is as to the Pillar, (<hi>Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> of a ſide) his <hi>Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> come In, and his <hi>Croup</hi> goes out: Nay, in the right <hi>Terra a terra,</hi> his <hi>Shoulders</hi> going before,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:52970:126"/>
his <hi>Croup</hi> ſhuns the Center, which is a little out, though you think his <hi>Croup</hi> is In.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, How is it then in <hi>Paſſager</hi> when his <hi>Croup</hi> is In? I ſay, that is another Action than a <hi>Gallop,</hi> or <hi>Terra a terra</hi>; becauſe then he is upon the Action of a <hi>Trott,</hi> which is Croſs, and may better admit to be Preſt within the <hi>Turn,</hi> and his <hi>Leggs</hi> at Liberty without the <hi>Turn</hi>; but yet (if his <hi>Shoulders</hi> go before his <hi>Croup,</hi> and is <hi>Byas</hi> as he ought to be, in reſpect of his <hi>Shoulders</hi>) his <hi>Croup</hi> is a little Out.</p>
                  <p>But now for <hi>Le petit Gallop,</hi> or <hi>Terra a terra</hi>; if his <hi>Croup</hi> be In, and you pull in his outward <hi>Shoulder,</hi> at the ſame time, it is a great Force, and Unnatural, ſo as the Horſe goes Croſs with his <hi>Leggs,</hi> and can go no otherwiſe, and is preſt on the Inſide. It is True, it puts the Horſe upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> and ſo of neceſſity upon the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and gives him an <hi>Apuy,</hi> which all the former Leſſons do; ſo that his <hi>Croup</hi> In needs it not, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is Falſe.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Terra a terra,</hi> He ſhould be Preſt on the Outſide, to have his <hi>Leggs</hi> at Liberty within to

                  <head>MORE OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>IF a Horſe goes Forward too much, pull him Back; if he goes Back, put him Forward; if if he goes Side-ways on the <hi>Right-Hand,</hi> put him Side-ways on the <hi>Left-Hand</hi>; if he goes Side-ways on the <hi>Left-Hand,</hi> put him Side-ways on the <hi>Right-Hand.</hi> If he puts Out his <hi>Croup,</hi> put it In; if he puts In his <hi>Croup,</hi> put it Out. If he goes on the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> ſtop him, and pull him Back; if he goes on the <hi>Hanches,</hi> continue him ſo; if he Riſes when you would not have him, keep him Down. All this upon a <hi>Walk</hi>; for thus he muſt Attend both your <hi>Hand</hi> and your <hi>Heel,</hi> and follow your Will, and ſo of Neceſſity muſt Obey you, becauſe thus he is put from his Will, to Yours. And this muſt make him a perfect Horſe; It is a moſt Excellent Leſſon.</p>
                  <p>Never put a Horſe upon any <hi>Ayre,</hi> nor
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52970:130"/>
Preſs him much, until you find him very Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and Obedient, both to your <hi>Hand,</hi> and to your <hi>Heel</hi>; and extreamly Supple: But Young Horſes muſt never be much Preſt, nor Stopt too hard; for if you do, you will give them ſuch a Crick, and Taint in their <hi>Back,</hi> as they will never Recover it.</p>
                  <p>The Horſe's <hi>Head</hi> to the Pillar, (or an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Center) the Pillar without his <hi>Head</hi>; and the Horſe's <hi>Croup</hi> to the Pillar, the Pillar on the Inſide of his <hi>Croup.</hi> And thus the Horſe ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be <hi>Entier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I never Work a Horſe's <hi>Head</hi> to the Pillar, (<hi>Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> contrary;) becauſe his inward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> goes ſo much before his <hi>Shoulder,</hi> which is Falſe; but <hi>Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> on a ſide, as I ſhewed you before.</p>
                  <p>To Work a Horſe upon Quarters, is to no purpoſe; for, it Confounds a Horſe more, than a whole Circle; but upon <hi>Demy-Voltoes,</hi> or half Turns, is very good ſomtimes.</p>
                  <p>To put a Horſe <hi>Byas</hi> on one <hi>Hand,</hi> and then put him Forward; and then put him <hi>Byas</hi> on the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52970:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other <hi>Hand,</hi> and then put him Forward; and ſo from <hi>Hand</hi> to <hi>Hand</hi>; and Forward, makes him Attend, and Obey both the <hi>Hand,</hi> and the <hi>Heel,</hi> and is an Excellent Leſſon: But, as you put him <hi>Byas,</hi> his Fore-parts muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes go before his Hinder-parts.</p>
                  <p>There is no Leſſon comparable to <hi>Paſſager,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> In, to make him Obey the <hi>Hand,</hi> and the <hi>Heel</hi>; and to Raiſe him in <hi>Paſſadoes,</hi> and <hi>Paſſager</hi> him again, ſtill <hi>Raiſing</hi> and <hi>Paſſager</hi>; and if you find he is not upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> then <hi>Walk,</hi> or <hi>Trott</hi> him upon Large Circles, and Stop him Hard, and Raiſe him. All theſe Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are upon a <hi>Walk,</hi> and <hi>Paſſager</hi>; therefore you may ſee what a Rare thing <hi>Walking,</hi> and <hi>Paſſager</hi> is, to Make, and Dreſs all Horſes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</p>
                  <p>Nay, when a Horſe is a perfect Dreſt Horſe, you muſt not make him go above Once a Week at the moſt, but Work him every Day upon his <hi>Trott, Gallop, Paſſager, Raiſing</hi> of him, and <hi>Tuning</hi> of him Thus, and with the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezone,</hi> he will go Rarely, when you would
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52970:131"/>
make him go upon any <hi>Ayre,</hi> or <hi>Terra a Terra.</hi> I ſay, a Horſe is thus to be <hi>Tuned</hi>; for, a Horſe having <hi>Four Leggs,</hi> is like a Fiddle of <hi>Four Strings</hi>; and if a Fiddle be not <hi>Tuned,</hi> the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian</hi> can never Play <hi>Salengers Round</hi> upon it: So, if a Horſe's <hi>Leggs</hi> be not rightly <hi>Tuned,</hi> he will never <hi>Dance</hi> his <hi>Round</hi> right.</p>
                  <p>Again, if you alwayes Play upon a Fiddle, though Well-Tuned at the firſt, it will ſoon be out of Tune by continual Playing on it; ſo a Ready-Horſe, if you make him go perpetually, he will be ſoon out of Tune; and therefore you muſt Tune him ſtill, as I have told you.</p>

                  <head>THE JUST &amp; EXACT WAY FOR TERRA A TERRA.</head>
                  <p>TO go upon a Square for <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> is Good, but not the Beſt Way; for, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52970:131"/>
a Horſe too much; ſo that he cannot go with that Freedom that he ſhould; and is in great Danger, that his Inward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> will go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Shoulder,</hi> and then it would be very Falſe: therefore the True, Eaſie, and Beſt way is this that follows.</p>
                  <p>You muſt Sit Straight in the <hi>Saddle,</hi> the poiſe on the outward Stirrup, but not to Lean down upon it too much; but only the outward <hi>Legg</hi> is to be a little Longer than the inward <hi>Legg</hi>; and the inward <hi>Legg</hi> to be a little Before it, but very little; and Sit you muſt all upon the <hi>Twiſt,</hi> and <hi>Stirrups,</hi> and as Forward to the <hi>Pommel</hi> as you can; the outward <hi>Legg</hi> cloſe to the Horſe, and the <hi>Knee</hi> turned inwards; and Stiff in the <hi>Ham,</hi> to bring the Calf of the <hi>Legg</hi> to the Horſe. Then for the <hi>Bridle-Hand</hi>; on the <hi>Right-Hand</hi> put your <hi>Hand</hi> on the outſide of his <hi>Neck,</hi> or turn the <hi>Knuckles</hi> towards his <hi>Neck,</hi> pulling your little <hi>Finger</hi> up ſtraight without turning your <hi>Hand,</hi> which pulls the inward <hi>Reyn</hi> lying above your little <hi>Finger,</hi> your <hi>Arm</hi> a little from your <hi>Body</hi> oblike, your <hi>Left Shoulder</hi> coming a little
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52970:132"/>
In, and your <hi>Neck</hi> behind, removed a little on the Left ſide, and your <hi>Buttons</hi> a little on the Right ſide: This makes the Horſe neceſſarily to go <hi>Byas.</hi> But now I muſt tell you where you muſt Look, or Turn your <hi>Head</hi>; which muſt be on the inſide of the <hi>Turn,</hi> to the Inſide of the Horſes <hi>Head,</hi> which keeps your <hi>Hand</hi> ſteady; for did you Look to your inward <hi>Shoulder,</hi> it would remove your <hi>Bridle-Hand</hi> too much within the <hi>Turn</hi>; and did you Look juſt between the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Ears,</hi> your outward <hi>Shoulder</hi> would not come In enough; and neither it, nor you, nor the Horſe would be oblike; your <hi>Hand</hi> muſt go Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly with the Horſe, and Steadily; and but to feel him.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Horſe being <hi>Byas,</hi> the inward <hi>Reyn</hi> pull'd thus, inlarges the Horſe before, in pulling his inward <hi>Fore-Legg,</hi> from the outward <hi>Fore-Legg</hi>; which puts his inward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> to his outward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> which Narrows him Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, makes him Bow in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> eſpecially on his outward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> which he Reſts on, and Thruſts his inward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> under his
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52970:132"/>
                     <hi>Belly</hi>; which (with all theſe things) makes him very much upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; the Horſe is preſt on the outſide, and therefore of neceſſity muſt Look within the <hi>Turn,</hi> and his Fore-parts being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, muſt imbrace the <hi>Turn</hi> the better; his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> being within the Lines of his <hi>Fore-Leggs,</hi> he muſt needs be upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; and his Inward <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> being pull'd from his outward <hi>Fore-Legg,</hi> (being <hi>Circular</hi>) his inward <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> of neceſſity muſt be Longer than his outward <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> to Lead, which is Right, and ſo makes the Largeſt Circle; and his outward <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> the Second Circle; and his inward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> the Third Circle; becauſe it is thruſt ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his outward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> and under his <hi>Belley</hi>; and his outward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> makes the Fourth and Leaſt Circle, becauſe he Reſts ſo much upon it, and Bows in the <hi>Gambrels.</hi> Thus the Horſe makes Four perfect Circles, about the Pillar, or Center, as I have Told you, and given you the Reaſons of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth the Horſes Fore-parts go always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Hinder-parts; that is, half his <hi>Shoulders</hi>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:52970:133"/>
within the <hi>Turn,</hi> before his half <hi>Croup</hi> within the <hi>Turn</hi>; which is his <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> within the <hi>Turn,</hi> before his <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> within the <hi>Turn:</hi> And thus the Horſe can never go Falſe, but moſt exactly True, with <hi>Head, Neck, Body, Leggs,</hi> and all.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Left-Hand,</hi> every thing muſt be as for the <hi>Right,</hi> and the ſame way, changing <hi>Hand, Body,</hi> and <hi>Legg</hi>; only for the <hi>Bridle-Hand,</hi> it is neceſſary, That when you go on the <hi>Left-Hand,</hi> you ſhould put your <hi>Hand</hi> on the contrary ſide of his <hi>Neck</hi>; your <hi>Arm</hi> cloſe to your <hi>Body,</hi> and the <hi>Knuckles</hi> of your <hi>Bridle-Hand</hi> turned towards his <hi>Neck,</hi> which pulls the inward <hi>Reyn</hi> for the <hi>Left-Hand</hi>; becauſe that <hi>Reyn</hi> lies under your little <hi>Finger</hi>; and this makes you Oblike, and the Horſe Oblike: And every thing for the <hi>Left Hand</hi> works as truly, in all thoſe ſeveral things, as I told you for the <hi>Right-Hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus the Horſe is within your <hi>Hand,</hi> and your <hi>Heel</hi>; and ſo you Drive him, and make him go as you Liſt; Slower, or Faſter; Higher, or Lower: But remember, That your <hi>Hand</hi> be not
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:52970:133"/>
too High, but that the Horſe may go Low, and Preſt; for if your <hi>Hand</hi> be Low, the Horſe goes Low; and if your <hi>Hand</hi> be High, the Horſe goes High: For the Horſe always goes according to the heighth of the <hi>Hand</hi>; and <hi>Terra a Terra</hi> ſhould always be Low, and Preſt.</p>
                  <p>Now I muſt tell you, That the inward <hi>Reyn</hi> Preſſes the Horſe on the outſide, Weighs him up, and puts him upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> eſpecially on his outward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> ſo that all his <hi>Body</hi> Leans on the outſide, and he cannot bring In his outward <hi>Shoulder</hi>; for it is Bound up, and his <hi>Leggs</hi> within the <hi>Turn</hi> to Lead: You may know by his <hi>Neck,</hi> whether he Leans on the Outſide or no; for if he does, his <hi>Neck</hi> will Lean all on the Outſide, and your <hi>Body</hi> muſt be Concave on the outſide, and Convex within; for being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave on the Outſide, makes the Horſe ſo, and puts In his <hi>Hanch,</hi> (being Preſt on the Outſide) and hath three <hi>Leggs</hi> in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> his two <hi>Fore-Leggs,</hi> and his inward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> with a Leap forward Low, and Preſt.

                  <head>One of the GREATEST SECRETS IN The MANNAGE that ever I found out.</head>
                  <p>THe inward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> to the <hi>Turn</hi> always put Out a little, Is in all things the Quinteſſence of the <hi>Mannage,</hi> whether his <hi>Croup</hi> Out, or In; the <hi>Knuckles</hi> of the <hi>Bridle-Hand</hi> towards his <hi>Neck,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> In, doth well in <hi>Terra a Terra</hi>; and always your Horſe to go <hi>Byas,</hi> upon his <hi>Voltoes,</hi> or his <hi>Head</hi> to the <hi>Wall,</hi> doth it Beſt; for his <hi>Shoulders</hi> going before, his Hinder-parts put out his inward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> which is the greateſt Buſineſs in the <hi>Mannage</hi>; for ſo his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> are near to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſo upon the <hi>Hanches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The inward <hi>Reyn</hi> of the <hi>Bridle</hi> doth it, pull'd, as I have told you, and ſo doth the inward <hi>Reyn</hi> of the <hi>Cavezone</hi>; for it puts out his inward <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Legg,</hi> Narrows him behind, and Inlarges him before; becauſe it pulls his inward <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> from
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52970:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his outward <hi>Fore-Legg,</hi> and therefore Inlarges him before; and at the ſame time, it puts his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> out, to his outward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi>; and therefore Narrows him behind, and ſo muſt of neceſſity be upon the <hi>Hanches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus his inward <hi>Fore-Legg</hi> muſt always be before his inward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> ſo that half his <hi>Shoulders</hi> goes always before half his <hi>Croup,</hi> by which means he can never go Falſe; and his Fore parts always Imbracing the <hi>Turn</hi> the better, and the outward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> being kept In a little, with your outward <hi>Legg,</hi> makes his two <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> within the Lines of his <hi>Fore-Leggs,</hi> which makes him upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> and his Fore-parts to Lead, as Horſes always ſhould do: For, they do not Work with their <hi>Arſes</hi> firſt, but with their <hi>Heads,</hi> and Fore-parts.</p>
                  <p>Remember, That no Horſe can be upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> but thoſe that Bend in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and Bow there; and the more their <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> go under their <hi>Belley,</hi> the more they Bow in the <hi>Gambrels.</hi> Remember alſo as a certain Truth, That no Horſe can be upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> except

his <hi>Croup,</hi> or <hi>Buttock,</hi> be thruſt out Backwards: As for Example; When you give a Horſe a good Stop, his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> go under his <hi>Belly,</hi> and his <hi>Croup,</hi> or <hi>Buttocks,</hi> are thruſt out; he Bows in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and ſo is upon the <hi>Hanches:</hi> When he goes <hi>Le petit Gallop,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> In, his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> are thruſt under his <hi>Belly,</hi> then his <hi>Croup</hi> goes out; he Bows in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and is upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>: So in <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> are thruſt under his <hi>Belly,</hi> and his <hi>Croup</hi> goes out; he Bows in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and is upon the <hi>Hanches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you pull a Horſe Back, one of his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> goes always under his <hi>Belly</hi>; he puts out his <hi>Croup,</hi> bends in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and is upon the <hi>Hanches:</hi> So in <hi>Paſſadoes</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> is thruſt out, he Bows in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and is upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; but if he be Raiſed too High, it puts him off of the <hi>Hanches,</hi> for then he is Stiff in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> becauſe his <hi>Croup</hi> goes In; which puts him upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> but off of the <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> Therefore you muſt never Raiſe him too High in <hi>Paſſadoes</hi>; if his <hi>Croup</hi> muſt go out, be

                  <p>The inward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> and inward <hi>Cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone</hi>'s <hi>Reyn,</hi> is the Quinteſſence of the <hi>Mannage,</hi> with thruſting his <hi>Croup</hi> out, which makes him Bow in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and ſo be upon the <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>; which is the End of all our Work and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in the <hi>Mannage.</hi> I do not mean his <hi>Croup</hi> to be put out in a Circle, or put out upon a Straight Line; but be thruſt out Backwards, and then he is upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> becauſe he Bows in in the <hi>Gambrels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt Remember you again, that to put him on the <hi>Hanches,</hi> is all Before; ſo that when his <hi>Head</hi> is pull'd Down, and In, then he is upon
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52970:141"/>
the <hi>Hanches</hi>; for his <hi>Croup</hi> goes out, and he Bow in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and therefore is upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>: That is, the Horſe muſt be a little Higher behind than before; for then his <hi>Croup</hi> goes out, and he Bows in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and therefore is upon the <hi>Hanches.</hi> As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; A Horſe goes down a Hill, then his <hi>Croup</hi> is Higher than his Fore-parts, and his <hi>Croup</hi> goes out, and then he bows in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly upon the <hi>Hanches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So if he be turned in the <hi>Stable,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> is Higher than his Fore-parts, and puts his <hi>Croup</hi> out, bends in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and therefore is very much upon the <hi>Hanches.</hi> So in plain Ground, where there is no Hills, you muſt Supply it, with pulling his <hi>Head</hi> Down, and In, as much as you can, to make him Higher behind, than before, which puts out his <hi>Croup,</hi> makes him bow in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and puts him upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; as <hi>Stopping</hi> of him, pulling <hi>Back, Paſſager, Le petit Gallop,</hi> and <hi>Terra a Terra:</hi> All theſe pulls him Down, and puts out his <hi>Croup,</hi> which puts him upon the <hi>Hanches.</hi>

                  <p>But I muſt tell you for a great Truth, That whenſoever, upon Large Circles <hi>D'une piſte,</hi> the Horſe's inward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> is put out, and bows, it puts him not upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> but very much upon the <hi>Shoulders</hi>; for the more his <hi>Buttock</hi> doth go out, the more ſtill he is upon the <hi>Shoulders</hi>; for that Leſſon is not to put him upon the <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> but to Supple his <hi>Shoulders</hi>; for if you would put him upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> you muſt put In his <hi>Croup</hi>; for the Larger Circle is wrought moſt, becauſe it goes the moſt Ground; yet his Hinder-parts are the moſt preſt, becauſe in the Narrower Circle, and therefore upon the <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some are of Opinion, That the more you put In his <hi>Croup,</hi> the more he is on the <hi>Hanches</hi>; which I do not Think, becauſe his inward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> goes before half his <hi>Shoulder,</hi> and ſo he is Wide behind, and off of the <hi>Hanches,</hi> and goes
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52970:142"/>
Backward: But if his <hi>Croup</hi> be In, and you put out his inward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> then he bows in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> Narrow behind, and ſo upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; and the more upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> if the Horſe goes <hi>Byas,</hi> becauſe by that means the Horſes <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> are nearer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo Narrower, and therefore upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; and this is moſt true: For if the Horſes <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> (within the <hi>Turn</hi>) goes before his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Fore-Legg,</hi> he doth not only go Backward, but his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> are ſtiff in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and therefore not upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; but when you put out his inward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> then he Bows in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and therefore upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> becauſe his <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> are made like our <hi>Armes</hi>; only he hath a Joynt more, which is the Stifling-Joynt.</p>

                  <head>To put a Horſe UPON the HANCHES: On which I inſiſt the More, becauſe it is the End of all our Work and Labour in the <hi>Mannage;</hi> For, Without it, no Horſe can Poſſibly go Well.</head>
                  <p>A Horſe can never go Well upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> but his Fore-parts muſt be Wrought; for, in that Manner, when you Stop him, you pull his Fore-parts, and that puts him upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> becauſe you pull his Fore-parts Down, and In: When you pull him Back, you put him upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> becauſe you pull his Fore-parts Down, and In; When you make him go <hi>Terra a Terra</hi>; when you Work the Inward <hi>Reyn,</hi> on which <hi>Hand</hi> ſoever he goes, ſo you Preſs him on the outſide, and put In his outward <hi>Hanch,</hi> then you put him upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> becauſe you pull him Down on the outſide, with the Inward <hi>Reyn</hi> of the <hi>Bridle,</hi> on either <hi>Hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:52970:145"/>So (My Way) with the <hi>Cavezone</hi> Tied to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> or Tied to the <hi>Girthes,</hi> if he be Preſt on the outſide, and his outward <hi>Hanch</hi> put In, puts him upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone</hi> pulls Down his <hi>Head,</hi> and In. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, The <hi>Cavezone</hi> thus, puts him more on the <hi>Hanches,</hi> than any thing; but if you Preſs him on the Inſide of the <hi>Turn,</hi> (though you do pull Down his <hi>Head</hi>) he is off of the <hi>Hanches,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his outward <hi>Hanch</hi> goes out, and therefore puts him on the <hi>Shoulders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee then, That whatſoever pulls a Horſe <hi>Head</hi> Down, and In, puts him upon the <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>; or that Naturally he puts his <hi>Head</hi> Down. As for Example; a Horſe that goes <hi>In Caputiato</hi>; which is, To Arm himſelf againſt the <hi>Bitt,</hi> is eaſily put upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; and being upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> he is Leight of the <hi>Hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Strike a Horſe on the <hi>Knees</hi> with your <hi>Rodd,</hi> when he Riſes before, pulls him Down, and In, and therefore puts him upon the <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> There is no Horſe that holds Up his <hi>Head,</hi> but he is off of the <hi>Hanches</hi>; nor any Horſe that
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52970:145"/>
Riſes High before, but is off of the <hi>Hanches</hi>; nor any Horſe in <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> when his <hi>Head</hi> is pull'd Down, and In, but goes on the <hi>Hanches,</hi> if he be Rid as he Ought to be. The Reaſon is this; No Horſe can go on the <hi>Hanches,</hi> that doth not Bow in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> or <hi>Hinder-Houghs:</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a Horſe Riſes High before, he is Stiff in the <hi>Gambrels</hi> of neceſſity, and therefore off of the <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>; nor doth a Horſe hold Up his <hi>Head</hi> very High, but it Stiffens his <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and therefore off of the <hi>Hanches</hi>; nor can any Horſe go Low before, but of neceſſity he muſt Bend in the <hi>Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brels,</hi> either going Down a <hi>Hill,</hi> or Turn'd in the <hi>Stable,</hi> which makes his Hinder-parts Higher than his Fore-parts; but he muſt Bend in the <hi>Gambrels,</hi> and therefore muſt be upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> and ſo his <hi>Croup</hi> In: But if his <hi>Croup</hi> be out, he is upon the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> though his <hi>Head</hi> be Down.</p>
                  <p>So many a Horſe (as alſo Hunting and Travelling <hi>Geldings</hi>) go horribly upon the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> though their <hi>Heads</hi> be Down; but indeed they are all upon the <hi>Shoulders</hi> except in the <hi>Mannage.</hi> For Example; A Horſes <hi>Fore-Legs</hi> are made like our <hi>Legs,</hi> the <hi>Knees</hi>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:52970:146"/>
outword; but a Horſes <hi>Hinder-Leggs</hi> are made like our <hi>Arms,</hi> juſt contrary: So that whenſoever a Horſe is Raiſed High before, it Stiffens him in the <hi>Gambrels</hi>; and when he holds Up his <hi>Head,</hi> it Stiffens him in the <hi>Gambrels.</hi> So on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, whenſoever his <hi>Head</hi> is pull'd Down, of Neceſſity he muſt Bend in the <hi>Gambrels</hi>; for he cannot do otherwiſe, if he be Preſt, otherwiſe not.</p>
                  <p>I labour this Point the more, becauſe you ſhall clearly ſee what puts him on the <hi>Hanches,</hi> and what puts him off of the <hi>Hanches</hi>; that ſo you may Shun the one, and Take the other, which is, to put him on the <hi>Hanches,</hi> becauſe that is the End of all our Labour, and the Quinteſſence of our Art; for, without a Horſe be upon the <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> he can never be a Ready-Horſe, or Leight on the <hi>Hand</hi>; but there is no Rule without an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and that is, you may pull Down a Horſes <hi>Head,</hi> and yet not upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; which is, when you Work his <hi>Shoulders D'une piſte, Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> on the Inſide, though his <hi>Head</hi> be pull'd Down, he cannot be on the <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:52970:146"/>
becauſe you put it out, and Preſs him on the Inſide: No more when his <hi>Croup</hi> is In, if he be Preſt on the Inſide, his <hi>Croup</hi> goes out a little, and therefore cannot be upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> though his <hi>Head</hi> be pull'd Down, becauſe you put his <hi>Hanch</hi> out: This is good to give him an <hi>Apuy</hi> upon the <hi>Barrs,</hi> and Supple his <hi>Shoulders</hi>; but it cannot put him on that which you put away, that were too great a Miracle, indeed an Impoſſibility.</p>
                  <p>Pulling Down his <hi>Head,</hi> and In, puts him upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> at a Stop; and pulling Down his <hi>Head,</hi> and In, when you make him go Back, puts him upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; and when you pull Down his <hi>Head</hi> and In, and Raiſe him, it puts him upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; and when you Preſs him on the outſide of the <hi>Turn</hi> in <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> it puts him upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; when you pull Down his <hi>Head</hi> and In, either with the <hi>Cavezone,</hi> or the <hi>Bridle</hi>; and ſo pulling Down his <hi>Head,</hi> and In, preſſing him on the outſide of the <hi>Turn,</hi> puts him upon the <hi>Hanches</hi> in <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> or upon his <hi>Walk</hi> in <hi>Paſſager:</hi> And this (I am ſure) is ſufficient to put a Horſe upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi>
                     <pb n="268" facs="tcp:52970:147"/>
which is the <hi>Elixir</hi> of the <hi>Mannage,</hi> and is done when his <hi>Head</hi> is Down, and In, and Preſt; that is, when you pull Down his <hi>Head,</hi> that you preſs him with the <hi>Heels,</hi> or <hi>Leggs,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not; for, if a Horſe holds Down his <hi>Head</hi> to Drink, he is not on the <hi>Hanches,</hi> for then he Bows rather Before, than Behind, and is on the <hi>Shoulders</hi>; therefore he muſt be preſt; ſo if he holds Up his <hi>Head,</hi> it Works nothing on the <hi>Hanches,</hi> but the contrary.</p>
                  <p>A ſhort <hi>Trott</hi> puts a Horſe upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> ſo a ſhort <hi>Trot D'une piſte, Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> on a ſide, puts a Horſe upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> becauſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> is put out; his <hi>Head</hi> to the <hi>Wall</hi> puts him upon the <hi>Hanches</hi>; and nothing puts him more on the <hi>Hanches</hi> than a Leight <hi>Hand</hi>; for when he hath nothing to Reſt on Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then he will reſt Behind, which is upon the <hi>Hanches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many Reaſons why we Work a Horſe ſo much, to put him upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> which I have ſhewed you before; but there is one Reaſon more, and that is this: A Horſe's <hi>Croup,</hi>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:52970:147"/>
or <hi>Hanches,</hi> bears nothing but his <hi>Tayl,</hi> which is very Leight; but his <hi>Shoulders</hi> hath his <hi>Neck</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> to Bear, which is more; and therefore we put him upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> to Poyſe him, and to Relieve his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and to make him Leight on the <hi>Hand.</hi>

               <head>THE THIRD PART, For Dreſſing and Making of Horſes in all SEVERAL AYRES, MY NEW WAY.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou muſt in all <hi>Ayres</hi> follow the Strength, Spirit, and Diſpoſition of the Horſe, and do nothing againſt <hi>Nature</hi>; for <hi>Art</hi> is but to ſet <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in <hi>Order,</hi> and nothing elſe: But to make a Horſe <hi>Gallop</hi> and <hi>Change,</hi> and to go <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> is for the moſt part Forced; and in <hi>Paſſadoes</hi> the like: For, if a Horſe be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, he will hardly go well in <hi>Paſſadoes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No other <hi>Ayres</hi> are to be Forced, but every
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52970:149"/>
Horſe is to Chuſe his own <hi>Ayre,</hi> unto which <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> hath moſt Fitted him, which you may eaſily ſee, when he is Tied Short to the <hi>Single Pillar</hi> My Way.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Corvets,</hi> a Horſe ought to have a great deal of <hi>Patience:</hi> And the <hi>Ayre</hi> of <hi>Corvets</hi> gives a Horſe <hi>Patience</hi> with Diſcreet <hi>Riding,</hi> (as they ſay) but I have ſeldom ſeen that Diſcreet Riding; I doubt there is a Miſtake in it, which is this: Firſt the Horſe hath <hi>Patience,</hi> and then that Horſe goes in <hi>Corvets</hi>; but ſeldom Impatient Horſes are made Patient by <hi>Corvets:</hi> So ſeeing moſt Horſes that go well in <hi>Corvets,</hi> to have <hi>Patience,</hi> they think <hi>Corvets</hi> gives them <hi>Patience,</hi> when it is <hi>Patience</hi> that gives them <hi>Corvets.</hi> But there is no Rule without an Exception, yet I doubt I am in the Right; for, though ſome Young Horſe may (by Chance) go in <hi>Corvets,</hi> yet I aſſure you, for the moſt part, Horſes muſt have a great deal of time, with the Cuſtom of often Repetitions; to be in ſome Years, and to have <hi>Gray-Hairs</hi> in their <hi>Beard,</hi> before they will be Settled, and Firm'd, to go cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in <hi>Corvets,</hi> both Forwards, and upon their
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52970:149"/>
                  <hi>Voltoes</hi>; therefore it is an Errour in thoſe that think they can force <hi>Corvets,</hi> if the Horſe's inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not to go in that <hi>Ayre</hi>; for I have known many Horſes, that all the Force in the world would never make go in <hi>Corvets</hi>; their Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition being againſt it: <hi>Corvets</hi> is an <hi>Ayre,</hi> built only of Art; for if the Horſe be not perfectly in the <hi>Hand</hi> and the <hi>Heels,</hi> and upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> he will never go in <hi>Corvets:</hi> Yet I muſt Tell you, This <hi>New Way</hi> of Mine will make Horſes go in <hi>Corvets,</hi> which by no other Way would have been brought to it, and it ſeldom or never Fails me.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Leaping</hi> Horſes, there are Four ſeveral <hi>Ayres,</hi> which are <hi>Croupadoes, Balotadoes, Capriols,</hi> and a <hi>Pace and a Leap</hi>; the Heighth of theſe may be all alike, but not the Manner; though the Horſe that goes the Longeſt time, muſt needs go the Higheſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Croupadoes</hi> is a <hi>Leap,</hi> where the Horſe pulls up his <hi>Hinder-Leggs,</hi> as if he drew, or pull'd them up into his <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Balotadoes</hi> is a <hi>Leap</hi> where the Horſe offers
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52970:150"/>
to Strike out with his <hi>Hinder-Leggs,</hi> but doth not; and makes only an Offer, or Half ſtrokes; ſhewing only the <hi>Shooes</hi> of his <hi>Hinder-Leggs,</hi> but doth not Strike, only makes an Offer, and no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Capriols</hi> is a <hi>Leap,</hi> that when the Horſe is at the full Heighth of his <hi>Leap,</hi> he Yerks, or Strikes out his <hi>Hinder-Leggs,</hi> as neer, and as eeven To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and as far out as ever he can Stretch them; which the <hi>French</hi> call, <hi>Nouer l'Eſquillette,</hi> which is, To tie the Point.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Pace</hi> and a <hi>Leap,</hi> is, as it were three <hi>Ayres</hi>; the Pace <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> the Raiſing of him a <hi>Corvet,</hi> and then a <hi>Leap:</hi> Theſe <hi>Ayres</hi> can never be Forc't to go Well in them, in ſpight of their <hi>Poynſons,</hi> but what <hi>Nature</hi> ordains them; for, they are called, <hi>Well-Diſpoſed</hi> Horſes.</p>
               <p>What belongs to <hi>Leaping</hi> Horſes (according to the Old Opinion) are theſe things: A Horſe of huge and vaſt <hi>Strength,</hi> an excellent <hi>Mouth,</hi> perfect good <hi>Feet</hi>; in which laſt they have not ſaid Amiſs, for good <hi>Feet</hi> are very Requiſite, elſe the Horſe dares never Leight on them, for fear
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52970:150"/>
of Hurting them (no more than a Man that hath the <hi>Gout,</hi> dares <hi>Leap)</hi> and ſo will never Riſe.</p>
               <p>I could wiſh a good <hi>Mouth,</hi> (which is a good <hi>Apuy)</hi> neither too Hard, nor too Soft, but to ſuffer a good <hi>Apuy</hi> upon the <hi>Barrs,</hi> and ſo to ſuffer the <hi>Curb,</hi> which is to be underſtood a good <hi>Mouth:</hi> yet I muſt tell you, the rareſt <hi>Leaping</hi> Horſe that ever I ſaw, or Rid, went not at all upon the <hi>Curb,</hi> but only upon the <hi>Barrs</hi> of his <hi>Mouth,</hi> which I do not Commend; but it is better to have him <hi>Leap</hi> ſo, being ſo rare a Horſe, than to be ſo Over-Curious as not to have him <hi>Leap</hi> at all, becauſe he went not upon the <hi>Curb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they muſt be very Strong Horſes to be <hi>Leaping</hi> Horſes, is a very great Errour; for, it is not the Strongeſt Horſes that is fitteſt for the Delight of the <hi>Mannage,</hi> and eſpecially not for <hi>Leaping</hi> Horſes; for I have ſeen many Strong Horſes, that muſt be <hi>Galloped</hi> very long before you could Abate the ſtrength of their <hi>Chines</hi>; and all that while they would do nothing but Yerk,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52970:151"/>
and fetch diſordered Counter-times of Falſe <hi>Leaps,</hi> and the beſt Horſe-men in the World could never make them <hi>Leaping</hi> Horſes: So it is not Strong, but Well-diſpoſed Horſes; for the beſt <hi>Leaping</hi> Horſes that ever I Knew, were the Weakeſt Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes I have ſeen.</p>
               <p>Take one of the <hi>Guard,</hi> the Strongeſt Fellow that is, and I will bring a Little Fellow that ſhall <hi>Out-Leap</hi> him many a Foot; yet that Strong Fellow would Cruſh that Little Fellow to Death in his <hi>Armes:</hi> So 'tis not Strength, but Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition fits Horſes for <hi>Leaping.</hi> But ſome will ſay, That a little Man's Strength is above his Weight, and the great Man's Weight is above his Strength; but that is not ſo; for the great Man's Strength ſhall be more above his Weight, than the little Man's Strength above his, and yet the little Man ſhall <hi>Out-Leap</hi> him. Nay, two Little Men of Equal Strength, the one ſhall <hi>Leap</hi> excellently, and the other not; and more, a Weaker little man ſhall <hi>Out-Leap</hi> the Stronger, and ſometimes a Weak ſlender ſlim Fellow will <hi>Out-Leap</hi> a Knit ſtrong Fellow; ſo that it is nothing but Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52970:151"/>
which <hi>Nature</hi> gives, and not <hi>Art:</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Strong great Fellow will <hi>Out-Leap</hi> a little Man, but that is ſeldom, becauſe their Spirits are more Dilated, Aſſunder, and Diffuſed, than in little men: The like I will aſſure you in Horſes, as I have told you of men; there may be a Strong Horſe diſpoſed for <hi>Leaping,</hi> and that no doubt is an Excellent Horſe; but for the moſt part they are but Weak Horſes, that are diſpoſed for <hi>Leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; ſometimes a Horſe finds himſelf ſo Pincht with <hi>Corvets</hi> upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> being Weak, that he finds Eaſe in <hi>Leaping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, that <hi>Leaping</hi> Horſes are diſpoſed by <hi>Nature,</hi> and not <hi>Art,</hi> being full of Spirit, and Leight; ſo that Horſe-men hath nothing to do in making <hi>Leaping</hi> Horſes, but only to give them the time, which is all the Art ought to be uſed to a <hi>Leaping</hi> Horſe; and he that thinks to ſhew more Art in a <hi>Leaping</hi> Horſe, will but ſhew his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Folly.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Pace</hi> and a <hi>Leap</hi> is an <hi>Ayre,</hi> in which Horſes commonly go when they have not a good <hi>Apuy</hi>; for the <hi>Pace</hi> puts him upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> and gives
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:52970:152"/>
him a Riſe to <hi>Leap</hi> like one that Runs before he <hi>Leaps,</hi> and ſo may <hi>Leap</hi> Higher than he that goes every time a <hi>Leap.</hi> Thus I have ſhewed you theſe <hi>Ayres, Corvets, Croupadoes, Balotadoes, Capriols,</hi> and a <hi>Pace,</hi> and a <hi>Leap,</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi> muſt do more than <hi>Art:</hi> Two <hi>Paces,</hi> and three <hi>Paces,</hi> and a <hi>Leap,</hi> are not comely, and are indeed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Gallop Galliard,</hi> than can be called an <hi>Ayre.</hi>

                  <p>WHen you Work a Horſe upon <hi>Corvets,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you do that, you muſt make a Horſe to Riſe perfectly in <hi>Paſſadoes,</hi> which is High Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and to ſtay upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> uſing the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezone</hi> ſtill; and this Forward, and not upon <hi>Circles</hi> at the firſt by any means: Then to make him go in <hi>Corvets,</hi> Tie the <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s Reyn from the <hi>Wall,</hi> to keep that <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> to his other <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> that is next the <hi>Wall,</hi> and begin with two or three <hi>Corvets,</hi> and then <hi>Walk</hi> him again, and then <hi>Corvet</hi> him again; and if you Feel him on the <hi>Hand,</hi> and he goes forwards with it, he will Quickly be <hi>Drest</hi>; and if he goes Forwards too much, let him make his <hi>Corvets</hi> in a place, and pull him Back, and then make him go in <hi>Corvets.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:52970:154"/>When your Left <hi>Shoulder</hi> is to the <hi>Wall,</hi> you muſt Tie the right <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s Reyn to the <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,</hi> which doth not only keep Back his <hi>Hinder-Legg</hi> on the ſame ſide the <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s right <hi>Reyn</hi> is Tied, but it alſo Supples his <hi>Shoulders</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, and prepares him; nothing like it to go upon <hi>Voltoes</hi> on the right <hi>Hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When your Right <hi>Shoulder</hi> is to the <hi>Wall,</hi> then you muſt Tie the Left <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s Reyn to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> for the ſame Reaſons, and work him in <hi>Corvets,</hi> as I told you before; and this will prepare him, and make him go upon his <hi>Voltoes</hi> on the <hi>Left-Hand</hi>; and no Leſſon better at the Firſt.</p>
                  <p>There is another rare Leſſon for <hi>Corvets,</hi> which is this; Tie the Right <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s Reyn to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> and let him go on the <hi>Left-Hand, Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> on a ſide, as if his <hi>Head</hi> was to the <hi>Pillar</hi>; and Raiſe him ſo in <hi>Corvets,</hi> two or three times, his <hi>Croup</hi> out; and then <hi>Walk</hi> him, and then <hi>Corvet</hi> him in the ſame Manner: This keeps out his Inward <hi>Hinder-Legg,</hi> and ſo Supples him to the <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Heel,</hi> that there is nothing

                  <p>The <hi>Left-Hand</hi> is the ſame; you muſt Tie the Left <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s Reyn to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> and go on the <hi>Right-Hand,</hi> his <hi>Croup</hi> out, and help <hi>Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> on a ſide, and ſo do in all things elſe, as you did before; and thus he ſhall never be <hi>Entier,</hi> but moſt Supple both to <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Heel.</hi>

                  <p>If you find he Haſtens too much, then Raiſe him High in <hi>Paſſadoes,</hi> and keep him upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> and Help him with the <hi>Rod</hi> upon the <hi>Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Leggs,</hi> to make him bend them; which is the only <hi>Grace</hi> in all <hi>Ayres</hi> whatſoever: This, and thus Working of him upon his <hi>Voltoes,</hi> either <hi>D<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>une piſte,</hi> or his <hi>Croup</hi> in upon <hi>Paſſadoes,</hi> will make him go Rarely in <hi>Corvets.</hi>

                  <p>To make a Horſe go Side-ways in <hi>Corvets,</hi> help only with the <hi>Bridle,</hi> and put his <hi>Head</hi> to the <hi>Wall</hi>; and on the <hi>Right-Hand,</hi> help with the outward <hi>Reyn,</hi> and let the Horſe go <hi>Byas</hi>; that is, his <hi>Shoulders</hi> before his <hi>Croup</hi>; and let him go three or four <hi>Corvets</hi> Byas, and then <hi>Walk</hi> him Byas; and then <hi>Corvet</hi> him Byas again, and ſo <hi>Walk</hi> him, and <hi>Corvet</hi> him; and by little and little Diminiſh his <hi>Walking,</hi> and Augment his <hi>Corvets,</hi> until he goes all in <hi>Corvets,</hi> which he will ſoon do, and very perfectly.</p>

                  <p>To make the Horſe go in <hi>Corvets</hi> Backward, Pull the Horſe back, and then make him go three or four <hi>Corvets</hi> in a place, and then pull him back again, and then <hi>Corvet</hi> him in a place again; and thus pulling him back, and <hi>Corvetting</hi> him in a place, Diminiſhing the pulling Back, and Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the <hi>Corvets,</hi> he will at laſt go Backward in <hi>Corvets</hi> as perfectly as can be.</p>
                  <p>To go Forwards in <hi>Corvets,</hi> you muſt always Help with the <hi>Reyn</hi> to the <hi>Wall</hi>; to Inlarge him Before, and to Narrow him Behind; becauſe he Leads with his Fore-parts, and his Hinder-parts follow to keep the Ground that his Fore parts hath got; his Fore-parts being at Liberty, and his Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-parts Preſt.</p>

and his Fore-parts follow, to keep the Ground that his Hinder-parts hath got; his Hinder-parts being at Liberty, and his Fore-parts preſt, your <hi>Hand</hi> is to be Low, that the Horſe may not go too High, and your <hi>Body</hi> a little Forward, to give his Hinder-parts Liberty to Lead, and not Help with the <hi>Leggs</hi> at all, but with the <hi>Hand</hi> every time to pull him Back, as he Falls to the <hi>Ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Side-wayes in <hi>Corvets,</hi> you muſt Help with the outward <hi>Reyn</hi> and outward <hi>Legg</hi>; that is, you muſt pull that <hi>Reyn</hi> on which <hi>Hand</hi> ſoever he goes, and your contrary <hi>Legg</hi>; and that's right for Side-ways.</p>
                  <p>Knowing how to Help him Forwards, Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and of each Side, in <hi>Corvets,</hi> put thoſe together, and then you may make him do the Croſs when you pleaſe, without any Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Saraban</hi> in <hi>Corvets,</hi> it muſt be with the outward <hi>Reyn,</hi> which is to be pull'd firſt on one Side, and then on the other Side, in every <hi>Corvet,</hi> from ſide to ſide, Helping only with

your <hi>Hand</hi>; your outward <hi>Shoulder</hi> following it, and not Helping with your <hi>Leggs</hi> at all.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Ayres</hi> muſt be quick from the Ground, and are to Stay upon the <hi>Hand</hi>; that is, to <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenir,</hi> or hold him there, but it muſt be Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; a leight, and a firm <hi>Hand,</hi> Helping every time.</p>
                  <p>If a Horſe beats upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> it is, becauſe he doth not Obey the <hi>Curb</hi>; and in that caſe, you muſt Raiſe him very High in <hi>Paſſadoes,</hi> and hold him there, which puts him upon the <hi>Curb</hi>; and if this will not do, then <hi>Gallop</hi> him upon a ſtraight Line by a <hi>Wall,</hi> or otherwiſe; and from his <hi>Gallop</hi> ſtay him upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> and let him go in <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets</hi>; or let him <hi>Gallop</hi> forward <hi>Le petit Gallop,</hi> and Stop him, and then Raiſe him three or four <hi>Paſſadoes</hi> very High, and hold him on the <hi>Hand</hi> when he is Up, and this will cure him; if not, then <hi>Trot</hi> him, and Stop him good hard Stops; and pull him Back: And upon the ſame Circles <hi>D'une piſte, Gallop</hi> him, and Stop him, and pull him Back, and this will Settle him on the <hi>Hand,</hi> I warrant you; your <hi>Stirrups</hi> being of

                  <p>You are to Sit as Forward to the <hi>Pommel</hi> as you can, being ſtraight, and your <hi>Thighes</hi> and <hi>Knees</hi> as cloſe as if they were Glued to the <hi>Saddle,</hi> but your <hi>Toes</hi> down, that you may be Weak in the <hi>Hams</hi>; that is, to have your <hi>Nerves</hi> Weak from the <hi>Knees</hi> down-wards, and Strong from the <hi>Knees</hi> upwards, and not touch your Horſe with the <hi>Leggs,</hi> nor Help with your <hi>Leggs</hi> at all; but to leave his <hi>Croup</hi> free to follow his Fore-parts that Leads.</p>
                  <p>For when the Horſe is between the Pillars, or at the Single Pillar <hi>My Way,</hi> and no body on him, yet he goes as juſt as can be, and yet there is no <hi>Leggs</hi> that Helps him, therefore you muſt not Help with your <hi>Leggs</hi> at all; for, if you Help with your outward <hi>Legg,</hi> he thinks he muſt go <hi>Terra a Terra</hi>; and if he doth go in

                  <p>This is for a Horſe that goes Perfectly; but if a Horſe puts In his <hi>Croup</hi> too much, you muſt put it out with your inward <hi>Legg</hi>; and if he puts out his <hi>Croup</hi> too much, then you muſt put it In with your outward <hi>Legg</hi>: But Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member alwayes, that your Horſe goes <hi>Byas</hi> upon his Circles, his Fore parts always to Lead, which is Oblique: And this is the Exact way for <hi>Corvets.</hi>

                  <p>You muſt Remember, when you Raiſe him to <hi>Leap,</hi> That you Help him with your <hi>Rod</hi> behind, either one Stroke, or more, as you pleaſe, ſo it be in time; and that is, when the Horſe is Raiſed, then Help him, but alwayes high <hi>Paſſadoes</hi> after he hath <hi>Leapt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Remember to Sit Straight, your <hi>Stirrups</hi> a little ſhorter, a hole, or ſo; for too Short would throw you out of the <hi>Saddle,</hi> and to Long would

diſorder your <hi>Seat,</hi> and make you loſe your <hi>Stirrups</hi>; your <hi>Toes</hi> down, to ſlack your <hi>Nerves</hi> from the <hi>Knees</hi> downward, or elſe the Horſe would <hi>Bolt</hi> forward too much; for a <hi>Leaping</hi> Horſe ſhould never go Forward above a Foot and a Half at the moſt; and when you Raiſe him, inſtantly put your <hi>Breſt</hi> out, which makes your <hi>Shoulders</hi> go a little back (though inſenſibly) to the <hi>Beholders</hi>; for, did you not ſo when the Horſe Riſes, it would be too late when he Yerks behind, or Raiſes his <hi>Croup.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>THis <hi>Way</hi> is to no purpoſe at all to <hi>Dreſs</hi> a Horſe, ſince the end of <hi>Riding</hi> is, To go with the <hi>Bitt</hi>; for, with the <hi>Trench</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingal,</hi> you muſt uſe both <hi>Hands,</hi> and you have not a third <hi>Hand</hi> for the <hi>Sword</hi>; but with the <hi>Bitt,</hi> your <hi>Left-Hand</hi> governs the Horſe, and your <hi>Right-Hand</hi> is free for the <hi>Sword:</hi> But I will let you ſee, that to uſe the <hi>Trench</hi> and <hi>Martingal,</hi> is juſt ſo much time loſt, as you <hi>Ride</hi> Horſes with it, and no preparation at all for the <hi>Bitt:</hi> For firſt, the <hi>Trench</hi> hath no <hi>Curb,</hi> therefore they will not underſtand the <hi>Curb</hi> by it, becauſe it hath none. Then Secondly, there is no <hi>Trench</hi> in the world, or <hi>Snaffle,</hi> that ever wrought upon the <hi>Bars</hi> of a
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:52970:172"/>
Horſe, but upon his <hi>Lips,</hi> and the <hi>Weeks</hi> of his <hi>Mouth.</hi> So, what preparation is there in the <hi>Trench</hi> for the <hi>Bitt,</hi> when the <hi>Trench</hi> can neither make him underſtand the <hi>Curb,</hi> nor the <hi>Bars</hi>? And the <hi>Bitt</hi> Works only upon thoſe two places, <hi>Curb,</hi> and <hi>Bars</hi>; and without thoſe two, no Horſe can be a <hi>Ready-Horſe.</hi> Nay, pull down the Horſes <hi>Head</hi> as much as you can with the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingal,</hi> or the <hi>Trench,</hi> it ſhall never work upon his <hi>Bars</hi>; the <hi>Snaffle</hi> is the ſame; for the <hi>Trench</hi> is but a great <hi>Snaffle:</hi> Then for the <hi>Martingal,</hi> uſe it never ſo long, the Horſe ſhall not be ſetled one jot the better when you take it off.</p>
                  <p>So now you may ſee how unuſeful a folly the <hi>Trench</hi> and <hi>Martingal</hi> is, for the <hi>Dreſſing</hi> of Horſes; meerly ſo much time loſt to no purpoſe, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain, and diſordering the poor Horſe; ſo that I wonder at the Horſe-men, that had no more Wit than to uſe it.</p>
                  <p>It is the <hi>Bitt,</hi> with the <hi>Cavezone,</hi> and the true <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Riding,</hi> that <hi>Makes,</hi> and <hi>Dreſſes</hi> Horſes perfectly, and not the <hi>Trench</hi> and <hi>Martingal</hi>; no, nor the <hi>Martingal</hi> with the <hi>Bitt,</hi> if it be tied to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:52970:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Arches of the <hi>Bitt,</hi> for then the <hi>Curb</hi> never Works; no, nor the New-faſhioned <hi>Martingal,</hi> that is tied to the <hi>Cavezone,</hi> for it hinders the operation of the <hi>Bitt.</hi>

                  <p>CErtainly the Foundation of all <hi>Ayres</hi> in the <hi>Mannage,</hi> and the Ground of every thing, is, <hi>Trotting,</hi> and <hi>Stopping,</hi> with Looking into the <hi>Turn</hi>; a gentle <hi>Stop,</hi> not too Hard, which puts a Horſe upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> and ſettles him upon the <hi>Hand</hi>; becauſe it pulls him Down before; but too Hard a <hi>Stop</hi> pulls him Up before; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore puts him off of the <hi>Hanches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make him Look into the <hi>Turn,</hi> the <hi>Cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone,</hi> My Way, and pulling the inward <hi>Reyn</hi> to your <hi>Knee,</hi> low, or beyond it, brings In his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Shoulder,</hi> and Bends him into the <hi>Turn</hi> very much; Supples his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> Preſſes him within the <hi>Turn,</hi> and leaves his <hi>Leggs</hi> at liberty without the <hi>Turn</hi>; and pulling him Down before,

makes him <hi>Stop</hi> well: But ſee ſtill, that his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Shoulder</hi> comes In, and then he ſhall never be <hi>Entier</hi>; which is the greateſt <hi>Vice</hi> a Horſe can have.</p>
                  <p>To Tie the inward <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s Reyn to the <hi>Pommel,</hi> puts a Horſe on the Outſide, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him there, except your inward <hi>Legg</hi> puts Out his <hi>Croup</hi>; therefore I would have you Tie the inward <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s Reyn to the <hi>Girths</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which Preſſes him within, and gives Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to his <hi>Leggs</hi> without the <hi>Turn,</hi> and brings In his outward <hi>Shoulder:</hi> And thus Tied to the <hi>Girths,</hi> is more powerful, than if you held it in your <hi>Hand</hi>; for, many Horſes may force your <hi>Hand,</hi> which they cannot do, when it is Tied to the <hi>Girths</hi>; and pulling him Down thus, makes him <hi>Stop</hi> well.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paſſadoes</hi> is a rare thing to put a Horſe upon the <hi>Hand,</hi> and prepare him for all <hi>Ayres</hi>; it puts him on the <hi>Hanches</hi> too; and eſpecially is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for <hi>Leaping Horſes</hi>; and all this with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s Reyn Tied to the <hi>Girthes</hi>; upon a <hi>Trott,</hi> or <hi>Le petit Gallop,</hi> it is an excellent thing to give him a little touch with the <hi>Spur,</hi> to make him Flie it, and Obey it; but then it muſt not be abandoned upon the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> but upon the <hi>Hanches,</hi> when he feels the <hi>Spur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cavezone</hi> is the Rareſt thing in the world for <hi>Dreſſing of Horſes</hi>; not only to Preſerve their <hi>Mouth,</hi> but to give them the <hi>Ply,</hi> which is to <hi>Bend</hi> them into the <hi>Turn,</hi> to make them <hi>Look</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Turn,</hi> to work their outward <hi>Shoulder,</hi> to bring it into the <hi>Turn:</hi> And thus to <hi>Supple</hi> their <hi>Shoulders,</hi> either upon a <hi>Trott,</hi> or <hi>Gallop D'une piſte</hi>; or <hi>Paſſager</hi> the <hi>Croup</hi> In, or <hi>Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> on a ſide; and all this to <hi>Supple</hi> the <hi>Shoulders,</hi> which is a prinpal thing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cavezone</hi> again, (<hi>Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> contrary) works a Horſe's <hi>Croup</hi>; his <hi>Croup</hi> out, as if it

But when you work <hi>Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> contrary, I would wiſh you to have the <hi>Cavezone</hi>'s Reyn in your <hi>Hand</hi>; for ſo you will Help him the better.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how Powerful the <hi>Cavezone</hi> is to Work <hi>Shoulders,</hi> or <hi>Croup,</hi> or any thing for the perfect <hi>Dreſſing of Horſes</hi>; ſo that I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to <hi>Dreſs a Horſe</hi> better, and more perfectly, with a <hi>Cavezone</hi> without a <hi>Bitt,</hi> than with a <hi>Bitt</hi> without a <hi>Cavezone</hi>; therefore uſe the <hi>Cavezone</hi>; but then it muſt be My Way, or elſe it is of little effect.</p>
                  <p>Since <hi>Trotting,</hi> and <hi>Stopping</hi> upon the <hi>Trott,</hi> is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all <hi>Ayres</hi> in the <hi>Mannage,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

highly Eſteem of it, and Practice it moſt; that is, Never do any thing with your Horſe, until he <hi>Stop</hi> perfectly upon his <hi>Trott</hi>; for, if you do, you will perfectly Spoyl him for ever.</p>

                  <p>Upon <hi>Voltoes</hi> in <hi>Corvets,</hi> uſe the outward <hi>Reyn,</hi> and in every thing as I told you before; only let the Horſe go <hi>Forward,</hi> as if he did not <hi>Turn,</hi> which ought to be upon all <hi>Circles</hi> whatſoever, except the <hi>Piroyte</hi>; and commonly you are not to <hi>Help</hi> with your <hi>Leggs</hi> at all; but if you do, it muſt be the outward <hi>Legg</hi> a little to him.

                  <head>To Know the Degrees of Tying the inward <hi>Cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone's</hi> Reyn, either to the Girthes or the Pommel of the <hi>Sadle,</hi> which is the Life or Soul of the <hi>Mannage,</hi> never found out but by My Self.</head>
                  <p>I Begin with Tying the inward <hi>Cavezone's</hi> Reyn to the Girthes, which works his outward <hi>Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> preſſes him within the Turn, and leaves his outward <hi>Leggs</hi> at Liberty; is fit for <hi>Gallopping</hi> large, or narrow, <hi>D'une Piſte</hi>; as alſo for <hi>Paſſager,</hi> either large, or in his length; and for the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royte.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No Horſe can go, or be made a <hi>Ready-Horſe,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his <hi>Shoulders</hi> be extreamly Supple; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is the beſt <hi>Leſſon</hi> in the world to Supple his <hi>Shoulders</hi>: But you muſt take heed of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his <hi>Croup</hi> in too much, for it is impoſſible to put in his <hi>Croup,</hi> and put out his <hi>Croup</hi> all at one time; for the <hi>Cavezone's</hi> Reyn tyed to the Girthes, puts out his <hi>Croup,</hi> and at the ſame time
<pb n="002" facs="tcp:52970:188"/>
you will put in his <hi>Croup</hi> with your <hi>Heel,</hi> which cannot be: And when the Horſe finds your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, working impoſſibilities, then he grows Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient and Reſty, as he hath great reaſon to be ſo. Therefore you muſt not Tye the <hi>Cavezone</hi> too ſtrait; for if you do, the Horſe cannot go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but turns Round, and ſo grows Reſty again, as he muſt needs do, which is your Fault, not his. You ſhould Tye the <hi>Cavezone</hi> no ſtraiter than to make him Look into the Turn, and no more; that is, ſo ſtrait, that he cannot Look out of the Turn: And thus he may go Forward, and be pleaſed; which is Natural, and no Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility.</p>
                  <p>The inward <hi>Cavezone's</hi> Reyn tyed to the Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel is another Buſineſs; for, this preſſes the Horſe on the outſide of the Turn, and leaves his <hi>Leggs</hi> within the Turn at liberty; keeps back his outward <hi>Shoulder,</hi> and works his <hi>Croup,</hi> and his outward <hi>Hanch,</hi> and makes him ſubject to the <hi>Heel,</hi> becauſe he cannot get from it; ſo he Obeys it, and Flies it. This is proper for <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> and <hi>Demi-Voltoes</hi> upon the ground; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                     <hi>Cavezone's</hi> Reyn muſt not be tyed too ſtrait; for if it be, then the Horſe cannot go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, no more than the other way, and will grow Reſty: So the inward <hi>Cavezone's</hi> Reyn muſt be pull'd no harder, than juſt to make him Look into the Turn, and no more.</p>
                  <p>To pull the inward <hi>Cavezone's</hi> Reyn to your Knee, or beyond it, works the Horſe's outward <hi>Shoulder,</hi> preſſes him on the Inſide, and leaves his <hi>Leggs</hi> at liberty without the Turn, ſupples his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and gives a little liberty to his <hi>Croup</hi>; and the inward <hi>Cavezone's</hi> Reyn tyed to the Girthes hath the ſame opperation.</p>
                  <p>You are to know, that the Invention of the Pillars is a meer <hi>Routine</hi>; that is, by <hi>Rote</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it works by the <hi>Eyes,</hi> and not by Feeling the <hi>Hand,</hi> and the <hi>Heels,</hi> and being obedient to them: So that this Method of the Pillars, hath ſpoiled more Horſes than any thing in the world, working upon the <hi>Eyes,</hi> by looking at the Pillars; and never any man wrought Horſes well at the Pillar, but <hi>Pluvinel,</hi> that Deviſed them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Way</hi> is a Method of the <hi>Cavezone,</hi> and

there he goes not by <hi>Rote</hi>; his <hi>Eyes</hi> doe nothing here, nor the <hi>Voyce</hi>; but the Horſes meerly obey the <hi>Hand</hi> and the <hi>Heel,</hi> which makes them all Perfect, of what nature or condition ſoever they be, and never Fails me.</p>

                  <p>For <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> it is another thing, the <hi>Reynes</hi> being in your <hi>Left-Hand</hi>; Here you muſt pull the inward <hi>Reyn,</hi> to preſſe him on the out-ſide, and leave his <hi>Legges</hi> at Liberty, within the Turn; and you muſt turn your <hi>Fiſt</hi> inward, and turn it to your <hi>Left-Shoulder,</hi> cloſe to it, which pulls the inward <hi>Reyn,</hi> and your outward <hi>Legge</hi> cloſe to him; Thus he is preſt on the out-ſide, and his <hi>Leggs</hi> at liberty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Turn; But for <hi>Terra a Terra</hi> on the <hi>Left-Hand,</hi> your <hi>Bridle</hi> ſtill in the <hi>Left-Hand,</hi> you muſt turn your little <hi>Finger</hi> up, and pull it cloſe to your <hi>Right-Shoulder,</hi> helping with the outward <hi>Legge.</hi>

as he ſhould do, and then the <hi>Curb</hi> works on the other ſide, contrary to the <hi>Cheek,</hi> of what <hi>Hand</hi> ſo ever you go: If you pull the <hi>Cheeks</hi> ſtrait, the <hi>Mouth</hi> goes down; but when you put your <hi>Hand,</hi> as far forward as you can, to the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular Line, then that works hardeſt on the <hi>Curb.</hi> If you pull the inward <hi>Reyn</hi> to your <hi>Knee,</hi> or from your <hi>Body, Tribacato,</hi> that it layes the <hi>Cheek</hi> even to the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>Bitt,</hi> then it works not at all upon the <hi>Curb,</hi> ſo great a difference there is betwixt the <hi>Cavezone</hi> and the <hi>Bit</hi>; For <hi>Terra a Terra,</hi> when you pull the inward <hi>Reyn</hi> to your outward <hi>Shoulder,</hi> then the <hi>Reyn</hi> is a great deal within the <hi>Pommel,</hi> which <hi>Hand</hi> ſoever you go on; but whenſoever you help with the outward <hi>Reyn,</hi> then your <hi>Hand</hi> muſt be three <hi>Fingers</hi> above the <hi>Pommel,</hi> and as many <hi>Fingers</hi> before it: This is certainly the Truth of the <hi>Bitt</hi> and <hi>Bridle.</hi> When I work the outward <hi>Reyn</hi> of the <hi>Bridle,</hi> I finde his <hi>Croup</hi> is loſt, although I help with the outward <hi>Legge,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> both of a ſide; but <hi>Legg</hi> and <hi>Reyn</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary works his <hi>Croup,</hi> and keeps back his outward <hi>Shoulder.</hi>

                  <p>There is however, a Propriety to fit every Horſe, according to the Turn of his <hi>Neck</hi>; ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or longer, wider or narrower; the Mouth, the liberty, wider or narrower; the Eye longer or ſhorter; the Eye ſtraight, or more bending; the Branches ſtronger, or weaker; the Curb equal; the Hooks according to the juſt meaſure of the

                     <hi>Bitt</hi>; the Curb three good round Eſſes, with one Ring, where 'tis Faſtened; and two Rings, or Malions, where 'tis Curbed, handſomely furniſh'd with Boſſes, not too bigg; richer, or poorer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you pleaſe: Not two Rowes of little Chains, tied to the <hi>Bitt,</hi> within his <hi>Mouth,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One at the moſt.</p>
                  <p>And this Rule muſt ever be Obſerv'd, to have as little <hi>Iron</hi> in your Horſe's <hi>Mouth</hi> as poſſible you can: If his <hi>Tongue</hi> be too bigg, the Liberty muſt be the wider; if his <hi>Tongue</hi> be too little, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty the leſs; but you muſt take heed, that the <hi>Apuy,</hi> or Reſting place of the <hi>Bitt,</hi> be never made upon the Liberty, for it will Gaul him; but the <hi>Apuy</hi> muſt be made in the True place, where it ought to be, which is about Ones Little Fingers breadth beyond the Liberty, on both ſides of the <hi>Bitt</hi>; and the <hi>Bitt</hi> to be Ones Fingers breadth above his <hi>Tuſhes</hi>: The Branches are ſtrong, when the Reyns are ſlackt; thoſe Branches that comes Back to his <hi>Neck</hi> moſt, are Weak; thoſe that go Forward from his <hi>Neck,</hi> are Strong; and good reaſon, for you have the greater Pull.</p>

him Down, and In; wherein they are half Right: So if a Horſe holds his <hi>Head</hi> too Low, and brings it In too Round, ſo that he Armes himſelf againſt the <hi>Bitt,</hi> which is, To reſt the <hi>Branches</hi> upon his <hi>Breaſt,</hi> ſo that you have no Pull, or Command of him at all; becauſe this <hi>Vice</hi> is Contrary to holding Up his <hi>Head,</hi> and Out; for which <hi>Vice</hi> they had ſhorter <hi>Cheeks,</hi> and ſtronger, to bring it In: So Arming againſt the <hi>Bitt,</hi> being the Contrary <hi>Vice,</hi> they think they muſt have the <hi>Bitt</hi> made Contrary; they muſt have a Long One to put it Up; and ſince a ſtrong <hi>Branch</hi> pull'd him Down, they muſt have a weak <hi>Branch</hi> to put Up his <hi>Head</hi>; wherein they are mightily Deceived: For when a Horſe Armes himſelf againſt the <hi>Bitt,</hi> certainly Long <hi>Branches</hi> will ſooner come to his <hi>Breaſt,</hi> than Short Ones; and it is as certain, that a Weak <hi>Branch</hi> will come ſooner to his <hi>Breaſt,</hi> than a Strong <hi>Branch</hi>; therefore they are ſo much Deceived.</p>
                  <p>As for a Horſe that Armes himſelf againſt the <hi>Bitt,</hi> you muſt have a Short <hi>Branch</hi> that will not touch his <hi>Breast,</hi> and a Strong <hi>Branch</hi> to keep It

yet further from his <hi>Breaſt</hi>: The <hi>Hooks</hi> of the <hi>Curb</hi> ought to be made a little Longer, and ſo Juſt as not to Hurt, or to Offend the ſides of his <hi>Cheeks</hi>; and if the <hi>Curb</hi> do not lye in his right Place, two little <hi>Iron</hi> Rings faſtened cloſe to the Top of the <hi>Hooks,</hi> to keep them Steady, and Faſt, is the beſt Remedy; All other Devices in <hi>Bitts</hi> or <hi>Curbs,</hi> are Idle and Ignorant things.</p>

third, when he doubles it about the <hi>Bitt</hi>: And the fourth, when he hangs his <hi>Tongue</hi> out of his <hi>Mouth,</hi> either Forward, or of one ſide of his <hi>Mouth:</hi> For all, and every one of theſe <hi>Vices,</hi> our great Doctors in <hi>Horſe-manſhip,</hi> hath taken a great deal of Pains, with many curious Devices, and many Inventions, with <hi>Bitts,</hi> to Cure them; and take great Pains, and much Labour about it; ſo much, as their ſeveral Writings, about theſe particular <hi>Vices</hi> of the <hi>Mouth,</hi> would make a great Volume; when the truth is, Moſt of their <hi>Bitts,</hi> to Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy theſe <hi>Imperfections,</hi> are much greater <hi>Vices</hi> than thoſe they would Remedy; and their <hi>Phyſick</hi> the greateſt <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> and brings more Inconveniencies with it, than the <hi>Vices</hi> they go about to Cure.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, in ſhort, I wiſh a Horſe had none of thoſe Faults; but put the caſe he hath, As put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out his <hi>Tongue,</hi> or putting his <hi>Tongue</hi> over the <hi>Bitt,</hi> or ſucking or drawing of his <hi>Tongue</hi> up, or doubling of it: All theſe I wiſh were not; but if they be, the Horſe is not prejudiced at all by them, for he will have as good an <hi>Apuy</hi> with them, as without them; and will be as firm and ſteady of his
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:52970:214"/>
                     <hi>Head,</hi> and as ſenſible of the <hi>Barrs,</hi> and the <hi>Curb,</hi> as if thoſe <hi>Vices</hi> were not; for the <hi>Bitt</hi> reſts, and works ſtill, upon his <hi>Barrs</hi>; and the <hi>Curb</hi> works in his due Place, where it ought, in ſpight of his <hi>Tongue,</hi> let it be where it will, or not be; for when a Horſe's <hi>Tongue</hi> is Cut off, Doth that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Bitt,</hi> for working on the <hi>Barrs,</hi> or the <hi>Curb,</hi> for working in his due Place? Not at all: Nay, I have known a Horſe's <hi>Tongue</hi> quite pull'd out by the Roots, and yet he went as well as ever he did in his Life; ſo that is nothing; for the <hi>Bitt</hi> ſtill works upon the <hi>Barrs,</hi> and the <hi>Curb,</hi> where it ought: And a Horſe with a <hi>Tongue,</hi> and put it where he will; or a Horſe without a <hi>Tongue,</hi> is no hinderance to a Horſe that hath a good <hi>Apuy,</hi> or is well ſetled on the <hi>Hand</hi>; no hinderance in the world: So that now you ſee, What vain Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, to no purpoſe, Our great Maſters hath troubled themſelves about, and puſled many of their Readers, and tormented the poor Horſes to boot, to no End in the world.</p>
