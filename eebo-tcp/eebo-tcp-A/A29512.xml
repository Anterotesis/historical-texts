            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ivers and sundry Predictions and Prophesies
have bin made by our ancient Prophets, Bards,
and fatidicall Vaticinators, which in their due
times have futurely, both punctually and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
come to passe, as of the <hi>Sybills</hi> (so often and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
alledged by the Fathers) who many years before
predicted of the Incarnation of our blessed Saviour. The
like did <hi>Merlin Ambrosins,</hi> that famous <hi>Cambrian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
who flourished in the time of <hi>Vortiger,</hi> King of
<hi>Britaine,</hi> whose <hi>South-saies</hi> (for so they called them in
old time) have proved true even to these latter dayes,
which is made plenally apparent in a Book not long
since published by the Title of <hi>Merlins life and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,</hi>
which whosoever shall read may be amply satisfied
what prevalence his prenotions had, all of them in the
processe of time, being seasonably and maturely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</p>
            <p>But to leave others, and insist only upon Mr. <hi>Brightmans</hi>
stupendious Revelations, a zealous Divine, who in his
learned Sermons preached in the later end of Queene <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeths</hi>
days (of most blessed memorie) about the
three and foure and fortieth yeare of her reigne; which
was immediately before the comming in of K. <hi>Iames,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to our Royall Soveraigne K. <hi>Charles,</hi> (of like sacred
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94289:2"/>
memorie with the former) His Predictions were out of the 3. and
4. Chapters of the <hi>Revelations:</hi> in which there is mention made of
7. Epistles sent to the 7. Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> which were Types of
7. other succeeding Churches to come. The 7. <hi>Asian</hi> Churches as
you shall finde there mentioned, were <hi>Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus,
Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia,</hi> and <hi>Laodicea;</hi> in three of which he
figured the state at that time, and that should hereafter be of the
three Churches of <hi>Germanie,</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of <hi>England,</hi> making
the Church of <hi>Germanie</hi> a counterpaine of <hi>Sardis,</hi> the Church of
<hi>Scotland</hi> a type of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> represented
in <hi>Laodicea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Germanie</hi> had its initiation or beginning in
<hi>Martin Luther</hi> of <hi>Wittenburg</hi> a Towne in <hi>Saxonie;</hi> in the yeare of
grace 1517. Now as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> vatically observeth, the Church
of <hi>Thyatira</hi> was much blamed for suffering the woman <hi>Iezabel,</hi> who
cals her selfe a Prophetesse, to teach &amp; deceive Christs servants, and
commit fornication, by which is meant Idolatrie, &amp;c. But this the
Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> reformed: notwithstanding which, she still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
many errors, as Consubstantiation of the Lords Supper, and
about free-will, justification, good works, &amp;c. by which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
the miserie since come upon them, admonished the <hi>Germans</hi>
to consider of it before hand, and to prevent these impending
judgements by reformation and timely repentance, grounding his
Conjectures upon the words of the Text, which are these: <hi>But if
thou wilt not watch, I will come upon thee as a thiefe:</hi> that is, sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and unexpected: now these judgements are thus fatidically deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.

Of all which, and how punctually they have happened, whosoever
would be fully satisfied, I referre them (the better to confirm their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94289:3"/>
truth) to divers letters sent out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> bewayling their sad
and lamentable estate, and are to be read in print, one sent from
<hi>Swebrugden,</hi> the 14. of <hi>November,</hi> 1636. by the Ministers of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi>
to the Dutch Church in <hi>London:</hi> another written by a worthy
Minister of <hi>Messenbeim,</hi> upon the edge of the lower <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the
<hi>first</hi> of <hi>Februarie,</hi> 1637. And a third also sent from <hi>Worms,</hi> and
written by a godly Minister the tenth of <hi>Febr.</hi> in the same year: all
which you may find in a book called the <hi>Lamentations of Germanie,</hi>
To which may be added (namely to the premisses) what happened
to a learned and a godly Preacher of especiall note and remark,
at the taking in of <hi>Magdenburg,</hi> who was dragged from the Church
unto his owne house, where having seen his wife and daughters ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished
before his face, and his yong infants torne from their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
armes, and pitcht upon the tops of Pikes: when his eyes were
blood-shot with these savage and brutish objects, they led him
bound to the Market-place, and having tied him to a stake, pill'd
all his books about him, of which setting fire, they burnt them with
his bodie to ashes. God Almighty in great mercie, avert the like
judgements from us.</p>
            <p>As concerning the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in which he likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
the two Churches of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> which (he saith)
were truely figured in the <hi>Asian Philadelphia:</hi> of them he saith, that
in no place of Christendome, <hi>The Doctrine of Christ soundeth more
purely, the worship of God is exercised more incorruptly: nor the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of Pastors and Teachers is performed more faithfully &amp;c.</hi> To
which he also addeth, that the <hi>Philadelphians</hi> (meaning the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Scotland, Geneva,</hi> and <hi>Holland)</hi> shall continue till the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and that they shall bee joyned with
it in covenant and so<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Nourish and cherish thy hopes with these things, O holy</hi> Philadelphia,
<hi>and be not perplexed, whatsoever the world vainely prates of thee, thou
art little and lowly, God shall exalt thee, goe forward constantly, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Much more is spoken by Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> to the like purpose, which into
these few words are contracted, speaking of those Churches before named,
as had he lived in these our dayes, and had seene and knowne all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingents
late happened: of which, because they are so frequent, and familiar
in everie mans notion, I purpose no longer to insist, but proceed to the last.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Laodicea</hi> (saith he) is figured the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (called Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
in which he presageth the state of the Prelacie, and Clergy of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and how it now stands; and least he should be taxed of any spleene or
malice conceived against them in regard of sundry troubles and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which he in those times suffered by them: therefore hee maketh this
apologie in the Epistle to his worke. God is my witnesse, that I am not
grieved through envie at the wealth or honours of any of them, being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
contented with that small and competent estate which God hath
allotted me: neither thought I ever any thing more foolish than for any
man to please himselfe by distasting others. But when I perceived that
these seven Cities were propounded for a type of all the Churches amongst
the Gentiles: and when I did moreover see so clearely both the order, the
time, and the marvellous agreeing of all things together, I durst not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiously
burie the truth in silence; for God forbid that I should willingly
distaine that Church with the least aspersion or infamy, which by the mercy
of God hath brought me forth, and hath brought me up, and doth now su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
me; yet I thought it my duty rather to cast my selfe upon any trouble
whatsoever, than to betray the salvation of that Church, whose estate
ought to be of more accompt with every one of us than our owne. For he
that gathereth the tears of his children into his bottle doth know right wel
that I have not with dry eyes taken a survey of <hi>Laodicea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it appeares by his owne ingenious confession, that these Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmes
&amp; raptures which proceeded from him, were meer inspirations, and
no vaine and idle fancies and fantasmes, the fruit of a distracted braine: of
which no better testimonie can be given, than the event, which in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
will be more apparent; for it thus followeth.</p>
