            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yea euen after that God had poured

<note place="margin">Ierem. <hi>29</hi>

               </note> frome the middest
of his brethren prisoners in Chaldea, did write his vision to those that were

of the afflicted and chosen saintes of
God, who did lie hyd amongest the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate

and the vengeance whiche God
wold execute vpon the oppressors of
his people. The same did Daniel and
the rest of the prophetes euerie one in
their season. By whose examples and
by the plaine precept, which is geuen
to Ezechiel, commanding him that he
<note place="margin">Examples what tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chers oght to do in this time.</note> shall say to the wicked: Thou shalt die
the death. We in this our miserable age
are bounde to admonishe the world a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes therof, of their sodeine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,

it is our dutie to open the truthe
reueled vnto vs, vnto the ignorant and
blind world, vnlest that to our owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demnation
we list to wrap vp and hyde
the talent committed to our charge.
I am assured that God hath reueled to
some in this our age, that it is more
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8577:4"/>
then a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stre in nature, that a woman
shall reigne a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d haue empire aboue man.
And yet with vs all, there is suche silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
as if God there with were nothing
offended. The naturall man, ennemy to
God shall fynd, I knowe, many causes
why no suche doctrine oght to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in these our dangerous dayes.<note place="margin">Thre chef reasons, that do stay man from spea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king the truthe.</note>
First, for that it may seme to tend to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
secondarilie, it shal be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
not onlie to the writer or publisher,
but also to all such as shall reade the
writinges, or fauor this truth spoken:
and last it shall not amend the chief of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
partlie because it shall neuer
come to their eares, and partlie because
they will not be admonished in such ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses.
I answer, yf any of these be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reason that a truth knowen shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celed, then were the auncient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
of God very fooles, who did not
better prouide for their owne quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
then to hasard their liues for rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of vices, and for the opening of
such crimes, as were not knowen to the
world. And Christ Iesus did iniurie to
<pb facs="tcp:8577:5"/>
his Apostles, comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache
repentance and remission of syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in his name to euerie realme and na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion.
And Paule did not vnderstand his
owne libertie, when he cried, wo be to
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi>Cor.<hi>9.</hi>
               </note> me, if I preache not the Euangile. Yf
feare, I say, of persecution, of sclander,
or of any inconuenience before named
might haue excused, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d discharged the
seruantes of God, from plainlie rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<note place="margin">Mat.<hi>26.</hi> Act.<hi>18, 21.</hi>
               </note> the sinnes of the world, iuste cause
had euerie one of them to haue ceased
frome their office. For sodeinlie their
doctrine was accused by termes of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
of newe learning, and of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
persecution and vehement trouble
did shortlie come vpon the professours
with the preachers: kinges, princes and
worldlie rulers did conspire against
<note place="margin">Psalm.<hi>2.</hi> Act.<hi>4.</hi>
               </note> God and against his anoynted Christ
Iesus. But what? Did any of these moue
the prophetes and Apostles to faynt in
their vocation? no. But by the resistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
whiche the deuill made to them by
his suppostes, were they the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
to publishe the truthe reueled
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8577:5"/>
vnto them and to witnesse with their
blood, that greuous condemnation and
Goddes heuie vengeance shuld folowe
the proude contempt of graces offred.
The fidelitie, bold courage, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie
of those that are passed before vs,
oght to ꝓuoke vs to folowe their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steppes,
onles we loke for an other king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome then Christ hath ꝓmised to such
as perseuere in ꝓfession of his name to
the end. Yf any think that the empire of
women, is not of such importance, that
for the suppressing of the same, any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is bounde to hasarde his life, I answer,
that to suppresse it, is in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of god
alone. But to vtter the impietie and abo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mination
of the same, I say, it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of euerie<note place="margin">It is neces<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sarie for euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the impietie, whiche he knoweth to hurt his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>welth.</note> true messager of God, to whome the truth is reueled in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.
For the especiall dutie of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
messagers is to preache repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to
admonishe the offenders of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenses,
and to say to the wicked, thou
shalt die the death, except thou repent.
This, I trust, will no man denie to be
the propre office of all Goddes messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb facs="tcp:8577:6"/>
to preache (as I haue said) repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and remission of synnes. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of both can be done, except the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of the offenders be accused and
conuicted of transgression. For howe
shall any man repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<note place="margin">No man can repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t except he knowe his synne.</note> not knowing wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in he hath offended? And where no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is founde, there can be no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
to grace. And therfore I say, that
of necessitie it is, that this monstrife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse
empire of women, (which amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
all enormities, that this day do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
vpon the face of the hole earth,
is most detestable and damnable) be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlie
reueled and plainlie declared to
the world, to the end that some may re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pent
and be saued. And thus farre to
the first sorte.</p>
            <p>To such as thinke that it will be long
before such doctrine come to the eares
of the chief offenders, I answer that the
veritie of God is of that nature, that at
<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of Goddes truth.</note> one time or at other, it will pourchace
to it selfe audience. It is an odour and
smell, that can not be suppressed, yea it
is a trumpet that will sound in despite
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8577:6"/>
of the aduersarie. It will compell the
verie ennemies to their own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion,
to testifie and beare witnesse of it. For
I finde that the prophecie and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of Heliseus was declared in the
hall of the king of Syria by the seruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and flatterers of the same wicked
king, making me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion that Heliseus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared<note place="margin">

to the king of Israel, what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the said king of Syria spake in his
most secret chamber. And the wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
workes of Iesus Christ were noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to Herode, not in any greate praise<note place="margin">Mat.<hi>14.</hi>
               </note>
or commendation of his doctrine, but
rather to signifie that Christ called that
tyranne a fox, and that he did no more
regarde his authoritie then did Iohn
the Baptist, whom Herode before had
beheaded for the libertie of his tonge.
But whether the bearers of the rumors
and tidinges were fauourers of Christ
or flatterers of the tyranne, certein it is
that the fame, as well of Christes doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne,
as of his workes came to the eares
of Herod: euen so may the sounde of

For to the most parte of men, laufull

it is the subuersion of good order,
of all equitie and iustice.</p>
            <p>In the probation of this proposition,
I will not be so curious, as to gather

as I haue spoken my conscience in

Goddes ordinance in nature, his plaine

of such as be moste auncient amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest

            <p>And first, where that I affirme the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb facs="tcp:8577:10"/>
of a woman to be a thing repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to nature, I meane not onlie that God
by the order of his creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath spoiled

be. Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I say, in many other cases blind,
doth in this behalfe see verie clearlie.
For the causes be so manifest, that they

be al women, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared vnto man in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

regiment, is but blindnes: their

and iudgement, phrenesie, if it

of women as nature and experience
do this day declare them. Nature I say,
doth paynt them furthe to be weake,

experience hath declared them to be
vnconstant, variable, cruell and lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the spirit of counsel and regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
And these notable faultes haue men in
all ages espied in that kinde, for the
whiche not onlie they haue remoued
women from rule and authoritie, but
also some haue thoght that men subiect
to the counsel or empire of their wyues
were vnworthie of all publike office.
For thus writeth Aristotle in the secon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de

beare authoritie, or the husbandes that

to be magistrates? For what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth
the one, must nedes folowe the
other, to witte, iniustice, confusion and
disorder. The same author further
reasoneth, that the policie or regiment
<pb facs="tcp:8577:11"/>

He shall be Lord and gouernour, not

geueth to vs an other interpretation of
this place, taking from all women all

ouer man, speaking as foloweth,
by the mouth of saint Paule: I suffer<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Tim. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note>
not a woman to teache, nether yet to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe
authoritie aboue man. Here he na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth
women in generall, excepting
none, affirming that she may vsurpe au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thoritie
aboue no man. And that he
speaketh more plainlie, in an other pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
in these wordes: Let women kepe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>14.</hi>
               </note>
in the congregation, for it is not
permitted to them to speake, but to be
subiect as the lawe sayeth. These two
testimonies of the holy ghost, be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb facs="tcp:8577:16"/>
to proue what soeuer we haue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
before, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to represse the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
pride of women, as also to correct
the foolishnes of those that haue stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
to exalt wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in authoritie aboue
man, against God, and against his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
ꝓnounced. But that the same two
places of the apostle may the better be
vnderstand: it is to be noted, that in the
latter, which is writen in the first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to the Corinthes the 14.chapitre,
before the apostle had permitted that
all persones shuld prophecie one after
an other: addinge this reason: that all
may learne and all may receiue conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
And left that any might haue
iudged, that amongest a rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and the pluralitie of speakers,
manie, thinges litle to purpose might
haue bene affirmed, or elles that some
confusion might haue risen: he addeth,
the spirites of the prophetes are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to the prophetes: As he shuld say,
God shall alwayes raise vp some, to
whome the veritie shalbe reueled, and
vnto such ye shal geue place, albeit they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8577:16"/>
sit in the lowest seates. And thus the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
wold haue prophecying an exer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cise
to be free to the hole churche, that
euerie one shuld communicate with the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, what God had reueled to
them, prouidinge that it were orderlie<note place="margin">Frome a generall priuiledge is woman secluded.</note>
done. But frome this generall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he secludeth all woman, sayinge:
let women kepe silence in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
And why I pray you? was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the apostle thoght no woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to haue any knowledge? no he geueth
an other reason, saying: let her be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
as the lawe saith. In which wordes
is first to be noted, that the apostle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
this former sentence pronounced
against woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a lawe, that is, the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
decree of God, who by his owne<note place="margin">She that is subiect to one, may not rule many</note>
voice hath subiected her to one me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre
of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is to her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
wherupon the holie ghost concludeth,
that she may neuer rule nor bear empire
aboue man. For she that is made subiect
to one, may neuer be preferred to many,
and that the holie ghoste doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festlie
expresse, saying: I suffer not that
<pb facs="tcp:8577:17"/>
woman vsurpe authoritie aboue man:
he sayth not, I will not, that woman v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe
authoritie aboue her husband,
but he nameth man in generall, taking
frome her all power and authoritie, to
speake, to reason, to interprete, or to
teache, but principallie to rule or to
iudge in the assemblie of men. So that
woman by the lawe of God, and by the
interpretation of the holy ghost, is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
forbidden to occupie the place of
God in the offices afore said, which he
hath assigned to man, whome he hath
appointed and ordeined his lieutenant
in earth: secluding frome that honor a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
dignitie all woman, as this short argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>
               <note place="margin">A strong argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> The apostle taketh power frome all

he permitteth no woman to rule aboue

doth the couclusion of necessitie
<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> folowe. For he that taketh from woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the least parte of authoritie, dominion
or rule, will not permit vnto her that
whiche is greatest: But greater it is to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8577:17"/>
reigne aboue realmes and nations, to
publish and to make lawes, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande
men of all estates, and finallie to
appoint iudges and ministers, then to
speake in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation. For her iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
sentence, or opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proposed in
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, may be iudged by all,
may be corrected by the learned, and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formed
by the godlie. But woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being
promoted in souereine authoritie, her
la wes must be obeyed, her opinion fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and her tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie mainteined:supposing
that it be expreslie against God,
and the prophet of the common welth,
as to manifest experience doth this day
witnesse. And therfore yet againe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pete
that, whiche before I haue affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
to witt, that a woman promoted
to sit in the seate of God, that is, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache,
to iudge or to reigne aboue man,
is a monstre in nature, contumelie to
God, and a thing most repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to his
will a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For he hath depriued
them as before is proued, of speakinge
in the congregation, and hath expreslie
forbidden them to vsurpe any kinde of
<pb facs="tcp:8577:18"/>
authoritie aboue man. Howe then will
he suffer them to reigne a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d haue empire
aboue realmes and nations? He will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
I say, approue it, because it is a thing
most repugnant to his perfect ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
as after shalbe declared, and as the
former scriptures haue plainlie geuen
testimonie. To the whiche, to adde any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing
were superfluous, were it not
that the worlde is almost nowe comen
to that blindnes, that what soeuer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not the princes and the multitude,
the same is reiected as doctrine newe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
forged, and is condemned for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
I haue therfore thoght good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the mindes of some auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the same mater, to the end that
suche as altogither be not blinded by
the deuil, may consider and vnderstand
this my iudgement to be no newe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of Goddes scriptures, but
to be the vniforme consent of the most

of the apostles. Tertullian<note place="margin">Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. de habitu mulieru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d doth it yet abide in thy mind to dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke

many other graue sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, and quicke
interrogations, did this godlie writer
labour to bring euerie woman in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of her selfe, to the end that
euerie one depelie weying, what senten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
God had ꝓnounced against the hole
race a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d doughters of Heua, might not
onely learne daily to humble and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
them selues in the presence of God,
but also that they shulde auoide a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
what soeuer thing might exalte
<pb facs="tcp:8577:19"/>
them or puffe them vp in pride, or that
might be occasion, that they shuld for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the curse and malediction of God.
And what, I pray you, is more able to
cause woman to forget her owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
then if she be lifted vp in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
aboue man? It is a thing verie dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficile
to a man, (be he neuer so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant)
promoted to honors, not to be tickled
some what with pride (for the winde of
vaine glorie doth easelie carie vp the
<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> drie dust of the earth). But as for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
it is no more possible, that she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
set aloft in authoritie aboue man,
shall resist the motions of pride, then it
is able to the weake reed, or to the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wethercocke, not to bowe or tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
at the vehemencie of the vnconstant
wind. And therfore the same writer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preslie
forbiddeth all woman to intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medle
<note place="margin">Tertull. lib.<hi>8.</hi> de virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus velan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dis.</note> with the office of man. For thus

It is not permitted to a woman, to spea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, nether to teache,
nether to baptise, nether to vendicate
to her selfe any office of man. The same
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8577:19"/>
he speaketh yet more plainly in the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>face
of his sixte boke writen against
Marcion, where he recounting certein<note place="margin">In proce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mio <hi>6.</hi> lib. contra Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note>
monstruous thinges, whiche were to be
sene at the sea called <hi>Euxinum,</hi> amongest
the rest, he reciteth this as a greate mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre
in nature, that women in those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
were not tamed nor embased by
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of their own sex and kind:
but that all shame laide a parte, they
made expenses vpon weapons and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the feates of warre, hauinge more
pleasure to fight, then to mary and be
subiect to man. Thus farre of Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
whose wordes be so plain, that
they nede no explanation. For he that
taketh from her all office apperteining
to man, will not suffre her to reigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
man: and he that iudgeth it a mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stre
in nature, that a woman shall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
weapons, must iudge it to be a mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stre
of monstres, that a woman shalbe
exalted aboue a hole realme and natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

addeth these wordes: God seeth not for

in his sight and knowledge, meaninge
therby, that what God hath sene in one
woman (as concerning dominion and
bearing of authoritie) the same he seeth

<note place="margin">Ambros. in Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emero, lib.<hi>5.</hi>c.<hi>7.</hi>
               </note> thus writeth in his Hexaemeron: Adam
was deceiued by Heua, and not Heua
by Adam, and therfore iust it is, that wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man
receiue and acknowledge him for
gouernor whom she called to sinne, lest
that again she slide and fall by woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
facilitie. And writing vpon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
<note place="margin">Cap.<hi>5.</hi>
               </note> to the Ephesians, he saith: let
women be subiect to their owne hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8577:21"/>
as vnto the Lorde: for the man
is heade to the woman, and Christ is
heade to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, and he is the
sauiour of the bodie: but the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is subiect to Christ, euen so oght
wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be to their husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des in all thin
ges. He procedeth further saying: wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are commanded to be subiect to
men by the lawe of nature, because that
man is the author or beginner of the
woman: for as Christ is the head of the
churche, so is man of the woman. From
Christ, the church toke beginning, and
therfore it is subiect vnto him: euen so
did woman take beginning from man,
that she shuld be subiect. Thus we heare
the agreing of these two writers to be
such, that a man might iudge the one to
haue stolen the wordes and sentences
from the other. And yet plain it is, that
duringe the time of their writinge, the
one was farre distant frome the other.
But the holie ghost, who is the spirite
of concorde and vnitie, did so illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
their hartes, and directe their ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and pennes, that as they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb facs="tcp:8577:22"/>
ceiue a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d one truth, so did they
pronounce and vtter the same, leauing
a testimonie of their knowledge and
concorde to vs their posteritie. If any
thinke that all these former sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, be
spoken onelie of the subiection of the
maryed woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to her husband, as before
I haue proued the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, by the plain
wordes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reasoning of S. Paule, so shal
I shortlie do the same, by other testimo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies
of the forsaid writers. The same Am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brose
<note place="margin">Ambros. super <hi>2.</hi> c.<hi>1.</hi> epist.ad Timoth.</note> writing vpon the second chapitre
of the first epistle to Timothie, after he
hath spoken much of the simple array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of women: he addeth these wordes:
woman oght not onelie to haue simple
arrayme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but all authoritie is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
vnto her: for she must be in subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to man (of whome she hath taken
her originall) aswell in habit as in serui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce.
And after a fewe wordes he saith: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that death did entre in to the
world by her, there is no boldenes that
oght to be permitted vnto her, but she
oght to be in humilitie. Hereof it is
plain, that frome all woman, be she ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8577:22"/>
or vnmaried, is all authoritie taken
to execute any office, that appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to man. Yea plain it is that all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is commanded, to serue, to be in
humilitie and subiection. Whiche thing
yet speaketh the same writer, more
plainlie in these wordes: It is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted<note place="margin">Ambros. in <hi>1.</hi> epist. ad Corin, cap. <hi>14.</hi> Genes.<hi>3.</hi>
               </note>
to wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speake, but to be in
silence, as the lawe saith. What saith the
lawe? Vnto thy husband, shall thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
be, and he shall beare domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ouer the. This is a speciall lawe
(saith Ambrose) whose sentence, lest it
shulde be violated, infirmed, or made
weake, women are commanded to be in
silence. Here he includeth all women.
And yet he ꝓcedeth further in the same
place saying: It is shame for them to pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sume
to speake of the lawe in the house
of the Lord, who hath comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them
to be subiect to their men. But moste
plainly speaketh he writing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 16.
chapitre of the epistle of S. Paule<note place="margin">whose hou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se I pray you oght the parlia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t house to be, God<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des or the deuilles? Rufus is by S. Paul saluted be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore his mother.</note> to the
Romaines, vpon these wordes: Salute
Rufus and his mother. For this cause
(saith Ambrose) did the apostle place
<pb facs="tcp:8577:23"/>
Rufus before his mother, for the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the administration of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of God, in the whiche a woman hath
no place. For he was chosen and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Lorde, to take care ouer his
busines, that is, ouer the churche, to the
whiche office could not his mother be
appointed, albeit she was a woman so
holie, that the apostle called her his mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther.
Hereof it is plaine that the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the grace of God, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to all woman. By the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Goddes grace, is vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not
onely the preaching of the worde and
administration of the sacramentes, by
the whiche the grace of God is presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and ordinarilie distributed vnto
man, but also the administration of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
iustice, by the whiche, vertue oght
to be mainteined, and vices punished.
The execution wherof is no lesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then is the preaching of
the Euangile, or administration of the

            <p>Chrysostome amongest the Grecian
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8577:23"/>
writers of no small credit, speaking in
rebuke of men, who in his dayes, were
becomen inferior to some women in
witt and in godlines, saith:<note place="margin">Chrysost. homil.<hi>17.</hi> in genes.</note> for this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
was woman put vnder thy power (he
speaketh to man in generall) and thou
wast pronounced Lorde ouer her, that
she shulde obey the, and that the head
shuld not folowe the feet. But often it
is, that we see the contrary, that he who
in his ordre oght to be the head, doth
not kepe the ordre of the feet (that is,
doth not rule the feet) and that she, that
is in place of the foote, is constitute to
be the head. He speaketh these wordes
as it were in admiration, that man was<note place="margin">NOTE.</note>
becomen so brutish, that he did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it to be a thing most monstruouse,
that woman shulde be preferred to man
in any thing, whom God had subiected
to man in all thinges. He procedeth
saying: Neuer the lesse it is the parte
of the man, with diligent care to repel
the woman, that geueth him wicked
counsel: and woman, whiche gaue that
pestilent counsel to man, oght at all ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes

<note place="margin">Homil.<hi>15</hi> in Genes.</note> And in an other place he induceth God
speaking to the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this sorte: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou left him, of whose nature
thou wast participant, and for whome
thou wast formed, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hast had pleasure

saying: womankinde is imprudent

she can not consider withe wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

they are easelie persuaded to any

proof that in vertue they farre differ
frome man. Let the reasons of this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be marked, for further he yet proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth:
after that he hath in many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
lamented the effeminate maners of
men, who were so farre degenerate to
the weaknes of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that some might
<pb facs="tcp:8577:25"/>
haue demanded: why may not women
teache amongest suche a sorte of men,
who in wisdome and godlines are be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
inferior vnto women? He finallie
concludeth: that not withstanding that
men be degenerate, yet may not women
vsurpe any authoritie aboue them, and
in the end, he addeth these wordes:
These thinges do not I speake to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolle
them (that is women) but to the
confusion and shame of our felues, and
to admonish vs to take again the domi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion,
that is mete and conuenient for
vs, not onelie that power which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the excellencie of dignitie:
<note place="margin">The body lackinge the head, can not be well gouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned nether can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welth lackinge man.</note> but that which is accordinge to proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and according to helpe, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
For then is the bodie in best propor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,
when it hath the best gouernor. O
that both man and woman shulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the profound counsel and admoni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of this father! He wolde not that
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for appetit of any vaine glorie shuld
desire preeminence aboue woman. For
God hath not made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be heade for
any suche cause: but hauing respecte to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8577:25"/>
that weaknes and imperfection which
alwayes letteth woman to gouerne.
He hath ordeined man to be superior,
and that meaneth Chrysostome, saying:
then is the bodie in best proportion,
when it hath the best gouernor. But wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man
can neuer be the best gouernor, by
reason that she being spoiled of the spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit
of regiment, can neuer attein to that
degree, to be called or iudged a good
gouernor. Because in the nature of all
woman, lurketh suche vices, as in good
gouernors are not tolerable. Which the<note place="margin">In ca.<hi>22.</hi>Ioh. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil.<hi>87.</hi>
               </note>
same writer expresseth in these wordes:
woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind (saith he) is rashe and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardie,
and their couetousnes is like
the goulf of hell, that is, insaciable. And<note place="margin">In Ioh. homil.<hi>41.</hi>
               </note>
therfore in an other place, he will that
woman shall haue no thing to do in iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gement,
in common affaires, or in the
regiment of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, because
she is impacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of troubles, but that she
shall liue in tranquillitie, and quietnes.
And if she haue occasion to go frome
the house, that yet she shal haue no mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er
of trouble, nether to folowe her, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:8577:26"/>
to be offered vnto her, as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
there must be to such as beare autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie.
And with Chrysostome fullie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
Basilius Magnus<note place="margin">Basilius Mag. in aliquot scripturae locos.</note> in a sermon
which he maketh vpon some places of
scripture, wherin he reproueth diuers
vices and amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest the rest, he affirmeth
woman to be a tendre creature, flexible,
soft and pitifull: whiche nature, God
hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto her, that she may be apt

broght her frome the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God.
And therfore in diuers other places
doth he conclude, that she is not apt to
beare rule, and that she is forbidden to
teache. Innumerable mo testimonies,
of all sortes of writers may be adduced
for the same purpose, but withe these I
stand content: iudgeing it sufficient to
stoppe the mouthe of such as accuse a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
condemne all doctrine, as hereticall,
whiche displeaseth them in any point
that I haue proued, by the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and lawes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> illuminated one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
by the light of nature, by the ordre
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8577:26"/>
of Goddes creation, by the curse and
maledictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pronounced against woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
by the mouth of saint Paule, who is the
interpreter of Goddes sentence, and
lawe, and finallie by the mindes of those
writers, who in the church of God, haue
bene alwayes holden in greatest reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: that
it is a thing moste repugnant
to nature, to Goddes will and apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ordinance, (yea that it can not be
without contumelie committed against
God) that a woman shuld be promoted
to dominion or empire to reigne ouer
man, be it in realme, natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, prouince or
citie. Now resteth it in fewe wordes, to
be shewed, that the same empire of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
is the subuersion of good ordre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
and iustice.</p>
            <p>Augustine defineth ordre to be that<note place="margin">De ordine lib.<hi>1.</hi>c.<hi>10</hi>
               </note>
thing, by the whiche God hath apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and ordeined all thinges. Note well
reader, that Augustine will admit no or
dre, where Goddes apointment is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and lacketh.</p>
            <p>And in an other place he saith, that or<note place="margin">De ciuit. Dei, lib.<hi>19</hi>cap.<hi>13.</hi>

dre is a disposition, geuing their owne

whiche he termeth in Latin <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium
&amp; disparium,</hi> that is, of thinges equall
or like, and thinges vnequall or vnlike.
Of whiche two places and of the hole
disputation, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
boke <hi>de ordine</hi> it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that what

his will manifestlie reueled in his word,

empire and regiment of all woman (as
euidentlie before is declared) and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I say, it is a thing plainlie repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to good ordre, yea it is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of the same. If any list to reiect
the definition of Augustin, as ether not

For as I depend not vpon the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8577:27"/>
plain and euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t on my side. That God
hath subiected womankinde to man by
the ordre of his creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and by the curse
that he hath pronounced against her, is
before declared. Besides these, he hath<note place="margin">Two mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, in which we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the ordre of nature.</note>
set before our eyes, two other mirrors
and glasses, in whiche he will, that we
shulde behold the ordre, which he hath
apointed and established in nature: the
one is, the naturall bodie of man: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the politik or ciuile body of that
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, in which God by his own
word hath apointed an ordre. In the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural
body of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>God hath apointed an
ordre, that the head shall occupie the
vppermost place. And the head hath he
ioyned with the bodie, that frome it,
doth life and motion flowe to the rest
of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres. In it hath he placed the
eye to see, the eare to hear, and the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
to speake, which offices are apointed
to none other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of the bodie. The
rest of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres, haue euery one their

may haue nether the place nor office of

<pb facs="tcp:8577:28"/>
that bodie to be a monstre, where there
was no head emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t aboue the rest, but
that the eyes were in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
and mouth beneth in the belie, and the

            <p>But iust and rightuouse, terrible and

and horrible ingratitude of the realmes
of England and Scotland. For when
thou diddest offre thy selfe moste mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifullie
to them both, offering the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
by the whiche they might haue bene
ioyned to gether for euer in godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8577:31"/>
then was the one proud a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cruel,
and the other vnconstant, and fikle of
promise. But yet (alas) did miserable
England further rebell against the. For
albeit thou diddest not cease to heape
benefit vpon benefit, during the reigne
of an innocent and tendre king, yet no
man did acknowledge thy potent hand
and meruelouse working. The stoute<note place="margin">what rob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bed God of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in England in the time of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell.</note>

of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selers, the learning of bishop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pes,
did robbe the of thy glorie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.
For what then was heard, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
religion, but the kinges procedin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
the kinges procedinges must be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed?
It is enacted by parliament:
therefore it is treason to speake in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trarie.
But this was not the end of this
miserable tragedie. For thou diddest<note place="margin">Goddes be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefites she wed to En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gland.</note>
yet procede to offre thy fauors, sending
thy prophetes and messagers, to call for

frome the highest to the lowest, all
were declined frome the (yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those
that shuld haue bene the lanterns to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
some I am affured did qwake and
<pb facs="tcp:8577:32"/>
tremble, and frome the botome of their
hartes thirsted amendment, and for the
same purpose did earnestly call for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.
But then brust furth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
which before lurked: then might
they not conteine their despiteful voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but with open mouthes did crie:
we will not haue suche a one to reigne
<note place="margin">Discipline refused in England.</note>
ouer vs. Then, I say, was euerie man so
stoute, that he wolde not be broght in
bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage: no not to the, ô Lord, but with
disdein did the multitude cast frome
them the amiable yoke of Christ Iesus.
No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wolde suffre his finne to be rebu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked,
no man wolde haue his life called
to triall. And thus did they refuse the,
ô Lorde, and thy sonne Christ Iesus to
be their pastor, protector and prince.
And therefore hast thou geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them ouer
in to a reprobat minde. Thou hast take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
from them the spirit of boldnes, of wis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome
<note place="margin">The nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and the hole realme of England, castle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly in to the pit.</note> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of rightuous iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. They
see their owne destruction, and yet they
haue no grace to auoide it. Yea they are
becomen so blinde, that knowing the
pit, they headlong cast them selues in to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8577:32"/>
the same: as the nobilitie of England,
do this day, fighting in the defense of
their mortall ennemie the spaniard.
Finallie they are so destitute of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and iudgement, that althogh
they knowe that there is a libertie and
fredome, the whiche their predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
haue inioyed: yet are they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled
to bowe their neckes vnder the yoke of
Satan, and of his proude ministres, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent
papistes and proude spaniardes.
And yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider that where
a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reigneth and papistes beare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
that there must nedes Satan
be prefident of the counsel. Thus hast
thou, ô Lorde, in thy hote displeasure
reuenged the contempt of thy graces
offred. But, ô Lord, if thou shalt reteine
wrath to the end, what fleshe is able to
susteine? We haue sinned, ô Lord, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d are<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession.</note>
not worthy to be releued. But worthy
art thou, ô Lorde, to be a true God,
and worthy is thy sonne Christ Iesus, to
haue his Euangil and glorie aduanced:
whiche both are troden vnder foot in
this cruell murther and persecution,
<pb facs="tcp:8577:33"/>
whiche the builders of Babylon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit
in their furie, haue raised against thy
children, for the establishing of their
kingdome. Let the sobbes therfore of
thy prisoners, ô Lord, passe vp to thine
eares, consider their affliction: and let
the eyes of thy mercie looke downe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the blood of such as die for testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of thy eternal veritie: and let not
thine ennemies mocke thy iudgement
for euer. To the, o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lorde, I turne my
wretched and wicked hart: to the alone
I direct my complaint and grones: for
in that Ile to thy faintes there is left no
comforte. Albeit I haue thus (talkinge
with my God in the anguishe of my
harte) some what digressed: yet haue I
not vtterlie forgotten my former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
to witt, that it is a thing repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the ordre of nature, that any wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man
be exalted to rule ouer men. For
God hath denied vnto her the office of
a heade. And in the intreating of this
parte, I remembre that I haue made the
nobilitie both of England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
inferior to brute beastes, for that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8577:33"/>
they do to women, which no male amon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gest
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sorte of beastes can be
proued to do to their females: that is,
they reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce them, and qwake at their
presence, they obey their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandemen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes,
and that against God. Wherfore I
iudge them not onelie subiectes to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
but sclaues of Satan, and seruantes
of iniquitie. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinke these my
wordes sharpe or vehement, let him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that the offense is more haynous,
then can be expressed by wordes. For
where all thinges, be expressedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
against the glorie and honor of
God, and where the blood of the sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of God is commanded to be shed,
whome shall we iudge, God or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil,

it is, that God ruleth not by his loue,

            <p>
               <note place="margin">NOTE.</note> The seconde glasse, whiche God hath
set before the eyes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherin he may

that any woman shall occupie

and vnchangeable will of God, to

the Iewes: further if the execution
of iustice be no lesse requisite in the
policie of the gentiles, then euer it was
amongest the Iewes: what man can be
so foolishe to suppose or beleue, that
God will no we admit those persons, to
sit in iudgement or to reigne ouer men
in the common welth of the gentiles,
whom he by his expressed word and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,

from the royall seate, the which
oght to be the sanctuarie to all poore
afflicted, and therfore is iustlie called

the places of the new testament,
whiche be moste euident) the ordre and
election which was kept in Iuda and Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
doth manifestlie declare. For when<note place="margin">NOTE.</note>
the males of the kinglie stocke failed,
as oft as it chaunced in Israel and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in Iuda, it neuer entered in to
the hartes of the people of chose
<pb facs="tcp:8577:37"/>
and promote to honors any of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
doughters, (had he neuer so many)
but knowing Goddes vengeance to be
poured furth vpon the father by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
taking of his sonnes, they had no
further respect to his stocke, but elected
suche one man or other, as they iudged
most apt for that honor and authoritie.
Of whiche premisses, I conclude (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
that to promote a woman heade
ouer men, is repugnant to nature, and a
thinge moste contrarious to that ordre,
whiche God hath approued in that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
welth, whiche he did institute and
rule by his worde. But no we to the last
point, to wit, that the empire of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is a thing repugnant to iustice, and
the destruction of euerie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth,
where it is receiued. In probation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
because the mater is more then eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<note place="margin">The first argument that the authoritie of women repugneth to iustice.</note> I will vse fewe wordes. First, I say,
if iustice be a constant and perpetuall
will to geue to euerie person, their own
right (as the moste learned in all ages
haue defined it to be) then to geue, or to
will to geue to any person, that whiche
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8577:37"/>
is not their right, must repugne to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
But to reigne aboue man, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be the right to woman: because it is
a thinge denied vuto her by God, as is
before declared. Therfore to promote
her to that estat or dignitie, can be no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing
els but repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie to iustice. If I
shulde speake no more, this were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
For except that ether they can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
the definition of iustice, or els
that they can intreate God to reuoke
and call backe his sentence pronounced
against woman, they shalbe compelled
to admit my conclusion. If any finde fau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te
with iustice, as it is defined, he may
well accuse others, but me he shall not
hurt. For I haue the shield, the weapon,
and the warrant of him, who assuredlie
will defend this quarel, and he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
me to crie:</p>
            <p>What soeuer repugneth to the will of<note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d argument.</note>
god expressed in his most sacred worde,
repugneth to iustice: but that women
haue authoritie ouer men repugneth to
the will of God expressed in his worde:
and therfore mine author commandeth
<pb facs="tcp:8577:38"/>
me to conclude without feare, that all
suche authoritie repugneth to iustice.
The first parte of the argument I trust
dare nether Iewe nor gentile denie: for
it is a principle not onelie vniuersallie
confessed, but also so depelie printed
in the hart of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be his nature neuer so
corrupted, that whether he will or no,
he his compelled at one time or other,
<note place="margin">Nature doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that repugnan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie to God<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des will is iniustice.</note> to acknowledge and confesse, that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
is violated, when thinges are done
against the will of God, expressed by
his worde. And to this confession are
no lesse the reprobat coacted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
then be the chosen childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
god, albeit to a diuers end the elect with
displeasure of their facte, confesse their
offense, hauing accesse to grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie,
as did Adam, Dauid, Peter, and all
<note place="margin">Howe the reprobat confesse Goddes will to be iust.</note> other penitent offenders. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat,
not withstanding they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to acknowledge the will of God
to be iust the which they haue offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded,
yet are they neuer in wardlie displeased,
with their iniquitie, but rage, complain
and storme against God, whose ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8577:38"/>
they can not escape: as did Cain,<note place="margin">Genes.<hi>4.</hi> Mat.<hi>27.</hi>
               </note>
Iudas, Herode, Iulian called apostata,
Yea Iesabel, and Athalia. For Cain no
doubte was conuict in conscience, that
he had done against justice in murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his brother, Iudas did openlie,
before the high priest confesse that he
had sinned, in betraying innocent
blood. Herode being stricken by the
angel, did mocke those his flaterers,
saying vnto them: beholde your God
(meaning of him selfe) can not nowe
preserue him self frome corruption and
wormes. Iulianus was compelled in the
end to crie, O galilean (so alwayes in
contempt did he name our sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ) thou hast nowe ouercomen.
And who doubteth but Iesabel, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia,
before their miserable end, were
conuicted in their cankered conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to acknowledge that the murther,
which they had committed, and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
whiche the one had six yeares vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
were repugnant to iustice: Euen
so shall they I doubte not, whiche this
daye do possesse and mainteine that
<pb facs="tcp:8577:39"/>
               <note place="margin">womans authoritie bringeth furth mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stres.</note> monstriferous authoritie of women,
shortlie be compelled to acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
that their studies and deuises, haue
bene bent against God: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that all such
authoritie as women haue vsurped, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth
to iustice, because, as I haue
saide, it repugneth to the will of God
expressed in his sacred worde. And if
any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubte herof, let him marke wel
the wordes of the apostle, saying: I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

man I trust will denie these wordes of
the apostle, to be the wil of God expres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
in his worde: and he saith openlie,
I permit not &amp;c. Which is asmuch as, I
will not, that a woman haue authority,

importeth the greke worde <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in

preserue her selfe, nether yet her adulte

and frome the sworde of Goddes ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
whiche shall shortlie apprehend
suche workes of iniquitie. The admoni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
I differre to the end.</p>
            <p>Here might I bring in the oppression
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iniustice, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted against
realmes and nations, whiche some times
liued free, and now are broght in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of forein nations, by the reason of
this monstriferous authoritie and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of women. But that I delay till bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
oportunitie. And now I think it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to answer such obiections, as
carnal and worldlie men, yea men igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rant
of God, vse to make for maintenan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
of this tyrannie (authoritie it is not
worthie to be called) and most vniuste
empire of woman.</p>
            <p>First they do obiect the examples of<note place="margin">Iudic.<hi>4.</hi> Para.<hi>34.</hi>
               </note>
Debora, and of Hulda the prophetesse,
<pb facs="tcp:8577:40"/>
               <note place="margin">The defen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses of the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note>
of whom the one iudged Israel, and the
other, by all apparance, did teache and
exhorte.</p>
            <p>Secondarily they do object the lawe
made by Moses for the doughters of
<note place="margin">Num. <hi>27</hi>
               </note> zalphead. Thirdlie the consent of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of such realmes as haue approued
the empire and regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of women. And
last the long custome, which hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the regiment of women. Their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
actes and prosperitie, together with
some papistical lawes, which haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the same.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Answer to the first obiection.</note> To the first, I answer, that particular
examples do establishe no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lawe.
The causes were knowen to God alon,
why he toke the spirite of wisdome
and force frome all men of those ages,
and did so mightely assist wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against
nature, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d against his ordinarie course:
that the one he made a deliuerer to his
afflicted people Israel: and to the other
he gaue not onlie perseuerance in the
true religion, when the moste parte of
men had declined frome the same, but
also to her he gaue the spirit of prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8577:40"/>
to assure king Iosias of the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which were to come. With these wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men,
I say, did God worke pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie, and
miraculouslie, yea to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he gaue moste
singular grace and priuiledge. But who
hath commanded, that a publike, yea a
tyrannicall and moste wicked lawe be
established vpon these examples? The<note place="margin">Examples against lawe haue no stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth when the question is of lawe.</note>
men that obiect the same, are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ignorant, that examples haue no
strength, when the question is of lawe.
As if I shuld aske, what mariage is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?
and it shulde be answered that lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
it is to man, not onelie to haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
wiues at ones, but also it is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to marie two sisters, and to enioye
them both liuing at ones, because that
Dauid, Iacob, and Salomon, seruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of God did the same. I trust that no
man wold iustifie the vanitie of this rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son.
Or if the question were demanded,
if a Christian, with good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science may
defraude, steale or deceiue: and answer
were made that so he might by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Israelites, who at Goddes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandement,
deceiued the Egyptians,
<pb facs="tcp:8577:41"/>
and spoiled them of their garmentes,
golde and syluer. I thinke likewise this
reason shuld be mocked. And what grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
force, I pray you, hath the former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument?
Debora did rule in Israel, and
Hulda spoke prophecie in Iuda: <hi>Ergo</hi> it
is laufull for women to reigne aboue
realmes and nations, or to teache in
the presence of men. The consequent is
<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> vain and of none effect. For of exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples,
as is before declared, we may establishe
no lawe, but we are alwayes bounde to
the lawe writen, and to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
expressed in the same. And the lawe
writen and pronounced by God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
no lesse that any woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reigne
ouer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then it forbiddeth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take
pluralitie of wiues, to mary two sisters
liuing at ons, to steale, to robbe, to mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
or to lie. If any of these hath bene
transgressed, and yet God hath not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
the same: it maketh not the like
fact or dede lawfull vnto vs. For God
being free, may for suche causes as be
approued by his inscrutable wisdome,
dispense with the rigor of his lawe, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8577:41"/>
may vse his creatures at his pleasure.
But the same power is not permitted to
man, whom he hath made subiect to his
lawe, and not to the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of fathers.
And this I thinke sufficient to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and moderate spirites. But to
represse the raging of woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s madnes,
I will descend somwhat deeper in to
the mater, and not feare to affirme: that
as we find a contrarie spirit in all these
moste wicked women, that this day be
exalted in to this tyrannouse authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to the spirite that was in those god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
matrons: so I feare not, I say, to affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
that their condition is vnlike, and
that their end shalbe diuers. In those<note place="margin">Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the former ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trones, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our Iesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles.</note>
matrones we finde that the spirit of mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie,
truthe, iustice and of humilitie did
reigne. Vnder them we finde that God
did shewe mercie to his people, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them frome the tyrannie of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,
and from the venom of idolatrie
by the handes and counsel of those wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
but in these of our ages, we finde
crueltie, falshed, pride, couetousnes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
and oppression. In them we also
<pb facs="tcp:8577:42"/>
finde the spirit of Iesabel, and Athalia,
vnder them we finde the simple people
oppressed, the true religion extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the blood of Christes membres
most cruellie shed. And finallie by their
practises and deceit, we finde auncient
realmes and nations geuen and betra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed
in to the handes of strangiers, the
titles and liberties of them taken frome
the iuste possessors. Which one thinge
is an euident testimonie, howe vnlike
our mischeuous Maryes be vnto Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,
vnder whome were strangiers chased
owt of Israel, God so raising her vp to
be a mother and deliuerer to his oppres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
people. But (alas) he hath raised vp
these Iesabelles to be the vttermoste of
<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> his plagues, the whiche mans vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
hath lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g deserued. But his secret
and most iust iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, shal nether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
them, nether their mainteiners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their counsels be diuers. But to
prosecute my purpose, let such as list to
defend these monstres in their tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie,
proue first, that their souereine maistres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses
be like to Debora in godlines and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8577:42"/>
pitie: and secondarilie, that the same
successe doth folowe their tyrannie,
which did folowe the extraordinarie
regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that godlie matrone. Which
thing althogh they were able to do (as
they neuer shalbe, let them blowe til
they brust) yet shall her example profet<note place="margin">NOTE</note>
them nothing at all. For they are neuer
able to prouc that ether Debora, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">No god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did euer claime au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer man by reason of her birth and blood.</note>
other godlie woman (hauing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendation
of the holie ghoste within
the scriptures) hath vsurped authoritie
aboue any realme or nation, by reason
of their birth and blood. Nether yet did
they claime it by right or inheritance:
but God by his singular priuiledge, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor,
aud grace, exempted Debora from
the common malediction geuen to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in that behalf: and against nature
he made her prudent in counsel, strong
in courage, happie in regiment, and a
blessed mother and deliuerer to his peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple.<note place="margin">why God sometimes worketh by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie meanes.</note>
The whiche he did partlie to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
and notifie the power of his
maiestie as well to his ennemies, as to
his owne people: in that that he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:8577:43"/>
himself able to geue saluation and
deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, by meanes of the moste we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake
vesselles: and partlie he did it to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>found and ashame all man of that age,
because they had for the moste part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
frome his true obedience. And
therfore was the spirit of courage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
and boldnes taken frome them
for a time to their confusion and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
humiliation. But what maketh this
for Mary and her matche Philippe? One
thing I wold aske of suche as depend
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Debora, whether she
was widowe or wife, when she iudged
Israel, and when that God gaue that no
table victorie to his people vnder her?
If they answer she was widowe, I wold
lay against them the testimonie of the
holie ghost, witnessinge that she was
<note place="margin">Iudic. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> wife to Lapidoth. And if they will
shift, and alledge, that so she might be
called, not witstanding that her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
was dead, I vrge them further,
that they are not able to proue it to be
any common phrase and maner of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache
in the scriptures, that a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8577:43"/>
be called the wife of a dead man, except
that there be some note added, wherbie
it may be knowen that her husband is<note place="margin">Luc. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note>
departed, as is witnessed of <hi>Anna.</hi> But in<note place="margin">Iudic. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>
this place of the iudges, there is no note
added, that her husband shuld be dead,
but rather the expressed contrarie. For
the text saith: In that time a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> named
Debora a ꝓphetesse, wife to Lapidoth
iudged Israel. The holie ghost plainlie
speaketh, that what time she iudged Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
she was wife to Lapidoth. If she was
wife, and if she ruled all alone in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note>
then I aske why did she not preferre her
husband to that honor to be capitain,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be leader to the host of the Lord.
If any thinke that it was her husbande,
the text proueth the contrarie. For it af
firmeth that Barak, of the tribe of Neph
talie was apointed to that office. If Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak
had bene her husband: to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
shuld the holie ghost so diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
haue noted the tribe, and an other
name then was before expressed? Yea
to what purpose shuld it be noted, that
she send and called him? wherof I doubt
<pb facs="tcp:8577:44"/>
not, but that euerie reasonable man
doth consider that this Barak was not
her husband, and therof likwise it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident,
that her iudgement or gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement
in Israel was no such vsurped
power, as our quenes vniustlie possesse
this day, but that it was the spirit of
prophecie, which rested vpon her, what
time the multitude of the people had
wroght wickedlie in the eyes of the
Lord: by the whiche spirit, she did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
the idolatrie and iniquitie of the

in the end, did bring them this comfort,
that God shuld deliuer them from the

And this she might do, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that an other did occupie the
<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> place of the supreme magistrat, (if any
was in those dayes in Israel) for so I fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

is the true meaning of the holie ghost,
the pondering and weying of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
shall manifestlie proue. When she
sendeth for Barak, I pray you, in whose<note place="margin">Dobora comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not as princes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande.</note>
name geueth she him his charge? Doth
she speake to him as kinges and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
vse to speake to their subiectes in
suche cases? No, but she speaketh, as
she that had a speciall reuelation frome
God, whiche nether was knowen to
Barak nor to the people, saying: hath
not the Lord God of Israel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded
the? This is her preface, by the whiche
she wold stirre vp the dull senses of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak,
and of the people, willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
vnto them, that the time was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
when God wold shewe him selfe
their protector and deliuerer, in which
preface she vsurpeth to her selfe, nether
power nor authoritie. For she saith not,
I being thy princes, thy maistresse, thy
souereine Jadie and quene, commande
the vpon thine allegeance, and vnder
pain of treason to go, and gather an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.
No, she spoileth her self of all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to commande, attributing that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb facs="tcp:8577:45"/>
to God, of whom she had her
reuelation and certitude to apoint Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak
capitain, whiche after appeareth
more plainlie. For when she had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to him the hole counsel of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
vnto him as well the nombre
of his souldiors, as the tribes, owt of
which they shuld be gathered: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
she had apointed the place of the batel,
(whiche she coulde not haue done, but
by especiall reuelation of God) and
had assured him of victorie in the name
of God, and yet that he fainted and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlie
refused, to entre in to that iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
except that the prophetesse wold ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>companie
him, she did vse against him
no external power, she did not threaten
him with rebellion and death, but for
assurance of his faint hart and weake co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>science,
being content to go with him,
she pronounceth, that the glorie shulde
not be his in that iourney, but that the
Lord shuld sell Sisera in to the hand of
a woman. Such as haue more pleasure in
light then in darknes, may clearlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that Debora did vsurpe no such
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8577:45"/>
power nor authoritie, as our quenes do
this day claime. But that she was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with the spirit of wisdome, of
knowledge, and of the true feare of
God: and by the same she iudged the
factes of the rest of the people. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
their defection and idolatry, yea
and also did redresse to her power, the
iniuries, that were done by man to man.
But all this, I say, she did by the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
sworde, that is, by the worde of
God, and not by any temporall regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
or authoritie, whiche she did vsurpe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Israel. In which, I suppose, at that
time there was no laufull magistrate, by
the reason of their greate affliction.
For so witnesseth the historie, saying:
And Ehud being dead, the Lorde sold
Israel in to the hand of Iabin king of
Canaan. And he by Sisera his capitain
afflicted Israel greatlie the space of
twentie yeares. And Debora her self, in
her song of thankes geuing, confesseth
that before she did arise mother in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
and in the dayes of Iael, there was
nothing but confusion and trouble. If
<pb facs="tcp:8577:46"/>
any sticke to the terme, alledging that
the holie ghost saith, that she iudged
Israel:let them vnderstand, that nether
doth the Ebrue word, nether yet the La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tin,
<note place="margin">To iudge is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Isaie <hi>2.</hi> Isaie <hi>42.</hi> Mich. <hi>4.</hi> Isaie <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> alwayes signifie ciuile iudgement,
or the execution of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall sword,
but moste commonlie is taken in the
sense, whiche we haue before expressed.
For of Christ it is said: he shal iudge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And that he shall pronounce
iudgement to the gentiles. And yet it is
euident, that he was no minister of the
temporal sword. God commandeth Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
and Iuda to iudge betwixt him
and his vineyarde, and yet he apointed
not them all to be ciuil magistrates. To
<note place="margin">EZech.<hi>20</hi> Ezech.<hi>22</hi> Ezech.<hi>34</hi>
               </note> Ezechiel it is said: shalt thou not iudge

of man, shalt thou not iudge? shalt
thou not iudge, I say, the citie of blood?
and also: behold, I shall iudge betwixt
beast a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d beast. And such places in great
nombre, are to be founde thrughout
the hole scriptures, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet I trust no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wilbe so foolish, as to thinke that any
of the Prophetes were apointed by God
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8577:46"/>
to be politike iudges, or to punishe the
sinnes of man, by corporal punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
No the maner of their iudgement is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in these wordes: Declare to<note place="margin">EZech.<hi>22</hi>
               </note>
them all their abominations, and thou
shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lorde
God: a citie shedding blood in the
middest of her, that her time may appro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
and which hath made idoles against
her selfe, that she might be polluted.
Thou hast transgressed in the blood
which thou hast shed, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thou art pollu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
in the idoles, which thou hast made.
Thus, I say, do the prophetes of God
iudge, pronouncing the sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God
against malefactors. And so I doubt not
but Debora iudged, what time Israel
had declined from God: rebuking their
defection, and exhorting them to repen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance,
without vsurpation of any ciuill
authoritie. And if the people gaue vnto
her for a time any reuerence or honour,
as her godlines and happie counsel did
well deserue, yet was it no such empire,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note>
as our mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stres claime. For which of her
sonnes or nerest kinsmen left she ruler
<pb facs="tcp:8577:47"/>
and iudge in Israel after her. The holie
ghost expresseth no such thing. Wherof
it is euident, that by her example God
offreth no occasion to establish any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of women aboue men, realmes,
and nations.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">An an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the second obiection.</note> But now to the second objection.
In whiche women require (as to them
appeareth) nothing but equitie and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
Whilest they a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their patrones for
them, require dominion and empire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
men. For this is their question: Is
it not lauful, that wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue their right
and inheritance, like as the doughters
of Zalphead were commanded by the
mouth of Moses to haue their portion
of grounde in their tribe?</p>
            <p>I answer, it is not onlie laufull that
women possesse their inheritance, but I
affirme also that iustice and equitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
<note place="margin">what wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wold not glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heare.</note> that so they do. But therwith I
adde that whiche gladlie they list not
vnderstand: that to beare rule or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
ouer man, can neuer be right nor
inheritance to woman. For that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be iust inheritance to any person,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8577:47"/>
whiche God by his word hath plainlie
denied vnto them: but to all wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath
God denied authoritie aboue man, as
moste manifestlie is before declared:
Therfore to her it can neuer be inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And thus must the aduocates of
our ladies prouide some better exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and strongar argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For the lawe
made in fauor of the dough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters of Zal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phead,
will serue them nothing. And as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredlie
greate wonder it is, that in so
greate light of Goddes truthe, men list
to grope and wander in darknes. For let<note place="margin">the dough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters of Zal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phead de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to rei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gne ouer no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Israel.</note>
them speak of conscience: if the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any of these fore named women
was to reigne ouer any one tribe, yea or
yet ouer any one man within Israel.
Plain it is, they did not, but onelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
that they might haue a portion
of ground amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their tribe,
lest, that the name of their father shuld
be abolished. And this was graunted
vnto them without respect had to any
ciuil regiment. And what maketh this,
I pray you, for the establishing of this
mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>struous empire of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion

               <note place="margin">women may suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance but not to office.</note> is not:if women may not succede
to possession, substance, patrimonie or
inheritance, such as fathers may leaue
to their children, for that I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
grant: But the question is:if women
may succede to their fathers in offices,
and chieflie to that office, the executor
wherof doth occupie the place a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
of God. And that I absolutelie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie:
and feare not to say, that to place a
woman in authoritie aboue a realme, is
to pollute and ꝓphane the royall seate,
the throne of iustice, which oght to be
the throne of God: and that to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
them in the same, is nothing els,
but continuallie to rebell against God.
<note place="margin">Num. <hi>36</hi>
               </note> One thing there is yet to be noted and
obserued in the lawe made concerning
the inheritance of the doughters of
Zalphead, to wit, that it was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
vnto them to marie without their
owne tribe, lest that such portion as
fell to their lotte, shuld be transferred
frome one tribe to an other, and so
shuld the tribe of Manasses be defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and spoiled of their iust inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8577:48"/>
by their occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For auoiding of which
it was commanded by Mofes, that they
shuld marie in the familie or housholde
of the tribe and kindred of their father.
Wonder it is that the aduocates and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones
of the right of our ladies did not<note place="margin">Our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones for women do not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke this caution.</note>
consider and ponder this lawe before
that they counseled the blinde princes
and vnworthie nobles of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
to betray the liberties therof in to
the handes of strangiers. England for
satisfying of the inordinat appetites of
that cruell monstre Marie (vnworthie
by reason of her bloodie tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie, of the
name of a woman) betrayed (alas) to
the proude spaniarde: and Scotland by
the rashe madnes of foolish gouerners,
and by the practises of a crastie dame
resigned like wise, vnder title of maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
in to the power of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Doth such
tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slation of realmes and natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s please
the iustice of God, or is the possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by<note place="margin">Realmes gotten by practises are no iuste posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note>
such means obteined, lauful in his sight?
Assured I am that it is not. No otherwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
I say, then is that possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherunto
theues, murtherers, tyrannes and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors
<pb facs="tcp:8577:49"/>
do attein by theft, murther, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie,
viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, deceit, and oppression,
whiche God of his secrete (but yet most
iust) iudgement doth often permit for
punishment, as wel of the sufferers, as of
the violent oppressors, but doth neuer
approue the same as laufull and godlie.
For if he wold not permit that the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of the children of Israel shuld
passe frome one tribe to an other by the
<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> mariage of any doughter, not witstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that they were all one people, all
spake one tonge, all were descended
of one father, and all did professe one
God, and one religion:If yet, I say, God
wold not suffer that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie and
vsuall frute, which might be gathered
of the portion of grounde limited and
assigned to one tribe shulde passe to
an other: Will he suffer that the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
lawes, commodities and frutes of
hole realmes and natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, be geuen in to
the power and distributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others, by
the reason of marriage, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the powers
of suche, as besides, that they be of a
strange tonge, of strange maners and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8577:49"/>
lawes, they are also ignorant of God,
ennemies to his truth, deniers of Christ
Iesus, persecutors of his true membres,
and haters of all vertue? As the odious
nation of spaniardes doth manifestlie
declare: who for very despit, which they<note place="margin">the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes are Iewes and they bragge that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is of the route of Ieffe.</note>

against the veritie of God, the flaming

And yet to these two cruell ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannes
(to France, and Spain I meane) is
the right and possession of England,
and Scotland appointed. But iust or lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
shall that possession neuer be, till
God do chaunge the statute of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
lawe: whiche he will not do for the

affirmeth, that when the almightie did

gentiles, and when he did disperse, and
scatter the sonnes of men, that then he
did apoint the limites and boundes of
peoples, for the nomber of the sonnes
<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> of Israel. Wherof it is plain, that God
hath not exposed the earth in pray to
tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, making all thing laufull, which
by violence and murther they may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8577:50"/>
but that he hath apointed to euery

did teache an ethnik to affirme) with
that portion, whiche by lotte and iust

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,
I delay at this time to intreate.
Onelie this I haue recited to geue the
worlde to vnderstand, that the reigne,
empire, and authoritie of women, hath
no grounde within Goddes scriptures.
Yea that realmes or prouinces posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<note place="margin">Realmes gotten by marriage, is vniust conquest.</note>
by their mariage, is nothing but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust
conquest. For so litle doth the lawe
made for the doughters of Zalphead
helpe the cause of your quenes, that vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie
it fighteth against them, both da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their authoritie and fact. But now
to the thirde objection.</p>
            <p>The consent, say they, of realmes and<note place="margin">Answer to the third ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note>
lawes pronounced and admitted in this
behalfe, long consuetude and custome,
together with the felicitie of some wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb facs="tcp:8577:51"/>
in their empires haue established
their authoritie. To whome, I answer,
that nether may the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie of princes,
nether the foolishnes of people, nether
wicked lawes made against God, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet the felicitie that in this earthe
may herof insue, make that thing lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
whiche he by his word hat mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festlie
condemned. For if the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of princes and people, lawes made
by men, or the consent of realmes, may
establishe any thing against God and
his word, then shuld idolatrie be prefer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
to the true religion. For mo realmes
and nations, mo lawes and decrees pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by Emperours with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmon con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent
of their counsels, haue established
the one, then haue approued the other.
And yet I thinke that no man of sounde
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, will therfore iustifie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
idolatrie. No more oght any man
to mainteine this odious empire of wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men,
althogh that it were approued of
all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their lawes. For the same God
that in plain wordes forbiddeth idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
doth also forbidde the authoritie
of women ouer man. As the wordes of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8577:51"/>
saint Paule before rehearsed do plainly
teach vs. And therfore whether women
be deposed from that vniust authoritie
(haue they neuer vsurped it so long) or
if all such honor be denied vnto them,<note place="margin">women may and oght to be deposed from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</note>
I feare not to affirme that they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defrauded of right, nor inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
For to women can that honor neuer
be due nor laufull (muche lesse inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
whiche God hath so manifestlie
denied vnto them.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that the subtill
wittes of carnall men (which can neuer
be broght vnder the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
simple preceptes to maintein this
monstruous empire) haue yet two vaine
shiftes. First they alledge, that albeit wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men<note place="margin">the fourth obiecteon.</note>
may not absolutelie reigne by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
selues, because they may nether fit in iud
gement, nether pronounce sentence, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
execute any publike office: yet may
they do all such thinges by their lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantes,
deputies and iudges substitute.
Secondarilie, say they, a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> borne to
rule ouer any realme, may chose her a hus<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>band,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to him she may tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sfer a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d geue
her authoritie and right. To both I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb facs="tcp:8577:52"/>
in fewe wordes: First that frome a
corrupt and venomed fountein can
spring no holsome water: Secondarilie
that no person hath power to geue the
thing, which doth not iustlie appertein
<note place="margin">womi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can make no laufull of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.</note> to them selues: But the authoritie of a
woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a corrupted fountein, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from her can neuer spring any lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
officer. She is not borne to rule ouer
men: and therfore she can apointe none
by her gift, nor by her power (which she
hath not) to the place of a laufull magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat.
<note place="margin">Let En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and Scotland take hede.</note> And therfore who socuer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, office or authoritie, are
adulterous and bastard officers before
God. This may appeare straunge at the
first affirmation, but if we will be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d equall in the cause of God,
as that we can be in the cause of man,
the reason shall sodeinlie appeare. The
case suposed, that a tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spiracie
vsurped the royall seat a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dignitie of a
king, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the same did so establish him
selfe, that he apointed officers, and did
what him list for a time, and in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane
time, the natiue king made streit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
to all his subiectes, that none
shuld adhere to this traitor, nether yet re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8577:52"/>
any dignitie of him, yet neuer the
lesse they wold honor the same traitor
as king, and beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me his officers in all af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>faires
of the realme. If after, the natiue
prince did recouer his iust honor a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
shuld he repute or esteme any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the traitors apointeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for a laufull
magistrate? or for his frende and true
subiect? or shuld he not rather with one
sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the head with the mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bres?
And if so he shuld do, who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to accuse him of rigor? much lesse to
condemne his sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of iniustice. And
dare we denie the same power to God
in the like case? For that woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reigneth
aboue ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, she hath obteined it by treaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spiracie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted against God.
Howe can it be then, that she being cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d giltie of treason against God
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, can apointe any officer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in his sight? It is a thing impossible.
Wherefore let men that receiue of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
authoritie, honor or office, be most<note place="margin">woman in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God.</note>
assuredly persuaded, that in so maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that vsurped power, they declare
them selues ennemies to God. If any
thinke, that because the realme and
<pb facs="tcp:8577:53"/>
estates therof, haue geuen their consen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
to a woman, and haue established
her, and her authoritie: that therfore it
is laufull and acceptable before God:
let the same men remembre what I haue
said before, to wit, that God can not ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proue
the doing nor consent of any mul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titude,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding any thing against his
worde and ordinance, and therfore they
must haue a more assured defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se against
the wrath of God, then the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of a blinded multitude,
or elles they shall not be able to stand in
the presence of the consuming fier: that
<note place="margin">what the nobilitie oght to do in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</note> is, they must acknowledge that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of a woman is a thing most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
in the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God. They must
refuse to be her officers, because she is a
traitoresse and rebell against God. And
finallie they must studie to represse her
inordinate pride and tyrannie to the
vttermost of their power. The same is
the dutie of the nobilitie and estates,
by whose blindnes a woman is promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
First in so farre, as they haue moste
haynouslie offended against God, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in authoritie suche as God by his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8577:53"/>
worde hath remoued frome the same,
vnfeinedly they oght to call for mercie,
and being admonished of their error
and damnable fact, in signe and token
of true repentance, with common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
they oght to retreate that, which
vnaduisedlie and by ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they haue
pronounced, and oght without further
delay to remoue from authority all such
persones, as by vsurpation, violence, or
tyrannie, do possesse the same. For so
did Israel and Iuda after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted
from Dauid, and Iuda alone in
the dayes of Athalia. For after that she<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Reg. <hi>11</hi>
               </note>
by murthering her sonnes children, had
obteined the empire ouer the land, and
had most vnhappelie reigned in Iuda
six years, Iehoiada the high priest called
together the capitaines and chief rulers<note place="margin">Marke this fact, for it agre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth with Goddes lawe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</note>
of the people, and shewing to them the
kinges so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Ioas, did binde them by an
othe to depose that wicked woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and
to promote the king to his royall seat,
whiche they faithfullie did, killinge at
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement not onlie that cruell
and mischeuous woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but also the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
did destroie the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Baal, break
<pb facs="tcp:8577:54"/>
his altars and images, and kill Mathan
Baales high priest before his altars. The
same is the dutie as well of the estates,
as of the people that hath bene blinded.
First they oght to remoue frome honor
and authoritie, that monstre in nature
(so call I a woman cled in the habit of
man, yea a woman against nature rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gning
aboue man). Secondarilie if any
presume to defende that impietie, they
oght not to feare, first to ꝓnounce, and
then after to execute against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of deathe. If any man be affraid to
violat the oth of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which they
haue made to suche mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stres, let them be
most assuredly persuaded, that as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of their othes, proceding from
ignorance was sinne, so is the obstinate
purpose to kepe the same, nothinge but
plaine rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against God. But of this
mater in the second blast, God willing,
we shall speake more at large.</p>
            <p>And nowe to put an end to the first
blast, seing that by the ordre of nature,
by the malediction and curse pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against woman, by the mouth of S. Paule
the interpreter of Goddes senten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8577:54"/>
by the example of that common
welth, in whiche God by his word plan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
ordre and policie, and finallie by
the iudgement of the most godlie wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
God hath deiected woman frome
rule, dominion, empire, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
aboue man. Moreouer, seing that
nether the example of Debora, nether
the lawe made for the doughters of
Zalphead, nether yet the foolishe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of an ignorant multitude, be able
to iustifie that whiche God so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
hath codemned: let all men ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<note place="margin">An admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nition.</note>
hede what quarell and cause frome
hence further they do defend. If God
raise vp any noble harte to vendicat
the libertie of his countrie, and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the monstruous empire of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
let all suche as shal presume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them in the same, moste certeinlie
knowe, that in so doing, they lift their
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d against God, and that one day they
shall finde his power to fight against
their foolishnes. Let not the faithfull,
godlie, and valiant hartes of Christes
souldiours be vtterlie discouraged, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet let the tyrannes reioise, albeit
<pb facs="tcp:8577:55"/>
for a time they triumphe against such
as studie to represse their tyrannie, and
to remoue them from vniust authoritie.
For the causes alone, why he suffereth
the souldiours to fail in batel, whome
neuerthelesse he commandeth to fight
as somtimes did Israel fighting against
Beniamin. The cause of the Israelites
was most iust:for it was to punishe that
horrible abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those sonnes of
<note place="margin">Iudic. <hi>20</hi>
               </note> Belial, abusing the leuites wife, whome
the Beniamites did defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. And they had
Goddes precept to assure them of well
doing. For he did not onelie comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
them to fight, but also apointed Iuda to
be their leader and capitain, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet fell
they twise in plain batel against those
most wicked adulterers.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">why God ꝑmitteth somtimes his owne souldiors to fall in batel.</note> The secret cause of this, I say, is knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to God alone. But by his euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t scriptu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res
we may assuredly gather, that by such
means doth his wisdome so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times, beat
downe the pride of the flesh (for the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
at the firste trusted in their mul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titude,
power a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, and somtimes
by such ouerthrowes, he will punish the
offenses of his owne childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and bring
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8577:55"/>
them to the vnfeined knowledge of the
same, before he will geue them victorie
against the manifest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners, whom he
hath apoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted neuerthelesse to vttermost
perdition: as the end of that batel did
witnesse. For althogh with greate mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the children of Israel did twise fall
before the Be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iamites, yet after they had
wept before the Lorde, after they had
fasted a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d made sacrifice in signe of their
vnfeined repentance, they so preuailed
against that proude tribe of Beniamin,
that after 25. thousande strong men of
warre were killed in batel, they destro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed<note place="margin">Iudic. <hi>20</hi>
               </note>
man, woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, childe and beaste, as well
in the fieldes, as in the cities, whiche all
were burned with fier, so that onelie of
that hole tribe remained fix hundreth
men, who fled to the wildernes, where
they remained foure monethes, and so
were saued. The same God, who did exe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cute<note place="margin">NOTE.</note>
this greuous punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of those, whom he suffred twise to
be ouercomen in batel, doth this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein
his power a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iustice. Cursed Iesabel
of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, with the pestilent a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d detesta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of papistes, make no litle

bragge and boast, that they haue trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
not only against Wyet, but also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all such as haue entreprised any
thing against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or their procedinges.
But let her and them consider, that yet
they haue not preuailed against god, his
throne is more high, then that the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
of their hornes be able to reache. And
let them further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this their bloodie reigne,
the haruest of their iniquitie was not co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men
to full maturitie and ripenes. No,
it was so grene, so secret I meane, so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
and so hid with hypocrisie, that
some men (euen the seruantes of God)
thoght it not impossible, but that wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
might be cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged in to la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d also
that the vipere might remoue her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

and that will haue his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
euen by the verie wicked, hath now
geuen open testimonie of her and their

also the sobbes and teares of the poore
oppressed, the groninges of the ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,

euerie earthlie creature abused by their
