         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Upon the Scaffold on Tower-hill, on <date>Friday Decemb. 7. 1683.</date>
            </head>
            <byline>By Algernoon Sidney, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
Before his Execution there.</byline>
            <opener>
               <salute>Men, Brethren, and Fathers; Friends, Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and Strangers;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT May be expected that I ſhould now ſay
ſome Great matters unto you, but the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of the Seaſon, and the Infirmities of
my Age, encreaſed by a cloſe Impriſonment of
above Five months, doth not permit me.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we live in an Age that maketh
Truth paſs for Treaſon: I dare not ſay any thing
contrary unto it, and the Ears of thoſe that are
about me will probably be found too tender to
hear it. My Tryal and Condemnation doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
evidence this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Weſt, Rumſey,</hi> and <hi>Keyling,</hi> who were brought
to prove the Plot, ſaid no more of me, than that
they knew me not; and ſome others equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
unto me, had uſed my Name, and that
of ſome others, to give a little Reputation unto
their Deſigns. The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> is too infamous
by his Life, and the many Perjuries not to be
denyed, or rather ſworn by himſelf, to deſerve
mention; and being a ſingle Witneſs would be
of no value, though he had been of unblemiſhed
Credit, or had not ſeen and confeſſed that the
Crimes committed by him would be pardoned
only for committing more; and even the Pardon
promiſed could not be obtained till the Drudgery
of Swearing was over.</p>
            <p>This being laid aſide, the whole matter is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the Papers ſaid to be found in my Cloſet by
the Kings Officers, without any other Proof of
their being written by me, than what is taken from
ſuppoſitions upon the ſimilitude of an Hand that is
eaſily counterfeited, and which hath been lately
declared in the Lady <hi>Car</hi>'s Caſe to be no Lawful
Evidence in Criminal Cauſes.</p>
            <p>But if I had been ſeen to write them, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50879:2"/>
would not be much altered. They plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to relate unto a large Treatiſe written long
ſince in anſwer to <hi>Filmer</hi>'s Book, which by all
Intelligent Men is thought to be grounded upon
wicked Principles, equally pernicious unto Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and People.</p>
            <p>If he might publiſh unto the World his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
That all Men are born under a neceſſity
derived from the Laws of God and Nature, to
ſubmit unto an Abſolute Kingly Government,
which could be reſtrained by no Law, or Oath;
and that he that hath the Power, whether he
came unto it by Creation, Election, Inheritance,
Uſurpation, or any other way had the Right;
and none muſt Oppoſe his Will, but the Perſons
and Eſtates of his Subjects muſt be indiſpenſably
ſubject unto it; I know not why I might not
have publiſhed my Opinion to the contrary,
without the breach of any Law I have yet
known.</p>
            <p>I might as freely as he, publickly have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
my Thoughts, and the Reaſons upon which
they were grounded, and I perſuaded to believe,
That God had left Nations unto the Liberty of
ſetting up ſuch Governments as beſt pleaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>That Magiſtrates were ſet up for the good of
Nations, not Nations for the honour or glory
of Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>That the Right and Power of Magiſtrates in
every Country, was that which the Laws of that
Country made it to be.</p>
            <p>That thoſe Laws were to be obſerved, and the
Oaths taken by them, having the force of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
between Magiſtrate and People, could not
be Violated without danger of diſſolving the
whole Fabrick.</p>
            <p>That Uſurpation could give no Right, and the
moſt dangerous of all Enemies unto Kings were
they, who raiſing their Power to an Exorbitant
Height, allowed unto Uſurpers all the Rights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
unto it.</p>
            <p>That ſuch Uſurpations being ſeldom Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
without the Slaughter of the Reigning Perſon,
or Family, the worſt of all Villanies was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
rewarded with the moſt Glorious Privileges.</p>
            <p>That if ſuch Doctrines were received, they
would ſtir up men to the Deſtruction of Princes
with more Violence than all the Paſſions that
have hitherto raged in the Hearts of the moſt
Unruly.</p>
            <p>That none could be Safe, if ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
were propoſed unto any that could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them.</p>
            <p>That few would be ſo gentle as to ſpare even
the Beſt, if by their deſtruction a Wild Uſurper
could become God's Anointed; and by the moſt
execrable Wickedneſs inveſt himſelf with that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Character.</p>
            <p>This is the Scope of the whole Treatiſe; the
Writer gives ſuch Reaſons as at preſent did oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
unto him, to prove it. This ſeems to agree
with the Doctrines of the moſt Reverenced Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of all Times, Nations and Religions. The
beſt and wiſeſt of Kings have ever acknowleged
it. The preſent King of <hi>France</hi> hath declared
that Kings have that happy want of Power, that
they can do nothing contrary unto the Laws of
their Country, and grounds his Quarrel with
the King of <hi>Spain; Anno.</hi> 1667. upon that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
King <hi>James</hi> in his Speech to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Anno.</hi> 1603. doth in the higheſt degree
aſſert it: The Scripture ſeems to declare it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If
nevertheleſs the Writer was miſtaken, he might
have been refuted by Law, Reaſon and Scripture;
and no Man for ſuch matters was ever otherwiſe
puniſhed, than by being made to ſee his Errour;
and it hath not (as I think) been ever known
that they had been referred to the Judgment of
a Jury, compoſed of Men utterly unable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them.</p>
            <p>But there was little of this in my Caſe; the
extravagance of my Proſecutors goes higher: the
above-mentioned Treatiſe was never finiſhed, nor
could be in many years, and moſt probably
would never have been. So much as is of it
was Written long ſince, never reviewed nor
ſhewn unto any Man; and the fiftieth part of it
was produced, and not the tenth of that offered
to be read. That which was never known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe who are ſaid to have Conſpired with
me, was ſaid to be intended to ſtir up the People
in Proſecution of the Deſigns of thoſe Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators.</p>
            <p>When nothing of particular Application un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Time, Place, or Perſon could be found in it,
(as hath ever been done by thoſe who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to raiſe Inſurrections) all was ſupplied
by <hi>Innuendo's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatſoever is ſaid of the Expulſion of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin;</hi>
the Inſurrection againſt <hi>Nero;</hi> The Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Domitian;</hi> The Tranſlation of
the Crown of <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Meroveus</hi> his Race
unto <hi>Pepin;</hi> and from his Deſcendants unto
<hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> and the like, applied by <hi>Innuendo</hi>
unto the King.</p>
            <p>They have not conſidered, that if ſuch Acts of
State be not good, there is not a King in the
World that has any Title to the Crown he bears;
nor can have any, unleſs he could deduce his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree
from the Eldeſt Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſhew
that the Succeſſion had ſtill continued in the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of the Eldeſt Line, and been ſo deduced to
him.</p>
            <p>Every one may ſee what advantage this would
be to all the Kings of the World; and whether
that failing, it were not better for them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
they had received their Crowns by
the Conſent of Willing Nations; or to have no
better Title unto them than Uſurpation and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
which by the ſame ways may be taken
from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50879:2"/>
But I was long ſince told that I muſt Dye, or
the Plot muſt Dye.</p>
            <p>Leaſt the means of deſtroying the beſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
in <hi>England</hi> ſhould fail, the Bench muſt be
filled with ſuch as had been Blemiſhes to the
Bar.</p>
            <p>None but ſuch as theſe would have Adviſed
with the King's Council, of the means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Man to death; Suffered a Jury to be pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the King's Solicitors, and the Under-She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff;
Admit of Jury-men who are not Freeholders;
Receive ſuch Evidence as is above mentioned;
Refuſe a Copy of an Indictment, or to Suffer the
Statute of 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. to be read, that doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
Enact, It ſhould in no Caſe be denied unto
any Man upon any occaſion whatſoever; Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
the moſt important Points of Law without
hearing. And whereas the Stat. 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. upon
which they ſaid I ſhould be Tried, doth Reſerve
unto the Parliament all Conſtructions to be made
in Points of Treaſon, They could aſſume unto
themſelves not only a Power to make Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but ſuch Conſtructions as neither agree
with Law, Reaſon, or Common Sence.</p>
            <p>By theſe means I am brought to this Place.
The Lord forgive theſe Practices, and avert the
Evils that threaten the Nation from them. The
Lord Sanctifie theſe my Sufferings unto me; and
though I fall as a Sacrifice unto Idols, ſuffer not
Idolatry to be Eſtabliſhed in this Land. Bleſs thy
People, and Save them. Defend thy own Cauſe,
and Defend thoſe that Defend it. Stir up ſuch
as are Faint; Direct thoſe that are Willing; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
thoſe that Waver; Give Wiſdom and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
unto All. Order all things ſo as may moſt
redound unto thine own Glory. Grant that I
may Dye glorifying Thee for all thy Mercies;
and that at the laſt Thou haſt permitted me to be
Singled out as a Witneſs of thy Truth; and even
by the Confeſſion of my Oppoſers, for that
<hi>OLD CAUSE</hi> in which I was from my
Youth engaged, and for which Thou haſt Often
and Wonderfully declared thy Self.</p>
