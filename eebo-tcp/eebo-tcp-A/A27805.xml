            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:94365:3"/>
of a Protector. And when in the beginning of these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles I hastned to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> the case of the King and His good Subjects, was something like that of <hi>Isaac,</hi> ready to be sacrificed, the wood was prepared, the fire kindled, the knife was lift up, and the hand was striking, that if we had not been something like <hi>Abraham</hi> too, and against hope have beleeved in hope, we had been as much without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort as we were in outward appearance without remedy.</p>
                  <p>It was my custome long since to secure my selfe against the violences of Discontents abroad, as <hi>Gerson</hi> did against temptations, <hi>in angulis &amp; libellis,</hi> in my books and my retirements: But now I was deprived of both them, and driven to a publick view and participation of those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and miseries which threatned the Kingdome, and disturbed the eavennesse of my former life. I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore constrained to amasse together all those arguments of hope and comfort, by which men in the like condition were supported; and amongst all the great examples of trouble and confidence, I reckon'd King <hi>David</hi> one of the biggest, and of greatest consideration. For conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that he was a King, vexed with a <hi>Civill Warre,</hi> his case had so much of ours in it, that it was likely the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions he used might fit our turn, and his comforts su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain us.</p>
                  <p>And indeed when I came to look upon the Psalter with a neerer observation, and an eye diligent to espy my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and remedies there deposited, I found very many Prayers against the enemies of the King and Church, and the miseries of Warre. I found so many admirable promises, so rare variety of expressions of the mercies of God, so many consolatory hymnes, the commemoration of so many deliverances from dangers, and deaths, and Enemies, so many miracles of mercy and salvation, that I began to be so confident as to beleeve there could come no affliction great enough, to spend so great a stock of comfort as was laid up in the treasure of the Psalter: the saying of S. <hi>Paul</hi> was here verified, if sinne [and misery]
<pb facs="tcp:94365:3"/>
did abound, then did grace superabound: and as wee beleeve of the Passion of Christ, it was so great as to be able to satisfy for a thousand Worlds; so it is of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes, they are more then sufficient to repair all the breaches of Mankind. But for the particular occasion of creating confidences in us that God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Church and his Anoynted, and all that trust in him, against all their Enemies, (which was our case, and contained in it all our needs for the present) I found so abundant supply, that of 150. Psalmes, some whereof are Historicall, many Eucharisticall, many Propheticall, and the rest Prayers for severall occasions, 34. of them are expresly made against Gods and our enemies; Eleven expresly for the Church, four for the King; that is, a third part of the Psalms relate particularly to the present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, beside many clauses of respersion in the other, which if collected in one, would of themselves, be great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hope to prevail in so good a cause.</p>
                  <p>This which experience taught me now, I was promised before by a frequent testimony of the Doctors of the Church, who give the Psalter such a Character as is due to the best and most usefull book in the whole World, <hi>viz.</hi> The most profitable of books: the treasure of Holy instructions, <hi>consummationem totius paginae Theologicae,</hi> the perfection of the whole Scripture; so the ordinary <hi>Glosse</hi> calls it; <hi>arma juvenum, parva Biblia, tribulatorum solatia,</hi> the young mans armory, the little Bible, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the distressed, so others; to be said by all men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions, is the counsell of the most devout amongst them. But concerning the Psalter there are good words enough, and reall observation of advantages in the severall prefaces before the Commentaries upon the Psalms, set forth by the Fathers, and Writers of the first and middle ages. I leave the particular enumeration of them, to the learned Divines of our Church, to whom it is more proper; the summe of them is this, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> alone hath expressed in his Apology ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Gentiles, Omnes Bibliothecas, &amp; omnia monumenta unius Prophetae scrinium vincit, in quo videtur thesaurus collocatus esse totius Judaici Sacramenti, &amp; inde etiam nostri,</hi> this book alone of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> hath in it some excellencies beyond all the monuments of Learning in any Library whatsoever, and is the store-house both of the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Religion.</p>
                  <p>But that which pleases me most is the fancy of S. <hi>Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> expounding the Psalter to be meant by the Key of <hi>David,</hi> spoken of by S. <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Revelation:</hi> And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly enough; for if we consider how many mysteries of Religion are open'd to us in the Psalter, how many things concerning Christ, what clear vaticinations concerning his Birth, his Priesthood, his Kingdome, his Death, the very circumstances of his Passion, his Resurrection, and all the degrees of his Exaltation-more clearly and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely recorded in the Psalter, then in all the old Prophets besides, we may easily beleeve that Christ with a <hi>Key of David</hi> in his hand, is nothing else but Christ fully open'd and manifested to us in the Psalmes in the whole mystery of our Redemption. <hi>Omnes penè Psalmi Christi personam sustinent,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Almost all the Psalmes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Person of Christ. Now this <hi>Key of David,</hi> opens not onely the Kingdome of Grace, by Revelation of the mysteries of our Religion, but the Kingdome of Heaven too, it being such a Collection of Prayers, Eucharist, acts of hope, of love, of patience, and all other Christian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that as the everlasting Kingdome is given to the Heire of the House of <hi>David,</hi> so the Honour of opening that Kingdome is given to the first Prince of that Family; the Psalmes of his Father <hi>David</hi> are one of the best inlets into the Kingdome of the Sonne. Something to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is that saying of one of the old Doctors, <hi>Vox psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiae si recto corde dirigatur, in tantum omnipotenti Deo aditum ad animum aperit, ut intentae animae vel Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>iae mysteria, vel compunctionis spiritum insundat.</hi> The saying or singing of Psalmes opens a way so wide for
<pb facs="tcp:94365:4"/>
God to enter into the heart, that a devout soule does usually from such an imployment receive the grace of compunction and contrition, or of understanding Prophecies.</p>
                  <p>Upon such premises as these, or better, the Church of God in all ages hath made <hi>Davids</hi> Psalter the greatest part of her publike and private devotions; sometimes divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Psalter into seven parts, that every weeks devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might spend it all.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes decreeing that it should be said day and night. Otherwhile injoyned the recitation of the whole Psalter before the celebration of the blessed Sacrament; and after some time it was made the publike office of the Church.</p>
                  <p>It was the generall use of Christendome, to say the Psalmes <hi>Antiphonatim,</hi> by way of verse and answer, saith <hi>Suidas</hi>; and so ancient, that the Religious of S. <hi>Mark</hi> in <hi>Alexandria</hi> used it, saith <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew; and S <hi>Ignatius,</hi> or else <hi>Flavianus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> brought it first into the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the private Devotions, that they chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of the Psalmes we have great probability from the strict requiring it of the Clergy, and particularly from them who came to be ordained, great readinesse of saying the Psalter by heart. It was S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> counsell to <hi>Rusticus,</hi> and when S. <hi>Gregory</hi> was to ordain the Bishop of <hi>Ancona,</hi> his inquiry concerning his Canonicall sufficiency was, if he could say <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes without book; and for a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of doing it, <hi>John</hi> the Priest was rejected from the Bishoprick of <hi>Ravenna.</hi> But this I conceive more relates to their private, then to their publick devotions, for I cannot think but that in respect of the publick Liturgy, it was enough for Bishops and Priests to read the Psalm; the requiring ability to remember them was to ingage them to a frequent use of so admirable devotions, in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate offices.</p>
                  <p>

S. <hi>Hierome</hi> made a collection of choyce versicles, and put them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into their severall classes, and that was much of his devotion; the Collection is still extant under the Name of S. <hi>Hierome's Psalter.</hi> S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> made an Index of the severall occasions and matters of prayer and Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, and fitted Psalms to each particular, that was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, the Psalms intire as they lay, onely he made titles of his own. I have seen of latter time a short hymne of some eight verses, which are indeed very choyce senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of severall Psalms set together to make a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of Liturgy of Breviary of our necessity, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, collected by S. <hi>Bernardine,</hi> it is a very good Copy to be followed. But if we look into the old Liturgies of the Eastern and Western Churches, and where we will almost into the the private devotions of the old Writers, we may say of them in the expression of the Prophet, <hi>Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riebant aquas è sontibus Salvatoris,</hi> they drew their waters from the fountains of our Blessed Saviour, but through the limbecks of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the practice of this devotion I derived from a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er precedent, even of Christ and his Apostles: for before the passion immediately, they sung a Psalm, saith the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Hymno dicto,</hi> saith the vulgar Latine, having recited or said a Psalm. But however it was part of <hi>Davids</hi> Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was sung, it was the great Allelujah, as the Jews called it, beginning at the 113. Psalme, to the 119. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusively, part of that was sung. But this devotion conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with our Blessed Saviour as long as breath was in him, for when he was upon the Crosse, he recited the 22. Psalme <hi>ad verbum,</hi> saith the Tradition of the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:94365:5"/>
and that he began it, saith the Scripture, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> The whole Psalme is rather a history then a prediction of the Passion; and what <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> saith of the whole Psalter is particularly verified of this, <hi>Filium ad Patrem, id est, Christum ad Deum verba facientem repraesentat,</hi> it represents the Sonnes addresse to his Father, that is, C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion of this manner of devotion: for B. <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> in his Oration of the end of the world, saith, that in the days of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, <hi>Psalmorum decantatio cessabit,</hi> they shall then no more use the singing or saying of the Psalmes; which when I had observed, without any further deliberation I fix'd upon the Psalter, as the best weapon against him, whose comming we have great reason to beleeve is not far off, so great preparation is making for him.</p>
                  <p>From the example of Christ this grew to be a Practice Apostolicall, and their devotion came exactly home to the likenesse of the design of this very Book: they turn'd the Psalmes into Prayers.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was said of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Act.</hi> 16. <hi>They pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Psalme,</hi> so it is in the Greek; and we have a Copy left us of one of the Prayers or Collects which they made out of the bowels of the second Psalme, it is in the fourth Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> beginning at the 24. verse, and ends at the 31.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nother mood, and fitted to the necessities of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of our selves in particular, according to the first designation or secondary intention of the blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for the use of them could not expire in the person of <hi>David,</hi> though first occasioned (many of them) by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall necessities: for all Scripture was written for our learning upon whom the ends of the world are come, (saith the Apostle) and Christ, and his Apostles, and the Church of all ages, hath taught us by their example and precepts, that the purposes of the holy Ghost were of great extent, and the profits universall both for times and occasions: so also were the Prayers which the Church made out of the Psalms, and sung them in her publick offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. S. <hi>Austin</hi> found great advantages by such devotions, as himselfe witnesses; <hi>Cùm reminiscor lachrymas meas quas fudi ad cantus Ecclesiae in primordiis recuperatae fidei meae, magnam instituti hujus utilitatem agnosco.</hi> When I call to minde the many teares I shed when I heard the Hymnes and Psalms of the Church, I cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the great benefit of this institution.</p>
                  <p>And yet besides, the spirituall sense of an actuall devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is sooner had in this use of the Psalms then of other Prayers, I have had a meditation that this manner of devotion might be a good Symbol and instrument of Communion between Christians of a different Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb facs="tcp:94365:6"/>
For if we all would communicate in the same pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate devotions, it were a great degree of Peace and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The Nicen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Fathers in their zeale against Heresie, forbad their people to be present at the Prayers of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques; and they had great reason so long as they derived their Heresie into their Liturgy, into their very formes of Baptisme: But I am much scandalized, when I see a man refuse to communicate with me in my Prayers, even such as are in his own Breviary or Manuall. For me thinks it is strange that the Lords Prayer it selfe should be unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the mouth of a Protestant, and yet the whole of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from the mouth of one of their Priests, though never so wicked, though a Necromancer, a secret Jew, or any thing, so of their Communion, shall lose no title of its sanctity and value. So long as nothing of controversie is brought into our Prayers (and certainly we may very well pray to God without disputing) and Devotion is not made a party, he that refuses to joyn with me in what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confesses true and holy, upon pretence I am a heretick, will certainly prove himself a Schismatick. For true it is, a Heretick is to be avoyded, that is in his temptation and in his heresie, just as a notorious Fornicator, an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, a sentenc'd drunkard, and no more, the Apostles rule excommunicates all alike, with such men no not to eat, and this rule cannot with so much ease and certainty bee put to practice in the case of heresie, as in the case of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, because heresie is as much harder to be judg'd, as the soule is more invisible then the body, especially if wee make heresy to be an error, not in the great articles of faith only, but to consist in minutes also, as all they do who refuse to communicate with Persons disagreeing even in the smallest article.</p>
                  <p>But hee that is ready to joyne with all the societies of Christians in the world, in those things which are certainly true, just and pious, gives great probation that he hath at least, <hi>animum Catholicam,</hi> no Schismaticall soul, because he would actually communicate with all Christendome,
<pb facs="tcp:94365:7"/>
if <hi>bona fides in falso articulo,</hi> sincere perswasion (be it true or false) did not disoblige him, since he clearly distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes persons from things, and in all good things commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with persons bad enough in others. This is the Communion of charity, and when the Communion of beleef is interrupted by misperswasion on one side, and too much confidence and want of charity on the other, the erring party hath humane infirmity to excuse him, but the uncharitable nothing at all. This therefore is the best and surest way, because we are all apt to be deceived, to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in our disquisitions, modest in our determinations, charitable in our censures, and apt to communicate in things of evident truth and confessed holinesse. And such is this devotion; the whole matter whereof is the Psalms of <hi>David,</hi> and the prayers Symbolicall, and alike in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and of the same expression throughout, where it is not altered by circumstances.</p>
                  <p>So that I thought I might not imprudently intend this Book as an instrument of publike charity to Christians of different confessions. For I see that all sorts of people sing or say <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms, and by that use, if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the consequences of their own Religion, accept s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t forms of prayer for their Liturgy, and this form in speciall is one of their own choyces for devotion; so that if all Christians, that think <hi>Davids</hi> Psalmes lawfull devotion, and shall observe the Collects from them to be just of the same Religion, would joyn in this or the like form, I am something confident the product would be charity, besides other spirituall advantages. For my own particular, since all Christendome is so much divided, and subdivided into innumerable Sects, I knew not how to give a better evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my own beleef, and love of the Communion of Saints, and detestation of Schisme, then by an act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whose consequence might be (if men please) the advancement of an universall Communion. For in that which is most concerning, and is the best preserver of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I mean practicall devotion and active piety, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<pb facs="tcp:94365:7"/>
of Christendome are not so great and many, to make an eternall dis-union and fracture; and if we instance in Prayer, there is none at all abroad (some indeed wee have commenc'd at home, but) in the great divisions of Christendome, none at all but concerning the object of our prayers and adorations. For the Socinian shuts the Holy Ghost from his Letanies, and places the Sonne of God in a lower form of addresse. But concerning him I must say, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> said of the unbeleevers, <hi>What have I to doe with them that are without?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this very thing that they disbeleeve the article of the holy Trinity, they make themselves uncapable of the communion of other Christian people of the Nicene Faith, and we cannot so much as joyn with them in good prayers, because we are not agreed concerning the persons to whom our devotions must be addressed; and Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome never did so lightly esteem the article of the holy Trinity, as not to glory in it, and confesse it publickly, and expresse it in all our offices. The holy Ghost toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Father and the Son must be worshipped and glorified.</p>
                  <p>But since all Christians of any publike confession and government, that is, all particular and nationall Churches, agree in the matter of prayers, and the great object, God in the mystery of the Trinity, if the the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would make her addresses to God onely, through Jesus Christ our Lord, and leave the Saints in the Calendar, without drawing them into her offices (which they might doe without any prejudice to the suits they ask, unlesse Christs intercession without their conjuncture were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I am sure they that have commenced this war against the King &amp; the Church, first fell out with our Liturgy, and refused to joyn with us in our prayers: I have therefore a strong perswasion, that if we were joyned in our prayers, we should quickly be united in affections: and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

I have some reason to beleeve this Psalter may doe good service.</p>
                  <p>For I have seen an Essay of this designe made by that prudent and pious Moderator of Controversies, <hi>George Cassander,</hi> who did much for the peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, when disagreeing interests and opinions made the great Schisme in the Western Churches, he puts forth Devotions, and with them Collects for each Psalme. But I said, it was a meer Essay, they are short of what he could have done: but when I saw his name at them, I guessed what every man else would have guessed concerning him, it was a pursuance of his great designe for peace and charity.</p>
                  <p>I have se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A second was printed at <hi>Lyons,</hi> 1545. without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors name, with a complying design of avoyding all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and a not engaging God in our scholasticall wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but quite contrary to the Saxon; the Prayers are so full of Paraphrase, that I resolved to goe further, and see if I could speed better, and at last met with a Psalter printed lately at <hi>Antwerp</hi> by Command, very fairly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, with a Title and a Collect to every Psalm, all free from dispute, and partaking in the questions of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that which I observed in all these, is, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign seems alike, and they are a form of devotion made for no private Sect, but for the benefit of all Christian people, which the Author of the <hi>Antwerp</hi> Psalter declines in his Additionall Devotions, where he brings in Letanies to Saints as grosly as he had before avoided it with discretion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94365:8"/>If any mans piety receives advantage by this intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is what I wish; but I desire that his charity might increase too, and that he would say a hearty Prayer, when his Devotion grows high and pregnant, for me and my family; for I am more desirous my Posterity should be pious then honourable. I have no ends of my own to serve, but to purchace an interest of Prayers; for I would fain have these Devotions goe out into a blessing to all them that shall use them, and yet return into my own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some too: and if I may but receive the blessings of the Psalter, <hi>even the sure mercies of David,</hi> it will be like the reward of five Cities for the improvement of a few talents; I shall venture again in a greater negotiation, and traffique for ten talents; for there is no honour so great as to serve God in a great capacity; and though I wait not at the Altar, yet I will pay there such oblations of my time and industry, as I can redeem from the services of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and the impertinences of my own life.</p>

Where shall we appear in the day of Judgement? How shall we stand upright in the eternall scrutiny? Our trust is in thy merits. O blessed Jesu, thou art our Judge and our Advocate, thou shalt answer for us, O Lord our God. Put us not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, O Lord, in thine anger, for it is insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, neither let thy whole displeasure arise, for that is vast and mountainous as our sinnes, and will break us in pieces.

Touch our sores gently, and let not thy hands presse us, unlesse to drive forth our corruption, then shall we follow the thing that good is, and rejoyce greatly in thy mercies, O Lord God of our salvation, who hast redeemed us, and saved us, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

                           <p n="25">25 He rained down Manna also upon them for to eat: and gave them food from heaven.</p>

                           <p n="30">30 So they did eat and were well filled, for hee gave them their own desire: they were not dissapointed of their lust.</p>
                           <p n="31">31 But while the meat was yet in their mouthes, the heavy wrath of God came upon them, and slew the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest of them: yea, and smote down the chosen men that were in Israel.</p>
                           <p n="32">32 But for all this they sinned yet more: and beleeved not his wondrous works.</p>
                           <p n="33">33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity: and their years in trouble.</p>

                           <p n="35">35 And they remembred that God was their strength: and that the high God was their Redeemer:</p>

                           <p n="40">40 For he considered that they were but flesh: and that they were even a winde that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p>
                           <p n="41">41 Many a time did they provoke him in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and grieved him in the desert.</p>
                           <p n="42">42 They turned back and tempted God: and moved the holy One in Israel.</p>

                           <p n="46">46 He sent lice among them and devoured them up: and frogs to destroy them.</p>
                           <p n="47">47 He gave their fruit unto the caterpiller: and their labour unto the grashopper.</p>
                           <p n="48">48 He destroyed their vines with hailstones: and their mulberry trees with the frost.</p>

                           <p n="50">50 He cast upon them the furiousnesse of his wrath, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, displeasure, and trouble: and sent evil Angels among them.</p>
                           <p n="51">51 He made a way to his indignation, and spared not their soul from death: but gave their life over to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence.</p>
                           <p n="52">52 And smote all the first-born in Egypt: the most principall and mightiest in the dwellings of Ham.</p>
                           <p n="53">53 But as for his own people, hee led them forth like sheep: and carried them in the wildernesse like a flock.</p>

                              <pb n="150" facs="tcp:94365:87"/>54 He brought them out safely that they should not fear: and overwhelmed their enemies with the sea.</p>

                           <p n="56">56 He cast out the heathen also before them: caused their land to be divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
                           <p n="57">57 So they tempted and displeased the most high God: and kept not his testimonies.</p>
                           <p n="58">58 But turned their backs, and fell away like their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers: starting aside like a broken bow.</p>
                           <p n="59">59 For they grieved him with their hill altars: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to displeasure with their images.</p>
                           <p n="60">60 When God heard this, he was wroth: and took fore displeasure at Israel.</p>
                           <p n="61">61 So that he forsook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that he had pitched among them.</p>
                           <p n="62">62 He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemies hand.</p>
                           <p n="63">63 He gave his people over also unto the sword: and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>

                           <p n="7">7 Our fathers regarded not thy wonders in Egypt, neither kept they thy great goodnesse in remembrance: but were disobedient at the sea, even at the Red sea.</p>

                           <p n="9">9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the deep, as through a wildernesse.</p>

                           <p n="11">11 As for those that troubled them, the waters over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed them: there was not one of them left.</p>
                           <p n="12">12 Then beleeved they his words: and sang praise unto him.</p>
                           <p n="13">13 But within a while they forgat his works: and would not abide his counsell.</p>

                           <p n="15">15 And he gave them their desire: and sent leannesse withall into their soul.</p>
                           <p n="16">16 They angred Moses also in the tents: and Aaron the saint of the Lord.</p>
                           <p n="17">17 So the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of Abiram.</p>
                           <p n="18">18 And the fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt up the ungodly.</p>
                           <p n="19">19 They made a calf in Horeb: and worshipped the molten image</p>
                           <p n="20">20 Thus they turned their glory: into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay.</p>
                           <p n="21">21 And they forgat God their Saviour: which had done so great things in Egypt.</p>
                           <p n="22">22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham: and fearfull things by the Red sea.</p>
                           <p n="23">23 So he said he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the gap: to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his wrathfull indignation lest he should destroy them.</p>
                           <p n="24">24 Yea, they thought scorn of that pleasant land: and gave no credance unto his word.</p>
                           <p n="25">25 But murmured in their tents: and hearkned not unto the voice of the Lord.</p>
                           <p n="26">26 Then lift he up his hand against them: to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them in the wildernesse.</p>
                           <p n="27">27 To cast out their seed among the nations: and to scatter them in the lands.</p>
                           <p n="28">28 They joyned themselves unto Baal-peor: and ate the offering of the dead.</p>
                           <p n="29">29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their own inventions: and the plague was great among them.</p>
                           <p n="30">30 Then stood up Phineas, and prayed: and so the plague ceased.</p>
                           <p n="31">31 And that was counted unto him for righteousnesse: among all posterities for evermore.</p>
                           <p n="32">
                              <pb n="211" facs="tcp:94365:117"/>32 They angred him also at the waters of strife: so that he punished Moses for their sakes.</p>

                           <p n="34">34 Neither destroyed they the heathen: as the Lord commanded them.</p>
                           <p n="35">35 But were mingled among the heathen: and learned their works.</p>
                           <p n="36">36 Insomuch that they worshipped their idols, which turned to their own decay: yea, they offered their sonnes and daughters unto devils.</p>
                           <p n="37">37 And shed innocent bloud, even the bloud of their sons and of their daughters: whom they offered unto the idols of Canaan, and the land was defiled with bloud.</p>
                           <p n="38">38 Thus were they stained with their own works: and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>
                           <p n="39">39 Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people: insomuch that he abhorred his own inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                           <p n="40">40 And he gave them over into the hand of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: and they that hated them were Lords over them.</p>
                           <p n="41">41 Their enemies oppressed them: and had them in subjection.</p>
                           <p n="42">42 Many a time did he deliver them: but they rebelled against him with their own inventions, and were brought down in their wickednesse.</p>
                           <p n="43">43 Neverthelesse, when he saw their adversity: hee heard their complaint.</p>
                           <p n="44">44 He thought upon his covenant, and pitied them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the multitude of his mercies: yea, he made all those that had led them away captive, to pity them.</p>
                           <p n="45">45 Deliver us (O Lord our God) and gather us from among the heathen: that we may give thanks unto thy holy Name, and make our boast of thy praise.</p>

                     <head>Penitentiall Prayers, and a Form of Confession of sinnes to God, to be said upon days of publike or private humiliation.</head>
                     <p>O Lord God of mercy and pardon, give me a just remembrance and sad apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my sins; teach me to bewail them with as great an indignation and bitternesse, as I have committed them with complacency and delight. Let my prayers and my confession come into thy presence, and obtain a mercy for me and a pardon. Let not thy justice and severity so remember my sins, as to forget thine own mercy; and though I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that for which I deserve to be condemned, yet thou canst not lose that glorious attribute whence flows comfort to us and hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing saved. Spare me therefore, O mercifull God; for to give pardon to a sinner that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth his sinnes, and begges remission, is not impossible to thy power, nor disproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to thy justice, nor unusuall to thy mercy and sweetest clemency. Blessed Jesu, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in me whatsoever is thine, and cleanse me from whatsoever is amisse. Have pity on me now in the time of mercy, and condemne me not when thou commest to judgement, for what profit is there in my bloud? Thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightest not in the death of a sinner, but in his
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:94365:168"/>
conversion there is joy in Heaven; and when thou hast delivered me from my sins, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my soul, I shall praise and magnifie thy Name to all eternity, Mercy, sweet Jesu, Mercy:

And yet, O Lord, thou hast spared me all this while, and hast not taken away my life in the midst of my sins, which is a mercy so admirable and of so vast a kindness, as no heart or tongue can think, or speak.

Heavenly Father, if it may be for thy glory, and my ghostly good, to have the days of my pilgrimage prolonged, I begge of thee health and life; but if it be not pleasing to thee, to have this cup passe from me, thy will be done: my Saviour hath drunk off all the bitternesse. Behold, O Lord, I am in thine hands, do with me as seemeth good in thine eyes; though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy rod, and thy staffe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me.

                        <p>O Lord Jesus Christ, our health and life, our hope, and our resurrection from the dead: I resign my self up to thy holy will and pleasure, either to life, that I may live lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to thy service and my amendment; or to death to the perpetuall enjoyment of thy presence, and of thy glories. Into thy hands I commend my spirit, for I know, O Lord, that nothing can perish, which is committed to thy mercies. I believe, O Lord, that I shall receive my body again at the resurrection of the just: I relinquish all care of that, onely I begge of thee mercy for my soul; strengthen it with thy grace against all temptations, let thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindness defend it as with a shield against all the violences and hostile assaults of Satan: let the same mercy be my guard and defence, which protected thy Martyrs, crowning them with victory in the midst of flames, horrid tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and most cruell deaths. There is no help in me, O Lord, I cannot by my own power, give a minutes rest to my wearied body, but my trust is in thy sure mercies, and I call to minde, to my unspeakable comfort, that thou wert hungry, and thirsty, and wearied, and whipt, and crown'd with Thorns, and mock'd,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:94365:184"/>
and crucified for me. O let that mercy which made thee suffer so much, make thee do that for which thou sufferedst so much, pardon me, and save me. Let thy merits answer for my impieties, let thy righteousnesse cover my sins, thy bloud wash away my stains, and thy comforts refresh my soul. As my body grows weak, let thy grace bestronger, let not my faith doubt, nor my hope tremble, nor my charity grow cold, nor my soul be affrighted with the terrors of death; but let the light of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance enlighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in death eternall; and when my tongue fails, let thy spirit teach my heart to pray, with strong cryings and groans that are unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. O let not the enemy do me any violence, but let thy holy mercies, and thy Angels repell and defeat his malice and fraud, that my soul may by thy strength triumph in the joyes of eternity, in the fruition of thee, my life, my joy, my hope, my exceeding great reward, my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
