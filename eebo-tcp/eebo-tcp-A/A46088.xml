            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <q>YOu have here the Diurnal of the whole Proceſs againſt the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> it was taken by the hand of a ready Writer, a faithful Ear, and an underſtanding Head, He was preſent at all the Action, and I make no doubt of the Fidelity of his Relation; Which beginneth thus:</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Houſe for the Appearance of the Lord Lieutenant, was the great Hall in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> where there was a Throne erected for the King, on each ſide thereof a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet encloſed about with Boards, and before with a Tarras; Before that, were the Seats for the Lords of the Upper Houſe, and Sacks of Wool for the Judges; before them ten Stages of Seats, extending farther than the midſt of the Hall, for the Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons; at the end of all was a Desk cloſed about, and ſet apart for the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and his Councel.</p>
            <p>Monday Morning about ſeven of the Clock, he came from the Tower,<note place="margin">Monday<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſix Barges, wherein were one hundred Souldiers of the Tower, all with Partizans for his Guard, and fifty pair of Oars: At his Landing at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> there he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with two hundred of the Trained Band, and went in, Guarded by them, into the Hall: The Entries at <hi>White-Hall, King Street</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were guarded by the Conſtables and Watchmen, from four of the Clock in the Morning, to keep away all baſe and idle perſons.</p>
            <p>The King, Queen and Prince came to the Houſe about Nine of the Clock, but kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves private within their Cloſets, only the Prince came out once or twice to the Cloth of State; ſo that the King ſaw and heard all that paſſed, but was ſeen of none: Some give the reaſon of this from the received practice of <hi>England</hi> in ſuch Caſes: Others ſay, that the Lords did intreat the King either to be abſent, or to be there privately, leſt Pretentions might be made hereafter, that his being there, was either to threaten, or ſome otherwiſe to interrupt the courſe of Juſtice: A third ſort, That the King was not willing to be acceſſary to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, till it came to his Part, but rather choſe to be preſent, that he might note and underſtand what Violence, Rigor or Injuſtice happened. When the Lieutenant entred the Hall, the Porter of the Hall (whoſe Office it is) asked Mr. <hi>Maxwel</hi> whether the Axe ſhould be carried before him or no? who did anſwer, That the King had expreſly forbidden it; nor was it the Cuſtom of <hi>England</hi> to uſe that Ceremony, but only when the Party accuſed was to be put upon his Jury, Thoſe of the Upper Houſe did ſit with their Heads covered, thoſe of the Lower Houſe unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: The Biſhops upon the <hi>Saturday</hi> before did voluntarily decline the giving of their Suffrages in Matters Criminal, and of that Nature, according to the proviſion of the Cannon-Law, and Practice of the Kingdom to this day, and therefore would not be preſent: yet withal they gave in a Proteſtation that their Abſence ſhould not prejudice them of that or any other Priviledge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to them, as the Lords Spiritual in Parliament, which was accepted.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> as Lord High Steward of <hi>England,</hi> ſate apart by himſelf, and at the Lieutenants Entry commanded the Houſe to proceed. Mr. <hi>Rym</hi> being Speaker of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee for his Accuſation, gave in the ſame Articles which were preſented at his laſt being before the Upper Houſe; which being read, his Replies were ſubjoyned and read alſo, the very ſame which were preſented before in the Upper Houſe. Some give the Reaſon of this, becauſe the Lower Houſe had not heard thoſe Accuſations in publick before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> others, that the Formality of the Proceſs required no les; however that day was ſpent in that Exerciſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98942:4"/>The Queen went from the Houſe about eleven of the Clock, the King and Prince ſtayed till the Meeting was diſſolved, which was after two. The Lieutenant was ſent to the Tower by his Guard, and appointed to return upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> at nine of the Clock in the Morning. The Crowd of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was neither great nor troubleſome, all of them ſaluted him, and he them, with great Humility and Courtiſie, both at his entrance and at his return, therefore let Fame pretend what it pleaſe about the Malice and Diſcontent of the Multitude, <hi>That if he paſs the ſtroak of Juſtice they will tear him in pieces,</hi> yet I ſee there is more in Rumor then in Sight and appearance, and in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as in all others of this nature, more is thruſt upon the vulgar (who ſeem as well fearful of Puniſhment, as exempt from it, for all their great number) than they do juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Tueſday</note>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> in the Morning he came accompanied, as before, to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>; and having ſtayed in the Exchequer Chamber till nine of the Clock, the King, Queen and Prince came, as before upon the firſt day.</p>

            <p>The Lieutenant with no leſs Moderation and Wiſdom than the other with heat and paſſion, ſpake to his own defence, and that with ſuch a meaſure of Eloquence and Lively-hood, that his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Enemies were affected with it and do mervailouſly report of it.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note>He modeſtly recounted his Services done to the King and Crown of <hi>England,</hi> his endeavours for advancement as well of the Honour as Commodity of both Kingdoms in general, but in particular that of <hi>Ireland</hi>; How he had engreatned and advanced the Kings Revenues there, Reſtored the Churches maintenance, Suppreſſed the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws, eſtabliſhed obedience to Royal Authority, and impedited the Tyranny and Uſurpation of greater ones over the Commons. And for the effecting of all theſe Actions, he mentioned himſelf the moſt weak and meaneſt Inſtrument, with a wonderful Prudence, in a middle way, betwixt the affectation of baſeneſs, or dejectedneſs, and Allegeance.</p>

It was very ſtrange, that after the cloſe of the Proceſs, and when matters were come to be ſcan'd, and examined by proof, that any new Charge ſhould be given in; Yet leſt he ſhould ſeem to decline the maintenance of his own Innocency, and the juſt de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> excepted againſt this, and told him that the Houſe did conceive it to be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to grant any farther Prorogation.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Lords of the upper Houſe (who did not think it ſit as yet to voice any particular in the audience of the Houſe of Commons) did retire themſelves, and after a pretty time of ſtay, they returned and declared, that they had found the Lieutenants ſuit to be equitable in deſiring of further time for anſwering; yet ſeeing the Articles themſelves, neither for number nor weight, ſeemed to be of that importance, but that he might furniſh out a preſent Anſwer, they thought it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tting to grant no delay.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant then (intreating them to paſs by and pardon the weakneſſes of his extemporary Anſwers) deſired to hear the Articles read which were theſe.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Firſt, That he had within theſe two years withdrawn Forty Thouſand pound Sterling, from the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and imployed it to his own private uſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That in the beginning of his Government, the Garriſons in <hi>Ireland</hi> had been maintained by the Engliſh Treaſury.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That he had advanced Popiſh and Infamous perſons, as the Biſhop of <hi>Waterford</hi> and others, to the prime Roomes in the Church of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98942:4"/>To the firſt he anſwered, That Thirty Thouſand Pounds were ſet apart for the Kings late Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, at his own moſt ſpecial and moſt peremptory Commands, for which he produced the Kings own Letter, already approved as his Acquittance at the Exchequer board in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the ſecond, That at the beginning of that Charge againſt him, as ever before his time, the Garriſons had been burthenſome to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> but that he had ſo improved it, and ſetled the Kings Revenue there, that the like is not to be heard in all the times that are by paſt; For which (if the beſt endeavours of a Subject may juſtly expect any reward from his King and Country) he craved leave to think that he rather deſerved many thanks, than the leaſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>To the third, He atteſted all the Clergy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> if ever he had taken upon him any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar medling in advancing their Church-men, or whether he had done any thing concerning ſuch Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but upon the ſpecial adviſe and deſire of the beſt and wiſeſt of their Number: For his part, when he befriended the Biſhop of <hi>Waterford,</hi> he conceived of him, as a Man of Integrity and Lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning, fit for ſuch an Imployment; nor was there then the leaſt ſuſpition of thoſe monſtrous Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, wherewith he was afterwards Charged, that he had now juſty ſuffered for the ſame, and that he hoped they would not lay a neceſſity upon him to Prophecy and divine of the future Conditions and Deportments of Men: For others of the Church, ſuſpected of Popery, he knew none ſuch, but ſhould anſwer to the Particulars ſo far as they concernd him, when they ſhould happen to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged.</p>
            <p>After this the Houſe diſolved for that night, the Kings Majeſty and the Prince having ſtayed all the time, and the Lord Lieutenant was appointed to come thither again on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Morning, at which time they are to proceed to the firſt Article, to give an Oath to the Witneſſes, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all the Proofs whereon the Proceſs was Builded.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It will be a very hard matter for him to expect every Mans Teſtimony, and to give his anſwers, either for full ſatisfaction or diminution of all Objections, which way of proceeding will ſpend at leaſt a Fortnight, if not a greater ſpace of time, yet it is thought the lower Houſe are impatient of delays: The expectations are exceeding various and different, about the event of this great action; ſome think it will be impoſſible to eſcape the many and great accuſation laid to his Charge; Others, and that the greater number too, are of oppinion that he will be in no hazard of his Life, and that it will not be poſſible to bring him into the compaſs of Treaſon <hi>(quod tam miſere cupio ut non credam)</hi> his adverſe party is ſo great, and ſo far intereſted both in point of ſafety and Honour againſt him, that <hi>Flectere ſi nequeunt ſuperos, &amp;c.</hi> Nothing will be left unaſſayed that may accelerate his Ruin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He hath all this time carried himſelf couragiouſly, to the admiration (and with all ſo mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, that it is to the great ſatisfaction) of his very Enemies, ſo that he ſeems neither dejected with fear, nor to affect boldneſs with confidence, but to carry himſelf with that conſtancy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution which his Innocency and brave parts do promiſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commiſſioners here, have hitherto abſtained from giving in any Remonſtrance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lieutenant, and do ſtill plead to have an immediate dependance from the King, and not from the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>: There was a Report that the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> had ſent a Proteſtation againſt the Act made the laſt year, for the Kings Supply in his Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> as a thing which was violently in part, and in part ſurreptitiouſly obtained from them: but I have learned this to be an untruth. I had almoſt forgotten one paſſage of Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> who in the aggravation of the Lieutenants faults, had this Expreſſion, That he was like the Whore in the <hi>Proverbs, He wiped his mouth, and with a brazen face ſaid he had done no evil.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Noble Lord replied, That he wiſhed his Innocence might not be taken for Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, That he hoped ſhortly to clear himſelf of all thoſe foul Aſperſions which his malicious Enemies had caſt upon him; and he was very confident that he ſhould give the Honourable Houſes full ſatisfaction concerning his Life hitherto, and thought of nothing more hereafter than to retire himſelf from all publick Employments.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> gave at this a great ſhout, and deſired the Houſe to take notice what an injury he had done to the Honourable Houſe of Commons, in calling them his Malicious Enemies.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Lieutenant falling down upon his Knees, humbly beſought them that they would not miſtake him; and withal gave a large Panegyrick of their moſt juſt and moderate proceedings, proteſting that if he himſelf had been one of the Houſe of Commons (as he had the Honour once to be) he would not have adviſed them to have done otherwiſe againſt his deareſt Friend: but withal told them, that he might juſtly ſay he had his own un-friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he hoped in time to make known: nor did he all this time ſpeak one bitter word againſt Mr. <hi>Pim,</hi> though juſtly incenſed, which hath infinitely advanced his Reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have been a daily hearer of theſe Proceedings againſt this great Perſonage now upon the Stage, therefore do preſume I can give a reaſonable account thereof: The Book of his Charge
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98942:5"/>
is extant in Print, ſo it ſhall be needful for me only to name the Articles as they were can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed: and thoſe deſigned by the Houſe of Commons to be his Accuſers; which were theſe that follow.</q>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Names of his Accuſers.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pym, Glin, Maynard, Whitlock,</hi> Lord <hi>Digby, St. Johns, Palmers,</hi> Sr. <hi>Walter Earles, Stroud, Seilden, Hamden,</hi> &amp;c</p>
               <p>
                  <q>One of theſe began the Speech, the reſt after their Colleague hath done, follow in their turn, ſo that he hath all of them to wreſtle againſt; and yet ſufficiently able for them all; though by his agitation his Spirits are much exhauſted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Glyn,</hi> after a large Flouriſh, on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> told the Lords, That the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> was impeached, not with ſimple, but accumulative Treaſon: For though in each particular Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, ſuch a monſtrous Crime could not be deprehended, yet when all was conceived in the Maſs, and under one view, he ſhould be undoubtedly found the moſt wicked and exorbitant Traytor that ever was Arraigned at that Barr. He added, That his Charge was for intending to ſubvert and change the Fundamental Laws, Liberties, and Priviledges of both the Kingdoms, and to introduce an Arbitrary and Tyrannical Form of Government. This, he ſaid, could not appear, but by the Fruits, which were either in Expreſſion or Action. The Expreſſions were four.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Expreſ.</note>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That before ſeveral Witneſſes he had ſaid at <hi>York,</hi> That the King's little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould beheavier, to them, than the Loyns of the Law.</p>
               <p>To this the Lieutenant replied, That having ſpoken ſufficiently before to his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general, he would moreover add theſe few Words, by their Favours: That it ſtrike him to the heart to be attached of ſuch a wicked Crime, by ſuch Honourable Perſons; yea, that it wounded him deeper, in regard that ſuch Perſons who were the companions of his youth, and with whom he had ſpent the beſt of his dayes, ſhould now riſe up in judgment againſt him; yet he thanked God for it, it was not Guilt, but Grief, that ſo much troubled him. He added, That it was a wonder how he had gotten ſtrength ſufficient in ſuch Infirmity of Body, and ſuch Anguiſh of Mind, to collect his Thoughts, and ſay any thing at all for himſelf: But the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who knows him to be innocent, had furniſhed him with ſome abilities to give Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the Truth, and to a good Conſcience: He therefore intreated, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> either in Judgment or in Memory, he ſhould at any time fail, it might be imputed to his great Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And although the Gentlemen his Accuſers ſhould ſeem more ready in their Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than himſelf in his defence, yet that might not prejudice his Cauſe, who in very unequal terms, had to do with learned and eloquent Lawyers, bred up a long time and inured to ſuch judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary pleadings, and whoſe Rhetorick he doubted not, might preſent many things to their view in a Mutiplying Glaſs; He told them farther, that for theſe many years he had been weary of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice, and that now it was his reſolution, after he had vindicated his Honour, to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and enjoy his much longed for privacy, And yet he could not but tell them ſo much, that it had been his hearty wiſh and deſire, rather voluntarily to have reſigned his places of Honour, like a ripe Fruit fallen from the Tree, than to be violently pulled from thence, as a fruitleſs and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table withered Branch.</p>
               <p>To the Charge of Treaſon, he ſaid, that under favour, he conceived that although all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles contained in his impeachment were verified againſt him, yet they would not all amount to Treaſon, neither ſimple not accumulative: For (ſaid he) I do not underſtand by what Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Law, the diverſion of Juſtice can be called a Subverſion of the ſame, or the exceeding of a Commiſſion, the uſurpation of a new Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To the particular he replyed, that his words were cleerly inverted, for that his expreſſion was, <hi>That the little finger of the Law (if not ſupported by the Regal Power, in granting Pardons for poenalties of the ſame) was heavier then the Kings Loyns.</hi> That this was his expreſſion he verified.</p>
               <p>Firſt by the occaſion, for he ſpake the words a long time ſince, to ſome Men who had lain impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned at <hi>York,</hi> and were then by the Kings favour ſet at Liberty, whom he incited to thankfulneſs (by this expreſſion) towards his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by witneſſes produced by him: In the examination of their witneſſes he convinced one of them of untruth, by interrogating him where he was when the ſpeech was heard, and how far diſtant from him, when the Man had replied, that he was twelve Yards from him, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that it was impoſſibly for him to hear a Man three Yards off, by reaſon of a deafneſs that had held him 14 years, which being found true, the witneſs was rejected.</p>
               <p>Another witneſs (Sir <hi>David Fouls</hi>) was brought againſt him, againſt whom he excepted as his known and profeſſed Enemy; 'twas told him that he himſelf did not uſe to admit of exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Witneſſes, and therefore was to expect the ſame meaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98942:5"/>He replyed that Maſter <hi>Pim</hi> might one day perhaps be atached for perſwading the Houſe of Commons to commit the ſame Crime that was laid upon him as a Charge of Treaſon: But for all this the Witneſs was received, becauſe in matter of Treaſon a Mans Enemy may witneſs againſt him <hi>pro Domino noſtro Rege,</hi> 
                  <q>Though, I ſuppoſe the Kings advice was never asked for the preſent. This was all that was done for that time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> he was charged with the ſecond Expreſſion;<note place="margin">Thurſday. Expreſ. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That he ſaid</hi> Ireland <hi>was a Conquered Kingdom, and that the King might preſcribe them what Law he pleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This they aggravated as a prime note of his Tyrannical will and affection, that would permit no Law to bound the Subject, but what himſelf and ſuch as he might draw up by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrous informations, from a gracious and well meaning Prince, and if this were admitted, the whole Power and Liberty of the Republique would be utterly loſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this he replied,<note place="margin">Staffords Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</note> that neither was the Expreſſion in thoſe words nor in that ſence ſpoken or meant by him; The firſt part of it (ſaid he) cannot be denied; To the ſecond that he had ſaid only, that the King was the Law-giver, which he hoped none could deny without incurring the Crime of Treaſon; And that the Kings Sentence was a Law in matter not determined by Acts of Parliament, which all but diſloyal Subjects would grant; and that it had ever been his endeavour to have the Liberty of the Subject, and the Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative follow both in one Channel: If either of them croſſed other, we could expect nothing but a Subverſion of the Common-Wealth, either by Tyranny or Rebellion; That the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive was like the firſt; the Liberty of the Subject like the ſecond Table, either both or neither can be preſerved, that in his duty he ſtood obliged firſt to the King, as Gods Anointed, then in the ſecond place to his Countrey, if it did not croſſe the Regal Power: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hoped that what he had ſpoken was ſo far from being Treaſon, that he thought a thouſand ſuch Expreſſions would not make up one Fellony.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the two other Expreſſions were followed; <hi>That he ſaid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Friday. Expreſs. <hi>3.</hi> &amp; <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>He would not ſuffer his Ordinances to be diſputed by Lawyers, before inferiour Judicataries, and that he would make an Act of State equivalent to an Act of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the firſt he ſaid, that he had often ſaid (more then once) that he would not ſuffer his Ordinance to be contemned, becauſe, in him, his Maſters Honour was wounded.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, He thought a proportionable obedience was due to Acts of State, as well as to Acts of Parliament, otherwiſe they were made in vain if that both did not bind in one kind.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Cork</hi> (though his mortal Enemy) was now examined and admitted,<note place="margin">Corks two Falls.</note> as a Witneſs, whom in his Depoſition he convinced of two ſhameful overſights: For <hi>Corke</hi> had declared upon his Oath,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1</hi> Interlining.</note> that the Lieutenant had cauſed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlined an Ordinance againſt himſelf, and had cauſed ſome words to be ſcraped out, which words were notwithſtanding ſtill found to be in the Sentence by an authentique Copy under the hand of Sir <hi>Paul Daviſon,</hi> Clerk to the Councel-board of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Cork</hi> alleaged, that he had advanced a Groom of his to be a Preacher,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Glyn</hi> proceeded to the Tenth Article. The Charge was, <hi>That the Earl of</hi> Strafford, <hi>having eſtabliſhed an Arbitrary and Tyrannical Government, over the Lives, Lands and Liberties of the Kings Subjects, his next deſire was to make intruſion upon the Crown it ſelf, that by applying to his own uſe the Publick Revenues, he might be the more enabled to accompliſh his Diſloyal and Trayterous Intentions: To which end, having by a new Book of Rates, enhaunced the Cuſtoms, he had gotten by advantage of his Leaſe, above twenty ſix thouſand pound yearly. This (they added) was a Crime of higher nature than thoſe contained in the preceding Articles, becauſe in thoſe there was ſome colour or pretext of Juſtice, here none; thoſe in Particulars, this in General; thoſe againſt the Subject on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this againſt the King himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Proof of the Charge, they produced the Leaſe of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which was read and compared with that Leaſe to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (which the Lieutenant hath now by Aſſignment) and ſome Difference ſhewn ariſing to the Sum of two thouſand pounds in the Dukes Leaſe, only the Moiety of concealed and forfeited Goods were

due to him, but the whole Goods to the Dutcheſs in her Leaſe: Again, the Kings Ships of Prizes did not pay Cuſtom in the Dukes Leaſe; in the Dutcheſſes they did: Again, the Impoſt of the Wines (then belonging to the Earl of <hi>Carlile</hi>) was not in the Dukes Leaſe; in the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſes it was: Laſtly, Whereas the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> paid but fourteen thouſand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> for the Cuſtom, it was worth to him, as was apparent by the Books of the Exchequer, forty thouſand pounds. Witneſſes were examined.</p>

               <p>Secondly, The Lord <hi>Renelaugh,</hi> who depoſed that by the inſpection of the Books of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, he had found the Cuſtoms to be <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. thirty ſix thouſand pounds; <hi>Anno</hi> 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>With the Proof they concluded the Charge: <hi>That notwithſtanding the Lord</hi> Strafford <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a great meaſure of Zeal and Honeſty in His Majeſties Service, yet it is evident he had abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Trust put upon him, and by withdrawing ſo great Sums of Money from the Crown, had weakned the King, prejudiced the Subject of the Protection they were to expect from him, and had been the cauſe that the extraordinary way of Impost and Monopolies had been undertaken for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the Royal Neceſſity: And that this Act, therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought to be enough to make the Charge and Impeachment of High Treaſon laid againſt him.</hi>

               <p>The Lieutenants Reply was,<note place="margin">Strafford<hi>'s</hi> Reply.</note> That he conceived he had given full ſatisfaction to all hitherto brought againſt him, about that pretended Arbitrary Government, nor would he ſpend time in vain Repetitions, for the preſent Article, though in all its parts it were granted to be true, yet he could not perceive, by what Interpretation of Law, it could imply the leaſt Act of Treaſon, and when it ſhould be directly Charged upon him as a point of Miſdemeanor, Oppreſſion, or Felony, he made no doubt but he ſhould be very able to clear himſelf abundantly in that point alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet leſt any prejudice might ſtick to his Honour, by theſe bold Aſſertions, he was content to ſtep ſo far out of the way as to give Anſwer.</p>

               <p>Secondly, For the Book of Rates (wherein the chief matter of Oppreſſion and Grievance ſeemed to reſt) the ſame was there eſtabliſhed by the Deputy <hi>Faulkland, An.</hi> 1628, three years before his going into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore it was exceeding ſtrange, in his apprehenſion, now that could riſe up in judgment againſt him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That he had his intereſt in the Cuſtoms by Aſſignation of a Leaſe from the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, which was given her before his Government, nor did he ever hear it alledged as a Crime of Treaſon for a man to make a good Bargain for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That not of his own accord, but at the Kings ſpecial Command he had undergone that Charge, on hopes that upon the enquiry into the worth thereof, the Cuſtoms might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for the Benefit of the Crown, and the true value thereof diſcovered.

               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, That upon a pretended Diſobedience, he had puniſhed a great Number of People, by Seizures, Impriſonments, Fining, Whipping, Pillory, and ſuch like cruel and inhumane <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, That by theſe means he had gained one hundred thouſand Pounds yearly.</hi>

            <div type="part">
               <head>For Proof hereof,</head>
               <p>Firſt, The Proclamation for reſtraining <hi>Tobacco,</hi> was read.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Proclamation about the Sealing of the ſame.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Others who had known ſome <hi>Tobacco</hi> ſeized on as forfeited.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Remonſtrance of the Houſe of Commons in <hi>Ireland,</hi> declaring that the Earl had ſold 500 Tun of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> which ſold at 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> pound, amounts to 100000 <hi>l.</hi>

               <head>The Lieutenant's Reply was,</head>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Strafford's Reply.</note>That his moſt ſecret Thoughts were conſcious of nothing but of a ſincere intention and endeavour to promote and advance the wellfare of that Kingdom; and withal he conceived (by their leaves) that nothing in that Charge could have the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Treaſon; yet as he ſaid before, for removing of all prejudice, he was content to anſwer:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That long before his coming to <hi>Ireland,</hi> the ſame reſtraint had been of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and the ſame Impoſt of eighteen pence <hi>per</hi> pound, enjoyned by King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That at that time the Tradeſmen for this Commodity paid but twenty pounds a year to the Crown for the Impoſt, but now 400 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the Parliament in <hi>Ireland</hi> 1628, had Petitioned to have this Impoſt ſetled by an Act of State for ever afterwards, as a part of the Revenue of the Crown.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That he had expreſs Command from the King, for iſſuing thoſe Proclamations, and therefore could not imagine more danger in them, than in others for Monopolies in <hi>England,</hi> in the worſt ſence.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That the Proclamations were not put forth by himſelf alone, but by the whole Councel-Board of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, That for the Contract of Tobacco, he was ſo tender of it, that it was ſent over hither, and ſeen and approved of by the Councel-Board of <hi>England,</hi> before it was condiſcended to in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Proclamations; he told them it was his own opinion (and if he failed in it, he humbly craved pardon, and hoped that it ſhould not be treaſon to have no more Judgement than God had beſtowed on him) that the King was indued by God, with a power, to make temporary Laws, and cauſe the ſame to be promulgated for the good of his People, upon ſuddain emergent occaſions to which Laws obedience is due, till they be abrogated by enſuing Parliaments; that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained no man from importing <hi>Tobacco,</hi> who was willing to pay the appointed Impoſt; that for his part, he had never traffict in all his time, in that kind, nor had any part with the Contractors: And if any <hi>Tobacco</hi> was ſeized on, it was upon contempt of the Proclamations; And if any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were cenſured to the Pillory, or Whipping, it was for known perjury, the ordinary and uſual puniſhment in ſuch a Caſe; concerning the Tobacco imported (he ſaid) no conſideration was taken of the prices given for the Tobacco beyond Seas, of the Kings Revenue of four thouſand pound, of the Merchants pains and danger, bringing the ſame home: For his part, if any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage were made, ſurely it was not his, nor could he annul every Contract or Leaſe made by the King: And therefore, ſeeing his intereſt was none, he had done nothing but at the Kings dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and at the advice of the Councel-Board; ſeeing the ſame Impoſt was in King <hi>James</hi> his time,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98942:8"/>
and Petitioned for by themſelves in <hi>Ireland</hi>: He hoped the carriage in the buſineſs ſhould be ſo far from a Crime of Treaſon, that it ſhould rather be thought no Crime at all. So much for <hi>Wedneſday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> he was Charged with the twelfth Article, concerning Flax,<note place="margin">Thurſday Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. <hi>12.</hi> Charge by <hi>Maynard.</hi>
                  </note> by Maſter <hi>Maynard,</hi> on this manner: <hi>That the Flax, being the native and principal Commodity of that Kingdom, was by him (the Lieutenant) reſtrained, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects put to that which was unknown, yea impoſſible for the</hi> Iriſh <hi>to make the ſame into Yarn, here they complained of three things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, That by Proclamation he had reſtrained ſelling of Flax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, That he had ordered the making of Yarn of ſuch and ſuch lengths and numbers of Threds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, That the Native</hi> Iriſh, <hi>being unacquainted with ſuch Cuſtomes, upon a pretended diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, had all their Flax and Yarn ſeized on to his uſe, whereby a great many Families were reduced to ſuch penury that they died, by great numbers in the Fields for want of Food.</hi>

            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>For proof hereof they brought:</head>
               <p>Firſt, The Proclamation about the Reſtraint.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Warrant for ſeizing the forfeited goods.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Execution of this Warrant, proved by Sir <hi>John Clotworthy,</hi> Lord <hi>Ranelaugh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Remonſtrance from the Houſe of Commons, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that upon the rigorous courſe and execution of this Warrant, many perſons died for want of Food. They concluded the Charge therefore: <hi>Though the Article did not individually imply Treaſon, yet it did make very much for the Accumulation of Treaſon.</hi>

               <head>The Lieutenants Reply was,</head>
               <p>That as before he would and muſt ever repeat it,<note place="margin">Staffords Reply.</note> that nothing was in the Charge that contained Treaſon, to the matter it ſelf he anſwered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Proclamations iſſued forth, were grounded not only upon convenience, but upon neceſſity, becauſe that except ſome way had been taken for ordering of Yarn, the Merchants had abſolutely given over the Linnen-trade in that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Councel-Board was as lyable to the Charge as himſelf, amongſt whom were, at that time, the Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Chancellor <hi>Loftis</hi> and the Lord <hi>Mount-Norris,</hi> all Subſcribers to the Proclamation, men to them of known integrity and Judgment.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That nothing was more common, then for the Councel-Board of <hi>Ireland</hi> to give one Orders for reducing the Natives to the Engliſh Cuſtomes, and to fine them for drawing their Horſes by the tails, during their Corn, and ſuch like, and he conceived that to be a thing of the ſame nature.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the ſpecial thing inducing him to it was, becauſe he perceived the trade of Wool to increaſe much in that Kingdom; He diſſwaded by all means the making of Wooles-Cloath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the infinite detriment that might happen thereby to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought this the beſt way to encourage the way of Linnen Cloth; For the Warrant to ſeize upon the goods, he affirmed the ſame to be neceſſary, becauſe there ſhould be no contempt to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations; But that any part thereof did accrue to him, he flatly denied; If any rigour was uſed in the execution, he ſaid not he, but his Officers were to anſwer for it; for this might happen in the moſt juſt and neceſſary commands, nor was there eyer any complaint preſented to him of any ſuch matter; For his part he had loſt thirty thouſands pounds in the Manufacture, eſtabliſhed by himſelf for the encouragement of others.</p>
               <p>To that, that Perſons died by this means, he Replied, that it was more then ever he heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or could think poſſible, yea that he was cleared by the allegation it ſelf, which ſaith that the ſame hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſince his coming from <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Remonſtrance of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he conceived that a charge was but a ſlender proof of a Charge, and that eſpecially upon Interrogatories, not upon Oath, ſeeing that priviledge was not due to the Houſe of Commons, neither here, nor there; that he might ſay it in truth and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, he deſerved much better of that People, and might take up that in the Goſpel. <hi>For which of all my good Deeds, &amp;c.</hi> Yet he hoped to be better underſtood ſhortly, both here and there, and for his part, though his purſuit had been very hot, yet God was his Witneſs he never intended to take the leaſt Impreſſion of Revenge, for thoſe diſcontents and affronts which had been eagerly put upon him, or to carry any thing hence with him from that Bar, where ſo many foule Aſperſions had been unjuſtly thrown upon him, but only <hi>Gratuitas Cicatricis.</hi>

               <head>To the Charge he anſwered.</head>
               <p>Firſt, That the Cuſtomes of <hi>Ireland</hi> differed exceedingly from the Cuſtomes of <hi>England,</hi> and was clear by <hi>Cooks</hi> Book, and therefore, though ſeſſing of Men might ſeem ſtrange here yet not ſo there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98942:10"/>Secondly, That even in <hi>England</hi> he had known Souldiers preſſed upon men, by the preſidents of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> in caſe of known and open Contempts, and that both in point of Outlary and Rebellion, and alſo even for ſums of Debt between party and party, there is nothing more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary than theſe Seſſings to this day in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereby the chief houſe of the owner is ſeized upon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That to this day there hath been nothing more ordinary in <hi>Ireland,</hi> than for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours to appoint Souldiers, to put all manner of Sentences in execution, which he proved plainly to have been done frequently, and familiarly exerciſed in <hi>Grandiſons, Faulklands, Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſters, Wilmot, Corks, Evers,</hi> and all preceding Deputies times: And had even for Outlaries, for the Kings debts in the Exchequer, of Collection, of Contribution money, and (which comes home to the point) for peteet ſums of money between party and party, ſo that he marvailed, <hi>quâ fronte,</hi> or with what boldneſs it could be called an Arbitrary Government lately brought in by him.</p>
               <p>To this the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> Sir <hi>Adam Loftis,</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Teringham</hi> depoſed; the laſt of whom told, that in <hi>Faulklands</hi> time he knew twenty Souldiers Seſſed upon a Man for refuſing to pay ſixteen ſhillings ſterling.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That in his inſtructions for executing his Commiſſions, he hath expreſs warrant for the ſame, as were in the inſtructions to the Lord <hi>Faukland</hi> before him, both of which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and read.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That although all theſe preſidents were not, yet it were not poſſible to govern the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland</hi> otherwiſe, which had been from all times accuſtomed to ſuch ſummary proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That no Teſtimony brought againſt him can prove that erer he gave warrant to that effect, and for the Deeds of the Serjeant at Arms, he did conceive himſelf to be anſwerable for it.</p>
               <p>As for the Acts of Parliament, he had reſerved them to the diſpute of his Lawyers, but was content to ſay thus much for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is a ground in the Civil Law, that where the King is not mentioned, there he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be included.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The words of the Statute are not appliable to him, for God knows, he never went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in perſon to lay Souldiers upon any of the Kings Subjects.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the Kings own Souldiers, enquiring in a cuſtomary way obedience to his Orders, could in no conſtruction be called <hi>Iriſh-Rebels, Engliſh Enemies,</hi> or Hooded-men.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the uſe and cuſtom of the Law was the beſt Interpreter thereof, and for that he had already ſpoken enough.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That it favoured more of prejudice than equity, to ſtart out ſuch an old Statute againſt him, and none others, though culpable of the ſame Fact, to the overthrow and ruine of him and his Poſterity.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That (under favour he conceived) for any <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cuſtom, or upon any <hi>Iriſh</hi> Statute, he was to be judged by the Peers of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, That Statute, of what force ſoever, was repealed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the Tenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, where it is expreſly declared, nothing ſhall be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Treaſon hereafter, but what is ſo declared by the preſent Statute, now not a word there of any ſuch Treaſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the eleventh of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> where expreſly power is given to the Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſeſs and lay Souldiers, although the ſame be reputed Treaſon in any other.</p>
               <p>To the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, he Replied, that a ſlender Anſwer might ſerve: He ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that no man would think him ſo inconſiderate to war againſt the King of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the ſeſſing of five Souldiers, that he had been charged by many for taking Arms for the King, but to that time, never for taking Arms againſt him; and that he heartily wiſhed that no man in all his Majeſties Dominions, had more practiſes with Rebels and Rebellious Deſigns againſt the King than himſelf. So much for <hi>Thurſday.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, the Inſtructions were read, whereby that Reſtraint was permitted.</p>
               <p>Seconly, the Proclamation, That all Noblemen, Gentlemen, Undertakers, Officers, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subjects that ſhould reſort into that Kingdom, ſhould not come from thence without a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That he had reſtrained the Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> becauſe of a Suit in Law depending between the Earl and himſelf, till Publication of the ſame was paſſed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the Lord <hi>Roch,</hi> being informed againſt before the Star-Chamber, he would not Licence him to come into this Kingdom, till the Sentence was paſſed againſt him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Than one <hi>Marchatee,</hi> having pretended a mind to travel, was denied a Licence.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That the whole Committee for the Parliament, was reſtrained this laſt year by Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Waniford,</hi> which they ſaid might be interpreted to be his Fact, both becauſe they had ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence the one from the other, as alſo by the Proclamation iſſued by him before.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That one <hi>Parry,</hi> Servant to Chancellor <hi>Loftis,</hi> was fined five hundred pounds at his return, for departing <hi>Ireland</hi> without Licence.</p>
               <p>Eightly, That the Iriſh Remonſtrance complained of this, as the greateſt Innovation and Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom put upon them ſince the time of the Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>They concluded the Charge; <hi>That by this meanes, having taken of that Intelligence which ſhould be between the King and his People, and having deprived them of that Remedy which in Reaſon they might expect from ſo Juſt and ſo gracious a Prince he had taken upon him a Royal and Independent Power, and had faulted highly both againſt King and State.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note>That he hoped to make it clear, that he had done nothing in that particular, but what was uſual, neceſſary and juſt, and that he ſhould be very well able (by the Grace of God) not only of that, but of all other his publick Actions, to give a reaſonable Accompt, though not be free from much weakneſs, yet certainly from oll Malice and Treaſon.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>To the Particulars.</head>
               <p>Firſt, For Inſtructions laid upon him, he was not ſo much Chargeable as thoſe of the Council of <hi>England,</hi> whereof there was a great many preſent who could witneſs their Commands; but leſt any thing ſhould ſeem unjuſtly enjoyned by them, or embraced by him, he deſired that the Reaſons of their Inſtructions might be read: which were; <hi>That it were Injustice to complain of Injuries, of Oppreſſion done in that Kingdom, till first the Deputies Judgment was informed, and Trial made of his Integrity; That it would much diſcourage the Ministers of State there, and expend the Monies of that Kingdom, if upon every trifling buſineſs Complaints ſhould be admitted in</hi> England: <hi>And that if Juſtice were there denied by the Deputy, it ſhould be lawfull for any man to come over.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, For the Proclamation: That the ſame was builded upon the Statute of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the 25 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. which contained the ſame Reſtraint <hi>verbatim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. the Agents for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation had Petitioned for the ſame from the King.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the Deputy <hi>Faulkland</hi> had ſet forth the ſame Proclamation.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That he had the Kings expreſs Warrant for it, <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. which was read.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That he had received the Warrant in <hi>January,</hi> yet the Proclamation iſſued not out till <hi>September</hi> after.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That the whole Council-Board of <hi>Ireland,</hi> had not only condeſcended, but alſo preſſed him to it.</p>
               <p>Eightly, The Neceſſity of the Kingdom required the ſame; for, if the Gentlemen had the Ports open to go to <hi>Spain,</hi> and their Scholars to <hi>Doway, Rhemes</hi> or St. <hi>Omers,</hi> it were likely that at their return they would put fire both in Church and State, and produce very ſad Events, by practiſing to diſtemper both.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, He conceived that the King, as great Maſter of the Family, might reſtrain whom he pleaſed from departing his Kingdom without his privity, and here it was not lawful for any to go from <hi>England</hi> without Licence, how much more neceſſary was this from <hi>Ireland?</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>To the Proofs he anſwered,</head>
               <p>Firſt, For <hi>Deſmond,</hi> he granted he was Reſtrained indeed, but not for any Suit of Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, but becauſe at that time he ſtood Charged with Treaſon before the Councel in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for practiſing againſt the Life of one Sir <hi>Valentine Cooke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, For the Lord <hi>Roch,</hi> he had often-times marvailed with what reaſon the man at that time could ſeek a Licence, ſeeing he was a Priſoner for Debt in the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi>; and if he had granted a Licence to him then, it had been a far more juſt Charge of Treaſon than now.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For <hi>Marcattee,</hi> he was afraid of his going to <hi>Spain</hi>; and if he had intended to go for <hi>England,</hi> and complain of himſelf, he would not have refuſed him Liberty, as he never did to any.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98942:11"/>Fourthly, That the Committy of <hi>Iriſh</hi> was not reſtrained by him, and therefore did not concern him at all</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That for <hi>Parry,</hi> he was fined indeed, but that it is expreſly ſaid in his Sentence, that it was not for coming over without Licence (as is ſuggeſted) but for ſundry contempts againſt the Councel-Board in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, That he had Replied in the laſt Article, a Remonſtrance was no proof at all; He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that he hoped the leaſt Suſpition of Treaſon could not accrue to him from the Article; For Oppreſſion or Miſdemeanour, when it was laid to his Charge, he made no doubt but he ſhould be able to anſwer it.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, Sir <hi>Jo. Clotworthy,</hi> who declared that a great number had fled the Kingdom for fear of that Oath.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, One Mr. <hi>Samuel,</hi> who depoſed, that upon the tenth of <hi>October,</hi> 1638. He heard the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They Concluded, <hi>That this was a point of the moſt Tyrannical and Arbitrary Government, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time was ever heard of, not only to Lord it over the Fortunes, but alſo over the Souls of Men.

               <head>The Lieutenant Replied:</head>
               <p>That every new Article acquainted him with a new Treaſon,<note place="margin">Straffords Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</note> that if he had done any thing in all his life acceptable to the King and Countrey, he conceived it to be this. To theſe Particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, He deſired the Lord would call to mind the condition of thoſe times, no than (pointing to my Lord Steward) knows better than your Lordſhip, who had then the chiefeſt place in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Service; I would be very ſorry to rub (ſaid he) old Sores, eſpecially ſeeing I hope things are in a fair way to a firm Peace, and I wiſh that I may not be deceived, that is, that it may be ſo, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus much I may ſay, we had then greater fears and apprehenſions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> left the <hi>Scots</hi> in the Kingdom (who were above one hundred thouſand Souls) might have joyned with their Countrey-Men at home, for the diſturbance of our Peace, mean time we detected a Treaſon of Betraying of the Caſtle of <hi>Knockfergus,</hi> to a great Man in that Kingdom (whoſe name I now ſpare) by one <hi>Freeman,</hi> who upon the diſcovery was executed.</p>
               <p>The Councel-Board therefore in <hi>Ireland</hi> reſolved to preſcribe the <hi>Scots</hi> an Oath, whereby they might declare their diſcontent at their Countrey-mens proceedings, and obliege themſelves to the Kings Service; but while we were about this; they, of their own accord, come to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to Petition for it, and took it with a wonderful alacrity and heartineſs, ſo that it is a marvelous falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood for any man to ſay it was invented, or violently enjoyned by me.</p>
               <p>Secondly, about the ſame time, the ſame Oath <hi>verbum verbo</hi> was by the Councel of <hi>England</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the <hi>Scots,</hi> at <hi>London</hi> and elſe where, which was no ſmall encouragement to us in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I had (ſaid he) which I never ſhewed, becauſe I had no need before this time, a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Warrant from the King, all Written with his own hand to that effect; and when the King commands a matter not contrary to Law, truly I (ſaid he) do conceive it both contrary to Law and Conſcience, not to yield him all due obedience. For the Proof brought againſt him, there was nothing ſeemed to be of any moment but the words.</p>
               <p>For the firſt words, <hi>That he had called all the Nation Rebels and Traytors,</hi> He ſaid there was no proof at all, nor indeed could there be any, for if I had ſaid it (quoth he) I had been perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of my Witts; And, he thanked God, ſuch irrational-ſpeeches uſed not to eſcape him: He honoured that Kingdom very much, becauſe it was the native ſoil of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98942:12"/>
our dread Soveraign, his gracious Maſter, and becauſe he knew a part, yea (he hoped) the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of them had been, and ever will be as loyal and dutiful to the King, as any other of his Subjects; and of thoſe too who had ſubſcribed that unhappy combination, he knew a great many had done it againſt their hearts and wills, and would be ever ready upon occaſion to remonſtrate the ſame, by adhering to the Kings ſervice: So that this accuſation was nothing but a wreſtling and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the other words, they were proved only by one Witneſs, which could make no ſufficient faith, and that Witneſs too he would evince, if not of perjury, yet of a notable miſtake; For he had ſworn poſitively that he had ſpoken theſe words the tenth of <hi>October,</hi> whereas he was come out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>England</hi> the twelfth of <hi>September</hi> before, and was at <hi>London</hi> the one and twentieth.</p>

               <p n="3">3. The Earl of <hi>Clare</hi> deſired to know what could be meant by <hi>this</hi> Kingdom; for his part (he ſaid) he thought it meant of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi>

friends ſearch'd and ſiſted to the leaſt Circumſtance, that he might ſeem guilty of that which, by God's aſſiſtance, he ſhould never be.</p>
               <p>To the Lord <hi>Traquieres,</hi> and the Deputies Depoſitions, he thought their Proofs did not much ſtick upon him; for upon the Suppoſitions, firſt, That the Demands were true; ſecondly, That they were not juſtifiable; thirdly, That no other Courſe could prevail: He could not ſee what other Advice he could poſſibly give the King, than to put himſelf into a poſture of War, eſpecially ſeeing then there was frequent Reports of the <hi>Scots</hi> invading or entring into <hi>England,</hi> nor was he of any other mind than all the reſt of the Council-Board.</p>
               <p>For that of <hi>Morton</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he doth not poſitively remember the Words, but if the Demands were read, perhaps they would imply nothing leſs; and if ſo, how otherwiſe to be anſwered but by the Sword; all other Means being firſt aſſayed, which is ever to be ſuppoſed?</p>
               <p>For Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s and <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s Teſtimony, about perſwading of an Offenſive War, he ſaid, he remembred it very well, and thought it as free for him to give his Opinion or an Offenſive as they for a Defenſive War: Opinions (ſaid he) if they be attended with Obſtimacy or Pertinacy, may make an Heretick, but that they ever made a Traytor, he never heard it till now; nor (under favour) ſhould I be an Heretick either (ſaid he) for as I was then, ſo am I now, moſt willing to acknowledge my Weakneſs, and correct my Errors, whereof no man hath more, or is more ſenſible of them, than I my ſelf: yet, if that Opinion of mine had been followed, it might perhaps have ſpared us ſome Money (ſaid he) and ſome Reputation too, of which we have been prodigal enough.</p>
               <p>For the laſt, about the Ships, it proves nothing but he would willingly confeſs, that ſome Ships were there detained, and that by himſelf, and his own Direction, as Vice Admiral of <hi>Connaugh,</hi> but it was at the Command of the Lord Admiral the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and produced his Letter to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proof, He marvelled much how Sir <hi>George Ratcliff</hi>'s Words could be put upon him; Sir <hi>George</hi> (though alledged to be his Boſom Friend) yet had thoughts of his own, and might have ſome other thoughts in his Boſom, and be to ſome other Expreſſions than Sir <hi>George Ratcliffe</hi>: No man (ſaid he) can commit Treaſon by his Attorney, and ſhould I, by my Friend Sir <hi>George,</hi> as by a Proxy?</p>
               <p>For his Brother, He never knew him before ſo raſh; but that was nothing to him; except they could prove a nearer Identity than Nature had inſtituted, and that his Brother's Words and his were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll one; yet withal he conceived that his Brother's Words might be very well underſtood, of the <hi>Scots</hi> conquering <hi>England,</hi> but not at all of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>; and ſo he wiſhed with all his heart, that he had not ſpoken ſomething which is like a Propheſie.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Primate's</hi> Teſtimony (with all Reverence to his Integrity be it ſpoken) he is but one Witneſs, and in Law can prove nothing; Add to this (ſaid he) that it was a private Diſcourſe between him and me, and perhaps ſpoken by me <hi>Tentandi gratia,</hi> and how far this ſhould be laid to a mans Charge, let your Lordſhips judge.</p>
               <p>Yea, this ſeems to me againſt Humanity it ſelf, and will make the Society of men ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and loathſom to us, that our Dwelling Houſes will be turned to Cells, and our Towns to Defarts: That which God and Nature (our Tongues) have beſtowed upon us [for the greater comfort of venting our own Conceptions, or craving the Advice of Wiſer and Learnecer men] ſhould become Snares and Burdens to us, by a curious and needleſs Fear; yet if my Words be taken, ſaid he, with all that went before and followed after, I ſee no danger in it.</p>
               <p>To the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> I may reply the ſame, with this Addition, That it is a very Natural Motion, for a man to preſerve himſelf: every Greature hath this Priviledge; and ſhall we deny it to Monarchy, provided this be done in a lawful, though in an extraordinary way? This grain of Salt muſt be added to ſeaſon all my Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>To that of Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> of offering my Service to the King, I thank him for the Teſtimony, and think he hath done me much honour thereby; but if he or any body elſe do ſuſpect that his Majeſty will employ me in unlawful Enterprizes, I ſhall think them more liable to the Charge of Treaſon than my ſelf,</p>

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98942:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>To the ſubſequent Teſtimonies, I ſhall not need to wreſtle about them much, only the laſt of Sir <hi>Henry Vanes</hi> pinches, and lies ſore upon me, but to that which the Earl of <hi>Clare</hi> (and I thank him for it) hath ſaid already, give me leave to add this, that the Teſtimony of one man is not a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Witneſs, nor can a man be Accuſed, much leſs Condemned, of Treaſon, upon this, and for that read the Stat. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.12. and of <hi>Edw</hi> 6.5.</p>
               <p>Now my Lords (ſaid he) to give you further ſatisfaction, I ſhall deſire all the Lords of the Councel, which were then preſent (only to the number of eight) may be examined whether they heard theſe words or not, for the Archbiſhop and Sir <hi>Francis Windebank</hi> they cannot be had, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> gives the Teſtimony, I deny it, four only remain.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Earl of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> Teſtimony, which was read, had declared expreſly that he had never heard thoſe words, nor any like them from the Lord <hi>Strafford,</hi> but he ſpake with great Honour and regard to the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who declared upon his Oath, that he had never heard ſuch words, but that he had heard the Lieutenant often ſay, that the King was to rule his Royal Power <hi>Candidè &amp; Caſtè,</hi> that it would never be well for this Kingdom, till the Prerogative of the Crown, and the Priviledge of the Subject went in one pace together, and that Parliaments were the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way to keep a correſpondency between the King and People.</p>
               <p>The very ſame was delivered by the Lord Treaſurer, and the Lord <hi>Cottington.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, my Lords, you may mervail how theſe words reſted only on the ears of Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> but my Lords, ſaid he, that I may remove all ſcruple from you, I will make it evident that there was not the leaſt intention that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army ſhould ſet a foot in <hi>England,</hi> and then I hope you will conceive that I had no meaning to reduce this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>This he made clear by the Teſtimony of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the Oaths of Marquiſs <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For other of my words my Lords (ſaid he) I deſire you would not take them by halves, if ſo, who ſhould be free from Treaſon? Certainly, if ſuch a precident take ſooting, <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> ſhall be more troubled with Treaſon then with Common-Law, look therefore to the Antecedents and Conſequents of my Speeches, and you ſhall find the ſtate of the queſtion clearly altered; the Antecedents were upon an abſolute or inevitable neceſſity, upon a preſent Invaſion, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of a Parliament cannot be expected; the Conſequents for the defence of the Kingdom, which acompts afterward to the Parliament. The qualifications too in a lawful, convenient, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, ſo far as the preſent neceſſity can permit. Add but theſe, and which of you are not of my mind? Is the King endowed with no power from the Lord? Is he not <hi>publicus inſpector Regni?</hi> Stands it not him in hand to do ſomething on preſent neceſſities.</p>
               <p>And that theſe were his words he often proved, over and over again, by the Marqueſs, by the Lord Treaſurer, <hi>Cottington,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Jermine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lords, what I have kept to the laſt (ſaid he) is this, and I would intreat you ſeriouſly to think of it; If a mans Table, his Bed, his Houſe, his Brother, his Friends (and that too after they have given an Oath of Secrecy) to be Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> to find out Treaſon againſt him, who never knew what it meant, what earthly Man ſhall paſs free from Treaſon? Let my misfortune my Lords, be your advertiſement, your wiſe Anceſtors were glad to put bands and limits to this Lion Treaſon, if you give him the large ſcope of words to range into, he will at laſt pull you or yours all to pieces.</p>
               <p>But my Lords, I did never think till now, that matter of Opinion ſhould be objected as matter of Treaſon.</p>
               <p>For, firſt Opinions are free, and Men may argue both <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>eon,</hi> in all faculties without any ſtain of his Reputation, otherwiſe all conſultations would be vain.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I may be of another Judgment then I declare my ſelf to be of opinion, perhaps to gain better Arguments for the maintenance of my own Grounds.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Many, and my ſelf often times, have propounded my Opinion, yet upon hearing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Judgments have preſently changed it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We uſe to ſtrain our Opinions too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fifthly, It is expreſly commanded by the Stat. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.9. That though a Man ſhould ſay the King is not lawful Heir to the Crown, and may be depoſed, yet he is not to be charged with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but only with Felony, and I hope my Lords, thoſe words are of a more tranſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>The Proofs were theſe:</head>
               <p>Firſt, The Biſhop of <hi>Loden,</hi> Lord Treaſurer, who declared that he remembred the words very well, that the Lord Lieutenant had adviſed the King to cauſe the Ship Money to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in, but he remembred withal, that both himſelf and all the Councel had done the like, and that it was upon a preſent neceſſity, and defect of Money, for entertaining the Army, which (the condition of the times conſidered) they all conceiued, was by any means to be kept on foot.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Alderman <hi>Wiſeman</hi> declared, that upon an humble Remonſtrance made to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel Board, the City would take it ill, if a Tax-role ſhould be delivered of their Eſtates, who were thought able for the Loan Money; the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> ſaid, they deſerved to be fined, Ranſome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, The Earl of <hi>Barkſhire</hi> declared, that the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> had ſaid, that upon the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of ſuch a ſervice enjoined by the Kings Peremptory Command, it was his Opinion, they might be fined.</p>

               <head>The Lieutenant Replied:</head>
               <p>Firſt, That though all the Charge were,<note place="margin">Straffords Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</note> in the moſt ſtrict and rigid way o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſence verified againſt him, yet he could not conceive by what Interpretation of Law it could be rech't home to High-Treaſon, and to that common objection (that the Treaſon was not individual but Accumulative) he replied that under favour he thought to that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, were as much as to ſay, no Treaſon at all: Becauſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That neither in Statute Law, Common Law, nor practiſe, there was ever, till this time, heard of ſuch a matter as Accumulative-Treaſon, or a Treaſon-by way of Conſequence, but that it is a word newly coined to attend a Charge newly invented, ſuch an one as never was before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Treaſon was a thing of a ſimple and ſpecificative nature, and therefore could not be ſo by accumulation, but either muſt be ſo in ſome, or either of the Articles, or elſe could not be ſo at all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He did conceive that it was against the first principles of Nature, and falſe; therefore could not be ſo by Accumulation, but either muſt be ſo in ſome or each of the Articles, or elſe could not be ſo at all.</hi> That a heap, or Accumulation, ſhould be and not be of Homo-genous things, and therefore that which, in its firſt being, is not treaſonable, can never confer to make up an accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Treaſon. <hi>Cumulus, an heap of Grain,</hi> ſo called becauſe every, or at laſt ſome of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals are grain, if otherways, an heap it may be, but not an heap of Grain: Juſt ſo, perhaps theſe Articles may make up an heap of Felonies, Oppreſſions, Errors, Miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, That the Teſtimonies brought againſt him, were all of them ſingle, not two one way, and therefore could not make Faith in matter of Debt, much leſs in matter of Life and Death; yea, that it was againſt the Statute expreſly, to impeach a Man of High-Treaſon under the evidence of two famous Witneſſes, much leſs to adjudg and convince him upon atteſtation of one.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To the Lord-Treaſurers Teſtimony, he did with all his heart condiſcend unto it, but upon sheſe grounds only, that there was a preſent neceſſity of Money, that all the Councel-Board had ſo voiced with him, yea before himſelf, and he always thought it Preſumption in a Man, not to follow the wiſer and more judicious, and that there was than a Sentence of the Star-Chamber, for the right of paying Ship-Money; for his part, he would never be more prudent then his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor give Judgment againſt the Judges, and therefore he thought it not far amiſs to adviſe the King for the collecting of that, which by Law was his own, in ſuch a preſent and urgent neceſſity, and although his opinion (and it was no more) had been amiſs, he hoped, that though in caſe of Religion, being attended with ſtubbornneſs and pertinacy, it might come home to Hereſie, yet in his caſe opinion could not reach ſo far as Treaſon; unleſs it be Treaſon for a Man to ſpake his Judgment freely, when he is upon his Oath to do the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, For the words about fining, he had already acknowledged in his general Anſwers to be true, but with theſe qualifications, that it was his opinion only, that it was upon the refuſal (as he conceived) of a juſt ſervice, that he had ſpoken them, by no means to prejudice the Citizens, but to make them the more quick and active in the Kings ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no ill conſequence at all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon them; that they were words might have been ſpared indeed, but innocently, though ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, ſpoken; which he hoped might proceed from a Man of ſuch a haſty and incircumſpect hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor as himſelf (made ſo both by nature, and his much infirmity of body) without any mind at all to Treaſen, and that if all Chollerick expreſſions, of that nature, ſhould be accounted treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there would be more ſuits, of that kind, fly up and down <hi>Westminſter-Hall,</hi> then Common-Law.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, To thoſe words atteſted by the Alderman, he poſitively denied rhem, and hoped they ſhould never riſe up againſt him in Judgment, becauſe the Teſtimony was ſingle and not poſitive, but only to his beſt remembrance, and that it was exceeding ſtrange, that not any one man, neither of the Councel or other Aldermen were ſo quick to obſerve them, but only Alderman <hi>Garway,</hi> which he thought ſufficient to nullifie that ſingle Teſtimony, except he could demonſtrate himſelf to have ſome rare and ſingular faculty of hearing.</p>
               <p>In the Cloſe, He deſired the Lords, from his misfortune, to provide for their own ſafety, and ſeriouſly to conſider what a way was chalked out to ruin them both in their Lives and Eſtates, if for every opinion given in Councel, or words ſuddenly or haſtily ſpoken, they (who are born to weild the great affairs of the Kingdom) ſhould be Arraigned and Sentenced as Traytors.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> declared that he ſpake ſomething about the King of <hi>France,</hi> but whether with relation to <hi>England</hi> or not, he did not remember.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Sir <hi>William Parkiſe</hi> atteſted in the ſame words, and withal that the Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> was then preſent, and could declare the whole buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Sir <hi>Ralph Freeman</hi> declared, that in a diſcourſe with the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> he had ſaid that the ſervants in the Mint-houſe would refuſe to work the Copper Money, and he replied, that then it were well to ſend thoſe Servants to the Houſe of Correction.</p>

               <p>Secondly, About the Speeches. He ingeniouſly confeſſed that ſome ſuch thing might perhaps have eſcaped the dore of his lips, when he ſaw their backwardneſs to his Majeſties Service, and as the times were then conditioned he did not think it much amiſs to call that faction by the name of Rebels, but yet he thought he had abundantly ſatisfied for that overſight, (if it was any) at <hi>York</hi>: For having underſtood there that the City of <hi>London</hi> were willing to make a Loan of Money, he there before the great councel of the Peers, expreſſed himſelf to this ſence, that the <hi>Londoners</hi> had ſufficiently made up all their delays hitherto by their Act that the King was oblieged to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, and that he himſelf ſhould be as ready to ſerve them as any poor Gentleman in <hi>England</hi>: About the other words he ſaid, that being in conference with ſome of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> there came at that time to his hands a Letter from the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> then at <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein were the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zets incloſed, reporting that the Cardinal had given ſome ſuch order, as to leavy Money by forces, this he ſaid he only told the Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> ſtanding by without the laſt application or intention con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Engliſh Affairs, <hi>Cottington</hi> being examined upon this, declared the ſame in the ſame manner.</p>

               <p>The Time and Place were deſigned by the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the night before the Meeting a ſmall Number convented, and in a private and factious way, did draw up that Petition upon the morrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at their appointed Diet, in preſence of the whole Number, the Petition was preſented to him, where he did adviſe them to leave out that Clauſe, and that becauſe he knew the King, out of his own Gracious Diſpoſition, had intended to call a Parliament, which he deſired ſhould rather be freely done, than upon the conſtraint and importunity of Petitions; moreover it would ſeem a Mercenary thing in them, at one and the ſame time to offer a Benevolence, and withal to Petition for his Favour: upon this Remonſtrance, they were all willing to recall the Petition, and directed him by word of Mouth, to offer unto the King the Months pay in their Names; which he did accordingly, in the preſence of Forty of them, to their no ſmall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>This he proved by Sir <hi>William Pennyman,</hi> Sir <hi>Paul Neale,</hi> Sir <hi>George Wentworth,</hi> Sir <hi>William Savil,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Danby,</hi> who all of them declared as much in ample terms; and withal added, That nothing was done upon better grounds of Neceſſity and Obedience than the Offer of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the Second, about the Council of Peers, he alledged that he never made mention of any Order of theirs, but he remembred very well it was twice propounded before them, that the King had approved it at that time a juſt and neceſſary Act, and none of the Council had contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted it, which he conceived as a tacit approbation and an Order in Equivalence.</p>
               <p>But though that had not been, yet there was nothing done in the Buſineſs, but at the ſpecial deſires of the Gentlemen themſelves, and for their neceſſary Defence and Protection; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To the Earl of <hi>Argiles</hi> Bounds, he hoped the Gentleman knew they came not on foot out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but had Ships to waſt and tranſport themſelves, and that one of his prime Houſes (<hi>Roſneth</hi>) was within ſome few Miles of the ſame Frith.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Digby</hi> finding Sir <hi>Walter Earles</hi> on ground, did handſomly bring him off, and told the Lords that all their proofs for that Article were not yet ready, and that this was a Superfoeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only of the Charge, and that in ſuch a Buſineſs ac the Plotting of Treaſon, they muſt be content ſometimes with dark Probabilities.</p>

               <p>The Lord Steward replied, That the Lords had appointed four of their Number to go to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and learn the juſt cauſe of his Stay; and if by any means he were able, he ſhould be obliged to come then; if not, Humanity, and common Equity would excuſe him.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>It was anſwered by the Lord Lieutenant, That he thought it ſtood him in hand as neerly to maintain his life, as it did any to purſue him for it, yet he was willing they ſhould bring in new Proofs, provided that he might have time to make new Replies, and withall uſe ſome new Witneſſes in ſome Articles, that concerns his juſtification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Newark,</hi> upon theſe motions deſired the Houſe might be adjourned; after two hours ſtay, and a hot conflict upon the Lords, they returned, and the Lord Steward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Order to be read, which conſiſted of two Articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it was granted unto them to bring in Proofs concerning the two and twentieth Article; ſo it was to the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> to make his replies, and uſe his Witneſſes concerning the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That if they went to no more Articles, no more ſhould the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>; but if they did, that he might pitch upon any one Article as he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of Commons preſently declined all other Articles, and conceived the Order ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly for them, reſtraining him from all other Articles, except that only.</p>
               <p>He conceived the Order was for him, and ſaid, That ſeeing they had pick'd out their Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, it was againſt all common Equity to tye up his hands, and not admit of a common Rule for them both; they replied, That when the Article was canvaſed, they reſerved Witneſſes till another time; he anſwered, That he had done the ſame upon every Article; they replied, That the Houſe had refuſed his Reſervation; he anſwered, Nor had they paſſed an Order for theirs.</p>
               <p>Upon this new Conteſtation the Houſe roſe again, and was adjourned. It is ſuppoſed that the Houſe of Commons had the better ground, becauſe they had particularly named their Witneſſes in their Reſervation, the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> not ſo; they preſſed but one Article, he many. But ſuch was the pleaſure of the Lords, that though the matter did not deſerve to be much ſtood upon, yet after two hours vehement agitation of the buſineſs in the Upper-Houſe, they returned, and the Order was in his favour to this effect.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That both of them ſhould wave their new Proofs, and go immediately to that which follows.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If they would not do ſo, the Lords conceived themſelves common Judges to both, and therefore would not deny <hi>Strafford</hi> the liberty of pitching upon what Article he pleaſed, as they had done.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That both of them ſhould name their Witneſſes at the Bar inſtantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98942:17"/>The Commons were much grieved at this, yet deſired him to nominate his Witneſſes, if he would make any benefit of the Order; he anſwered, That he would nominate after them, becauſe they were firſt in order; they replied, That he knew their Article, they not his, He ſaid, He was to bring Proofs about the ſecond, fifth, thirteenth, and the fifteenth Articles, and did deſire them that they would now proceed to nomination.</p>

               <p>After a great deal of ſtorm all was (as well as might be) ſodered up again, and Tueſday appointed to be the day for the Lieutenant to reſume his Defences, and they their Charge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more proof, to be uſed on either ſide.</p>

               <p>I ſhall proceed in repeating my Defences, as they are reduceable to theſe two main points of Treaſon, and for Treaſon againſt the Statute (which is the only Treaſon in effect) nothing is alleaged for that, but the fifteenth, two and twentieth, and twenty ſeventh Articles.
<q>Here he brought the ſum of all his Replies made to theſe three Articles before, and almoſt in the ſame words as before; only that teſtimony of Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s, becauſe it ſeemed preſſing, he ſtood upon it, and alleaged five Reaſons for the nullifying thereof.</q>

               <p>Fourthly, That at that time the King had levied no Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore he could not be poſſibly ſo impudent as to ſay to the King, that he had an Army there which he might imploy for the reducing this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That he had proved by Witneſſes beyond all exceptions (Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Lord Treaſurer, the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> Sir <hi>William Pennyman,</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Terringham</hi>) that there was never the leaſt intention to land thoſe Forces in <hi>England.</hi> He went on:</p>

               <head>So much for the Articles that concern Individual Treaſon.</head>
               <p>To make up the Conſtructive Treaſon, or Treaſon by way of Accumulation; many Articles are brought againſt me, as if in a heap of Felonies or Miſdemeanors (for in their conceit they reach no higher) ſome prolifical ſeed apt to produce what is treaſonable, could lurk: Here I am charged to have deſigned the ruin and overthrow, both of Religion and State: The firſt ſeemeth rather to have been uſed to make me odious than guilty, for there is not the leaſt Proof alleaged concerning my confederacy with the Popiſh-faction, nor could there be any indeed, never a Servant in Authority beneath the King my Maſter, was ever more hated and maligned by thoſe men than my ſelf, and that for an Impartial and ſtrict executing of the Laws againſt them.</p>
               <p>Here your Lordſhips may obſerve, that the greater number of the Witneſſes uſed againſt me, either from <hi>Ireland</hi> or from <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> were men of that Religion: But for my own Reſolution (I thank God) I am ready every hour of the day to Seal my diſaffection to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with my deareſt Blood.</p>
               <p>But, my Lords, give me leave here to pour forth the grief of my Soul before you, theſe proceedings againſt me ſeem to be exceeding rigorous, and to have more of prejudice than equity, that upon a ſuppoſed Charge of my Hypocriſie or Errors in Religion, I ſhould be made ſo monſtrouſly odious to three Kingdoms; a great many thouſand Eyes have ſeen my Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, whoſe Ears ſhall never hear, that when it came to the upſhot I was never accuſed of them. Is this fair dealing amongſt Chriſtians? But I have loſt nothing by that: Popular applauſe was ever nothing in my conceit, the uprightneſs and integrity of a good Conſcience, was, and ever ſhall be, my continual Feaſt; and if I can be juſtified in your Lordſhips judgments from this grand imputation (as I hope now I am, ſeeing theſe Gentlemen have thrown down the Bucklers) I ſhall account my ſelf juſtified by the whole Kingdom, becauſe by you, who are the Epitomy, the better part, yea the very Soul and Life of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>As for my Deſign againſt the State, I dare plead as much Innocency here, as in matter of my Religion: I have ever admired the wiſdom of our Anceſtors, who have ſo fixed the pillars of this Monarchy, that each of them keep a due proportion and meaſure with other, and have ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly tied up the Nerves and Sinews of the State, that the ſtraining of any one may bring danger and ſorrow to the whole Oeconomy. The Prerogative of the Crown, and the Propriety of the Subject, have ſuch mutual Relations, this takes protection from that, that foundation and nouriſhment from this. And as on the Lute, if any one ſtring be too high or too lowly wound
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98942:18"/>
up, you have loſt the Harmony, ſo here the exceſs of a Prerogative is oppreſſion of pretended Liberty in the Subject, Diſorder, and Anarchy. The Prerogative muſt be uſed as God doth his Omnipotency, upon extraordinary Occaſions; the Laws (anſwerable to that <hi>potentia ligata in Creaturis</hi>) muſt have place at other times: And yet there muſt be a Prerogative, if there muſt be extraordinary occaſions, the Propriety of the Subject is ever to be maintained, if it go in equal pace with this: They are fellows and Companions that have and ever muſt be inſeparable in a well governed Kingdom; and no way ſo fitting, ſo natural to nouriſh and entertain both, as the frequent uſe of Parliaments: By thoſe a commerce and acquaintance is kept, betwixt the King and Subject. Theſe thoughts have gone along with me theſe fourteen years of my public Employments, and ſhall God willing to my Grave: God, His Majeſty, and my own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yea, and all thoſe who have been moſt Acceſſory to my inward thoughts and opinions can bear me witneſs, that I ever did inculcate this; That the happineſs of a Kingdom conſiſts in a juſt poize of the King's Prerogative, and the Subjects Liberty. And that things would never go well, 'till they went hand in hand together.</p>
               <p>I thank God for it, by my Maſter's favour, and the providence of my Anceſtors, I have an Eſtate, which ſo intereſſeth me in the Common-wealth, that I have no great mind to be a Slave, but a Subject; nor could I wiſh the Cards to be ſhuffled over again, upon hopes to fall upon a better Set: Nor did I ever nouriſh ſuch baſe mercenary thoughts, as to become a Pander to the Tyranny and Ambition of the greateſt man living: No, I have and ever ſhall aim at a fair, but a bounded Liberty, remembring always that I am a Free-man, yet a Subject; that I have a Right, but under a Monarch. But it hath been my misfortune now when I am gray-headed, to be Charged by the Miſtakers of the times, who are now ſo highly bent, that all appears to them to be in the extream for Monarchy, which is not for themſelves. Hence it is, that Deſigns, Words, yea Intentions, are brought out for real Demonſtrations for my miſdemeanors, ſuch a multiplying Glaſs is a prejudicate Opinion.</p>
               <p>The Articles contain Expreſſions and Actions: My Expreſſions either in <hi>Ireland</hi> or <hi>England</hi>; my Actions either before or after theſe late ſtirs (in this Order he went through the whole Charge, from the firſt Article to the laſt, in an excellent Method, and repeated all the Sums and Heads of what was ſpoken by him before, only added in the twenty eighth Article) if that one Article had been proved againſt him, it contained more weighty matter than all the Charge beſides: And it had not only been Treaſon in him, but alſo Villany, to have betrayed the truſt of His Majeſty's Army. Yet becauſe the Gentlemen had been ſparing (by reaſon of the times) to inſiſt upon that Article, though it might concern him much, he reſolved to keep the ſame Method, and not utter the leaſt expreſſion that might ſeem to diſturb the happy agreement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, though he wiſhed the ſame might deceive his expectation: Only thus much he admired, how himſelf, being an Incendiary againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> in the twenty third Article, is now become their Confederate in the twenty eighth Article; or how he could be Charged for betraying <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> and for fighting with the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Newbourn</hi> too, ſeeing fighting with them was no poſſible means for betraying the Town, but to hinder their paſſage thither.</p>
               <p>That he never adviſed War farther (than in his poor judgment) concerned the very life of the King's Authority, and the ſafety and honour of his Kingdoms: Nor ſaw he what advantage could be made by a War in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where nothing could be gained but many hard blows: For his part, he honoured the Nation, but he wiſhed they might be ever under their own Climate, and had no deſire they ſhould be too well acquainted with the better Soyl of <hi>England:</hi> But he thought that Article had been added in jeſt, or as a ſupernumerary; and he very little ſuſpected to be reckoned a Confederate with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and wiſhed (as he hoped it was) that every <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man were as free from that imputation as himſelf, [cloſing his Defence with this Speech.]</p>
               <p>My Lords, You ſee what may be alleaged for this Conſtructive, rather Deſtructive Treaſon. For my part, I have not the judgment to conceive, that ſuch a Treaſon is agreeable, either with the fundamental grounds of Reaſon, or Law: not of Reaſon, for how can that be Treaſon in the lump or maſs, which is not ſo in any of the parts? Or how can that make a thing Treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, which in it ſelf is not ſo? Not of Law, ſince neither Statute, Common-Law, nor Practice, hath from the beginning of this Government ever mentioned ſuch a thing; and where, my Lords, hath this Fire, without the leaſt appearance of any Smoak, lien hid ſo many hundred years, and now breaks forth into a violent Flame to deſtroy me and my Poſterity from the Earth? My Lords, do we not live by Laws, and muſt we be puniſhed by Laws before they be made? Far better were it to live by no Laws at all, but to be governed by thoſe Characters of Diſcretion and Virtue, that Nature hath ſtamped in us, than to put this neceſſity of Divination upon a man, and to accuſe him of the breach of Law, before it be a Law at all. If a <hi>Water-man</hi> upon the <hi>Thames</hi> ſplit his Boat by grating upon an Anchor, and the ſame have a Buoy appending
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98942:18"/>
to it, he is to charge his own Inobſervance; but if it hath none, the owner of the Anchor is to pay the loſs.</p>
               <p>Mr Lords, if this Crime which they call Arbitrary Treaſon, had been marked by any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of the Law, the ignorance thereof ſhould be no excuſe for me, but if it be no Law at all, how can it in rigour or ſtrictneſs it ſelf condemn me? Beware you do not awake theſe ſleeping Lyons, by the ſearching out ſome neglected Moth-eaten Records, they may one day tare you and your Poſterity in pieces: It was your Anceſtors care to chain them up within the Barracadoes of Statutes, be not you ambitious to be more skilful and curious than your fore-Fathers in the Art of killing.</p>
               <p>My Lords, it is my preſent misfortune, for ever yours; and it is not the ſmalleſt part of my Grief, that not the Crime of Treaſon, but my other Sins (which are exceeding many) have preſented me before this Bar, and except your Lordſhips wiſdoms provide for it, it may be, the ſhedding of my Blood may make way for the tracing of yours; you, your Eſtates, your Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, lie at the ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe Gentlemen tell me they ſpeak in defence of the Common-wealth, againſt my Arbitrary Laws; give me leave to ſay it, I ſpeak in defence of the Common-wealth, againſt their arbitrary Treaſon, for if this latitude be admitted, what prejudice ſhall follow to King and Country, if you and your Poſterity be by the ſame diſenabled from the greateſt Affairs of the Kingdom; for my poor ſelf, were it not for your Lordſhips intereſt, and the intereſt of a Saint in Heaven, who hath left me here two Pledges on Earth, [At this his breath ſtopt, and he ſhed Tears abundantly in mentioning his Wife, which moved his very Enemies to Compaſſion] I ſhould never take the pains to keep up this Ruinous Cottage of mine, it is loden with ſuch infirmities, that in truth I have no great pleaſure to carry it about with me any longer: Nor could I ever leave it in a better time than this, when I hope the better part of the World would perhaps think, that by this my misfortune I had given a teſtimony of my Integrity to God, my King and Country: I thank God, I count not the afflictions of this preſent life comparable to that Glory, which is to be revealed in the time to come.</p>
               <p>My Lords! my Lords! my Lords! Something more I had to ſay, but my Voice and Spirits fail me, only I do in all humility and ſubmiſſion caſt my ſelf down before your Lordſhips Feet, and deſire that I might be a <hi>Pharos</hi> to keep you from Ship-wrack; do not put ſuch Rocks in your own way, which no prudency, no circumſpection, can eſchew or ſatisfie, but by your utter Ruin; and whether your judgments in my Caſe (I wiſh it were not the Caſe of you all) be either for life or death, it ſhall be righteous in my Eyes, and received with a <hi>Te Deum Laudamus,</hi> (and then he lifted up his Eyes, and ſaid) <hi>In te Domine confido, nè confundar in aeternum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This he ſpake with an inimitable Life and Grace. You have his very Words as near as I can remember, only with ſo much loſs and detriment as hath periſhed by tranſcribing the Copy from his own mouth: But you deſire impartiality, and indeed you have it, and with ſome Grains too of allowance, for I was ſo afraid of my own affection to the Gentleman, that I rather bowed to the other extremity, and therefore have ſet down his defences, rather to his diſadvantage by my rude Pen, than in the native Colour, to his Eternal Glory, and the Confuſion of his Enemies.</p>
               <p>The Repetition of the Charge did not ſpend much time, they proceeded orderly Article by Article, in the very ſame Words and Matter as before, only there were ſome remarkable flaſhes that paſſed from Mr. <hi>Glyn</hi> (who was the man) in the time of their handling.</p>
               <p>He told them that he ſhould repreſent the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> as cunning in his Replies, as he had been crafty in his Actions; that he waved all that was material, and inſiſted only upon the Secondary Proofs, that it was more than evident throughout all his Charge how he had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to bring in an Arbitrary and Tyrannical form of Government over the Lives, Lands, and Liberties, of the King's Subjects, yea had exerciſed a Tyranny over their Conſciences too, by the Oath adminiſtred in <hi>Ireland</hi>; and though his malicious Deſigns had taken no effect, yet no thanks to him, but to the goodneſs of the King, and the vigilancy of the Peers: Had they pleas'd, it had been too late to have puniſhed him, for no Rule of Law had been left whereby to Cenſure him, after the death and expiration of the Laws. And if the Intention of <hi>Guido Faux</hi> might be thought Treaſon, though the Houſe was not blown up, then this Intention of his may admit the ſame cenſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:98942:19"/>He cloſed, that throughout all his Defences he had pretended either Warrants from the King, or elſe the Kings Prerogative, and what was this elſe but to draw up a Cloud, and exhale the Vapour for the eclipſing of the bright Sun, by the Jealouſies, or Repinings of his Subjects; If the ſtrength of his Piety and Juſtice ſhould not diſpel all theſe Miſts, and ſend them down to their Original: That the very ſtanding and falling of theſe three Kingdoms ſtood upon this Proceſs, all of which do conceive their ſafety ſo far intereſſed in his juſt puniſhment, that no ſetling of their peace or quiet could be expected without this: That they hoped the Law ſhould never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him, who had gone about to ſubvert all Law; nor the Nobility (who had the ſame Blood moving in their Veins) by ſubmitting themſelves to his baſe Tyranny, loſe that privilege and liberty, which their Anceſtors had bought with their deareſt Lives. Though there was no Statute for his Treaſon, was it the leſs monſtrous? For there was none for ſo many hundreds of years that durſt ever adventure upon ſuch Inſolencies, to occaſion ſuch a Statute: And were not the fundamental Grounds, Rules, and Government, ſufficient to riſe up in Judgment againſt him, without the making a particular Statute? This he ſaid he left to the diſpute of the Law, and concluded, That ſeeing they had found out the <hi>Jonah,</hi> who theſe many years had toſſed and hazarded the Ship of the Common-wealth, with continual Storms and Tempeſts; there could no calms be expected, but by caſting him out into the Seas; which in all Juſtice they muſt and do expect from their hands, who are intruſted by the body of the Kingdom to do the ſame. The Aggravation of the Offence he ſaid, he had left to Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> who here ſpake that Speech which is now in Print.</p>
               <p>It was a Sport to ſee how Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> in his Speech was fearfully out, and conſtrained to pull out his Papers, and read with a great deal of confuſion and diſorder, before he could recollect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; which failing of his memory was no ſmall advantage to the Lieutenant, becauſe by this means the Houſe perceived it was a premeditated flaſh, not grounded upon the Lieutenant's laſt Anſwer, but reſolved on before, whatſoever he ſhould ſay for his own juſtification; but the Lieutenant was not ſuffered to reply a word, either to <hi>Glyn</hi> or <hi>Pym,</hi> becauſe the laſt word muſt be theirs. And ſo with Tueſday ended the matter of Fact.</p>
               <p>On Thurſday the Diſpute in Law is expected.</p>
               <p>Upon Wedneſday we were big with expectation for the matter of Law, having done before with the matter of Fact; but it ſeems the Houſe of Commons had perceived a great defection of their Party, and a great increaſe of the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Friends in both the Houſes, occaſioned by his inſinuating, honeſt, and witty defences, and therefore they reſolved of no more hearing in public; therefore it was thought upon by his Accuſers to draw up a Bill of Attainder, and preſent the ſame to the Lords, whereby firſt the matter of Fact ſhould be declared to have been ſufficiently proved, and then in the matter of Law that he had incurred the cenſure of Treaſon, for intending to ſubvert the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, for though (ſaid they) he cannot be charged by Letter of Statute of the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, yet he is within the compaſs of the <hi>Salvo,</hi> whereby it is provided, that the King and Parliament hath Power to determin what is Treaſonable, and what not, and that they were confident the Lords would ratifie, and approve of this Bill of theirs, and give Judgment accordingly.</p>
               <p>The motion was ſtoutly oppoſed by three great Lawyers, (all Members of the Houſe) <hi>Selden, Holborn,</hi> and <hi>Bridgeman,</hi> who made it manifeſt, that the <hi>Salvo</hi> of 25 <hi>Edward</hi> 3. was repealed, and that no man could now be convicted of Treaſon, but by the Letter of that Statute: But being put to Voice, it was carried for the Bill, and a Committee appointed for to draw it up.</p>
               <p>This gave occaſion of much talk abroad, and they who were otherwiſe the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Enemies could not find Equity enough in the Bill of Attainder. Some could not conceive what difference imaginable was betwixt the Bill and the Charge preſented before, for in the Charge he was accuſed of Treaſon; and the Bill (though they had no Legiſlative power) ſeemed nothing but an Affirmation of the ſame. Others (who would have the Bill underſtood of a Definitive ſentence, becauſe it was conſecutive to the Proofs) were not ſatisfied, but that it was againſt all practice, that the Commons ſhould give ſentence upon the death of a Peer; and that it was againſt common Equity too, that the Party accuſant ſhould give the Judgment, if the complainers were admitted to be Judges. A third ſort gave it out, that this was no Sentence againſt the Lord <hi>Strafford,</hi> but only a paſſing of a new Act of Parliament, about a matter not hitherto declared Treaſonable; but yet theſe doubted, that by declaring the matter of Fact to be approved, and applying the cenſure to it, in reference to the Lord <hi>Strafford,</hi> it would ever be thought a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt him, to blemiſh his own Fame, and the Blood of his Poſterity. Moreover, that if they were about to make a new Act, it were ſtrange to puniſh a man for the breach of ſuch a Statute as was not yet extant in <hi>Rerum Naturâ,</hi> which ſhould in reaſon refer only to fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98942:19"/>
at all; now there is none can be brought except the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, whereof the Letter of that Statute cannot by their own Confeſſion, nor was not ſo much as once alleaged againſt the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>; and for the <hi>Salvo</hi> or <hi>Proviſo</hi> (which they mainly inſiſted on) the ſame ſtands repealed by two poſterior Acts of Parliament.</p>
               <p>You have the Mutterings of all ſorts of People.</p>
               <p>The Lords fearing the Proceedings, as a beaten Path trodden out to the ruin of their own Lives and Eſtates, told the Houſe of Commons in their Conference upon Thurſday, That they would go on the ſame way they did already, and according to the Order of the Houſe give full Audience to the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Councel in matter of Law, and that they themſelves, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges, would by themſelves only give Sentence in the Cauſe, nor was there any other courſe ſutable to the practice and Statutes of the Kingdom, the Safety of the Nobility, or to Equity, or common Juſtice.</p>
               <p>It was replied by them of the Lower Houſe, That they were reſolved to go on with their Bill, and if the ſame ſhould be rejected by the Lords, they feared a Rupture and Diviſion might follow, to the utter Ruine and Deſolation of the whole Kingdom, that no content would be given to the Subject (and this was a ſtrong Argument indeed, yet better beſeeming Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Violence, than the pretended Juſtice and Piety of the times) unleſs the man, who had ſo much intruded upon their Right, and diſcontented the People, might be puniſhed as a Traytor; and for the practice of the Kingdom, that no man had ever found ſuch a favourable hearing, and that the Proceſs againſt <hi>Eſſex, Norfolk, Somerſet,</hi> were all of them cloſed up in one day.</p>
               <p>Upon Friday the Lords gave Anſwer, That they could expect nothing from the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but what ſhould tend to the Peace and Preſervation of the Kingdom; nor was there a more forceable way than to preſerve the Laws and Cuſtoms thereof, leſt Innovation ſo much complained of by them, might unhappily be found among themſelves: That the Subjects ſhould have all that Juſtice could afford, but that an Act of Injuſtice would never give ſatisfaction to the World, nor ſafety to themſelves; the Eyes of all Foreign States being fixed upon the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs now in agitation, and the wiſdom of our Nation either to be much advanced or depreſſed by their Judgments in this Caſe: That the Proceſs againſt <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> (for <hi>Somerſet</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict only of Felony, and had not ſo much Animadverſion to ſave himſelf by his Book) were for direct and formal Treaſons, compriſed in one or two Individual Acts; but this againſt the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> only Arbitrary and Accumulative, to be pick'd out of Twenty eight Articles. And therefore that it was impoſſible to have a full Examination of them all, to give Sentence againſt him; and thoſe Noble men were charged with ſome Actual breach of Statutes, formerly made; but here a new Statute was to be made, or elſe he to be found guiltleſs. They concluded, that they had given Order for his appearance on Saturday, and that in the Great Hall at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> where the Houſe of Commons might, if they pleaſed, be preſent.</p>
               <p>After ſome deliberation with the Houſe, the Conferrers anſwered, That ſince the Lords had ſo reſolved, they would not deny to be there preſent, and to hear what his Councel could ſay for him, but to reply any more in public, they neither could nor would, becauſe of the Bill already paſt, only if the Lords ſhould take any ſcruple in the matter of Law, they would be ready to give them ſatisfaction by a private Conference, (ſo they willingly declined to do what indeed they could not poſſibly do) that is, to give public ſatisfaction in the matter of Law.</p>
               <p>Upon Saturday they convened in the Great Hall, but they that were of the Committee for the great Charge, did not ſtand at the Bar as before, but ſat promiſcuouſly with the reſt of their Fellows, ſo that a mouth was not opened in the behalf of the Houſe of Commons all that day. After they were ſet, the Lord Steward told the Lieutenant, That the Lords had reſolved to give him a fair hearing in the matter of Law, and therefore deſired that the Councel might keep that diſtance, moderation, and reſpect, to the Judicatory that was fitting, and not at all to meddle with the matter of Fact.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant replied, That in all humility he did acknowledge that favour from the Lords, and that it was ſuch an one too, as he could not but expect from ſuch honourable Peers, and juſt Perſons, in whoſe integrity and goodneſs (under that which he had placed above) he had repoſed his chiefeſt confidence; for his Councel, they knew much better than himſelf what concerned the point of Diſcretion and Reverence, and that he doubted not but that they would give all ſatisfaction and obedience.</p>
               <p>Then his Councel were called to the Bar, Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> the Prince's Attorney; Mr. <hi>Gardiner,</hi> Recorder of <hi>London</hi>; Mr. <hi>Loe,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lightfoot.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> ſpake, and much to this ſence and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:98942:20"/>My Lords, there is an heavy Charge lieth on me and my Fellows, nothing leſs than to defend the Life, the Eſtate, the Reputation, yea the Poſterity of this Honourable Perſon at the Bar; if therefore we ſhall be more preſſing, we hope your Lordſhips will interpret this our forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be for Honour and Conſcience ſake, in a matter that concerneth both ſo nearly: But it ſhall be our endeavour to carry our ſelves with our beſt reſpects to your Lordſhips, and with all content and ſatisfaction to the honourable Houſe of Commons; and becauſe your Lordſhips mentioned the matter of Fact, one thing I dare be bold to ſay, that all the time of this Noble Lord's defences, he did not ſo much as crave any one of our Opinions, yea, or acquainted us with any thing that tended that way: And for the matter of Law, thoſe Statutes cited by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were none of our ſtock, but taken up at his own adventure; nor do I ſpeak this to derogate from the pertinency of thoſe Statutes (for they ſhall be the ſubject of my diſcourſe) but that the Noble-man be not diſappointed of your right Conceptions, and his own due Praiſe.</p>
               <p>My Lords, It is your pleaſure we meddle not with matter of Fact, and indeed we need not meddle at all with it, becauſe we hope it is already done, and that ſufficiently to our hands, yet the matter of Law doth ſo naturally ariſe out of the matter of Fact, that of neceſſity (under your Lordſhips ſavours) we muſt ſomewhat grate on this, if we ſpeak of that, nor do I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it poſſible for us to ſpeak advantagiouſly enough for the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>'s juſt defence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſs the whole matter of Fact be determined, either as proved or not proved, or at leaſt ſome ſtates of Queſtions agreed upon, where we may fix and ſettle our Arguments, and therefore it is, my Lords, that I have choſen not at all to touch the matter of Law (until your Lordſhips ſhall be pleaſed to chalk me out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>way) unleſs it be to clear your judgments in one Statute only, <hi>viz.</hi> 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Becauſe when the ſame was alleaged by the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> in his own Defence, that not being convicted of the Letter thereof, he could not be convicted of Treaſon; I remember the <hi>Salvo</hi> of that Statute was much inſiſted upon by thoſe from the Houſe of Commons, as much conducing to their own ends. My Lords, I will firſt ſpeak of the Statute it ſelf, and then of its <hi>Salvo</hi> or Proviſion: The Statute is, (That if any man ſhall intend the death of the King, his Queen, their Children; kill the Chancellor, or Judge upon the Bench; imbaſe the King's Coyn, or counterfeit the Broad-Seal; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſhall be convicted and puniſhed as a Traytor) that the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> comes within the Letter of this Statute is not ſo much as once alleaged, nor indeed it cannot be with any reaſon; all that can be ſaid is, That by Relation, or by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>à minore ad majus,</hi> he may be drawn thither, yet that this cannot be, I humbly offer theſe Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This is a Declarative Law, and ſuch are not to be taken by way of Conſequence, Equity, or Conſtruction, but by the Letter only, otherwiſe they ſhould imply a contradiction to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and be no more Declarative Laws, but Laws of Conſtruction, or Conſtitutive.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is a Penal Law, and ſuch (if our Grounds hitherto unqueſtioned hold good) can admit of no Conſtructions or Inferences, for Penalties are to perſuade the keeping of known Laws, not of Laws conjectural, ambiguous, and by conſequence, which perhaps the moſt Learned may not in their Diſputes queſtion, much leſs the Subject (who is not obliged to interpret the Statute) doubt of in the point of Obedience, yea rather without any doubt, he is to obey the Letter of the Statute, and conceive, (and that truly) that he is not lyable to the Penalty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We have a notable Law, 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. whereby it is declared, That the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Bulls from <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſtir up the Subject to Mutiny and Rebellion, ſhall be puniſhed as Treaſon: Now if by interpretation, or by conſequence, this ſence might have been thruſt upon the preceding Statutes, the making of this had been ſuperfluous, yea the perſons then charged with that Crime, might have been impeached of Treaſon, even before the making of this Act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 21 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. We have a Statute declaring, That for a Servant to kill his Maſter is an Act of Treaſon, and in the three and twentieth year of the ſame King, a Proceſs of Treaſon was framed againſt a man for killing his Father, grounded upon the ſame Argument <hi>à minori ad majus</hi>: But it was found (and the Sentence is yet in the Records) that although in the one and twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, that Argument might have been admitted, yet in the 27 it could not, by reaſon of the Declarative Law intervening in the 25 year, and this Caſe comes very home to the Point in Law.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I will not demand what kind of Offence it may be, for a man to ſubvert the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws of a Kingdom, the Crime doubtleſs is unnatural and monſtrous, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt keep the ſame proportion, only I preſume to offer theſe few things to your Lordſhips conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That one or more Acts of Injuſtice, whether maliciouſly, or ignorantly done, can in no ſence of Law be called the ſubverſion of the fundamental Laws; if ſo, as many Judges (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) ſo many Traytors. It is very incident to man's Nature to err, nor doth the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> plead his innocency in over-ſights, but in Treaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:98942:20"/>Secondly, I do remember the Caſe of <hi>John de la Poole,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> this man in the twenty eighth of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, was charged by the Houſe of Commons with Articles of Treaſon, and thoſe too very like to theſe againſt my Lord <hi>Strafford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That he had given the King bad advices.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he had embaſed his Coyn.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he had ſeſſed men of War.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That he had given out ſummary Decrees.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That he had Impoſed Taxes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That he had corrupted the Fountain of Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That he had perſuaded the King to unneceſſary War, and to the giving over of <hi>Anjou</hi> in <hi>France, Ovum Ovo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for all theſe, though he was Charged with High Treaſon, for wronging the right of the Subject, and ſubverting the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom; yet after a long Agitation, the matter was found by the Lords of Parliament, not to imply Treaſon, but only Felony. Add to this another, who in the twenty third of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, was charged for ſubverting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, and yet no Treaſon charged upon him. Add to both the Charge of <hi>Richard Larks,</hi> pleaded at the Common-Pleas, who was charged with Treaſon for ſubverting the Law, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed only of Felony, by which you may ſee, my Lords, what to this time hath been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Laws.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is very conſiderable, that the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> is not charged to have ſubverted, but only to have intended to ſubvert the fundamental Laws, and this I conceive, if there were no more, might keep him free from that Statute of the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: For although as touching the King, his Queen, and Children, intention is Treaſonable; yet in all other things there mentioned, there muſt be action beſide intention; for it is not ſaid, if a man do intend to kill a Chancellor, it ſhall be Treaſon, but only if he do kill him; and if he doth actually counterfeit the Broad Seal: And although a man ſhould prepare a Furnace, make ready his Stamp, melt his Bullion, yet if he gives not the King's impreſſion upon the Coyn, all his intentions, yea, his preparations will not ſerve to make up a Treaſon.</p>
               <p>And this (under favour) may ſerve to anſwer the Caſe of <hi>Guido Faux,</hi> lately objected, unleſs it be alleaged, that the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> had as reall an intention againſt the King's Life as <hi>Faux</hi> had: For though the intention in that Caſe be Treaſon by the Statute, yet in all other things there is no Treaſon without the Action, ſo immenſe and vaſt a difference both is, and ought to be, betwixt a project againſt the Royal Blood, and all things elſe of a lower and under Nature.</p>
               <p>You ſee therefore my Lords, that the body of the Statute cannot ſtick againſt the Lord <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> neither in Letter, nor in conſequence, this is not, that muſt not be; all that can be ſaid is, that his Fact may be Treaſon by the Common Law: For my part I profeſs my ignorance, who ever thought the Common Law might declare, but never make a Treaſon, that is, it might be preſuppoſed that there is a Statute whereupon to build a Declaration, and therefore to ſay there is no Statute for it, is to ſay it is no Treaſon at all. The Statute ever makes the Treaſon; and to be declared to be Treaſon, either by Common Law, or by Parliament, are but two different ways of Proceedings, and muſt both reſolve into one Principle, yea, which comes home to the point, in the one and twentieth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, To kill a man imployed in the King's War was Treaſon; and the twenty third, To kill the King's Meſſenger was Treaſon by Declaration of the Common Law, but always by reaſon of the Statute, yet none of theſe are now Treaſons but Felonies only, by reaſon of the intervening Statute the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, ſuch hath ever been thought the force of its Letter and Declaration: And ſo I will leave it, and ſpeak a word or two of the <hi>Salvo,</hi> which is this. That becauſe all particulars could not be then defined, therefore what the Parliament ſhould declare to be Treaſonable in time to come, ſhould be puniſhed as a Treaſon.</p>
               <p>And according to this Reſervation, in the eighth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, one who was charged before the King's Bench, was afterwards referred to the Parliament, and there, though the Fact was not contained in the body of the Statute, yet becauſe of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> afore-mentioned, it was adjudged Treaſon.</p>
               <p>In the eleventh year of the ſame King, the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Nevil</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> were impeached of High-Treaſon by <hi>Glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ceſter, Arundel,</hi> and <hi>Warwick,</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Statute, were convicted thereof by the <hi>Salvo.</hi> But in the one and twentieth of the ſame <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, the Tid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-turned, and the King had ſuch a hand with the Parliament, that the Sentence was recalled, and thoſe three Noble-men themſelves adjudged Traytors. Again in the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth his Succeſſor, that Revocation of the one and twentieth of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond was repealed, and the Sentence of the eleventh of his Reign eſtabliſhed; ſuch were the toſſings too and fro of Treaſon, and all becauſe of that uncertain <hi>Proviſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:98942:21"/>Therefore it was, That in the ſame Parliament the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, a Petition was preferred by the Nobility to have Treaſon limitted with ſome Statute.</p>
               <p>Becauſe they knew not what to ſpeak, or what to do, for fear thereof; and in the tenth Chapter an Act was made upon this Petition, that the <hi>Salvo</hi> ſhould be holden Repealed in all times to come, and nothing eſteemed Treaſon but what was litterally contained in the Statute of the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; and therefore it is ſaid in the Records, That there was great joy at the making of this Act, in that the drawn Sword hanging over every man's head, by this ſlender Thred of a conſequence, or illation, was moved by that Act. Add to this, that in the firſt of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the firſt Chapter, the ſame is repeated, That no man ſhall be puniſhed in Life or Eſtate as a Traytor, but for the Crime contained in the Statute, 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. without the leaſt mention of a pretended <hi>Salvo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s Caſe comes nigh to the Point, he was charged with Treaſon, the fifth of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth; and if the Statute of the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the firſt Chapter, whereby this <hi>Proviſo</hi> is Repealed, had not intervened, no doubt he had been condemned of Treaſon, but he was only convict of Felony, and that becauſe he could not be drawn within the Letter of the Statute of the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and I dare confidently ſay it, that ſince that Act was made, the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the firſt Chapter, whereby the <hi>Proviſo</hi> is Repealed, no man hath ever been declared a Traytor, either by King or Parliament, except it were upon that or ſome other Statute, litterally, and declaratively taken. Theſe two things I do offer to your Lordſhips conſiderations. That the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> cannot be impeached of Treaſon, by the Statute of the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and that the <hi>Salvo</hi> contained in the ſame ſtands Repealed almoſt two hundred years ago, and this is all I conceive to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for that Statute which was alleaged by the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> in his Defence for matter of Fact.</p>
               <p>Then the Recorder ſpake ſome few Words to this purpoſe, That what was ſpoken upon the Statute,<note place="margin">The Recorder.</note> was becauſe it ſeemed inſeparable from the matter of Fact, that they could proceed no farther, 'till a State were afforded them, that to do otherwiſe they conceived might be very prejudicial unto my Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>:</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that they ſhould ſuppoſe that to be done, which is not proved to be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the matter of Law ariſeth ſo naturally from the matter of Fact, that it will be impoſſible to ſeparate one from the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That it is the courſe of all Judicatories, firſt to ſettle the Verdict, and upon that to fix the Arguments, otherwiſe he could conceive no poſſible way of proceeding; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Name he moſt humbly entreated, that the Lords would either wholly determine the matter of Fact (or whether Treaſon or not; for then all other proceedings in the Law were unneceſſary, but whether done or not done) or elſe to give them ſome States of the queſtion whereunto they might confine themſelves.</p>
               <p>Upon this motion the Houſe was adjourned for that day, nor hath it met ſince, for the Houſe of Commons are turned to their old byas, and will hear of nothing but the Bill of Attainder, but the Lords ſeem to be more reſolute than before, becauſe they find that they have no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to declare a Treaſon in a Fact already paſt, the <hi>Salvo</hi> of the twenty fifth of <hi>Edward</hi> the third being Repealed, withall that if the Bill of Attainder ſhould proceed, the King hath as great power to hinder that at the laſt blow as any other Statute, but I hope the Lords will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen him of that envy.</p>
               <p>All the which ſtand obliged to the Lord <hi>Strafford,</hi> in blood, affection, or deſerving, and all who have been intereſſed with him in the King's Service, and many too, who both hate his perſon, and diſlike his proceedings, will doubtleſs look upon it, and tender their own ſafety, all of them in likelihood being ſubject to the Charge of Treaſon, if ever they chance to be called to do the King Service in any place of importance.</p>
               <p>I cannot expreſs how much the voice of the multitude is now altered from what it was lately, nothing now talked of what ſhould be done, but only of what muſt be done: So that if the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> dyes, his very Enemies will confeſs that it is done more for neceſſity than for Justice, and rather for the ſatisfaction of rancorous apprehenſions, than for any guiltineſs in the Cauſe.</p>

               <p>The Lords did meet at the Great Hall at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> about Nine of the Clock, not in their Robes, nor did the Lord <hi>Steward</hi> ſit upon his Sack, but with the reſt promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,<note place="margin">The formality of a conference.</note> nor did the Committee for the Houſe of Commons ſtand at the Bar, but ſat with the reſt of their Fellows, and the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> ſat behind the place where he uſed to ſit before; the reaſon of theſe changes were, becauſe the Diet was appointed, not for a Meeting but for a Conference, ſo curious are we (and that's all) about formalities:

The King, Queen, and Prince were there, according to their Cuſtom, not a man ſpake a word in the Houſe all the time, but only Mr. <hi>St. John,</hi> the King's Sollicitor, one of the Committee, whoſe drift and purpoſe was to furniſh the Lords with reaſons, why the Houſe of Commons had proceeded with a Bill of Attaindor: And withal, to reply to what the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> had ſpoken, either by himſelf, or his Council, in matter of Law.</p>

And theſe thoughts produced the late tumults of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> of which more by and by. And it is verily thought, that for theſe two Reaſons, the Lieutenants ſeeming Friends, but indeed real Enemies, have put the King upon this way, hoping thereby, that the Lords ſhould find occaſion to pretend neceſſity of doing that, which perhaps, in regard of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon equity, or the King's diſpleaſure, they could, nor durſt have done; howſoever <hi>Facta eſt alia,</hi> the King is now ſo far ingaged, that with reſpect to Honour and Conſcience, he cannot retire; for if the Procedure be by a Legiſlative Power, it falls directly upon him, nor can he give his aſſent; if by a Judiciary, then muſt he either hinder the Execution, or be ſaid to have Charged himſelf with Injuſtice.</p>
               <p>This hath produced ſtrange alterations, even the Marriage of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (done on <hi>Sunday</hi> laſt, <hi>May</hi> the Second, with ordinary Solemnity) is now exceeding hateful to the Commons, which ſo much before deſired it; ſome ſay, the Precipitation of that Marriage Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports no good; others, that the Parliament had condeſcended to that Marriage, but did not expect that Acceleration; a third ſort, that the Party is mean enough, if not too low for the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Eldeſt Daughter; all of them, that the <hi>Dutch-men</hi> have offered Money to the King for a new Service of War, and have thereby bought this Honour; this is increaſed by the Landing of a <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> who is to be Gentleman of the Kings Horſe; And ſhortly with us the <hi>Hollander</hi> will be no leſs odious than the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Oh, the wonderful changes of the unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, unconſtant, and giddy multitude!

amongſt them, and with a great deal of pains, perſuaded them to retire home, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards entred into the Ambaſſador's Houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at his coming in, the Ambaſſador deſired him to pull down his Sword which was carried before him, becauſe he was now where the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had Juriſdiction. That being done, he told the Lord Mayor, that in all his life time he had never ſeen ſuch a barbarous attempt, and deſired to know whether <hi>England</hi> was a civil Nation or no, where the Law of Nations was ſo monſtrouſly violated. The Mayor replied, That they were of the baſe and raſcally ſort of People, and intreated the Tumult might not be imputed to the Town. The Ambaſſador anſwered, That he could hardly acknowledge that to be a Town, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Ambaſſador replied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador had the free Exerciſe of his Religion at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and that he would rather forgo his life, than any of thoſe Privileges due to him by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>action, and the Law of Nations. The Mayor anſwered, They were the more incenſed againſt him, becauſe the <hi>Londoners</hi> popiſhly affected, were permitted to come into his houſe to Maſs, which was beyond both Law and Cuſtom. The Ambaſſador replied, That if the Mayor would keep them without doors, he would promiſe to ſend for none of them; but if they came once within his doors, he could not in preſervation of his Conſcience, or his Maſter's Honour, deny them either acceſs to his Religion, or ſafeguard to their Perſons, as far as in him lay. Upon this a Guard was appointed to attend the Ambaſſador's houſe, whether to keep out Papiſts, or to preſerve them that were within, or to let in others, is yet to be diſputed.</p>
               <p>The ſtorm was quiet from thence 'till Monday, when the people being inflamed again by the King's Speech, came to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with the number of five or ſix thouſand, having Weapons and Battoons in their hands; at the entring of every Coach ſome cried Juſtice; others Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a third man told his Fellows that both were to be conjoyned, and that Juſtice and Execution was the noble Word; upon which <hi>(quaſi dato-ſigno)</hi> all the Rabble cried aloud with one voice Juſtice and Execution, with a wonderful ſtrange noiſe. Some went to the Coach ſide and told the Lords, that they muſt and would have Juſtice done upon the Deputy. In particular, above 1000 of them beſet the Lord Steward's Coach, and demanded Juſtice and Execution of him; Juſtice, ſaid they, we have gotten already, and we only deſire (and muſt have it) Execution. The Lord Steward replied, they ſhould have Juſtice and Execution, and deſired them only to forbear, and have patience a while: No, ſaid they, we have had too much patience, we will not ſuffer longer, and therefore, my Lord, before you go from us you muſt grant us Execution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Lord Steward told them, he was going to the Houſe to that effect, and that they ſhould have all content. But whilſt they were about to detain him longer, ſome of the greateſt Power amongſt them ſaid, We will take his word for once, and with difficulty enough made paſſage for him.</p>
               <p>The Lords ſtayed within 'till twelve of the Clock, nor was there any courſe taken in the mean time for diſſolving of the multitude; the greateſt part of them went home the back way by Water, only when the Lord <hi>Holland,</hi> Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> came out to their Coach, all of them called Juſtice and Execution; but when they perceived that <hi>Briſtol</hi> was in the Coach, they drew near the Coach ſide, and told him, For you my Lord <hi>Briſtol,</hi> we know you are an Apoſtate from the Cauſe of Chriſt, and our mortal Enemy, we do not therefore crave Juſtice from you, but ſhall (God willing) crave Juſtice upon you, and your falſe Son the Lord <hi>Digby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let a man caſt his Eyes back now but for ſome few Months paſt, and he ſhall ſee what truſt may be repoſed in the favour of the giddy multitude, unleſs a man ſhall reſolve to quit all Religion and Honeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to mould and faſhion his Conſcience to the preſent diſtemper and fancy of the people, neither can he do ſo ſafely, when ſo much hazard lies in the Inconſtancy of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
               <p>After this they drew up all the Names of thoſe, either in the Houſe of Commons, or the Houſe of Lords, whom they imagined to favour the Lieutenant, and gave them the Title of <hi>Straffordians,</hi> with this cloſe, That all thoſe, and all other Enemies to the Common-wealth, ſhould periſh with him; and did poſt up the Paper at the Gate of <hi>Westminſter,</hi> as if the old Democracy of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Tribunitial Power thereof in <hi>Cippo proſcribere,</hi> were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and revived.</p>

And it is likely this will be the Iſſue of the buſineſs, leſt this zeale ſhould be quenched in the breeding and beginning, whoſe ſurcharge and exceſs is laudable, yea neceſſary, in a time of Reformation.

               <p>Firſt, Some think it ſtrange that ſeeing the Houſe of Commons have lately fined the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation Houſe, upon this ground eſpecially, that they enjoyned an oath, which is a Legiſlative power (ſay they) and only due to Parliaments, how they at this time, (as if all the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power were in them) without the advice of the Lords (I ſay not of the Church, though in matters Eccleſiaſtical) or approbation of the King (which is conceived to be a mighty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon his Prerogative) ſhould offer either to preſcribe, or ſubſcribe ſuch an Oath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if it were eſſential to our Reformation, ever to be done by the people, without Authority of the Superiour Powers, and yet before it paſs into a Statute it muſt come in by a Bill <hi>

               <p>Secondly, That the Houſe of Commons were four hours pleading, upon that one expreſſion in the Proteſtation, [<hi>The true reformed Religion expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of England.</hi>] Some who were more tender toward the Church, and deſiring that the word Diſcipline, might be adjoyned to the word Doctrine, but others mainly oppoſed that, reaſoning that no Diſcipline could be admitted, but all to be eſteemed as Popiſh that was not conteined in the Doctrine, that is in the word of God, which party at the laſt did prevail, though the other affirmed, that there was more expreſs warrant in the word of God for Biſhops, than for ruling Elders; but if ſome Hint be not there intended againſt the Deans and Chapters, the Lyturgies, and Ceremonies, yea the very Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> let any man judge; and of what dangerous conſequence that may be, if thoſe who pretend to have authority in all Church Affaires may be permitted to give Sentence, is not difficult to determin.</p>

The Oath was likewiſe preſented to the Lords, and ſome ſay all of them (except the eight Recuſant Lords, and four of the Biſhops) have ſigned the ſame, but others ſay they have only admitted the Bill, which is more likely.

               <p>In the afternoon the Houſe of Commons deſired acceſs to the King in the Banqueting Houſe, and having ſtayed there an hour for his coming, in three words they propounded theſe two great Bills, deſiring that he would give his Royal Aſſent to them both <hi>(Quod ſi non proſint ſingula, Juncta Jubant)</hi> Withall humbly ſhewing that the preſent danger of the Kingdom could admit of no delayes. The King told them they ſhould expect an anſwer on <hi>Monday</hi> Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The Court at this time was ſurcharged with a confluence of People, <hi>quaſi Civitas tota ſedibus ſuis mota,</hi> as if the whole City was come to petition for Juſtice, a Government indeed worſe than a Democracy, where the people do not rule but play the Tyrants: If there were no Monarchy there needs no conſcience to obey it; But where it is, and cannot protect it ſelf, the good ſubject muſt either forget himſelf, or his loyalty; A two edged ſword killing either the body or the ſoul, nor in this are men in better caſe than the winged Fiſhes, that our Southern Mariners tell us of, which, if they ſwim beneath the water are catch'd by Dolphins, if they fly above for refuge, ſnatch'd away by the hungry Ravenous ſouls, (Lord help then the times, or help our patience, and Reſolutions, give us either redreſs in thee, or confidence in thee.)</p>
               <p>The wiſer ſort conceived theſe two Bills too big for them to deſire at once, and that both of them together might procure a flat denial, but the more couragious knew the readier way by far, having often had experience of his Majeſties readineſs to grant juſt deſires; reſolving that he that expects to loſe the day, is beaten at his own diffidence, and it is the quality of ſome men to ſwallow Camels upon a ſudden, who (if you give them leiſure) will perchance ſtrain at a Gnat.

                  <note place="margin">Four Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</note>Four Biſhops were ſent for by the King, the Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Durham, Lincoln</hi> and <hi>Carlile</hi>: Some ſay (and I do rather believe it) that the King was deſirous the Bill ſhould be voiced again, and argued, the Biſhops had their ſuffrages in the admiſſion though not in the approbation of the Bill, others think in regard the Primate was there, (who had no Intereſt in this Kingdom) it was to reſolve the Kings Conſcience; for my part I ſee not how they ſhould do this, ſeeing the buſineſs was grounded upon a caſe in

Law, which none of them (unleſs the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> had learned when he was Lord Keeper) could poſſibly diſcuſs; for if the King was tender in it, how could they perſuade him to give way, if not, what needed their Reſolution?</p>
               <p>But it may be that they perſuaded him, that in conſcience he might prefer the Opinion of the Judges before his own, and that if (though with ſome reluctation) they thought upon their Oaths, the Proceedings to be lawful, he might give way to them. This is not unlikely, becauſe the Judges were ſent for the ſame time, and it ſeems, for the ſame Service; and if it be ſo, I admire (and adore too) the wonderful providence of God, who in his preparatory Act, to this unlawful Judgment (which undoubtedly will follow) ſuffers not only the King and the Country, but the Church too, (as if her Cup were not yet full) to be involved.</p>
               <p>But could this be to the matter of Fact, the King I am ſure knew him to be free from any the leaſt intention of ſubverting the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and could the Biſhops ſatisfie this ſcruple too, it may be they are perſuaded, that the Proofs might be taken Implicitly from the Houſe of Commons, as the Law from the Judges: It is reported indeed that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the King with many Tears to give way, and that to prevent the ruin of the Kingdom, which theſe Stateſmen (who will be ever content with the longeſt life for themſelves, 'till by piece-meal they be thruſt from all) did ſee would neceſſarily follow. Well, I dare Propheſie to them they ſhall not want their Reward, neither from the King nor People, for the next tumult of people ſhall be againſt their Liturgies, Surplices, and Church-Ornaments. And ſeeing they have now over-perſuaded the King in this, if they can procure him, then to protect themſelves from thoſe imminent dangers which hang over their heads, they ſhall do a miracle. <hi>Sed quos perdere vult Jupiter, dementat.</hi> Some body elſe will perſuade the King that to ſatisfie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, and to prevent the Ruin of the Kingdom, Biſhopricks, Deans, Prebends, and all Cathedrals muſt down, <hi>Sed omen avertat Deus optimus.</hi>

It is Power, Faction, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that are the managers of human Affairs, and ſways the times.

upon hot burning Bricks, ſo deſtroying the Optick Nerves, as thinking themſelves unworthy ever afterwards to look upon any worldly Object; I leave your ſelf Sir to make the application, I dare ingeniouſly ſay it, that all my ſufferings to this time (and I have not been without a round ſhare of them) did never touch me ſo nearly, as the ſufferings of Juſtice, Religion, and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, by this one Fact: Not for any evil conſequence to me (God knows) I am beneath the reach of Fortune, and can eaſily change my Climate; but for that Cloud which hangeth over the public, and will not, I fear, be diſſolved till the meaſures of deſervings be made up brim full.</p>
               <p>What turbulency, what confuſion is within me, you may eaſily gueſs by theſe Symptomes that are without, thoſe raw and indigeſted expreſſions, it is my dayly labour to obtain the Maſtery of my ſelf and my affections, but upon ſuch extraordinary times and occaſions, they grow too ſtrong for me; I muſt give way and retire before I get new ſtrength again: Hence it is, that though at the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>'s laſt departure out of this World, I might have been aſſured of his Mantle, that is, the doubling of his Perfections upon me, and of a capacity to admit of the leaſt of them, yet I could not have attended his Execution; my heart was too weak, and my Eyes too blind to behold ſuch a woful ſpectacle; but be you aſſured he will not dye like one of the vulgar, nor like one of thoſe wanton Courſers who can ruſh fiercely into the Battel, yet withall ſtart at his own ſhadow: He hath done, and can do, greater things than dye, and that too without any in-decorum. As he hath lived for the real Demonſtration of his ſervice and fidelity, ſo he can dye for the pretended ſafety of his Soveraign, and that in a ſtrange way too, as if the head could not be ſafe, but by cutting off the right hand.</p>
               <p>Sir, your deſires have obliged me to unty my Wounds, yet ſcarce bound up, and by reflection upon that ſad object, to fall a bleeding again; nor can I grant your ſuit to make that great Lord ſpeak in his own dialect. <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s tranſmutation could not have found out a fit lodging for that noble Soul, nor doth nature give us wonders every day, nor ſtrain her ſelf ambitiouſly to ſhew forth the utmoſt reach of her perfections or Maſter-piece, and to preſent us with ſuch a rare conjunction of ſuch a courage, attended with loyalty to danger; wiſdom accompanied with eloquence to admiration. What could not that man think? What think and not ſpeak? What ſpeak and not do? But I will not be too Rhetorical, that Speech, or rather Blemiſh, printed and pretended to be ſpoken by him in the <hi>Tower,</hi> is as like him as he was to a Pedant, his Soul now laughs (if that natural ſence could reach ſo high) at that poor injury, it doth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly well become the Charity of the times, not only to perturb his reſt, but alſo by belying his Expreſſions, to make his own hands the Scatterers of his own duſt, and his own Tongue the Trumpet of his own infamy: That Speech is a foiſt and a lye. His other Speech on the Scaffold, and with it, his Letter to the King, you ſhall find at the end of this Letter, in the beſt way we could get it, ſomething of his greatneſs appears in his phraſe, and as much life too as could by ſnatches be gathered from his mouth, yet it comes far ſhort of that Grace which it had when it was delivered by himſelf, what by the eſcapes of the Obſervers, what by the Faint-heartedneſs of the Preſs, which durſt not ſpeak freely, for fear of Arbitrary Treaſon.</p>
               <p>Two obſervable Expreſſions I had from an underſtanding Auditor.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Sir <hi>George Wentworth</hi> weeping extreamly upon the Scaffold, was thus checked by him: Brother, what do you ſee in me that deſerves theſe Tears? Doth my fear betray my guiltineſs? Or my too much boldneſs any Atheiſm? Think now (and this is the third time) that you do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me to my Marriage Bed: Nor did I ever throw off my Clothes with ſuch freedom and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as in this my preparrtion to my Grave. That Stock [pointing to the Block appointed for his Execution] muſt be my Pillow, here muſt I reſt, and reſt from all my labours; no thoughts of Envy, no dreams of Treaſon, jealouſies of Foes, cares for the King, the State or my ſelf, ſhall interrupt this nap; therefore Brother, with me, pity mine Enemies, who beſide their intention have made me bleſſed; rejoyce in my Innocency, rejoyce in my happineſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Kneeling down upon the Scaffold he made this Proteſtation; I hope, Gentlemen, you do think that neither fear of loſs, nor love to Reputation, will cauſe me to bely God and my own Conſcience, for now I am in the door going out, and my next ſtep muſt be from Time to Eternity, either of Peace or Pain; to clear my ſelf to you all, I do ſolemnly proteſt before God, I am not guilty (ſo far as I can underſtand) of that great Crime laid to my Charge, nor have ever had the leaſt inclination or intention to damnifie or prejudice the King, the State, the Laws, or Religion of this Kingdom, but with my beſt endeavours to ſerve all, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port all [<hi>So might God be merciful to his Soul.</hi>] His words did juſtifie him more there than in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, and made ſuch a deep impreſſion in the hearers, that a great many of thoſe who cryed out for Juſtice againſt him (after their fury was ſpent, and their madneſs ſtrewed with cold Blood) wiſhed their Tongues had been cut out of their heads, before they had opened their mouths againſt him; others moſt ignobly imputed this to his effronted boldneſs, and are ſo perſuaded of their own infallibility, that they marvelled he believed not his Actions to be Errors
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98942:25"/>

               <p>His Countenance was in a middle poſture, betwixt Dejection and Boldneſs, a man may call it even Courage and Innocence it ſelf, without any fear of Criticks; nor could his very Enemies, through their multiplying Glaſſes, perceive the leaſt affectation of diſguiſe in him; never man looked Death, more ſtately, in the Face; never man trembled more at his Sins, ſuch were his Contritions for his Overſights, and ſuch his immovable confidence of Gods Pardon and his Mercy.</p>
               <p>His Prayer raviſhed all the ſtanders by, that they could not judge whether to prefer his Zeal, or his Penitency; yea, the Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> (who is no complementer) reported afterwards to the King, that he had then firſt learned to make ſupplications aright to God-ward; and withal, told His Majeſty, That he had ſeen many die, but never ſuch a white Soul (this was his own expreſſion) return to its Maker; At which Words, the King was pleaſed to turn himſelf about, and offer a Tear to his Memory.

               <p>And becauſe miſ-report, about him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and my Lords-Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> hath wandred as far as <hi>Cambridge,</hi> give me leave to add the Story of that miſtake. It was reported here by the divulgers of ſuch ſlanders, that a little before his death, he had charged all his Misfortunes, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights, and Miſdemeanors, upon the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as the prime Author, and had bitterly curſt the Day of their firſt Acquaintance: A pretty Invention it was, to charge the Axe again, and to furniſh the People with lungs and voices to cry for another Sacrifice; yea, to ſtain this Martyrs long white Robe, with the Innocent blood of another. <hi>Heroe. O ye ſons of men! How long will ye love vanity, and ſeek after leaſing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this cauſe, I was the more Inquiſitive to learn out the Truth of this particular, and had it thus related to me by a worthy Divine, Doctor <hi>Wimberly,</hi> who dining with my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the day after the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Execution, had it from his own mouth. And my Lords-Grace, it ſeems, having heard of the miſtake, did at every period take the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> then preſent, his Atteſtation and Approbation.</p>
               <p>That the Lord <hi>Strafford,</hi> the Night before the Execution, had ſent for the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and asked him whether it were poſſible he might ſpeak with the Arch-Biſhop; the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant told him he might not do it, without order from the Parliament. Mr. Lieutenant, ſaid he, you ſhall here what paſſeth betwixt us; it is not a time now, either for him to plot Hereſie, or me to plot Treaſon: The Lieutenant anſwered, That he was limited, and therefore deſired his Lordſhip would Petition the Parliament for that favour; No (ſaid he) I have gotten my diſpatch from them, and will trouble them no more; I am now petitioning an higher Court, where neither partiality can be expected, nor error feared: But my Lord, (ſaid he) turning to the Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> then preſent, what I ſhould have ſpoken to my Lords-Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> you ſhall deſire the Arch-Biſhop to lend me his Prayers this Night, and to give me his Bleſſing when I do go abroad to Morrow, and to be in his Window, that by my laſt farewel, I may give him thanks for this, and all other his former favours.</p>
               <p>The Primate, having delivered the Meſſage without delay, the Arch-Biſhop replyed, That in conſcience, he was bound to the firſt, and in duty and obligation to the ſecond, but he feared his weakneſs and paſſion would not lend him Eyes to behold his departure.</p>
               <p>The next Morning, at his coming forth, he drew near to the Arch-Biſhops lodgings, and ſaid to the Lieutenant, Though I do not ſee the Arch-Biſhop, yet give me leave, I pray you, to do my laſt obſervance toward his rooms; in the mean time, the Arch-Biſhop, advertized of his approach, came out to the Window; then the Earl bowing himſelf to the Ground, my Lord, ſaid he, Your Prayers, and your Bleſſing, The Arch-Biſhop lift up his hands, and beſtowed both, but overcome with grief, fell to the Ground <hi>in Animi Deliquio.</hi> The Earl proceeding a little farther, bowed the ſecond time, ſaying, Farwel, my Lord; God protect your Innocency.</p>
               <p>To this relation, the Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> added, that it might perhaps ſeem an effeminacy, and ſoftneſs unbecoming him, to be ſo caſt down, but he hoped, by God's Aſſiſtance, and his own Innocence, that when he came to his own Execution (which he daily longed for) that the World ſhould perceive he had been more ſencible of the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi>'s loſs, than of his own; and good reaſon it ſhould be ſo (ſaid he) for the Gentleman was more ſerviceable to the Church (he would not mention the State) than either himſelf, or any of all the Church-men had ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And that there may be a ſlaughter-Goat for the Sins of the People in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to wait upon this report, they have fained another of the ſame Meal; that the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:98942:26"/>
caſts back all his miſdemeanors upon the Biſhop of <hi>Roſs,</hi> as if either the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> had been tutored by the Arch-Biſhop, or he by the Biſhop of <hi>Roſs,</hi> in the King and Countrys Service; I did not think that both of them had paſt their pupilage, and could not have been bended to execute the directions of any man living, but only their own Maſters; but this is a fair advertiſement to the Biſhop of <hi>Roſs,</hi> to make himſelf the ſcape-Goat.

               <p>Give me leave to adjoin one thing more; When he was marched to the Scaffold, more like the General in the head of an Army, to breath Victory, than like a condemned man, to undergo the Sentence of Death; the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> deſired him to take Coach, for fear the People ſhould ruſh in upon him and tear him in pieces; No, (ſaid he) Maſter Lieutenant, I dare look death in the Face, and I hope the People too; Have you a care that I do not eſcape, and I care not how I dye, whether by the hand of the Executioner, or the madneſs and fury of the People. If that may give them better content, it is all one to me.</p>
               <p>It is but diminutive to call it a wonder, it is ſomething above, that his thoughts and expreſſions ſhould be ſo preſent with him; no more putrifaction in them, than if he had been about ſome ordinary buſineſs: His Alacrity, his Devotion did amaze; yea, tear in pieces the hearts of all thoſe about him, who had the leaſt Grace or Humanity in them.</p>
               <p>Too much Perfection indeed to be loſt at one blow; but this Age was not worthy of it, nor ſhall any after Age, I think, ever enjoy the like, that only which is poſſible is the object of the Will, and therefore I will not endeavour to find out words for expreſſing this wonder of the Times; only I leave his virtues to ſpeak the reſt, to the <hi>Admiration of Ours, and Compaſſion of ſucceeding Ages.</hi>

                           </head>
                           <p>IT hath been my greateſt grief in all my troubles, to be taken as a perſon that ſhould endeavour to preſent and ſet things amiſs between Your Majeſty and Your People, and to have given Councel tending to the diſquiet of Your Majeſty, and Your three Kingdoms.</p>
                           <p>Moſt true it is, that ſuch an attempt (my private condition conſidered) had been a great madneſs, ſeeing through your gracious favour I was ſo provided, as I could not expect in any kind to mend my Fortune, or to pleaſe my mind, more than by reſting where your bounteous hand had placed me; nay, the buſineſs is moſt mightily miſtaken, for unto your Majeſty it is well known, that my poor and humble advices concluded ſtill in this, That your Majeſty ſhould never be happy, 'till there were a right underſtanding procured betwixt you and them: No other means to effect and ſettle this happineſs, but by the Councel and Aſſent of the Parliament; and no way to prevent the growing Evils of this State, but by putting your ſelf entirely upon the Loyalty and good Affection of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                           <p>Yet (ſuch is my misfortune) the truth finds little credit, the contrary (it ſeems) generally believed, and my ſelf reputed the cauſe of this great ſeparation betwixt you and your People: Under a heavier Cenſure than this I am perſuaded no Gentleman can ſuffer, and now I underſtand that the minds of Men are the more incenſed againſt me, notwithſtanding your Majeſty hath declared, That in your Princely Opinion I am not guilty of Treaſon, nor are you ſatisfied in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to paſs the Bill: This brings me into a great ſtreight. Here is before me the ruin of my Children and Family, hitherto untouch'd in all the branches of it with any foul Crime. Here are before me the many Evils which may befall your Sacred Perſon, and the whole Kingdom, ſhould your ſelf and the Parliament be leſs ſatisfied the one with the other than is neceſſary for the King and People. Here are before me the things moſt valued, moſt feared by mortal Men [Life and Death:] To ſay, Sir, there hath not been a conflict within me about theſe things, were to make my ſelf leſs Man than (God knows) my infirmities will give me leave, and to call a deſtruction upon my ſelf, and my young Children, where the intentions (at leaſt) of my heart, have been innocent of this great Offence (may be believed) would find no eaſie conſent from Fleſh and Blood.</p>
                           <p>But, out of much ſadneſs, I am come to a Reſolution of that which I take to be beſt becoming me, that is, To look upon that which is principally to be conſidered in it ſelf, and that is doubtleſs the proſperity of your ſacred Perſon and the Common-wealth, infinitely to be preferred before any Man's private Intereſt: And therefore in few words, as I have put my ſelf wholly upon the Honour and Juſtice of my Peers; ſo clearly as I wiſh your Majeſty hath been pleaſed to have ſpared that Declaration of yours on Saturday laſt, and to have left me entirely to their Lordſhips; ſo now (to ſet your Majeſty's Conſcience at Liberty) I do moſt humbly beſeech You, for the preventing of ſuch miſchiefs as may happen by your refuſal, to paſs the Bill; by this means to remove (praiſed be God I cannot ſay this accurſed, but I confeſs) this unfortunate thing forth of the way towards that bleſſed Agreement, which God, I truſt, ſhall for ever Eſtabliſh betwixt you and your Subjects. Sir, my conſent herein ſhall acquit you more to God, than all the World can do beſide. To a willing Man there is no injury done, and as by God's Grace I forgive all the World; with a calmneſs and meekneſs of infinite contentment to my diſlodging Soul, ſo, Sir, I can give the life of this World with all chearfulneſs imaginable, in the juſt acknowledgment of your exceeding

favours, and only beg, that in your goodneſs, you would vouchſafe to caſt your gracious Regard upon my poor Son and his three Siſters, leſs or more, and no otherwiſe, than their unfortunate Father ſhall appear more or leſs guilty of this Death. <hi>God preſerve your Majeſty.</hi>

                  <hi>My Lord Primate of</hi> Ireland,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is my great comfort that I have your Lordſhip by me this day, in regard I have been known to you theſe many years, and I do thank God and your Lordſhip for it that you are here, I ſhould be very glad to obtain ſo much ſilence as to be heard a few words, but I doubt I ſhall not, the noiſe is ſo great. My Lords, I am come hither by the good will and pleaſure of Almighty God, to pay that laſt Debt I owe to Sin, which is Death; and by the bleſſing of that God, to riſe again through the Merits of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to Righteouſneſs, and Life Eternal. [Here he was a little interrupted.]</p>
            <p>Mr Lords, I am come hither to ſubmit to that Judgment which hath paſſed againſt me, I do it with a very quiet and contented mind; I thank God, I do freely forgive all the World, a forgiveneſs that is not ſpoken from the Teeth outward, (as they ſay) but from the very Heart: I ſpeak it in the preſence of Almighty God, before whom I ſtand, that there is not a diſpleaſing thought ariſing in me towards any man living. I thank God I can ſay it, and truly too, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bearing me witneſs, that in all my Imployment ſince I had the Honour to ſerve His Majeſty, I never had any thing in the purpoſe of my heart, but what tended to the joint and individual proſperity of King and People, although it hath been my ill fortune to be miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued.</p>
            <p>I am not the firſt that hath ſuffered in this kind, it is the common Portion of us all, while we are in this life to err, Righteous Judgment we muſt wait for in another place, for here we are very ſubject to be miſ-judged one of another; there is one thing that I deſire to free my ſelf of, and I am very confident (ſpeaking it now with much chearfulneſs) that I ſhall obtain your Chriſtian Charity in the belief of it. I was ſo far from being againſt Parliaments, that I did allways think the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> were the moſt happy conſtitutions that any Kingdom or Nation lived under, and the beſt means under God to make the King and People happy.</p>
            <p>For my Death I here acquit all the World, and beſeech the God of Heaven heartily to forgive them that contrived it, though in the intentions and purpoſes of my heart I am not guilty of what I dye for: And my Lord Primate, it is a great comfort for me, that His Majeſty conceives me not meriting ſo ſevere and heavy a puniſhment, as is the utmoſt Execution of this Sentence. I do infinitely reioyce in this mercy of his, and I beſeech God return it into his own boſom, that he may find mercy when he ſtands moſt in need of it.</p>
            <p>I wiſh this Kingdom all the proſperity and happineſs in the World, I did it living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and now dying it is my wiſh; I do moſt humbly recommend this to every one who hears me, and deſire they would lay their hands upon their hearts, and conſider ſeriouſly, whether the beginning of the happineſs and reformation of a Kingdom, ſhould be written in Letters of Blood; conſider this when you are at your homes, and let me be never ſo unhappy, as that the laſt drop of my Blood ſhould riſe up in Judgment againſt any one of you; but I fear you are in a wrong way.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I have but one word more, and with that I ſhall end. I profeſs that I dye a true and obedient Son to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> wherein I was born, and in which I was bred. Peace and proſperity be ever to it.</p>
            <p>It hath been objected (if it were an Objection worth the anſwering) that I have been inclined to Popery; but I ſay truly from my heart, that from the time that I was one and twenty years of Age, to this preſent, going now upon forty nine, I never had in my heart to doubt of this Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor ever had any man the boldneſs to ſuggeſt any ſuch thing to me, to the beſt of my remembrance. And ſo being reconciled by the merits of Jeſus Chriſt my Saviour, into whoſe boſom I hope I ſhall ſhortly be gathered, to thoſe Eternal happineſſes which ſhall never have end, I deſire heartily the forgiveneſs of every man for any raſh or unadviſed words, or any thing done amiſs, and ſo my Lords and Gentlemen farewel; farewel all things of this World.</p>
            <p>I deſire that you would be ſilent, and Joyn with me in Prayer, and I truſt in God we ſhall all meet and live Eternally in Heaven, there to receive the accompliſhment of all Happineſs, where every Tear ſhall be wiped away from our Eyes, and every ſad thought from our Hearts, and ſo God bleſs this Kingdom, and Jeſus have mercy on my Soul.</p>
            <p>Then turning himſelf about, he Saluted all the Noble-men, and took a ſolemn leave of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable perſons upon the Scaffold, giving them his hand.</p>
            <p>After that, he ſaid, Gentlemen, I would ſay my Prayers, and entreat you all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> pray with me, and for me; then his Chaplain laid the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> upon the Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> before him
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98942:28"/>
as he kneeled down, on which he prayed almoſt a quarter of an hour, and then as long or longer without the Book, and concluded with the Lords Prayer.</p>
            <p>Standing up he ſpies his Brother Sir <hi>George Wentworth,</hi> and calls him to him, ſaying, Brother, we muſt part, remember me to my Siſter, and to my Wife, and carry my Bleſſing to my Son, and charge him that he fear God, and continue an obedient Son to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and warn him that he bears no private grudge or revenge toward any man concerning me; and bid him beware that he meddle not with Church-livings, for that will prove a Moth and Canker to him in his Eſtate, and wiſh him to content himſelf to be a Servant to his Country, not aiming at higher Preferments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aliter.</hi>] To his Son Mr. <hi>Wentworth</hi> he commends himſelf, and gives him charge to ſerve his God, to ſubmit to his King with all Faith and Allegiance in things Temporal, to the Church in things Spiritual; chargeth him again and again, as he will anſwer it to him in Heaven, never to meddle with the Patrimony of the Church, for if he did, it would be a Canker to eat up the reſt of his Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Carry my Bleſſing alſo to my Daughter <hi>Anne,</hi> and <hi>Arabella,</hi> charge them to ſerve and fear God, and he will bleſs them; not forgetting my little Infant, who yet knows neither good nor evil, and cannot ſpeak for it ſelf, God ſpeak for it, and bleſs it. Now, ſaid he, I have nigh done, one ſtroke will make my Wife Husbandleſs, my dear Children Fatherleſs, and my poor Servants Maſterleſs, and will ſeparate me from my dear Brother, and all my Friends, But let God be to you and them all in all.</p>
            <p>After this, going to take off his Doublet, and to make himſelf unready, he ſaid, I thank God I am not afraid of Death, nor daunted with any diſcouragement riſing from any fears, but do as chearfully put off my Doublet at this time, as ever I did when I went to bed; then he put off his Doublet, wound up his Hair with his Hands, and put on a white Cap.</p>
            <p>Then he called, Where is the Man that is to do this laſt Office? (meaning the Executioner) call him to me; when he came and asked him forgiveneſs, he told him, he forgave him and all the World. Then kneeling down by the Block, he went to Prayer again himſelf, the Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> kneeling on the one ſide, and the Miniſter on the other: To the which Miniſter, after Prayer, he turned himſelf, having done Prayer, and ſpake ſome few words ſoftly, having his hands lifted up; and cloſed with the Miniſter's hands.</p>
            <p>Then bowing himſelf to lay his Head upon the Block, he told the Executioner, That he would firſt lay down his Head to try the fitneſs of the Block, and take it up again before he would lay it down for good and all; and ſo he did: And before he laid it down again, he told the Executioner, That he would give him warning when to ſtrike by ſtretching forth his hands; and preſently laying down his Neck upon the Block, and ſtretching forth his hands, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner ſtrook off his Head at one blow, and taking it up in his hand, ſhewed it to all the People, and ſaid, <hi>God ſave the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Body was afterwards Embalmed, and appoined to be carried into <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> there to be buried amongſt his Anceſtors.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>He left theſe three Inſtructions for his Son in Writing.</head>
               <p>Firſt, That he ſhould continue ſtill to be brought up under thoſe Governours to whom he had committed him; as being the beſt he could pick out of all thoſe within his knowledge, and that be ſhould not change them, unleſs they were weary of him; that he ſhould rather want himſelf, than they ſhould want any thing they could deſire.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He charged him, as he would anſwer it at the laſt day, not to put himſelf upon any public Employments, 'till he was thirty years of Age at leaſt: And then if his Prince ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all him to public Service, he ſhould carefully undertake it, to teſtifie his Obedience; and withall to be faithful and ſincere to his Maſter, though he ſhould come to the ſame end that himſelf did.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That he ſhould never lay any hand upon any thing that belonged to the Church. He foreſaw that Ruin was like to come upon the Revenues of the Church, and that perhaps they might be ſhared amongſt the Nobility and Gentry: But if his Son medled with any of it, he wiſhed the Curſe of God might follow him, and all them, to the Deſtruction <hi>of the moſt Apoſtolical Church upon Earth.</hi>
