            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Discontent is hereditary, and
no doubt but it is much augmented
by the many sad eclipses and changes
that have fallen out of late in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
politick; yet the disease is not to be
pleaded for, because natural; but to
be resisted, because sinful. That
which should make us out of love
with this sullen distemper, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating

know not any ornament in Religion

the true Philosophers stone, which
turnes all into Gold; this is the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

heart, which makes Christs spouse <hi>all

such a sparkling Diamond! If there
be a blessed life before we come at

Canst thou deserve any

God puts thee under the <hi>black rod?</hi>
Whereas he useth a rod, he might use

of discontent? The good Lord humble
his own people for nourishing such a
viper in their brest, as doth not only
eat out the bowels of their comfort,
but spits venome in the face of God
himself. O Christian, who art over

might have made a more curious
draught: but having preached upon
the subject, I was earnestly sollicited
by some of my Hearers to publish it;
and although it is not drest in that
rich attire of eloquence, as it might;
yet I am not about Poetry, or Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

for fancy, but practice. If I may
herein do any service, or cast but a

of our living is to live to God, &amp; to

The
Lord adde an effectual blessing to
this work, and fasten it as a nail in a
sure place; He of his mercy make it
as spiritual physick to purge the ill
humour of Discontent out of our
hearts, that so a crown of honor may
be set upon the head of Religion,
and the crystal streams of joy and
peace may ever run in our souls:
which is the prayer of him who is
desirous to be a faithful Orator for
thee at the throne of grace,</p>

went away quite changed. A true
Saint is a divine Landskip or picture,
where all the rare beauties of Christ
are lively pourtraied and drawn
forth. He hath the same Spirit, the

Jesus Christ.</p>

of Christ to our selves, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40519:14"/>
as it were the spreading the sacred
medicine of his blood upon our souls.
You that have heard much of Christ,
and yet cannot with an humble adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
say, <hi>My Iesus,</hi> be not offended
if I tell you, the Devill can say his
Creed as well as you.</p>
               <p>3. To learne Christ, is to <hi>live
Christ.</hi> When we have Bible-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations,
our lives as rich Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds
cast a sparkling lustre in the
Church of God<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 1. 27.</note>; and are (in some

               <p>The maine Proposition I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> is this. <hi>Doctr.</hi> That a
gracious spirit is a contented spirit.
The Doctrine of Contentment is
very superlative; and till we have
learned this, we have not learned to
be Christians.</p>
               <p>1. It is an <hi>hard Lesson.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in heaven had not learned it;
they were not contented. Though
their estate was very glorious, yet
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40519:19"/>
they were still soaring aloft, and aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at something higher. <hi>Iude ver. 6.
The Angels which kept not their first
estate.</hi> They kept not their estate,
because they were not contented
with their estate. Our first Parents
cloath'd with the white robe of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
in Paradise, had not learned to
be content; they had aspiring hearts,
and thinking their humane nature too
low and home-spun, would be
crowned with the Deity, and be <hi>as
gods</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 3. 5.</note>; Though they had the
choice of all the trees in the Garden,
yet none would content them but
the <hi>tree of Knowledge,</hi> which they
supposed would have been as eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salve
to have made them omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
Oh then, if this Lesson were
so hard to learne <hi>in innocency,</hi> how
hard shall we finde it<note n="*" place="margin">Ars om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino mira &amp; diffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, quae toto cordis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisu discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da est. <hi>Greg.</hi> hom. 16. in <hi>Eze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40519:20"/>
to presse those to Contentment
whom God hath blessed with great
estates, but rather perswade them to
be humble and thankfull; nay, but I
say, <hi>Be content.</hi> Rich men have their
discontents as well as others. As
appears, 1. When they have a great
estate, yet they are discontented that
they have no more; they would
make the hundred talents a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.

               </p>
               <p>2. Rich men, if we may suppose
them to be content with their estate,
(which is very seldome;) yet, though
they have <hi>estate</hi> enough, they have
not <hi>honour</hi> enough<note n="*" place="margin">

are full enough, yet their <hi>turrets</hi> are
not high enough. They would be
some body in the world, as <hi>Theudas,
who boasted himselfe to be some body</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 5. 36.</note>;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40519:20"/>
they never go so chearfully, as when
the winde of honor and applause fills
their sailes; if this wind be down, they
are discontented. One would think
<hi>Haman</hi> had as much as his proud
heart could desire; he was set above
all the Princes, advanced upon the
pinnacle of honour to be the second
man in the Kingdome<note n="*" place="margin">Esth. 3. 1.</note>; yet in the
midst of all his pompe, because <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi>
would not uncover and kneele,
he is discontented, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. and full
of wrath, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. and there is no way
to asswage this plurisie of revenge,
but by letting all the Jewes blood,
and offering them up in sacrifice.
The itch of honour is seldom allayed
without blood; therefore I say to
you rich men, <hi>Be content.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Rich men, if we may suppose
them to be content with their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and magnificent titles, yet they
have not alwayes Contentment in
their relations. She that lies in the
bosome, may sometimes blow the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40519:21"/>
coales; as <hi>Iobs</hi> wife, who in a pet
would have him fall out with God
himself, <hi>Curse God and die.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
children cause discontent; how
oft is it seen that the mothers milke
doth nourish a Viper? and he that
once sucked her brest, goes about to
suck her blood? Parents doe often
<hi>of Grapes</hi> gather thornes, and <hi>of Figs</hi>
thistles; Children are Sweet-briar.
Like the Rose, which is a fragrant
flower; but, as <hi>Basil</hi> saith, it hath its
prickles. Our relative comforts are
not all pure wine, but mixed; they
have in them more dregs then spirits,
and are like that River <hi>Plutarch</hi>
speaks of<note n="*" place="margin">

life; therefore rich men had need be
called upon to be contented.</p>
               <p>2. The Doctrine of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concernes poore men. You
that do not suck so liberally from the

is an hard Lesson, therefore it had
need be set upon the sooner. How
hard is it when the livelihood is even
gone, a great estate boyled away al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to nothing, then to be content?
The means of subsistance, is in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
called <hi>our life,</hi> because it is
the very sinewes of life. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

is like a Watch; though you carry it
up and down with you, yet the spring

out of order, but the watch keeps its
perfect motion: So it was with St.
<hi>Paul;</hi> though God had carryed him
into various conditions, yet he was

Ship that lies at anchor may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be a little shaken, but never
sinks: Flesh and blood may have its
fears and disquiets, but grace doth

cast anchor in heaven, his heart never

no better then mutinie in the heart;
it is a rising up against God. When
the Sea is rough and unquiet, it casts
forth nothing but foame; when the
heart is discontented, it casts forth
the foam of anger, impatience, and
sometimes little better then blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40519:25"/>
Murmuring is nothing else but
the scum which boils off from a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented

               <p>2. It excludes an <hi>uneven discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure.</hi>
When a man saith, I am

Head and heart are so taken
up, that a man is not fit to pray, or
meditate, &amp;c. he is not himself: just
as when an Army is routed, one man
runs this way, and another that, the
Army is put into a disorder: So a
mans thoughts runne up and down
distracted. Discontent doth dislo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and unjoynt the soul, it puls off
the wheels.</p>
               <p>3. It excludes a <hi>childish despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency;</hi>
and this is usually consequent
upon the other. A man being in an
hurry of minde, not knowing which
way to extricate, or winde himself
out of the present trouble; begins
<hi>succumbere oneri,</hi> to faint and sinke
under it. For Care is to the minde
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40519:26"/>
as a burden to the back, it loads the
spirits, and with over-loading sinks
them. A despondent spirit is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Contentment is an <hi>intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
thing,</hi> it lies within a man,<note place="margin">Aphorism,</note> not
in the barke, but the root. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
hath both its fountaine
and stream in the soule; the Beame
hath not its light from the Aire:
the beams of comfort which a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
man hath, do not arise <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsicè</hi>
from forraigne comforts,
but from within; as sorrow is seated
in the spirit, <hi>The heart knowes its own
grief</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 14. 10.</note>: So Contentment lies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
in the <hi>soul,</hi> and doth not depend
upon externals. Hence I gather,
that outward troubles cannot hinder
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40519:27"/>
this blessed Contentment; it is a
spirituall thing, and ariseth from spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
grounds, <hi>viz. The apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Gods love.</hi> When there is a
tempest without, there may be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
within: a Bee may sting through
the skin, but it cannot sting to the
heart: Outward afflictions cannot
sting to a Christians heart, where
Contentment lies. Thieves may

but not of this pearl of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
unlesse wee are willing to part
with it, for it is locked up in the
<hi>cabinet of the heart.</hi> The soule who
is possessed of this rich treasure of
Contentment, is like <hi>Noah</hi> in the
Arke, that can sing in the midst of a
Deluge.</p>
               <p>3. Contentment is an <hi>Habituall</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
thing, is shines with a fixed light in
the firmament of the soul.<note place="margin">Aphorism.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
doth not appear onely now
and then, as some Starrs which are
seen but seldome: it is a setled tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40519:28"/>
of the heart. One action doth
not denominate: he is not said to be
a liberall man, that gives alms once
in his life; a covetous man may do
so, but he is said to be liberall, that
is <hi>given to liberality</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rom 12 13.</note>; that is, who
upon all occasions is willing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
the necessities of the poor: so
he is said to be a contented man that
is given to Contentment. It is not
<hi>casuall,</hi> but <hi>constant. Aristotle</hi> in his
Rhetorick, distinguisheth betweene
colours in the face that arise from
<hi>passion,</hi> and those which arise from
<hi>complexion;</hi> the pale face may look
red when it blusheth, but this is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a passion: he is said properly to be
ruddy and sanguine, who is constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so, it is his complexion. He is
not a contented man who is so upon
an occasion, (and perhaps when he
is pleased;) but who is so constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is the habit and complexion
of his soul.</p>

Contentment, I come next
to lay down some reasons, or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Contentment, which may
preponderate with us.</p>
               <p>The first is,<note place="margin">Reason. 1. Virtute praecepti.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods precept.</hi> It is
charged upon us as a duty; <hi>Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with such things as you have</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 13. 5.</note>;
the same God who hath bid us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
hath bid us be content; if we
obey not, we runne our selves into
a spirituall <hi>praemunire.</hi> Gods Word
is a sufficient warrant; it hath <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
in it, and must be a <hi>superse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,</hi>
or <hi>sacred Spell</hi> to discontent;
<hi>Ipse dixit</hi> was enough among <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagor
as</hi> his Scholars. <hi>Be it enacted</hi> is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40519:29"/>
the Royall stile. Gods Word must
be the star that guides, and his Will
the weight that moves our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
his <hi>fiat</hi> is a Law, and hath
majesty enough in it to captivate us
into obedience; our hearts must not
be more unquiet then the raging
Sea, which at his Word is still'd<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 8. 26.</note>.</p>
               <p>2. The second reason inforcing
Contentment,<note place="margin">Reason 2. Virtute promissi.</note> is, <hi>Gods promise:</hi>
For, <hi>Hee hath said, I will never
leave thee, nor forsake thee,</hi> Heb.
13. 5. Where God hath engaged
himselfe, under hand and seale, for
our necessary provisions. If a

I will take care for thee, as

man on his death-bed much discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
and heare him complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
What will become of my wife
and children when I am dead and
gone, they may come to poverty?
saith God, Trouble not thy self, <hi>Be
content,</hi> I will take care of thy
children, and, <hi>Let thy widowes trust
in mee.</hi> God hath made a Promise
to us, <hi>that he will not leave us,</hi> and
hath entail'd the promise upon our
<hi>wife and children,</hi> and will not this
satisfie? True Faith will take Gods
single bond without calling for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
               <p>3. Be contented,<note place="margin">Reason. 3. Virtute decreti.</note> 
                  <hi>by vertue of a
Decree.</hi> What ever our condition
be, God the great Umpire of the
world hath <hi>ab aeterno</hi> decreed that
condition for us, and by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

ordered all appertinances
thereunto. Let a Christian often
think with himselfe, who hath plac'd
me here, whither I am in an higher
sphere, or in a lower? not chance
or fortune, (as the pur-blinde
Heathens imagined;) no, it is the
wise God that hath by his providence
fixed me in this Orbe: We must
act that scene which God will have
us; say not, Such an one hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
this to me; look not too
much at the under-wheel. We read in
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> of <hi>a wheele within a wheel</hi>

                  </gap> or helme,

<hi>because thou, Lord, didst it</hi>

Gods Providence (which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the carrying on
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40519:30"/>
of his Decree,) should be a
<hi>supersedeas</hi> and counterpoison a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
discontent; God hath set as
in our station, and he hath done it
in wisdome.</p>
               <p>We fancy such a condition of
life good for us, whereas if we were
our owne carvers, we should often
cut the<note n="*" place="margin">Ista ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus quae plus nocent quàm pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceut.</note> worst piece. <hi>Lot</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 13. 10.</note>, which soon after was burnt
with fire. <hi>Rachel</hi> was very desirous
of children, <hi>Give mee children or
I die</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 30. 1.</note>, and it cost her her life in
bringing forth a childe. <hi>Abraham</hi>

may live before thee</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 17. 18.</note>! but he
had little comfort either of him or
his seed; he was borne a sonne of
strife, <hi>His hand was against every
man, and every mans hand against
him.</hi> The Disciples wept for
Christ's leaving the world; they
chose his corporall presence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it was best for them that Christ
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40519:31"/>
should be gone, for else <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
would not come</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 16. 7.</note>. <hi>David</hi>
chose the life of his childe, <hi>he wept
and fasted for it</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 16.</note>; whereas if the
childe had lived, it would have
been a perpetuall monument of his
shame. Wee stand oft in our own
light; if we should sort, or parcell
out our owne comforts, we should
hit upon the wrong. Is it not well
for the childe that the Parent doth
chuse for it? were it left to its self, it
would perhaps chuse a knife to cut its
own fingers. A man in a paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xysme
calls for wine, which if he
had, were little better then poyson;
'tis well for the Patient that he is at
the Physicians appointment.</p>
               <p>The consideration of a Decree de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining,
and a Providence dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all things that fall out, should
work our hearts to holy Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The wise God hath order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our condition; if he sees it better
for us to abound, we shall abound;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40519:31"/>
if he sees it better for us to want, we
shall want; be content to be at Gods
dispose.</p>
               <p>God sees in his infinite wisdom the
same condition is not <hi>convenient</hi> for
all; that which is good for one, may
be bad for another; one season of
weather will not serve all mens oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions;
one needs <hi>Sunshine,</hi> another
<hi>Raine;</hi> one condition of life will
not fit every man, no more then one
suite of apparell will fit every body;
Prosperity is not fit for all, nor yet
Adversity: If one man be brought
low, perhaps he can bear it better, he
hath a greater stock of grace, more
faith and patience; he can <hi>gather
grapes of thornes,</hi> pick some comfort
out of the Crosse; every one cannot
do this. Another man is seated in
an eminent place of dignity; he is
fitter for it; perhaps it is a place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
more parts, and judgement,
which every one is not capable of<note n="*" place="margin">Ex omni ligno non fit mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</note>;
perhaps he can use his estate better,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40519:32"/>
he hath a publick <hi>heart</hi> as well as a
publick <hi>place.</hi> The wise God sees
that condition to be bad for one
which is good for another; hence it is,
he placeth men in different orbes and
spheres, some higher, some lower;
one man desires <hi>health,</hi> God sees
sicknesse better for him; God will
worke health out of sicknesse, by
bringing the <hi>body of death</hi> into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
Another man desires
<hi>liberty,</hi> God sees restraint better for
him; he will work his liberty by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint;
when his feet are bound, his
heart shall be most enlarged. Did we
beleeve this, it would give check to
the sinfull disputes, and cavills of our
hearts; shall I be discontented at that
which is Enacted by a Decree, and
Ordered by a Providence? is this to
be a childe or a rebel?</p>

The contented man (saith <hi>Seneca)</hi> is

               <p>How is it that no man is contented?
Very few Christians have learned
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40519:35"/>
Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> lesson; neither poor nor

can learn any thing but this.</p>
               <p>1. If men are poor, they learne
to be, 1. <hi>Envious:</hi> they maligne
those that are above them. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Prosperity is an ey-sore; when

an <hi>evill</hi> eye. 2. They learn to be
<hi>querulous,</hi> still complaining, as if
God had dealt hardly with them;
they are ever telling of their wants,
they want this and that comfort;
whereas their greatest want is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
spirit. Those that are well
enough content with their <hi>sinnes,</hi>
yet are not content with their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If men are rich, they learn to

add a fifth, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>heart of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous

               <p>Never certainly since the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did this sinne of discontent <hi>reign,</hi>
or rather <hi>rage,</hi> more then in our

you can hardly speak with any,
but the passion of his tongue betrays
the discontent of his heart: every one
lisps out his trouble, and here even
the stammering tongue speaks too
freely and fluently.</p>

If God will not give the

If a man hath the Plague, it

So, these are they that have opposed

                     </gap>, a remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all our troubles, a <hi>levamen</hi> to
all our burdens, it is the cure of
care. Contentation, though it be
not properly <hi>a Grace,</hi> it is rather <hi>a
disposition of minde;</hi> yet in it there is
<hi>optimum temperamentum,</hi> an happy
temperature and mixture of all the
graces: It is a most precious

of <hi>Faith, Patience, Meeknesse, &amp;c.</hi>
which are the ingredients put into
it. Now there are <hi>in specie</hi> these
seven rare excellencies in Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>1. A contented Christian <hi>carries
heaven about him;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> For what is
Heaven but that sweet repose and
full contentment that the soule shall
have in God? in Contentment there
is the <hi>first</hi> fruits of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:40519:69"/>
There are two things in a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
spirit which makes it like Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>God is there;</hi> Something of
God is to be seen in that heart.<note place="margin">1. Ibi Deus.</note> A
discontented Christian is like a rough
tempestuous Sea; when the water is
rough, you can see nothing there;
but when it is smooth and serene, then
you may behold your face in the
water<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 27. 19.</note>. When the heart rageth
through discontent, it is like a rough
Sea; you can see nothing there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
passion and murmuring; there
is nothing of God, nothing of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in that heart; but by vertue of
Contentment, 'tis like the Sea when
it is smooth and calme, there is <hi>a face
shining there;</hi> you may see something
of Christ in that heart, a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the graces.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Rest is there.</hi> O what a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
is kept in a contented heart!<note place="margin">2. Ibi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies.</note>
What an Heaven! A contented
Christian is like <hi>Noah</hi> in the Arke;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40519:69"/>
though the Arke were tossed with
waves, <hi>Noah</hi> could sit and sing in the
Arke. The soule that is gotten into
the Arke of Contentment, sits qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
and sailes above all the waves of
trouble; he can sing in this spiritual
Arke. The wheeles of the Chariot
move, but the axle-tree stirs not;
the circumference of the Heavens is
carried about the Earth, but the
Earth moves not out of its centre.
When we meete with motion and
change in the creatures round about
us, a contented spirit is not stirred
or moved out of its centre. The sailes
of a mill move with the winde, but
the mill it self stands still; An em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme
of Contentment: When our
outward estate moves with the wind
of providence, yet the heart is setled
through holy Contentment; and
when others are like quick-silver
shaking and trembling through dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
the contented spirit can say
as <hi>David, O God, my heart is fixed,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40519:70"/>
my heart is fixed<note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 57. 7.</note>;</hi> what is this but a
piece of heaven?</p>
                  <p>2. Whatever is defective in the
creature,<note place="margin">2. Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie.</note> is <hi>made up in Contentment.</hi>
A Christian may want the comforts
that others have, the land, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions;
but God hath distilled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his heart that Contentment which
is far better; In this sense that is true
of our Saviour, <hi>He shall have in this
life an hundred fold</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 19. 29</note>. Perhaps he
that ventured all for Christ, never
hath his house or land again; I, but
God gives him a <hi>contented spirit;</hi>
and this breeds such joy in the soule,
as is infinitely sweeter then all his
houses and lands which he left for
Christ. It was sad with <hi>David</hi> in
regard of his outward comforts; he
being driven (as some thinke) from
his Kingdome, yet in regard of that
sweete contentment he found in
God, he had more comfort then
men use to have in time of harvest
and vintage<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 4, 7.</note>. One man hath house
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40519:70"/>
and lands to live upon, another hath
nothing, only a smal trade; yet even
that brings in a livelihood. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
may have little in the world,
but he drives the trade of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and so he knowes as well
how to <hi>want,</hi> as to <hi>abound.</hi> O the
rare <hi>art,</hi> or rather <hi>miracle</hi> of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!
Wicked men are often dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
in the enjoyment of all
things; the contented Christian is
well in the want of all things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But how comes a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to be contented in the deficiency
of outward comforts?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> A Christian findes content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
distilled out of the brests of
the Promises.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> He is poor in <hi>purse,</hi>
but rich in <hi>Promise.</hi> There is one
promise brings much sweet content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the soul; <hi>They that seeke
the Lord, shall not want any good
thing</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 34. 10.</note>. If the thing we desire be
good for us, we shall have it; if it be
not good, then the not having it is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40519:71"/>
good for us. The resting satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this Promise, gives content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>3. Contentment makes a man in tune
to serve God;<note place="margin">3 Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</note> it oiles the wheeles of
the soul, and makes it more agil and
nimble; it composeth the heart, and
now is fit for prayer, meditation, &amp;c.
How can he that is in a passion of
grief, or discontent, <hi>serve God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
distraction</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 35.</note>? Contentment doth
prepare and tune the heart. First
you prepare the Viol, and winde up
the strings, ere you play a fit of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.
When a Christians heart is
wound up to this heavenly frame of
Contentment, then it is fit for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
A discontented Christian is like
<hi>Saul</hi> when the <hi>evil spirit</hi> came upon
him. O what jarrings and discords
doth he make in prayer! When an
Army is put into a disorder, now it
is not sit for battell: When the
thoughts are scattered and distracted
about the cares of this life, a man is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40519:71"/>
not fit for devotion. Discontent
takes the heart wholly off from God,
and fixeth it upon the present
trouble, so that a mans mind is not
upon his <hi>prayer,</hi> but upon his
<hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Discontent doth disjoynt the soul,
and it is impossible now that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
should go so steadily, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
in Gods service. O how lame
is his devotion! The discontented
person gives God but <hi>halfe</hi> a duty,
his Religion is nothing but <hi>bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,</hi>
it wants a soul to animate it.
<hi>David</hi> would not offer that to God
which <hi>cost him nothing</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2 Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </note>; where there
is too much worldly <hi>care,</hi> there is too
little spiritual <hi>cost</hi> in a duty. The
discontented person doth his duties
<hi>by halves;</hi> he is just like <hi>Ephraim, a
cake not turned</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Hos. 7. 8</note>; he is a cake baked
on one side; he gives God the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi>
but not the spirituall part, his
heart is not in duty; he is baked on
one side, but the other side dough;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40519:72"/>
and what profit is there of such raw,
indigested services? He that gives
God only the skin of worship, what
can he expect more then the shell
of comfort? Contentation brings
the heart into frame; and then only
do we give God the flower and spirits
of a duty; when the soule is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
now a Christian doth <hi>rem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi>
his heart is intense and serious.
There are some duties which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
performe as we ought without
Contentment; As,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>To rejoyce in God.</hi> How can
he rejoyce that is discontented? he
is sitter for <hi>Repining</hi> then <hi>Rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>To be thankful for mercie.</hi> Can
a discontented person be thankfull?
he can be <hi>fretful,</hi> not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>To justifie God in his proceedings</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ezra. 9. 23</note>.
How can he doe this who is discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with his condition? He will
sooner censure Gods wisdome, then
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40519:72"/>
cleare his justice. Oh then how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
is <hi>Contentation</hi> which doth
prepare, and as it were string the
heart for duty? Indeed Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth not only make our duties
lively and agil, but <hi>acceptable.</hi> 'Tis
this that puts beauty and worth into
them; for Contentment <hi>settles</hi> the
soul: Now as it is with <hi>milke,</hi> when
it is alwaies stirring, you can make
nothing of it, but let it settle a while
and then it turnes to cream: When
the heart is overmuch stirred with
disquiet and discontent, you can
make nothing of those duties; how
thin, how fletten, and jejune are they?
But when the heart is once setled by
holy Contentment, now there is
some worth in our duties, now they
turn to cream.</p>
                  <p>4. Contentment is the spirituall
<hi>Arch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4. Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie.</note> or pillar of the soule; it fits a
man to <hi>bear burdens;</hi> he whose heart
is ready to sinke under the least sin,
by vertue of this hath a spirit invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40519:73"/>
under sufferings. A content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christian is like the Camomile,
the more it is troden upon, the more
it growes; as Physick works diseases
out of the body, so doth Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
work trouble out of the heart.
Thus it argues; If I am under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
God can vindicate me; If
I am in want, God can relieve me.
<hi>Ye shall not see wind, nor raine; yet
the valley shall be filled with water</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2 Kings 3. 17.</note>.
Thus holy Contentment keeps the
heart from fainting; in the <hi>Autumne</hi>
when the fruit and leaves are blown
off, still there is sap in the roote:
When there is an autumne upon our
external felicity, the leaves of our
estate drop off, still there is the sap
of Contentment in the heart; and
a Christian hath life inwardly, when
his outward comforts do not blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.
The contented heart is never
out of heart. Contentation is a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
shield, that doth beat back discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.
<hi>Humility</hi> is like the lead
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40519:73"/>
to the net, which keeps the soule
down when it is rising through passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and <hi>Contentment</hi> is like the cork
which keeps the heart up when it is
sinking through discouragement.
Contentment is the great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propper;
it is like the <hi>Beame</hi> which
beares whatever weight is laid upon
it; nay, it is like a <hi>Rock</hi> that breaks
the waves.</p>
                  <p>'Tis strange to observe the same
affliction lying upon two men, how
differently they carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under it. The contented
Christian is like <hi>Samson,</hi> that carried
away the gates of the City upon his
back<note n="*" place="margin">Judges 16. 3.</note>; he can go away with his cross
chearfully, and makes nothing of it;
the other is like <hi>Issachar</hi> couching
down under his burden<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 49. 14.</note>: the reason
is, the one is content, and that breeds
courage; the other discontented, and
that breeds fainting. Discontent
swells the grief, and grief breaks the
heart. When this sacred sinew of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40519:74"/>
Contentment begins to shrink, we
go limping under our afflictions. We
know not what burdens God may
exercise us with, let us therefore
preserve Contentment; as is our
<hi>Contentment,</hi> such will be our <hi>courage.
David</hi> with his five stones and his
sling, defied <hi>Goliah,</hi> and overcame
him. Get but Contentment into
the sling of your heart, and with this
sacred stone you may both defie the
world and conquer it; you may break
those afflictions which else wil break
you.</p>
                  <p>5. A fifth excellency is,<note place="margin">5. Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
prevents many <hi>sinnes and
tentations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. It prevents many <hi>sinnes.</hi> Where
there wants Contentment, there
wants no sin; discontentednesse with
our condition, is a sin that doth not
go alone, but is like the first link of
the chaine, which drawes all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
linkes along with it. In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
there are two sins which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40519:74"/>
Contentatation prevents.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Impatience.</hi> Discontent and
Impatience are two Twins; <hi>This e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is of the Lord, why should I wait
any longer</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2 Kings 6. 33.</note>? As if God were so
tied that he must give us the mercy
just when we desire. Impatience is
no smal sin, as wil appear, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whence it ariseth; As,</p>
                  <p>1. It is for want of faith. Faith
gives a right notion of God; it is an
intelligent grace; it beleeves that
Gods wisdome tempers, and his love
sweetens all ingredents; this workes
patience; <hi>Shall I not drinke the cup
which my Father hath given me?</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
is the daughter of infidelity.
If a patient hath an ill opinion of the
Physician, and conceits that he comes
to poison him, he will take none of
his Receits. When we have a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
against God, and conceit that
he comes to kill us, and undo us,
then we storme, and cry out through
Impatience. We are like a foolish
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40519:75"/>
man ('tis <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> simile) that cries
out, Away with the plaister, though it
be in order to a cure; is it not better
that the plaister smart a little, then the
wound fester and rankle?</p>
                  <p>2. Impatience is for want of love
to God. Wee will bear his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
whom wee love, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
patiently, but thankfully. <hi>Love
thinks no evill</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note>. It puts the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and most candid glosse upon
the actions of a friend; <hi>Love covers
evill.</hi> If it were possible for God in
the least manner to erre, (which were
blasphemy to think) love would co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that errour; love takes every
thing in the best sense; it makes us
bear any stroke, <hi>It endureth all
things</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 7.</note>; had wee love to God, we
should have patience.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Impatience is for want of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</hi>
The impatient man was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
humbled under the burden of
sinne; he that studies his sinnes, the
numberlesse number of them, how
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40519:75"/>
they are twisted together, and sadly
accented, is patient, and saith, <hi>I will
bear the indignation of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have sinned against him</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Mica. 7. 9.</note>.
The greater noise drowns the lesser;
when the sea roares the rivers are
still, he that lets his thoughts expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
about sinne, is both silent and
amaz'd, he wonders it is no worse
with him. How great then is this
sinne of impatience? and how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
is <hi>Contentation</hi> which is a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persedeas</hi>
or counterpoison against
this sinne. The contented Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
beleeving that God doth all in
love, is patient, and hath not one
word to say, unlesse to justifie God<note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 51. 4.</note>.
That is the first sin which Contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
prevents.</p>
                  <p>2. It prevents <hi>murmuring,</hi> a sinne
which is a degree higher then the
other; murmuring is a quarrelling
with God, &amp; enveighing against him,
<hi>They spake against God</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Num. 21. 5.</note>; the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murer
saith interpretatively, that God
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40519:76"/>
hath not dealt well with him, and he
hath deserved better from him. The
murmurer <hi>chargeth God with folly;</hi>
This is the language, or rather <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi>
of a murmuring spirit, God
might have been a wiser and a better
God. The murmurer is a mutineer.
The Israelites are called in the same
text <hi>murmurers</hi> and <hi>Rebels</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 17. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note>; and is not
rebellion <hi>as the sin of witchcraft?</hi> Thou
that art a murmurer, art in the account
of God as a <hi>Witch,</hi> a <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> as one
that deals with the Divel. This is a
sin of the first magnitude; murmuring
oft ends in cursing: <hi>Micah's</hi> mother
fell to cursing when the <hi>talents of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were taken away</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Judg. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</note>. So doth the
murmurer when a part of his estate
is taken away; our <hi>murmuring</hi> is the
Divels <hi>musick;</hi> this is that sinne which
God cannot bear, <hi>How long shal I bear
with this people that murmur against
me</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 14. 7.</note>? It is a sinne which whets the
sword against a people, it is a land-destroying
sinne; <hi>Murmur ye not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40519:76"/>
as some of them also murmured, and
were destroyed of the destroyer<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 10.</note>.</hi> 'Tis
a ripening sinne; this, without Gods
mercy, will hasten <hi>Englands</hi> fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.
O then how excellent is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation
which prevents this sinne?
To be contented and yet murmur,
is a soloecism; A contented Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
doth acquisce in his present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and doth not murmur, but
admire. Herein appears the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of contentation, it is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
antidote against sinne.</p>
                  <p>2. Contentment prevents many
temptations; discontent is a divel
that is alwaies tempting.<note place="margin">1 Tentation</note> 1. It puts
a man upon <hi>indirect means:</hi> He that
is poor and discontented, will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing; he will go to the
divel for riches; he that is proud and
discontented will hang himselfe, as
<hi>Achitophel</hi> did when his counsell
was rejected. Satan takes great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of our discontent; he loves
to fish in these <hi>troubled waters.</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40519:77"/>
doth both eclipse reason and
weaken faith; &amp; it is Satan policy, he
doth usually break over the hedge
where it is weakest. Discontent
makes a breach in the soule, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
at this breach the divel enters
by a tentation, and stormes the soul.
How easily can the divel by his <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi>
dispute a discontented Christian
into sinne? He formes such a syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism
as this; He that is in want must
study self-preservation: But you are
now in want, therefore you ought to
study self-preservation. Hereupon to

This <hi>modieum</hi> is in mercy;

this little I have is with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40519:79"/>
'Tis not <hi>stolen water;</hi> guilt

<hi>Contentment</hi> as an honey-comb
drops sweetnesse into every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Discontent is a leaven that
sowers every comfort, it puts aloes
and wormwood upon the brest of

it trebbles every crosse; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

it is the best <hi>commentator</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Providence; it makes a faire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of all Gods dealings.
Let the Providences of God be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so darke or bloody, Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth construe them ever in the
best sense. I may say of it as the
Apostle of charity, <hi>It thinks no evil</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 13</note>.
Sicknesse (saith Contentment) is
Gods furnace, to refine his gold
and make it sparkle the more; the
prison is an Oratory, or house of
prayer. What if God melts away
the creature from me? he saw per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
my heart grew too much in love
with it; had I been long in that fat
pasture, I should have surfeited;
and the better my estate had been,
the worse my soule would have
beene. God is wise, he hath done
this, either to prevent some sinne,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40519:80"/>
or to exercise some grace. What
a blessed frame of heart is this?
A contented Christian is an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
for God against unbeliefe and
impatience; Whereas Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
takes every thing from God
in the worst sense; it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead

                  <p>The fourth Argument to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
is, because now God hath
his end, and Satan misseth of his
end.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>God hath his end.</hi> Gods end
in all his crosse providences, is to
bring the heart to submit and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
and indeed this pleaseth God
much, he loves to see his children sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with that portion hee doth
carve, and allot them. It contents
him to see us contented; Therefore
let us acquiesce in Gods Providence;
Now God hath his end.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Satan misseth of his end.</hi> The
end why the Devil (though by Gods
permission) did smite <hi>Iob,</hi> in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and estate, was to perplex his
minde; hee did vex <hi>his body</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40519:83"/>
that he might disquiet <hi>his spirit.</hi>
He hoped to bring <hi>Iob</hi> into a fit of
discontent; and then, that he would
in a passion break forth against God;
but <hi>Iob</hi> being so well contented
with his condition, as that he falls <hi>to
blessing of God,</hi> he did now disappoint
Satan of his hope. <hi>The Devill shall
cast some of you into prison</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 2. 10.</note>. Why
doth the Devil throw us into prison?
It is not so much the hurting our
body, as the molesting our minde
that he aimes at; he would imprison
our <hi>Contentment,</hi> and disturbe the
regular motion of our soules; this
is his designe: 'tis not so much the
putting us into <hi>prison,</hi> as the putting
us into a <hi>passion,</hi> that he attempts;
but by holy contentation, Satan lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his prey, he misseth of his end.
The Devil hath oft deceived us; the
best way to deceive him, is by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation</hi>
in the midst of <hi>tentation;</hi>
our contentment will discontent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
Oh, let us not gratifie our

<hi>delight;</hi> now it is as he would have
it, he loves to warme himselfe at the

the joy <hi>of the Angels,</hi> and <hi>Discontent</hi>
is the joy <hi>of the Devils:</hi> As the
Devil danceth at discord, so he sings
at discontent. The fire of our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
makes the Devil a bon-fire; 'tis
a kinde of heaven to him to see us
torturing our selves with our own

Thus afflictions do in discipline, and
shal we be discontented at that which
is for our good?</p>
                  <p>2. Afflictions are <hi>probatory</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 66. 10, 11.</note>. Gold
is not the worse for being tried, or
corne for being fanned. Affliction
is the touchstone of sincerity, it
tries what mettall wee are made of;
affliction is Gods <hi>fan,</hi> and his <hi>sieve.</hi>
'Tis good that men be known; some
serve God for a <hi>livery,</hi> they are like
the fisherman that makes use of his
net, onely to catch the fish: So they
go a fishing, with the net of Religion,
onely to catch preferment; Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
discovers these. The <hi>Donatists</hi>
went to the <hi>Gothes,</hi> when the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
prevailed; Hypocrites will not
faile in a storme; true grace holds out
in the <hi>winter-season.</hi> That is a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
faith,</hi> which like the star shines
brightest in the darkest night. 'Tis
good that our graces should bee
brought to a triall; thus we have the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40519:87"/>
comfort, and the Gospel the honour;
and why then discontented?</p>
                  <p>3. Afflictions they are <hi>expurgatory;</hi>
these evills work for good, because
they work out sinne; and shall I be
discontented at this? What if I have
more <hi>trouble,</hi> if I have lesse <hi>sin?</hi> The
brightest day hath its clouds, the
purest gold its drosse, the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
soule hath some lees of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
The Saints lose nothing in
the furnace, but what they can well
spare, <hi>their drosse;</hi> is not this for our
good, why then should we murmure?
<hi>I am come to send fire on the earth</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 12 94.</note>.
<hi>Tertullian</hi> understands it of the fire
of <hi>affliction.</hi> God makes this like
the fire of the three children, which
burned onely their bonds, and set
them at liberty in the furnace: So the
fire of affliction serves to burne the
bonds of iniquity; <hi>By this therefore
shall the iniquity of Iacob be purged,
and this is all the fruit, to take away
his sinne</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Isa 27. 9</note>. When affliction or death
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40519:88"/>
comes to a wicked man, it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<hi>his soule;</hi> when it comes to a
godly man, it onely takes away his
<hi>sinne;</hi> is there then any cause why
wee should be discontented? God
steeps us in the brinish waters of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
that hee may take out our
spots. Gods people are his husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 9.</note>;
the ploughing of the ground
kills the weeds, and the harrowing
of the earth breaks the hard clods;
Gods ploughing of us by affliction,
is to kill the weeds of sinne, his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
of us, is to break the hard
clods of impenitency, that the heart
may be the fitter to receive the seeds
of grace; and if this be all, why should
we be discontented?</p>
                  <p>4. Afflictions doe both exercise
and encrease grace.</p>
                  <p>First, they <hi>exercise</hi> grace: affliction
doth breath our graces; every thing
is most in its excellency, when it is
most in its exercise. Our grace,
though it cannot be dead, yet it may
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40519:88"/>
be <hi>asleep,</hi> &amp; hath need of awakening.
What a dull thing is the fire when it
is hid in the embers, or the Sunne
when it is masqued with a cloud; a
sick man is <hi>living,</hi> but not <hi>lively;</hi>
afflictions quicken and excite grace.
God doth not love to see grace in the
eclipse. Now faith puts forth its
purest and most noble acts in times
of affliction: God makes the <hi>fall of
the leafe</hi> the <hi>spring</hi> of our graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
What if we are more <hi>passive,</hi> if grace
be more active?</p>
                  <p>2. Afflictions do <hi>encrease</hi> grace: as
the winde serves to encrease &amp; blow
up the flame; so do the windy blasts
of affliction augment &amp; blow up our
graces; grace spends in the furnace,
but it is like the <hi>widowes oile in the
cruse,</hi> which did encrease by pouring
out. The torch when it is beaten,
burns brightest, so doth grace when
it is exercised by sufferings. Sharp
frosts nourish the good corne, so doe
sharp afflictions grace; some plants
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40519:89"/>
grow better in the shade then in the
Sun; as the <hi>Bay</hi> and the <hi>Cypress.</hi> The
shade of adversity is better for some
then the Sun-shine of prosperity.
<hi>Naturalists</hi> observe, that the <hi>Colewort</hi>
thrives better when it is watered
with salt water then with fresh: So do
some thrive better in the salt water
of affliction; and shall wee be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
at that which makes us
grow and fructifie more?</p>
                  <p>5. These afflictions do bring more
of Gods immediate presence into the
soule. When we are most assaulted,
we shall be most assisted, <hi>I will be with
him in trouble</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 91. 15.</note>. It cannot be ill with
that man with whom God is by his
powerfull presence in supporting, and
his gracious presence in sweetning
the present triall. God will bee with
us in trouble, not onely to <hi>behold</hi> us,
but to <hi>uphold</hi> us; as he was with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
in the <hi>Lions den,</hi> and the three
children <hi>in the furnace.</hi> What if wee
have more trouble then others, if we
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40519:89"/>
have more of God with us then others
have? we never have sweeter smiles
from Gods face then when the world
begins to look strange; <hi>Thy Statutes
have been my songs,</hi> where? not
when I was upon the throne, but
<hi>in the house of my pilgrimage</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 119. 54.</note>. We
read, <hi>The Lord was not in the winde,
nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 19 11.</note>;
but in a metaphorical &amp; spiritual sense,
when the winde of affliction blowes
upon a beleever, God is in the winde;
when the fire of affliction kindles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, God is in the fire, <hi>viz.</hi> to
sanctifie, to support, to sweeten. If
God be with us the furnace shall bee
turned into a festival, the prison in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Paradise, the earthquake into a
joyful dance. Oh why should I be
discontented when I have more of
Gods company?</p>
                  <p>6. These evills of affliction are
for good, as they bring with them
Certificates of Gods love, and are
evidences of his speciall favour. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40519:90"/>
is the Saints livery, 'tis a
badge and cognizance of honour.
That the God of glory should look
upon a worme, and take so much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of him, as to afflict him rather
then lose him, is an high act of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
Gods rod is <hi>Sceptrum Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi>
a <hi>Scepter of dignity. Iob</hi> calls
Gods afflicting of us, <hi>his magnifying</hi>
of us<note n="*" place="margin">Job 7. 17.</note>. Some mens prosperity
hath been their shame, when others
affliction hath been their crown.</p>
                  <p>7. These afflictions worke for our
good, because they work for us <hi>a far
more exceeding weight of glory</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 4 17.</note>. That
which works for my glory in heaven,
works for my good; we do not read
in Scripture that any mans honour
and riches doe work for him <hi>a weight
of glory,</hi> but afflictions do; and shall
a man be discontented at that which
works for his glory? The heavier
the weight of affliction, the heavier
the weight of glory; not that our
sufferings do merit glory, (as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40519:90"/>
do wickedly glosse;) but though
they are not <hi>causa,</hi> they are <hi>via;</hi> they
are not the cause of our crown, yet
they are the way to it, and God
makes us as hee did our Captain <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
through sufferings</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 2. 10.</note>; and shall
not all this make us contented with
our condition? Oh I beseech you,
look not upon the <hi>evil</hi> of affliction,
but the <hi>good.</hi> Afflictions in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
are called <hi>visitations</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Job 7. 18.</note>, the

these must needs raise a storme in the
soule. Have you not seen the posture
of a sick man? sometimes he will sit
upon his bed, by and by he will lie
down, and when he is down, he is
not quiet; first he turnes on one side,
and then on the other, he is restlesse:
this is just the embleme of a discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
spirit, the man is not sick, yet
he is never well, sometimes hee likes
such a condition of life, and when he
hath it, yet he is not pleased, he is

Now the evill of discontent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in three things.</p>
                  <p>1. The <hi>sordidnesse</hi> of it,<note place="margin">1. Evil of discontent.</note> it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of a Christian.</p>
                  <p>First, it is unworthy of his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
It was the saying of an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
Bear thy condition quietly,
<hi>nosce te esse hominem,</hi> know thou art

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Fer man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetè for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunam tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, nosce te esse homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem. <hi>Tully.</hi>

contentedly, <hi>nosce te esse Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum,</hi>
know thou art <hi>a Christian.</hi>
Thou professest to live by faith,
what, and not content? Faith is a
grace that doth substantiate <hi>things
not seen</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note>, saith looks beyond the
creature, it feeds upon promises, faith
lives not <hi>by bread alone.</hi> When the
water is spent in the <hi>bottle,</hi> faith
knowes whither to have recourse;
now, to see a Christian dejected in
the want of visible supplies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits,
where is Faith? Oh, saith
one, my estate in the world is down.
I, and which is worse, thy faith is
down. Wilt thou not be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40519:92"/>
unlesse God let down the vessel to
thee as he did to <hi>Peter,</hi> wherein were
all manner of <hi>beasts of the earth, and
fowles of the aire</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 10 12.</note>, must you have

                     <note n="*" place="margin">John 10 25.</note>. So, unlesse thou hast a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
feeling of outward comforts,
thou wilt not be content. True faith
will <hi>trust</hi> God where it cannot <hi>trace</hi>
him, and will adventure upon Gods
<hi>bond</hi> though it hath nothing in view.
You who are disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented because you

either your faith is a <hi>non-entity,</hi> or at
best but an <hi>embrio;</hi> tis a <hi>weak faith</hi> that
must have stilts &amp; crutches to support
it. Nay, discontent is not only below
faith, but below reason; why are you
discontented? is it because you are

have you not reason to guide you?
doth not reason tell you that you are
but <hi>tenants at will?</hi> and may not God

are nothing else but the ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuations
and boilings over of pride.</p>
                  <p>2. The second cause of discontent
is envie, which <hi>Augustine</hi> calls <hi>viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
diabolicum,</hi> the sinne of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill;
Satan envied <hi>Adam</hi> the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

up <hi>strife,</hi> (this made the Plebeian
faction so strong amongst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes)</hi>
so it creates <hi>discontent;</hi> the
envious man looks so much upon the
blessings which another enjoyes, that
he cannot see his own mercies, and
so doth continually vexe and torture
himselfe. <hi>Cain</hi> envied that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sacrifice was accepted, and his
rejected, hereupon he was discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
and presently murderous
thoughts began to arise in his heart.</p>
                  <p>3. The third cause is <hi>Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
This is a radical sinne. Whence
are vexing Law-suits, but from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content?
and whence is discontent,
but from covetousnesse? <hi>Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
and <hi>contentedness</hi> cannot dwell
in the same heart. <hi>Avarice</hi> is an <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luo,</hi>
that is never satisfied. The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
man is like <hi>Behemoth, behold, he
drinketh up a river, he trusteth that he
can draw up</hi> Jordan <hi>into his mouth</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Job 40. 23.</note>,
There are foure things (saith <hi>Solomon)</hi>
say, <hi>It is not enough.</hi> I may adde a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40519:94"/>
fifth, <hi>The heart of a covetous man,</hi> he
is still craving. Covetousnesse is like
a Wolfe in the brest, which is ever
feeding; and because a man is not
satisfied, he is never content.</p>
                  <p>4. The fourth cause of Discontent
is <hi>Iealousie,</hi> which is sometimes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
through melancholy, and
sometimes misapprehension. The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of jealousie causeth <hi>this evil spirit.</hi>
Jealousie, <hi>is the rage of a man</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pro. 6. 34</note>: and
oft, this is nothing but <hi>suspicion</hi> and
<hi>phansie;</hi> yet such as creates reall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.</p>
                  <p>5. The fifth cause of Discontent
is <hi>distrust,</hi> which is a great degree
of Atheisme. The discontented
person is ever distrustfull. <hi>The bill
of provision</hi> growes low; I am in
these straits and exigencies, can God
help me? <hi>Can be prepare a table in the
wildernesse?</hi> sure hee cannot. My
estate is exhausted, can God recrute
me? My friends are gone, can God
raise me up more? sure the arme of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40519:94"/>
his power is shrunk. I am like the
<hi>dry fleece,</hi> can any water come upon
this fleece? <hi>If the Lord would make
windowes in Heaven, might this thing
be</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 7. 2.</note>? Thus <hi>the Anchor of hope,</hi> and
<hi>the shield of faith</hi> being cast away, the
soul goes pining up and down.</p>
                  <p>Discontent is nothing else but
the <hi>Echo</hi> of unbeliefe: and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>distrust</hi> is worse then <hi>distress.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Discontent is evil in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of it, whch are two.</p>
                  <p>1. Discontent is joyned with a
<hi>sullen melancholy;</hi> a Christian of a
right temper, should be ever chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in God; <hi>Serve the Lord with
gladness</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 100. ver. 2.</note>. A signe the oile of grace
hath been poured into the heart,
when <hi>the oile of gladness</hi> shines in the
countenance. Chearfulnesse credits
Religion; how can the discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
person be chearfull? Discontent
is a dogged, sullen humour; because
wee have not what wee desire, God
shall not have a good word or look
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40519:95"/>
from us; as the Bird in the cage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she is pent up, and cannot fly
in the open aire, therefore beats her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
against the cage, and is ready to
kill her selfe. Thus that peevish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
<hi>I doe well to be angry to the
death</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Jonah 4.</note>.</p>
                  <p>2. Discontent is accompanied with
<hi>unthankfulness;</hi> because we have not
all wee desire, wee never minde
the mercies which we have: we deale
with God as the widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi>
did with the Prophet; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Elijah</hi> had been a means to keep
her alive in the famine; for it was for
his sake that her <hi>meale in the barrel,</hi>
and her <hi>oile in the cruse</hi> failed not;
but assoon as ever her sonne dies, she
falls into a passion, and begins to
quarrel with the Prophet; <hi>What have
I to doe with thee, O thou man of God?
art thou come to call my sin to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
and to slay my son</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Kings 17. 18.</note>? So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully
do we deal with God; we
can be content to receive mercies
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40519:95"/>
from God; but if he doth crosse us
in the least thing, then through dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
we grow techy and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and are ready to fly upon God;
thus God loseth all his mercies<note n="*" place="margin">

of this sinne is <hi>Discontent?</hi> A discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
Christian, because hee hath
not all he would, therefore disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
God with the mercies which he
hath. God made <hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
rib, to be an <hi>helper</hi> (as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
speaks;)<note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> but the Devil made an

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o
the heart: So doth discontent take
the rib of Gods mercy and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
shoot at him; Estate, Liberty
shall be employed against God. Thus
it is often-times; behold then how
Discontent and Ingratitude are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
and twisted one within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
thus Discontent is sinful in its
concomitants.</p>
                  <p>3. It is sinfull in its <hi>Consequences,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. Discontent is sinful, In its conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</note>
which are these:</p>
                  <p>1. It makes a man very unlike the
Spirit of God. The Spirit of God
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40519:96"/>
is a <hi>meek Spirit.</hi> The Holy Ghost
descended in the likenesse of a <hi>Dove</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 3. 16.</note>.
A Dove is the embleme of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
A discontented spirit is not a
meek spirit.</p>
                  <p>2. It makes a man like the Devil.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
The Devil being swell'd with the
poison of envy and malice, is never
content: Just so is the Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
The Devil is an unquiet spirit,
he is still <hi>walking about</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note>; 'tis his rest
to be walking. And herein is the
discontented person like him; for he
goes up and down vexing himselfe,
<hi>Seeking rest and finding none;</hi> hee is
the Devils picture.</p>
                  <p>3. Discontent disjoynts the soul,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
it untunes the heart for duty; <hi>Is any
man afflicted, let him pray</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Jam. 5. 13.</note>. But, is
any man <hi>discontented,</hi> how shall he
pray? <hi>Lift up pure hands without
wrath</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 8.</note>. Discontent is full of wrath
and passion; The Male-content can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lift up pure hands; he lifts up <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous
hands,</hi> he poisons his prayers;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40519:97"/>
will God accept of a poison'd sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice?
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> compares prayer
to a fine Garland; Those, saith he, that
make a Garland, their hands had
need be clean: Prayer is a precious
Garland, the heart that makes it had
need be clean. Discontent throwes
poison into the spring, (which was
death among the <hi>Romanes;)</hi> Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
puts the heart into a disorder and
mutiny, and such a one cannot serve
the Lord <hi>without distraction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Discontent sometimes unfits
for the very use of reason; <hi>Ionah</hi> in
a passion of discontent, spake no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then blasphemy, and non-sense;
<hi>I doe well,</hi> saith he, <hi>to be angry to the
death</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Jona. 4. 8</note>. What? to be angry with
God? and to die for anger? sure
hee did not know well what he said.
When Discontent transports, then
like <hi>Moses,</hi> wee speak <hi>unadvisedly
with our lips.</hi> This humour doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
suspend the very acts of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:40519:97"/>
5. Discontent doth not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
a mans selfe, but those who are
near him. This evill spirit troubles
<hi>Families, Parishes, &amp;c.</hi> If there be
but one string out of tune, it spoiles
all the musick. One discontented
spirit makes jarrings and discords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others. 'Tis this ill humour
that breeds quarrels, and Law-suits.
Whence is all our <hi>Contention,</hi> but for
want of <hi>Contentation?</hi> From whence
<hi>come warres and fightings among you,
come they not hence, even of your lusts</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Jam. 4. 1</note>?
in particular from this <hi>lust</hi> of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content?
Why did <hi>Absalom</hi> raise
a warre against his Father, and would
have taken off not onely his <hi>Crowne,</hi>
but his <hi>Head?</hi> was it not his discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent?
<hi>Absalom</hi> would be King. Why
did <hi>Ahab</hi> stone <hi>Naboth?</hi> was it not
discontent about the Vine-yard?
Oh this Devil of Discontent! Thus
you have seen the sinfulnesse of it.</p>
                  <p>3. Consider the simplicity of it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
I may say as the Psalmist,<note place="margin">The simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of it.</note> 
                     <hi>Surely
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40519:98"/>
they are disquieted in vaine<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 39. 6.</note>,</hi> which
appeares thus.</p>
                  <p>1. Is it not a vain simple thing to
be troubled at the losse of that which
is in its owne nature perishing and
changeable? God hath put a vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde
into the creature; all the world
rings changes, and for me to meet
with inconstancy here, to lose a friend,
estate, to be in a constant fluctuation,
is no more then to see a flower wither,
or a leaf drop off in Autumne. There
is an <hi>Autumne</hi> upon every comfort,
a <hi>fall of the leafe;</hi> Now it is extream
folly to be discontented at the losse
of those things which are in their
own nature loseable. What <hi>Solomon</hi>
saith of <hi>Riches,</hi> is true of all things
under the Sun, <hi>They take wings.
Noahs</hi> Dove brought an Olive-branch
in its mouth, but presently
flew out of the Arke, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
more: Such a comfort brings
to us honey in its mouth, but it hath
wings; and to what purpose should
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40519:98"/>
wee be troubled, unlesse wee had
wings to fly after and overtake
it?</p>
                  <p>2. Discontent is an heart-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>By sorrow of the heart the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is broken</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 15. 13.</note>, it takes away the
comfort of life. There is none of
us but have many mercies if we can
see them; now, because wee have not
all we desire, therefore we will lose
the comfort of that which we have
already. <hi>Ionah</hi> having his Gourd
smitten (a withering vanity,) was
so discontented, that hee never
thought of his miraculous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
out of the Whales belly; he
takes no comfort of his life, but wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that he might die. What folly
is this? we must have all or none;
herein wee are like children, that
throw away the piece which is
cut them, because they may have
no bigger. Discontent eats out
the comfort of life. Besides, it were
well if it were seriously weighed how
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40519:99"/>
prejudicial this is, even to our health:
For Discontent, as it doth discruciate
the minde, so it doth pine the body;
it frets as a moth, and by wasting the
spirits, weakens the vitals; The plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie
of Discontent brings the body
into a consumption; and is not this
Folly?</p>
                  <p>3. Discontent does not ease us of
our burden, but makes the crosse
heavier. A contented spirit goes
chearfully under its affliction. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
makes our grief as unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
as it is unreasonable. If the
leg be well, it can endure a fetter, and
not complaine; but if the leg before,
then the fetter troubles. Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of minde is the <hi>sore</hi> that makes
the Fetters of affliction more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.
Discontent troubles us more
then the trouble it selfe, it steeps the
affliction in worm-wood. When
Christ was upon the Crosse, the
Jewes brought him <hi>gall and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
to drink, that it might adde to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40519:99"/>
his sorrow. Discontent brings to a
man in affliction gall and vineger to
drink; this is worse then the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it selfe. Is it not folly for a man to
imbitter his own crosse?</p>
                  <p>4. Discontent spins out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our
troubles the longer. A Christian is
discontented, because he is in want;
and therefore he is in want, because
hee is discontented; hee murmurs,
because he is afflicted; and therefore
he is afflicted, because he murmurs.
Discontent doth delay and adjourne
our mercies. God deales herein
with us as wee use to doe with our
children; when they are quiet and
chearfull, they shall have any thing;
but if wee see them cry and fret, then
we with-hold from them: Wee get
nothing from God by our discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
but blowes. The more the

                  <p>The tenth Argument or Motive
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40519:102"/>
to Contentment is; Consider seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
the nature of a prosperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
There are in a prosperous
estate three things.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Plus molestiae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Plus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiae.</note> more trouble.
Many who have abundance of all
things to enjoy, yet have not so
much content and sweetnesse in their
lives, as some that go to their hard
labour. Sad, solicitous thoughts
do often attend a prosperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Care</hi> is the <hi>malus genius,</hi> or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
spirit which haunts the rich man,
and will not suffer him to bee quiet.
When his chest is full of gold, his
heart is full of care, either how to
<hi>manage,</hi> or how to <hi>encrease,</hi> or how
to <hi>secure</hi> what hee hath gotten. Oh
the troubles and perplexities that do
waite upon prosperity! The worlds
high seats are very uneasie; Sun shine
is pleasant, but somtimes it scortcheth
with its heat; the Bee gives honey,
but sometimes it stings: Prosperity
hath its sweetnesse, and also its sting.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40519:103"/>
Competency with Contentment is
farre more eligible. Never did <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
sleep better then when hee had the
heavens for his Canopy, and an hard
stone for his pillow. A large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous
estate, is but like a long
trailing garment, which is more
troublesome then useful.</p>
                  <p>2. In a prosperous condition there
is <hi>plus periculi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Plus pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculi.</note> more danger, and
that two wayes.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Ex parte ipsius,</hi> in respect
of a mans self. The rich mans <hi>Table

a strong braine that beares heady

in the Northern parts of the world,
if you bring them into the South
part, they lose their stomacks,
and dye quickly; but those that
live in the more Southerne hot
climates, bring them into the
North, and their stomacks mend,
and they are long-lived: Give me

and he begins to lose his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to good things, hee growes
weak, and a thousand to one if all his

be contented with a competency of

grace. It was the end of Christs A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension
to heaven, <hi>to give gifts,</hi> and
the end of those gifts, <hi>that wee may
grow up into him who is the head,

content with a <hi>modicum</hi> in Religion.

though he was content with a little

Christian is a <hi>wonder,</hi> he is the most
contented, and yet the least satisfied:
he is contented with a morsell of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40519:116"/>
bread, and a little water in the Cruse,
yet never satisfied with grace; he
doth <hi>anhelare,</hi> pant and breath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more; this is his prayer, Lord,
more conformity <hi>to</hi> Christ, more
communion <hi>with</hi> Christ; he would
faine have Christs image more
lively pictured upon his soule. True
grace is alwayes progressive: as
the Saints are called <hi>Lampes</hi> and

sorts of fruit.</p>
               <p>A true Christian growes, 1. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ,
in beauty.</hi> Grace is the best
complexion of the soule; it is at the
first plantation like <hi>Rachel,</hi> faire to
looke upon; but still the more it lives,
the more it sends forth its rayes of
beauty. <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was at first
beautifull; but at last it did shine in
its orient colours, and grew so illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious,
that God himself was in love
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40519:117"/>
with it, and makes his faith a paterne
to all Beleevers.</p>
               <p>2. A true Christian growes <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate,</hi>
in sweetnesse. A poisonfull
weed may grow as much as the Hys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop,
or Rose-mary; the Poppy in
the field, as the Corne; the Crab,
as the Pearmaine: but the one hath a
harsh, sowre taste, the other mellows
as it growes; An hypocrite may
grow in outward dimensions, as
much as a childe of God; hee may
pray as much, professe as much; but
he growes onely in magnitude, hee

the activity of Grace. Indeed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
grace is as a sleepy habit in the
soule, like sap in the vine, not exerting
its vigour, which may be occasion'd
through spiritual sloth, or by reason
of falling into some sin; but this is
only <hi>pro tempore,</hi> for a while; <hi>the spring</hi>

               <p>5. A true Christian growes <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremento,</hi>
both in the kinde and in-the

others could be content
with their affliction, so
God would give them
leave to pick and choose. They
could be content to bear <hi>such</hi> a cross;
they could better endure sicknesse
then poverty, or bear losse of estate
then losse of children; if they might
have such a mans crosse, they could
bee content; any condition, but the
present; this is not to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
A contented Christian doth
not goe to choose his crosse, but
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40519:123"/>
leaves God to choose for him; he is
content both for the <hi>kinde,</hi> and for
the <hi>duration.</hi> A contented spirit
saith, Let God apply what medicine
he pleaseth, and let it lie on as long
as it will; I know when it hath done
its cure, and eaten the venome
of sin out of my heart, God will take
it off againe. In a word, a contented
Christian, being sweetly captivated
under the authority of the Word, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to be wholly at Gods dispose;
and is willing to live in that sphere
and climate where God hath set him;
and if at any time hee hath been an
instrument of doing noble and brave
service in the publick, hee knowes
hee is but a <hi>rational toole,</hi> a servant
to authority, and is content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to his former private condition
of life. <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> after he had done
worthily, and purchased to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
great fame in his Dictatourship,
did notwithstanding afterwards vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily

his foure acres of ground.<note place="margin">Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yr.</note> Thus
should it bee with Christians, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>Godliness with Contentment,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
served <hi>Mars,</hi> not daring to
offend <hi>Iupiter,</hi> lest otherwise they
discover onely to the world a <hi>brutish
valour,</hi> being so untam'd and head-strong,
that when they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
others, yet they are not able
to rule their own spirits.</p>
               <p>5. He that is contented with his
condition,<note place="margin">5. Charact.</note> to rid himselfe out of
trouble will not runne himselfe into
sin. I deny not but a Christian may
lawfully seek to change his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
so farre as Gods providence
doth goe before, he may follow; but
when men will not follow provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
but run before it, as he said,
<hi>This evill is of the Lord, why should I
wait any longer</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">2 King. 6</note>? if God doth not
open the doore by his providence,
they will break it open, and wind
themselves out of affliction by sin;
bringing their soules into trouble by
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40519:124"/>
bringing their estates out of troubble.
This is far from holy Contentation,
this is unbelief broken out into rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
A contented Christian is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to wait Gods leasure, and will
not stir till God open a door. As <hi>Paul</hi>
said in another case, <hi>They have
beaten us openly, uncondemned, being</hi>
Romanes, <hi>and have cast us into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and now do they thrust us out pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily?
nay verily, but let them come
themselves and fetch us out</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 16. 37.</note>: So
with reverence, saith the contented
Christian, God hath cast me into
this condition, and though it be sad
and troublesome, yet I will not stir,
till God by a clear providence fetch
me out. Thus those brave spirited
Christians, <hi>Heb. 11. 35. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
not deliverance</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11.</note>, that is, upon
base, dishonourable termes. They
would rather stay in prison, then
purchase their liberty by carnall
compliance. <hi>Estius</hi> observes on
the place, they might not onely have
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40519:125"/>
had their enlargement, but been rais'd
to honour, &amp; put into offices of trust;
yet the honour of Religion was dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to them, then either liberty, or
honour. A contented Christian
will not remove, till as the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
hee see a <hi>pillar of cloud and fire</hi> going
before him: <hi>It is good that a man
should both hope and quietly wait for
the salvation of the Lord</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Lam. 3. 26.</note>. 'Tis good
to stay Gods leasure, and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
our selves out of trouble, till
wee see the star of Gods providence
pointing out a way to us.</p>

                  <p>All our disquiets do issue imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from unbelief. 'Tis this that
raiseth the storme of discontent in
the heart. Oh set faith a work; 'tis
the property of faith to silence our
doubtings, to scatter our feares, to
still the heart when the passions are
up. Faith workes the heart to a
sweet, serene composure; 'tis not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>food</hi> and <hi>raiment,</hi> but having
<hi>Faith</hi> which will make us content.
Faith chides down passion; When

that whatever its trials are, yet it
is from the hand of a Father; 'tis
indeed a bitter cup, but, <hi>Shall I not

my soule; God <hi>corrects</hi> with the
same love hee <hi>crownes</hi> me; God is

carves me, to make me a <hi>polished shaft.</hi>

humility, even <hi>the peaceable

can bring such sweet fruit out of a

                  <p>2. Faith sucks the honey of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
out of the hive of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
Christ is the <hi>Vine,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are the clusters of Grapes that

                  <p>The humble man is the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man; if his <hi>estate</hi> bee low, his
heart is lower then his estate; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is content. If his <hi>esteem</hi> in
the world be low, hee that is little in
his own eyes, will not bee much
troubled to be little in the eyes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
He hath a meaner opinion of
himself then others can have of him.
The humble man studies his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse;
he looks upon himself
as <hi>less then the least</hi> of Gods mercies<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 32. 10.</note>,
and then a <hi>little</hi> will content him: He
cries out with <hi>Paul,</hi> that he is <hi>the
chief of sinners</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15.</note>; therefore doth not
murmure, but admire: Hee doth
not say his comforts are small, but
his sins are great. He thinks it a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
he is out of hell, therefore is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40519:129"/>
He doth not goe to carve
out a more happy condition to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
he knowes the worst piece God
cuts him, is better then he deserves.
A proud man is never contented, he
is one that hath an high opinion of
himselfe; therefore under small bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
is disdainfull, under small cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
impatient. The humble spirit
is the contented spirit; if his cross be
light, he reckons it in the inventory
of his mercies; if it be heavie, yet
takes it upon his knees, knowing that
when his estate is worser, it is to
make him better. Where you lay
humility for the foundation, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
will bee the superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>

                  <p>Contentment is the <hi>Manna</hi> that is

Oh, take heed of indulging
any sin. 'Tis as naturall for guilt to
breed disquiet, as for putred matter
to breed vermine. Sinne lies as <hi>Ionah</hi>
in the ship, it raiseth a tempest. If
dust, or motes be gotten into the eye,
they make the eye water, and cause
a sorenesse in it; if the eye be clear,
then it is free from that sorenesse:
If sin be gotten into the conscience,
which is as the eye of the soule, then
grief and disquiet breeds there;
but keep the eye of conscience clear,
and all is well. What <hi>Solomon</hi> saith
of a good stomack, I may say of <hi>a
good conscience:</hi>

every bitter thing is sweet;</hi> so to a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40519:130"/>
good conscience every bitter thing
is sweet; it can pick contentment
out of the <hi>Crosse.</hi> Good conscience
turnes the waters of <hi>Marah</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
wine. Would you have a quiet
heart, get a smiling conscience. I
wonder not to hear <hi>Paul</hi> say, he was

lived in all good conscience to this day</hi>

When once a mans reckonings are
clear, it must needs let in abundance
of contentment into the heart.
Good conscience can suck content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
out of the bitterest drugge; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
slanders, <hi>This is our rejoycing, the
testimony of our conscience</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note>: in case of

a good conscience; and if it be so, then
in prison wee may be in Paradise.
When the times are troublesome,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40519:130"/>
good conscience makes a calme; If
conscience he clear, what though the
dayes be cloudy? Is it not a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to have a friend alwayes by, to
speak a good word for us? such a
friend is conscience. Good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as <hi>Davids Harp,</hi> drives away
the evil spirit of discontent. When
thoughts begin to arise, and the heart
is disquieted; Conscience saith to a
man as the <hi>King</hi> did to <hi>Nehemlah,
Why is thy countenance sad</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Neb. 2. 2.</note>? So
saith Conscience, hast not thou the
<hi>seed of God</hi> in thee? art not thou an
<hi>heir of the Promise?</hi> Hast not thou
a treasure that thou canst never be
plundered of? Why is thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
sad? Oh keep conscience
clear, and you shall never want con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
For a man to keep the

is the best way to maintaine
health: So, to keep conscience
clear, and to preserve it from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obstructions
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40519:131"/>

to maintaine contentment. First

set her heart too much upon her

she lost her self too; such a veine of

Here was discontent. When we let
any creature lie too near our heart,
when God pulls away that comfort,
a piece of our heart is rent away with
it. Too much fondnesse ends in
frowardnesse. Those that would
be content in the want of mercy,
must be moderate in the enjoyment.

he did write Christs Name upon his
door, so he did invoke his Name in
his closet<note n="*" place="margin">Eusebius.</note>. Prayer is an <hi>exor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </hi> with
God, and an <hi>exoroist</hi> against sin. The
best way is to pray down discontent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
What <hi>Luther</hi> faith of <hi>Concupiscence</hi>
I may say of <hi>Discontent;</hi> Prayer is a
sacred Leech<note n="*" place="margin">Oratio est hirudo animae.</note> to suck out the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
and swelling of this passion.
Prayer composeth the heart, and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40519:147"/>
brings it into tune. Hath God depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
you of many comforts? blesse
God that he left you the Spirit of
Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use.</hi> 6. The last use is of comfort,<note place="margin">Use. <hi>VI.</hi> Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
or encouraging word to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
Christian. If there be an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon earth, thou hast it. O
Christian, thou may'st insult over
thy troubles, and with the <hi>Leviathan</hi>
laugh at the shaking of a spear,<note place="margin">Job 4. 1. 29</note> 
                     <hi>Iob</hi>
41. 29. What shall I say? thou art
a crown to thy profession; thou dost
hold it out to all the world, that
there's vertue enough in Religion to
give the soule contentment. Thou
shewest height of grace. When grace
is <hi>crowning,</hi> it is not so much for us
to be content; but when grace is
<hi>conflicting,</hi> and meets with crosses,
tentations, agonies; now to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
this is a glorious thing indeed.</p>
                  <p>To a contented Christian, I shall
say two things for a farewell.</p>
                  <p>First, God is exceedingly taken
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40519:148"/>
with such a frame of heart. God saith
of a contented Christian, as <hi>David</hi>
once said of <hi>Goliahs</hi> sword, <hi>There is
none like that, give it me,</hi> 1 Sam. 21.
9. If you would please God, and be
<hi>men of his heart,</hi> be contented. It is
said that <hi>Rebecca</hi> made <hi>Isaac</hi> savoury
meat, such as her husband loved;
would ye give God <hi>such a dish as he
loves?</hi> bring him this of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Musician hath many les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to play, but he hath one above
all the rest: There are many lessons
of holy Musick that delight God, the
lesson of repentance, humility, &amp;c.
But this lesson of Contentment is
the sweetest lesson that a Beleever
can play. God hates a froward spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the contented Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
shall be no loser. What lost <hi>Iob</hi>
by his patience? God gave him three
times as much as he had before.
What lost <hi>Abram</hi> by his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
he was content to leave his
Countrey at Gods call; the Lord
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40519:148"/>
makes a Covenant with him, that he
would be <hi>his God, Gen.</hi> 17. Hee
changeth his Name; no more <hi>Abram,</hi>
but <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of many
Nations. God makes his feed as
the Starres of heaven; nay, honours
him with this title, <hi>The Fatther of
the Faithfull.</hi> The Lord makes
known his secrets to him,<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Shall
I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>the thing that I
will do?</hi> God settles a rich inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
upon him, that land which was
a type of heaven, and afterwards
translated him into the blessed Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.
God will be sure to reward the
contented Christian. As our Saviour
said in another case to <hi>Nathaniel,
Because I said I saw thee under the
fig-tree, beleevest thou? thou shalt see
greater things then these.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 1. 50.</note> So, I
say, Art thou contented (O Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an)
with a little, thou shall see
greater things then these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God
will distill the sweet influences of his
love into thy soule: Hee will raise
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40519:149"/>
one in the cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e; and when that is
done, he will crowne thee with an
eternall enjoyment of himselfe; he
will give thee Heaven, where thou
shalt have as much contentment
as thy soule can possibly thirst
after.</p>
