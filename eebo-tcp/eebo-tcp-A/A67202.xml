            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE,
Spoken by the
Plain-Dealer.</head>
            <l>
               <hi>I</hi> The <hi>PLAIN-DEALER</hi> am to Act to Day:</l>
            <l>And my rough Part begins before the Play.</l>
            <l>First, you who Scrible, yet hate all that Write,</l>
            <l>And keep each other Company in Spite,</l>
            <l>As Rivals in your common Mistriss, Fame,</l>
            <l>And, with faint Praises, one another Damn;</l>
            <l>'Tis a good Play (we know) you can't forgive,</l>
            <l>But grudge your selves, the pleasure you receive:</l>
            <l>Our Scribler therefore bluntly bid me say,</l>
            <l>He wou'd not have the Wits pleas'd here to Day.</l>
            <l>Next, you, the fine, loud Gentlemen, o' th' Pit,</l>
            <l>Who Damn all Playes; yet, if y'ave any Wit,</l>
            <l>'Tis but what here you spunge, and daily get;</l>
            <l>Poets, like Friends to whom you are in Debt,</l>
            <l>You hate: and so Rooks laugh, to see undone</l>
            <l>Those Pushing Gamesters whom they live upon</l>
            <l>Well, you are Sparks; and still will be i' th' fashion:</l>
            <l>Rail then, at Playes, to hide your Obligation.</l>
            <l>Now, you shrewd Iudges who the Boxes sway,</l>
            <l>Leading the Ladies hearts, and sense astray,</l>
            <l>And, for their sakes, see all, and hear no Play;</l>
            <l>Correct your Cravats, Foretops, Lock behind;</l>
            <l>The Dress and Breeding of the Play ne'r mind:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:52036:3"/>
               <hi>Plain-dealing</hi> is, you'll say, quite out of fashion;</l>
            <l>You'll hale it here, as in a Dedication.</l>
            <l>And your fair Neighbors, in a Limning Poet,</l>
            <l>No more than in a Painter will allow it.</l>
            <l>Pictures too like, the Ladies will not please:</l>
            <l>They must be drawn too here, like Goddesses.</l>
            <l>You, as at <hi>Lely's</hi> too, wou'd Truncheon wield,</l>
            <l>And look like Heroes, in a painted Field;</l>
            <l>But the course Dauber of the coming Scenes,</l>
            <l>To follow Life, and Nature only means;</l>
            <l>Displays you, as you are: makes his fine Woman</l>
            <l>A mercenary Iilt, and true to no Man;</l>
            <l>His Men of Wit, and Pleasure of the Age,</l>
            <l>Are as dull Rogues, as ever cumber'd Stage:</l>
            <l>He draws a Friend, only to Custom just;</l>
            <l>And makes him naturally break his trust.</l>
            <l>I, only, Act a Part like none of you;</l>
            <l>And yet, you'll say, it is a Fool's Part too:</l>
            <l>An honest Man; who, like you, never winks</l>
            <l>At faults; but, unlike you, speaks what he thinks:</l>
            <l>The onely Fool who ne'r found Patron yet;</l>
            <l>For Truth is now a fault, as well as Wit.</l>
            <l>And where else, but on Stages, do we see</l>
            <l>Truth pleasing; or rewarded Honesty?</l>
            <l>Which our bold Poet does this day in me.</l>
            <l>If not to th' Honest, be to th' Prosp'rous kind:</l>
            <l>Some Friends at Court let the <hi>PLAIN-DEALER</hi> find.</l>

            <head>EPILOGUE, Spoken by the Widow Blackacre.</head>
            <l>TO you, the Iudges learned in Stage Laws,</l>
            <l>Our Poet now, by me, submits his Cause;</l>
            <l>For with young Iudges, such as most of you,</l>
            <l>The Men by Women best their bus'ness do:</l>
            <l>And, truth on't is, if you did not sit here,</l>
            <l>To keep for us a Term throughout the Year,</l>
            <l>We cou'd not live by'r Tongues; nay, but for you,</l>
            <l>Our Chamber-practice wou'd be little too.</l>
            <l>And 'tis not only the Stage Practiser</l>
            <l>Who, by your meeting, gets her living here;</l>
            <l>For, as in Hall of <hi>Westminster,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Sleek Sempstress vents, amidst the Courts, her Ware:</l>
            <l>So, while we Baul, and you in Iudgment sit,</l>
            <l>The Visor-Mask sells Linnen too i'th' Pit.</l>
            <l>O many of your Friends, besides us here,</l>
            <l>Do live, by putting off their sev'ral Ware.</l>
            <l>Here's daily done the great affair o'th' Nation:</l>
            <l>Let Love, and Vs then, ne'r have Long-vacation.</l>
            <l>But hold; like other Pleaders, I have done</l>
            <l>Not my poor Client's bus'ness, but my own.</l>
            <l>Spare me a word then, now, for him. First know,</l>
            <l>Squires of the Long Robe, he does humbly show</l>
            <l>He has a just Right in abusing you;</l>
            <l>Because he is a <hi>Brother-Templer</hi> too:</l>
            <l>For, at the Bar, you Railly one another;</l>
            <l>And Fool, and Knave, is swallow'd from a Brother:</l>
            <l>If not the Poet here, the <hi>Templer</hi> spare;</l>
            <l>And maul him, when you catch him at the Bar.</l>
            <l>From you, our common modish Censurers,</l>
            <l>Your Favor, not your Iudgment, 'tis he fears:</l>
            <l>Of all Loves begs you then to Rail, find fault;</l>
            <l>For Playes, like Women, by the World are thought</l>
            <l>(When you speak kindly of 'em) very naught.</l>

               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO I never had the Honour to receive a Favour from
you, nay, or be known to you, I take the confidence of
an Author to write to you a <hi>Billiet doux</hi> Dedicatory;
which is no new thing, for by most Dedications it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that Authors, though they praise their Patrons from top to
toe, and seem to turn 'em inside out, know 'em as little, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
their Patrons their Books, tho they read 'em out; and if the
Poetical Daubers did not write the name of the Man or Woman on
top of the Picture, 'twere impossible to guess whose it were. But
you, Madam, without the help of a Poet, have made your self
known and famous in the World; and, because you do not want
it, are therefore most worthy of an Epistle Dedicatory. And this
Play claims naturally your Protection, since it has lost its Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the Ladies of stricter lives in the Play-house; and (you
know) when mens endeavours are discountenanc'd and refus'd,
by the nice coy Women of Honour, they come to you, To you the
Great and Noble Patroness of rejected and bashful men, of which
number I profess my self to be one, though a Poet, a Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Poet; To you I say, Madam, who have as discerning a
judgment, in what's obscene or not, as any quick-sighted civil
Person of 'em all, and can make as much of a double meaning
saying as the best of 'em; yet wou'd not, as some do, make
nonsense of a Poet's jest, rather than not make it baudy: by
which they show they as little value Wit in a Play, as in a Lover,
provided they can bring t'other thing about. Their sense indeed
lies all one way, and therefore are only for that in a Poet which
is moving, as they say; but what do they mean by that word
moving? Well, I must not put 'em to the blush, since I find I can
<pb facs="tcp:52036:5"/>
do't. In short, Madam, you wou'd not be one of those who revish
a Poet's innocent words, and make 'em guilty of their own naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness
(as 'tis term'd) in spight of his teeth; nay, nothing is
secure from the power of their imaginations; no, not their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
whom they Cuckold with themselves, by thinking of other
men, and so make the lawful matrimonial embraces Adultery;
wrong Husbands and Poets in thought and word, to keep their
own Reputations; but your Ladyship's justice, I know, wou'd think
a Woman's Arraigning and Damning a Poet for her own obscenity,
like her crying out a Rape, and hanging a man for giving her
pleasure, only that she might be thought not to consent to't; and
so to vindicate her honour forfeits her modesty. But you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
have too much modesty to pretend to't; tho you have as
much to say for your modesty as many a nicer she; for you never
were seen at this Play, no, not the first day; and 'tis no matter
what Peoples lives have been, they are unquestionably modest who
frequent not this Play: For, as Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> says of his, that it is
the only Touchstone of Mens Wit and Understanding; mine is, it
seems, the only Touchstone of Womens Vertue and Modesty. But
hold, that Touchstone is equivocal, and, by the strength of a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's
Imagination, may become something that is not civil; but
your Ladyship, I know, scorns to misapply a Touchstone. And, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
tho you have not seen this Play, I hope (like other nice La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
you will the rather read it; yet, lest the Chambermaid or
Page shou'd not be trusted, and their indulgence cou'd gain no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
admittance for it, than to their Ladies Lobbies or outward
Rooms, take it into your care and protection; for, by your recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
and procurement, it may have the honour to get into
their Closets: For what they renounce in publick often entertains
'em there, with your help especially. In fine, Madam, for these
and many other reasons, you are the fittest Patroness or Iudge of
this Play; for you shew no partiality to this or that Author;
for from some many Ladies will take a broad jeast as chearfully
as from the Watermen, and sit at some downright filthy Plays
(as they call 'em) as well satisfy'd, and as still, as a Poet cou'd
wish 'em elsewhere; therefore it must be the doubtful obscenity
of my Plays alone they take exceptions at, because it is too bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:52036:5"/>
for 'em; and indeed most Women hate men, for attempting
to halves on their Chastity; and Baudy I find, like Satyr, shou'd
be home, not to have it taken notice of. But, now I mention
Satyr, some there are who say, 'Tis the Plain-dealing of the
Play, not the obscenity; 'tis taking off the Ladies Masks, not
offering at their Pettycoats, which offends 'em: and generally
they are not the handsomest, or most innocent, who are the most
angry at being discover'd:
<q>

               </q>
Pardon, Madam, the Quotation, for a Dedication can no more
be without ends of Latine, than Flattery; and 'tis no matter whom
it is writ to; for an Author can as easily (I hope) suppose Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to have more understanding and Languages than they have,
as well as more Vertues: But why, the Devil! shou'd any of the
few modest and handsome be alarm'd? (for some there are who
as well as any deserve those Attributes, yet refrain not from see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Play, nor think it any addition to their Vertue to set up
for it in a Play-house, lest there it shou'd look too much like acting.)
But why, I say, shou'd any at all of the truly vertuous be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
if those who are not so are distinguish'd from 'em? For
by that Mask of modesty which Women wear promiscuously in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
they are all alike, and you can no more know a kept Wench
from a Woman of Honour by her looks than by her Dress; for
those who are of Quality without Honour (if any such there
are) they have their Quality to set off their false Modesty, as
well as their false Iewels, and you must no more suspect their
Countenances for counterfeit than their Pendants, tho, as the
Plain-dealer <hi>Montaigne</hi> says, <hi>Els envoy leur conscience au Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
&amp; teinnent leur contenance en regle:</hi> But those who act as
they look, ought not to be scandaliz'd at the reprehension of
others faults, lest they tax themselves with 'em, and by too
delicate and quick an apprehension not only make that obscene
which I meant innocent, but that Satyr on all, which was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only on those who deserv'd it. But, Madam, I beg your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb facs="tcp:52036:6"/>
for this digression, to Civil Women and Ladies of Honour,
since you and I shall never be the better for 'em; for a Comic
Poet, and a Lady of your Profession, make most of the other
sort, and the Stage and your Houses, like our Plantations, are
propagated by the least nice Women; and as with the Ministers
of Iustice, the Vices of the Age are our best business. But, now
I mention Publick Persons, I can no longer defer doing you the
justice of a Dedication, and telling you your own; who are, of
all publick-spirited people, the most necessary, most communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
most generous and hospitable; your house has been the house
of the People, your sleep still disturb'd for the Publick, and when
you arose 'twas that others might lye down, and you waked that
others might rest; The good you have done is unspeakable; How
many young unexperienc'd Heirs have you kept from rash foolish
Marriages? and from being jilted for their lives by the worst
sort of Iilts, Wives? How many unbewitched Widowers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
have you preserv'd from the Tyranny of Stepmothers?
How many old Dotards from Cuckoldage, and keeping other mens
Wenches and Children? How many Adulteries and unnatural
sins have you prevented? In fine, you have been a constant
scourge to the old Lecher, and often a terrour to the young; you
have made concupiscence its own punishment, and extinguish'd
Lust with Lust, like blowing up of Houses to stop the fire.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Nimirum propter continentiam, incontinentia</l>
               <l>Necessaria est, incendium ignibus extinguitur.</l>
            </q>
            <p>There's <hi>Latin</hi> for you again, Madam; I protest to you, as I am
an Author, I cannot help it; nay, I can hardly keep my self from
quoting <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> and talking to you of the Rules of
Writing, (like the <hi>French</hi> Authors,) to shew you and my Readers I
understand 'em, in my Epistle, lest neither of you should find it out by
the Play; and, according to the Rules of Dedications, 'tis no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whether you understand or no, what I quote or say to you, of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
for an Author can as easily make any one a Iudge or Critick,
in an Epistle, as an Hero in his Play: But, Madam, that this may
prove to the end a true Epistle Dedicatory, I'd have you know 'tis
<pb facs="tcp:52036:6"/>
not without a design upon you, which is in the behalf of the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
of <hi>Parnassus,</hi> that Songs and Sonnets may go at your Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and in your Liberties, for Guinneys and half Guinneys; and
that Wit, at least with you, as of old, may be the price of Beauty,
and so you will prove a true encourager of Poetry, for Love is a
better help to it than Wine; and Poets, like Painters, draw better
after the Life, than by Fancy; Nay, in justice, Madam, I think a
Poet ought to be as free of your Houses, as of the Play-houses; since
he contributes to the support of both, and is as necessary to such as
you, as a Ballad-singer to the Pick-purse, in convening the Cullies
at the Theatres, to be pick'd up, and carry'd to Supper and Bed at
your houses. And, Madam, the reason of this motion of mine is,
because poor Poets can get no favour in the Tiring Rooms, for they
are no Keepers, you know; and Folly and Money, the old Enemies
of Wit, are even too hard for it on its own Dunghill: And for
other Ladies, a Poet can least go to the price of them; besides, his
Wit, which ought to recommend him to 'em, is as much an obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his Love, as to his wealth or preferment; for most Women
now adays, apprehend Wit in a Lover, as much as in a Husband;
they hate a Man that knows 'em, they must have a blind easie Fool,
whom they can lead by the Nose, and as the <hi>Scythian</hi> Women of
old, must baffle a Man, and put out his Eyes, ere they will lye
with him, and then too, like Thieves, when they have plunder'd
and stript a Man, leave him But if there shou'd be one of an
hundred of those Ladies, generous enough to give her self to a Man
that has more Wit than Money, (all things consider'd) he wou'd
think it cheaper coming to you for a Mistress, though you made him
pay his Guinney; as a Man in a Iourney, (out of good husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry)
had better pay for what he has in an Inn, than lye on free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost
at a Gentlemans House.</p>
            <p>In fine, Madam, like a faithful Dedicator, I hope I have done
my self right in the first place, then you, and your Profession, which
in the wisest and most religious Government of the World, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
with the publick allowance; and in those that are thought
the most unciviliz'd and barbarous, is protected, and supported by
the Ministers of Iustice; and of you, Madam, I ought to say no
more here, for your Vertues deserve a Poem rather than an Epistle,
<pb facs="tcp:52036:7"/>
or a Volume intire to give the World your Memoirs, or Life at
large, and which (upon the word of an Author that has a mind to
make an end of his Dedication) I promise to do, when I write the
Annals of our British Love, which shall be Dedicated to the Ladies
concern'd, if they will not think them something too obscene too;
when your Life, compar'd with many that are thought innocent, I
doubt not may vindicate you, and me, to the World, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
I have taken in this Address to you; which then may be
thought neither impertinent, nor immodest; and, whatsoever your
Amorous misfortunes have been, none can charge you with that
heinous, and worst of Womens Crimes, Hypocrisie; nay, in spight
of misfortunes or age, you are the same Woman still; though most
of your Sex grow <hi>Magdalens</hi> at fifty, and as a solid <hi>French</hi> Author
has it,
<q>
                  <l>Apres le plaisir, vien't la peine,</l>
                  <l>Apres la peine la vertu;</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But sure an old sinner's continency is much like a Gamester's
forswearing Play, when he has lost all his Money; and Modesty
is a kind of a youthful dress, which, as it makes a young Woman
more amiable, makes an old one more nauseous; a bashful old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is like an hopeful old man; and the affected Chastity of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated
Beauties, is rather a reproach than an honour to 'em, for
it shews the mens Vertue only, not theirs. But you, in fine, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
are no more an Hypocrite than I am when I praise you;
therefore I doubt not will be thought (even by your's and the Play's
Enemies, the nicest Ladies) to be the fittest Patroness for,</p>

ne'r mind that; I, like an Author in a Dedication, never speak well of a
man for his sake, but my own; I will not disparage any man, to disparage
my self; for to speak ill of people behind their backs, is not like a Person
of Honour; and truly to speak ill of 'em to their faces, is not like a
complaisant person: But if I did say, or do an ill thing to any Body, it
shou'd be sure to be behind their backs, out of pure good manners.</p>

speak well of people, (which is very seldom indeed) it shou'd be sure to
be behind their backs; and if I wou'd say, or do ill to any, it
shou'd be to their faces: I wou'd justle a proud, strutting, over-looking
Coxcomb, at the head of his Sycophants, rather than put out my tongue
at him, when he were past me; wou'd frown in the arrogant, big, dull
face of an overgrown Knave of business, rather than vent my spleen
against him, when his back were turn'd; wou'd give fauning Slaves the
Lye, whil'st they embrace or commend me; Cowards, whil'st they brag;
call a Rascal by no other title, though his Father had left him a Duke's;
laugh at Fools aloud, before their Mistresses: And must desire people to
leave me, when their visits grow at last as troublesom, as they were at first
impertinent.</p>

               <p>I must confess, I am so much your Friend, I wou'd not deceive

               <p>Because he that is (you'll say) a true Friend to a man, is a
Friend to all his Friends; but you must pardon me, I cannot wish well to
Pimps, Flatterers, Detractors, and Cowards, stiff nodding Knaves, and

               <p>You told 'em so, and swore it too; I heard you.</p>

               <p>Ay, but, when their backs were turn'd, did I not tell you they

            <sp>
               <speaker>Free.</speaker>
               <p>Why, don't you know, good Captain, that telling truth is a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as prejudicial, to a man that wou'd thrive in the World, as square Play
to a Cheat, or true Love to a Whore! Wou'd you have a man speak truth
to his ruine? You are severer than the Law, which requires no man to
swear against himself; you wou'd have me speak truth against my self,
I warrant, and tell my promising Friend, the Courtier, he has a bad
memory?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Yes.</p>

               <p>Why, first your promising Courtier wou'd keep his word, out of
fear of more reproaches; or at least wou'd give you no more vain hopes:
your Lawyer wou'd serve you more faithfully; for he, having no Honor
but his Interest, is truest still to him he knows suspects him: The new
Officer wou'd provoke thee to make him a Coward, and so be cashier'd,
that thou, or some other honest Fellow, who had more courage than mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
might get his place: the Noble Sonneteer wou'd trouble thee no
more with his Madrigals: the praying Lady wou'd leave off railing at
Wenching before thee, and not turn away her Chambermaid, for her own
known frailty with thee: and I, instead of hating thee, sheu'd love thee,
for thy <hi>Plain-dealing;</hi> and in lieu of being mortifi'd, am proud that the
World and I think not well of one another.</p>

dislikes not me: for she has often shut out of her conversation for mine,
the gaudy fluttering Parrots of the Town, Apes, and Echoes of men
only, and refus'd their common place pert chat, flattery, and submissions,
to be entertain'd with my sullen bluntness, and honest love. And, last of
all, swore to me, since her Parents wou'd not suffer her to go with me,
she wou'd stay behind for no other man; but follow me, without their
leave, if not to be obtain'd. Which Oathâ€”</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Free.</speaker>
               <p>Did you think she wou'd keep?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; for she is not (I tell you) like other Women, but can
keep her promise, tho' she has sworn to keep it; but, that she might the
better keep it, I left her the value of five or six thousand pound: for
Womens wants are generally their most importunate Solicitors to Love,
or Marriage.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Free.</speaker>
               <p>And Money summons Lovers, more than Beauty, and augments
but their importunity, and their number; so makes it the harder for a
Woman to deny 'em. For my part, I am for the <hi>French</hi> Maxim, if you
wou'd have your Female Subjects Loyal, keep 'em poor: but, in short,
that your Mistress may not marry, you have given her a Portion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>She had given me her heart first, and I am satisfi'd with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity;
I can never doubt her truth and constancy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Free.</speaker>
               <p>It seems you do, since you are fain to bribe it with Money. But
how come you to be so diffident of the Man that sayes he loves you, and
not doubt the Woman that sayes it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>I shou'd (I confess) doubt the Love of any other Woman but
her, as I do the friendship of any other Man but him I have trusted; but
I have such proofs of their faith, as cannot deceive me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Free.</speaker>
               <p>Cannot!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>No but I know, that generally, no Man can be a great Enemy,
but under the name of Friend; and if you are a Cuckold, it is your
Friend only that makes you so; for your Enemy is not admitted to your
house: if you are cheated in your Fortune, 'tis your Friend that does it;
for your Enemy is not made your Trustee: if your Honour, or Good
Name be injur'd, 'tis your Friend that does it still, because your Enemy is
not believ'd against you. Therefore I rather choose to go where honest,
downright Barbarity is profest; where men devour one another like ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
hungry Lyons and Tygers, not like Crocodiles; where they think
the Devil white, of our complexion, and I am already so far an <hi>Indian:</hi>
but, if your weak faith doubts this miracle of a Woman, come along
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52036:15"/>
with me, and believe, and thou wilt find her so handsom, that thou, who
art so much my Friend, wilt have a mind to lie with her, and so will not
fail to discover what her faith and thine is to me.</p>

               <p>AH, Cousin, what a World 'tis we live in! I am so weary of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eliz.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, Cousin, I can find no fault with it, but that we
cannot alwayes live in't; for I can never be weary of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oliv.</speaker>
               <p>O hideous! you cannot be in earnest sure, when you say you
like the filthy World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eliz.</speaker>
               <p>You cannot be in earnest sure, when you say you dislike it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oliv.</speaker>
               <p>You are a very censorious Creature, I find.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eliz.</speaker>
               <p>I must confess I think we Women as often discover where we
love, by railing; as men when they lye, by their swearing; and the World
is but a constant Keeping Gallant, whom we fail not to quarrel with,
when any thing crosses us, yet cannot part with't for our hearts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lett.</speaker>
               <p>A Gallant indeed, Madam, whom Ladies first make jealous, and
then quarrel with it for being so, for if, by her indiscretion, a Lady be
talk'd of for a Man, she cryes presently, <hi>'Tis a Censorious World;</hi> if, by her
vanity, the Intrigue be found out, <hi>'Tis a prying, malicious World;</hi> if, by her
over-fondness, the Gallant proves unconstant, <hi>'Tis a false World;</hi> and if,
by her nigardliness, the Chambermaid tells, <hi>'Tis a perfidious World:</hi> but
that, I'm sure, your Ladyship cannot say of the World yet, as bad as
'tis.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oliv.</speaker>
               <p>But I may say, <hi>'Tis a very impertinent World.</hi> Hold your peace.
And, Cousin, if the World be a Gallant, 'tis such as one as is my aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Pray name it no more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eliz.</speaker>
               <p>But is it possible the World, which has such variety of Charms
for other Women, can have none for you? Let's seeâ€”first, what d'ye
think of Dressing, and fine Cloaths?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oliv.</speaker>
               <p>Dressing! Fie, fie, 'tis my aversion. But, come hither, you
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52036:16"/>
Dowdy, methinks you might have open'd this Toure better: O hideous!
I cannot suffer it! d'ye see how't sits?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eliz.</speaker>
               <p>Well enough, Cousin, if Dressing be your aversion.</p>

               <speaker>Oliv.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis so: and for variety of rich Cloaths, they are more my aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Let.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, 'tis because your Ladyship wears 'em too long; for indeed a
Gown, like a Gallant, grows one's aversion, by having too much of
it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oliv.</speaker>
               <p>Insatiable Creature! I'll be sworn I have had this not above
three dayes, Cousin, and within this month have made some six
more.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eliz.</speaker>

               <p>If it be for me only, Madam pray do not wear 'em.</p>

               <speaker>Eliz.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but Railing now is so common, that 'tis no more Malice,
but the fashion; and the absent think they are no more the worse for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Or like a <hi>Holborn</hi> Lady, who cou'd not get into the last Ball, or
was out of countenance in the Drawing-room the last Sunday of her

into it, or else who are ridiculous when they are there: and I shall sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

               <p>In what sense am I to understand you? But, in fine, by the word
Aversion, I'm sure you dissemble; for I never knew Woman yet that
us'd it, who did not. Come, our tongues belie our hearts, more than our
Pocket-glasses do our faces; but methinks we ought to leave off dissemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
since 'tis grown of no use to us; for all wise observers understand
us now adayes, as they do Dreams, Almanacks, and <hi>Dutch Gazets,</hi> by the
contrary: And a Man no more believes a Woman, when she sayes she has
an Aversion for him, than when she sayes she'll Cry out.</p>

none speak ill of; and, rather than not flatter, will flatter the Poets of

think that as an over-conscious Fool at a Play, by endeavouring to
shew the Author's want of Wit, exposes his own to more censure: so
may a Lady call her own modesty in question, by publickly cavilling with
the Poets; for all those grimaces of honour, and artificial modesty, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
a Woman's real Virtue, as much as the use of white and red does
the natural complexion; and you must use very, very little, if you wou'd

               <p>Her tongue, I confess, was silent; but her speaking Eyes gloted

               <p>I know there are whose Eyes reflect more Obscenity, than the

their looks, to make 'em seem more beautiful, not more loving: which
vain young Fellows, like you, are apt to interpret in their own favor, and
to the Lady's wrong.</p>

               <p>Seldom, Sir; pray have you a care of gloting Eyes; for he that
loves to gaze upon 'em, will find, at last, a thousand Fools and Cuckolds
in 'em, instead of <hi>Cupids.</hi>

               <p>I tell you again, Sir, no Woman sticks there: Eye-promises of
Love they only keep; nay, they are Contracts which make you sure of
'em. In short, Sir, she, seeing me, with shame and amazement dumb, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active,
and resistless, threw her twisting arms about my neck, and smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
me with a thousand tasteless Kisses: believe me, Sir, they were so

cou'd not quite believe it; but she was, so that her second falseness is a
favor to me, not an injury, in revenging me upon the Man that wrong'd
me first of her Love. Her Love!â€”a Whores, a Witches Love!â€”
But, what, did she not kiss well, Sir? I'm sure I thought her Lipsâ€”
but I must not think of 'em moreâ€”but yet they are such I cou'd still

to return to her again, within this hour, as soon as it shou'd be dark; by

               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>I was only wond'ring why Fools, Rascals, and desertless
Wretches, shou'd still have the better of Men of Merit, with all Women;
as much as with their own common Mistress, Fortune!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Freem.</speaker>
               <p>Because most Women, like Fortune, are blind, seem to do all
things in jest, and take pleasure in extravagant actions; their love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
neither thanks, or blame, for they cannot help it: 'tis all sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;
therefore the noise, the finical, the talkative, the cowardly and
effeminate, have the better of the brave, the reasonable, and Man of
Honour; for they have no more reason in their love, or kindness, than
Fortune her self.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Man.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, they have their reason. First, Honour in a Man they fear
too much to love; and Sence in a Lover, upbraids their want of it; and
they hate any thing that disturbs their admiration of themselves; but
they are of that vain number, who had rather shew their false generosity,
in giving away profusely to worthless Flatterers, than in paying just
Debts: And, in short, all Women, like Fortune, (as you say) and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
are lost, by too much meriting.</p>

all prudent Women do together, secur'd money and pleasure; and now
all interruptions of the last are remov'd. Go Husband, and come up

Yet take this advice with you, in this Plain-dealing Age, to leave off for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing
your self; for when people hardly think the better of a Woman
for her real modesty, why shou'd you put that great constraint upon your
self to feign it?</p>

left me in the present possession of Two thousand pounds a Year;
which I left, with multitudes of Pretenders, to follow you, Sir; having
in several publick places seen you, and observ'd your actions throughly,
with admiration, when you were too much in love to take notice of mine,
which yet was but too visible. The name of my Family is <hi>Grey;</hi> my
other, <hi>Fidelia:</hi> the rest of my Story you shall know, when I have fewer
Auditors.</p>

               <p>Nay, now, Madam, you have taken from me all power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
you any Complement on my part; for I was going to tell you, that
for your sake onely, I wou'd quit the unknown pleasure of a retirement;
and rather stay in this ill World of ours still, tho odious to me, than give
you more frights again at Sea, and make again too great a venture there, in
you alone. But if I shou'd tell you now all this, and that your virtue
(since greater than I thought any was in the World) had now reconcil'd
me to't, my Friend here wou'd say, 'tis your Estate that has made me
Friends with the World.</p>

               <p>I must confefs I shou'd; for I think most of our quarrels to the
World, are just such as we have to a handsom Woman: only because we
cannot enjoy her, as we wou'd do.</p>

               <p>Nay, if thou art a <hi>Plain-dealer</hi> too, give me thy hand; for now
I'll say I am thy Friend indeed: And, for your two sakes, tho' I have
been so lately deceiv'd in Friends of both Sexes;</p>

                  <l>I will believe, there are now in the World</l>

                  <l>And handsom Women worthy to be Friends:</l>
                  <l>Yet, for my sake, let no one e're confide</l>
