            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THREE QUERIES Propounded to the King and Parliament, In the Fear of the Moſt High, and in the tender love of my ſoul to them.</p>

            <p>THe main thing conducible towards mans ſafety and happineſs, is to ſee things aright: and he that ſeeth aright, muſt ſee with a right eye. There is an eye which cannot ſee the things of God; there is an heart alſo which is inſenſible of his warnings, and ſo runs into the pit. There is alſo an eye, to which God giveth the true ſight, which foreſeeth the evil and ſeeketh an hiding place; and an heart which feareth its Maker, and waiteth on him for counſel, diſtruſting its own underſtanding, which it feeleth ſhallow and apt to err. O that man might feel his want of God, and receive a principle of divine life from him, and be fixed and act therein. If I ſhould pray thus particularly for every one of you, would ye be offended with me? I have written ſomewhat here in the kindlings of my love, and in the Light of Life which ſhineth in my heart; O that the Lord would pleaſe to open a vein of the ſame Life in you, and then would ye reade them in the ſame, and (in a ſecret ſence of ſpirit) feel what they are and from whence they come. Now if it ſhould pleaſe the Lord that any of you ſhould feel any touches of heart, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret aſſent of ſoul to the truth of them, O take heed of the fleſhly wiſdom and reaſonings of the earthly mind, which will ſoon riſe up afterwards, to wear out the ſence of any good that God begets in the heart.</p>

            <head>The <hi>QUERIES.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Quer. 1. <hi>VVHether ye do certainly and infallibly know, what was the ground or cauſe why the hand of the Lord was ſo heavy upon this Nation, and why he overturned the Government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and brought the Honourable into contempt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three things are ſuppoſed or taken for granted in this <hi>Query.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">Firſt, That it was the hand of the Lord that did this. It is he that hath the anguiſh of ſoul and the diſeaſes of body at his command, and afflicteth both mens bodies and ſouls at his pleaſure. And he alſo afflicteth Nations, with the Powers and Authorities thereof, when it ſeemeth good unto him. Now this is the thing which is mainly to be eyed by particular perſons, and alſo by Nations in whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth them, to wit, the hand of the Lord in things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there was a ground and cauſe for which the Lord did it. The Lord is tender-hearted, and loveth his creature, delighting to do it good, and doth not afflict it out of any pleaſure he hath therein, but upon a kind of neceſſity, that he may bring down evil and bring up good in a Nation. <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</hi> It is no pleaſure to the Lord to torment his creatures: but to deſtroy the ſeeds of corruption and unrighteouſneſs, and to bring up the good Seed which he hath ſown in the hearts of men, this is a pleaſure to him. Now as your afflictions were very great, and the alterations in this Nation ſtrange; ſo there was a conſideration in the Lord's eye to countervail them, or they had never been.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is requiſite and neceſſary for you, certainly and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly to underſtand the ground why the Lord did this: what his meaning was: what he was offended at and intended to bring down; what he was pleaſed with and intended to give ſcope to ſpring up and grow under this confuſion, which could not under the former ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The reaſon, why this is neceſſary for you, is this: Becauſe unleſs ye certainly underſtand this thing, ye may err and miſtake in your preſent courſe, ſetting up the ſame things now, which the heart of the Lord was then againſt, and endeavouring to ſuppreſs the ſame things, which it is the will of the Lord ſhould grow up, and ſo may provoke the ſame hand againſt you again; which truly I think is not good for you to do, nor indeed can I think ſo of you, as that ye willingly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36340:3"/>
would do it. Therefore pray to the Lord for the upright ballance to weigh a thing of ſuch a nature in, and of ſo deep concernment to you: for if ye do run a contrary courſe to the mind of the Lord, and he be provoked againſt you, and ſtretch forth his mighty Arm and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw you, it will then be too late for you to conſider of theſe things.</p>
            <p>Quer. 2. <hi>Whether when the Lord did overturn the former Powers, with the glory and beauty of this Nation, and raiſe up other Powers out of the duſt (as I may ſay) even from among them of low degree: If they had then anſwered what the Lord expected and required of them in their day, whether they ſhould have been continued by him in their dominion or no, and whether ye ſhould have had this day of tryal, which it hath pleaſed the Lord now to afford you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day of Power and Government which the Lord had given you formerly, was manifeſtly by his Providence come to an end; and whether ever ye ſhould have a day more, was very doubtful. All your Councils and Strength availed nothing, ſave only to make the work the more difficult, if not at length almoſt impoſſible. And now the Lord was buſie in trying ſeveral ſorts of theſe, what they would do for his Name: and truly this I may ſay concerning them all (though I would not reproach any) that they did not anſwer the expectation of the Lord. But this I leave to you to conſider, <hi>Whether if they had anſwered the expectation of the Lord, and done what his Soul delighted in, and what in part they promiſed, whether the Lord would have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued them in Authority or no?</hi> I propoſe this, that ye may take notice upon what tickliſh terms ye then ſtood, as to your future hopes, and how eaſily your Authority and Greatneſs might have been for ever buried, and that which was lately uppermoſt have continued ſo, if it had ſeemed good unto the Lord; that ſo ye may be ſenſible of what the Lord hath done in relation to you, and pray that ye may walk worthy of it, making uſe of it in the fear of his Name, who hath all ſtill in his hand, and can ſtill do what he pleaſeth in this Nation. Indeed he can yet bring down whom he will, and he can yet ſet up whom he will; and what he will do, ye know not: but in the fear of his dreadful Name, and in holding your ſtanding out of ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence (becauſe of your preſent ſtrength) is your ſafety.</p>
            <p>Quer. 3. <hi>If ye do not certainly know what was the cauſe of the Lord's former diſpleaſure againſt you, and of his ſo ſore afflicting you, but ſhall err in judgement and ſet up the ſame things again, which the Lord then put forth his hand to throw down, and alſo endeavour to cruſh and ſuppreſs that, which the Lord then made way for the growth of, whether this will not endanger your overthrow from the hand of the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:36340:4"/>Sure I am the Lord is able to overturn you as eaſily, as he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned them that were in power before you. <hi>What is man to the Lord? what is his fleſh to the Lord's Spirit?</hi> What great tree could ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the late vehement-wind (where the Lord gave it power) which was terrible and dreadful, tearing up by the very roots, which might be a figure and warning where the Lord gives eyes to reade. After ye have done all ye can, even made Laws as ſtrong as ye can, and put them in the ſtricteſt courſe of execution ye can, one night from the Lord may end the controverſie, and ſhew whether we pleaſe the Lord in obeying him, or ye in making Laws againſt us for our fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and obedience to him.</p>
            <p>And as the Lord is able to overturn you: ſo if ye miſtake your work, miſinterpreting the paſſages of his Providence, and erring in heart concerning the ground of his former diſpleaſure; and ſo (through the error of judgment) ſet your ſelves in oppoſition againſt him, replanting the plants which he will not have grow, and pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the plants of his planting; do ye not in this caſe provoke the Lord, even to put forth the ſtrength which is in him againſt you? We are poor worms: alas, if ye had only us to deal with, we ſhould be nothing in your hands! but if his ſtrength ſtand behind us, we ſhall prove a very burdenſome ſtone, and ye will hardly be able to remove us out of the place wherein God hath ſet us, and where he pleaſeth to have us diſpoſed of. And happy were it for you, if inſtead of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting us, ye your ſelves were drawn to wait for the ſame beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of God (which we have felt) out of the earthly nature into his Life and Nature, and did learn of him to govern in that; then might ye be eſtabliſhed indeed, and be freed from the danger of thoſe ſhakings and overturnings, which God is haſtening upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe ye may be apt to think, that I write theſe things for my own ſake, and the ſakes of my Friends and Companions in the Truth of God, that we might eſcape the ſufferings and ſeverity which we are like to undergo from you, and not ſo mainly and chiefly for your ſakes, leſt ye ſhould bring the wrath of God and miſery upon your ſouls and bodies: to prevent this miſtake in you, I ſhall add what followeth. Indeed this is not the intent of my heart: for I have long expected, and do ſtill expect this cup of outward affliction and perſecution from you, and my heart is quieted and ſatisfied therein, knowing that the Lord will bring glory to his Name and good to us out of it: but I am ſure it is not good for you to afflict us for that which the Lord requireth of us and wherein he accepteth us; and ye will find it the bittereſt work that ever ye went about, and in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36340:4"/>
the end will wiſh that the Lord had rather never given you this day of proſperity, than that he ſhould ſuffer you thus to make uſe of it. Now that ye may the more clearly ſee the temper of my ſpirit, and how my heart ſtands in this thing, I ſhall a little open unto you my faith and hope about it, in theſe enſuing particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I am aſſured in my heart and ſoul, that this deſpiſed people (called <hi>Quakers</hi>) is of the Lord's begetting in his own Life and Nature. Indeed had I not ſeen the power of God in them, and received from the Lord an unqueſtionable Teſtimony concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, I had never looked towards them: for they were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very deſpiſeable in my eyes. And this I cannot but teſtifie concerning them, that I have found the Life of God in me owning them, and that which God hath begotten in my heart refreſhed by the power of Life in them: and none but the Lord knows the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellency of Glory, which he hath hid under this mean ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord hath hitherto preſerved them againſt great oppoſitions, and is ſtill able to preſerve them. Every Power hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath made nothing of over-running them: yet they have hitherto ſtood, by the care and tender mercy of the Lord; and the ſeveral Powers which have perſecuted them, have fallen one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I have had experience my ſelf of the Lord's goodneſs and preſervation of me, in my ſuffering with them for the Teſtimony of his Truth, who made my bonds pleaſant to me, and my noiſom priſon (enough to have deſtroyed my weakly and tenderly-educated nature) a place of pleaſure and delight, where I was comforted by my God night and day, and filled with prayers for his People, as alſo with love to and prayers for thoſe, who had been the means of outwardly-afflicting me and others, upon the Lord's account.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I have no doubt in my heart that the Lord will deliver us. The ſtrength of man, the reſolution of man is nothing in my eye, in compare with the Lord. Whom the Lord loveth, he can ſave at his pleaſure. Hath he begun to break our bonds and deliver us, and ſhall we now diſtruſt him? Are we in a worſe condition than <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> was, when the Sea was before them, the Mountains on each ſide, and the Egyptians behind purſuing them? He indeed that looketh with man's eye, can ſee no ground of hope, nor hardly a poſſibility of deliverance: but to the eye of Faith it is now nearer, than when God began at firſt to deliver.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is the delight of the Lord and his glory to deliver his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36340:5"/>
People, when to the eye of ſence it ſeemeth impoſſible. Then doth the Lord delight to ſtretch forth his Arm, when none elſe can help: and then doth it pleaſe him to deal with the enemies of his Truth and People, when they are lifted up above the fear of him, and are ready to ſay in their hearts concerning them, <hi>They are now in our hands, who can deliver them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, were it not in love to you, and in pitty (in relation to what will certainly befall you, if ye go on in this courſe) I could ſay in the joy of my heart, and in the ſence of the good will of my God to us, who ſuffereth theſe things to come to paſs, <hi>Go on, try it out with the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> come forth with your Laws and Priſons and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our goods and Baniſhment and Death (if the Lord pleaſe) <hi>and ſee if ye can carry it.</hi> For we come not forth againſt you in our own wills, or in any enmity againſt your Perſons or Government, or in any ſtubborneſs or refractorineſs of ſpirit; but with the Lamb-like nature which the Lord our God hath begotten in us, which is taught and enabled by him, both to do his Will and to ſuffer for his Name ſake. And if we cannot thus overcome you (even in patience of ſpirit and in love to you) and if the Lord our God pleaſe not to appear for us, we are content to be overcome by you. So the Will of the Lord be done, ſaith my ſoul.</p>

Now if in your hearts ye ſhall ask me, <hi>What it is to come into the Power of that Religion, which ye your ſelves profeſs?</hi> I ſhall appeal unto your own ſouls, whether it be not this, even <hi>To forſake the Devil and all his works, taking up the Croſs unto your own hearts luſt and corrupt wayes, and under this Croſs</hi> (wherein is the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36340:5"/>
power of God felt by them that mind it, and wait upon God there with humble and ſubject ſpirits) <hi>to fight the battels of Chriſt againſt temptations to ſin and the ſouls enemies, even until death.</hi> Here (if ye will enter at this narrow gate, and walk on in this ſtreight way unto the Kingdom, into which fleſh and blood cannot enter, but the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh nature and earthly ſpirit muſt be left behind) in this Religion, which indeed is the ſubſtance of all true Religion, we can readily meet and unite with you. But if ye will ſet up a form to ſtop the power and progreſs of the Spirit of the Lord, in the hearts of his people in this Nation, and not mind the power of Religion your ſelves, but with vehemency go about to force others to your form (which ye cannot truly ſay is of God, but of man) in this we cannot cloſe with you, but muſt be content in the will of God to ſuffer under you, the time which the Lord hath allotted, which ye cannot go beyond. And bleſſed for ever be the Name of the Lord our God, who hath made us acquainted with that Life and Power, which was before all forms and wayes of Religion and Worſhip of man's inventing, and which will be after them; and who hath hitherto born up our ſpirits in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, which he hath given us to bear to his living Truth and Worſhip, and who we doubt not but will yet bear us up, even to a Conqueſt in his Spirit over all that he hath called us forth to teſtifie againſt. And that great City or building of Religion, which is built up by man's wiſdom and maintained by man's ſtrength, we are ſure is falling and ſhall fall throughout all the Earth: yea man's ſtriving to re-edifie and re-eſtabliſh it, will but make the ruins thereof more ſpeedy and more dreadful. The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, both in the Scriptures of Truth which cannot be broken, and in the hearts of many of his Servants, in this day of his appearance in ſpirit to thoſe, the eyes of whoſe ſpirits he hath opened, and by whom he hath given a Viſit and Warning to the Earth, which the earthly ear cannot hear, but will be overtaken and ſurprized with <hi>the Day of the Lord:</hi> and O what running and ſeeking will there be <hi>to the rocks, and hills, and mountains for an hiding-place from the wrath of the Lamb,</hi> but none will be then found. O miſerable earthly-ſpirited man (who haſt paſſed away thy time in a dream, and haſt little minded or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the ſalvation of thy ſoul, or conſidered what thy preſent vain pleaſures and courſes would tend to) what wilt thou then do? <hi>There is a pit prepared for the wicked</hi> (I ſpeak not an imagination of mine own, indeed it is the Truth of God.) Now the Lord ſeeks the ſouls of loſt men to ſave them from the pit: but <hi>their ears are dull of hearing, their eyes vailed, their hearts groſly fatted and made inſenſible with the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36340:6"/>
ſences and delights of the earthly nature, and the Voice of God</hi> (with the things that concern their eternal peace, yea their preſent welfare alſo) <hi>cannot enter into them</hi>; and ſo they let ſlip the time of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and waſte away the ſeaſon of their Viſitation, hardly ever ſo much as thinking what will become of them in the end. <hi>O Lord my God, awaken thy poor creatures, that they may live and not dye: ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let thy Judgments break forth to awaken them, than that they ſhould thus run on towards utter deſtruction, even to periſh from thy Life and Bleſſedneſs, and to be ſwallowed up in the miſery, torment and wrath due to that nature, which they have contracted and wallowed like ſwine in.</hi> Every nature, principle and ſpirit is travelling towards its end. O man, take heed what nature thou art of, in what principle and ſpirit thou acteſt, and towards what thou travelleſt. And remember that God loveth his creature; thy deſtruction is not of him, if thou periſh: but in him is thy help, if thou hearken to his Voice, and turn at the Reproofs of <hi>that</hi> which he hath placed near thee, even in thy heart to reprove ſin in thee, and to beget thee into the love and holineſs of his Life and Nature, leavening thee into a new man, as thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comeſt ſubject to the checks and leadings thereof. This is pleaſing to the Lord; that which proceeds from this, and is performed in this, is the true Worſhip, and not that which man hath invented, and with which the earthly nature is quieted and ſatisfied, but the power of Life turns from.</p>

               <hi>It is the great mercy of the Lord to ſtop any man in the way of his error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and happy is he that is ſtopped by him.</hi>

            <p>YEt one thing, perhaps as my laſt unto you, let me freely propoſe: and be not haſty in ſpirit, but wait on God for skill and ability to weigh the thing aright, and to give an upright anſwer thereto, as before him, in the ſecrets of your conſciences. It is briefly this, <hi>Why may not the power of Religion be permitted to flouriſh under you? can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the Government of God's Spirit and your Government ſtand together?</hi> I beſeech you conſider it. No man knoweth how ſhort his time is, nor what is to come after his preſent determination of things. It is now your day: O that ye had the true Light to walk by in it, that ye might not afterwards repent, and that my heart might be gladded concerning you, who have ſo prayed for you, as if I had felt mine own ſoul in your conditions.</p>
