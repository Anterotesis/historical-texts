            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>News from</hi> Chartham, <hi>in</hi> KENT.</head>
            <p>ALthough it may, and perhaps must be granted, that <hi>Miracles</hi> (strictly understood) are long since ceased: yet in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the notion, comprehending all things uncouth and strange, <hi>(miranda,</hi> as well as <hi>miracula;</hi> wonders, as well as miracles) they are not so: but do, more, or less, somewhere, or other, dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert, and shew themselves. <hi>Dies Diem docet.</hi> New days, make new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries; especially to such, as are in any measure, curious, (shall I say) or ingenious, and inquisitive; as few enough amongst us here in <hi>England</hi> are, unless acted and animated by some profit, or advantage to themselves by the discovery; how considerable and remarkable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be otherwise. 'Tis true, <hi>New lights,</hi> are now adays much cried up: but as in matters (mostly) of Religion; so (if you mark it) by whom? But such, as not so much for conscience, as for lucre-sake, broach and obtrude them upon a credulous giddy sort of people, whose applause they first catch, and then, their purses. But leaving these spiritual Mountebanks, and their counterfeit ware, <hi>new lights</hi> only in pretence; I shall here acquaint you with a piece of new light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but of another kind, presented and held forth upon no account, or aim at all of profit, or advantage to the publisher; but (if he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes not) of good use and profit (in point of knowledge) unto others, (learned <hi>Antiquaries,</hi> and <hi>Naturalists,</hi> as I suppose) of more skill, insight and judgment, (if they please to employ them on this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) in things so rare and extraordinary, then he can, doth, or would be thought to pretend unto. Well, to the matter of fact then.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Somner,</hi> in the moneth of <hi>September,</hi> 1668. sinking a Well at a new House of his, in <hi>Chartham,</hi> a Village about three miles from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> towards <hi>Ashford,</hi> on a shelving ground, or bankside, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twelve rods of the River, running from thence to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and so, to <hi>Sandwich</hi> Haven; and digging, for that purpose, about seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37360:4"/>
foot deep, through gravelly and chalky ground, and two foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Springs; there, met with, took, and turned up a parcel of strange and monstrous Bones, some whole, some broken, together with four Teeth, perfect and sound, but in a manner petrified, and turned into Stone; weighing, (each Tooth) something above half a pound, and almost as big (some of them) as a mans fist. Cheek-Teeth, or Grinders, as to the form, they are all, not much unlike, but for the bigness, the Grinders of a man. And whereas I said, <hi>almost as big, some of them, as a mans fist:</hi> it brings to my remembrance, what I have read in <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> of such a Tooth, but a little bigger; <hi>(dens molaris pugno major;</hi> he saith: that is, <hi>a Cheek-Tooth, bigger than a fist)</hi> which was shewed to him for one of St. <hi>Christophers</hi> Teeth, and was kept in a Church, that bare his name: which whether he believed, or not, I know not: but contradict it, he doth not, I am sure; neither he, nor his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed companion, whom he doth name there. Just such another Tooth <hi>of the bigness,</hi> he saith, <hi>of an ordinary fist,</hi> was seen by <hi>Acosta,</hi> (a very credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Author) in the <hi>Indies,</hi> digged out of the ground, in one of their houses there, with many other bones; which put together, represented a man, of a formidable, or as he speaketh, <hi>deformed bigness:</hi> or, <hi>greatness:</hi> as he judged of it. And so must we have judged of these Teeth, and of the body, to which they belonged; had not other Bones been found with them, which could not be mans Bones. Some that have seen them, by the Teeth, and some other circumstances, are of opinion, that they are the Bones of an <hi>Hippopotamus,</hi> or <hi>Equus Fluvialis;</hi> that is, <hi>a River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse;</hi> for a <hi>Sea-horse,</hi> as commonly understood, and exhibited, is a ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious thing. Yet <hi>Pliny</hi> makes <hi>Hippopotamum, (mari, terrae, amni communem)</hi> to belong to <hi>Sea, Land</hi> and <hi>Rivers.</hi> But what are the differences and properties of each kind, I leave to others to inquire. The Earth or Mould about them, and in which they all lay, being like a Sea-earth, or Fulling-earth, not a stone in it, unless you dig three foot deeper, and then it rises a perfect gravel.</p>
            <p>So have you the story, an account, if you please, of what was found, where, when, and upon what occasion. For more publick satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to facilitate the discovery; at least, to help such, as are minded
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37360:4"/>
to employ their skill in guessing and judging of the Creature, whose remains these are, what it was for kind; we have by, and with the help of an able Limner, adventured on a Scheme, or Figure, of several of the Teeth and Bones, with their respective dimensions, of breadth, length, and thickness.</p>
            <p>No man, we conceive, not willing to be censured of rashness, will be very forward to divine, much less to define or determine, what the Creature was; and doubtless dubious enough it is, whether of the twain, the Sea, or the Land may more rightly lay claim unto it. But leaving all others to the freedom of their own judgments and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; if he may have the same liberty from them for his, who as he knows the place, with the Country about it, hath taken a large time of consideration of all particulars and circumstances fit to be duly and deliberately weighed and observed in the case; he would adventure to conjecture it to be some Marine, or Sea-bred Creature, to which the Land can of right lay no claim. But admitting that (supposing it, I mean, a Sea-bred Creature) how then (will some say) should it possibly come there? <hi>Piscis in arido?</hi> and at such a depth under ground too? I answer, first, with as little wonder, as a Land creature should, which who with reason can imagine to have ever had at first so deep a burial? Next I say, the Mould, Soil or Earth, wherein it lay, was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether miry, like to that <hi>coenum (oase,</hi> some call it) on many parts of the Sea coast, both in <hi>England</hi> and abroad. But how possibly (will it be said) a Sea creature, when found at so remote a distance from the Sea? For solution (if it may be) of this, and the like incidental doubts, and removing all rubs out of the way of this conjecture; our future dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and further progress in this argument, shall branch it self out into these four following Queries.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether the situation and condition, face and figure of the place may possibly admit of the Seas once insinuating it self thither?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether (that possibility being granted, or evinced) the Sea did ever actually insinuate it self so far as to this place, and when?</p>
            <p n="3">3. How in probability, and when this Valley, or Level being once Sea land, should come to be so quite deserted and forsaken of the Sea,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37360:5"/>
as it is at this day; the Sea not approaching by so many, a dozen miles, or more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By what means, the Sea once having its play there, this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comes to lodge, and be found so deep in the ground, and under such a shelving bank.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for the first (the places capacity and aptitude for the Seas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux, or insinuation) such as know the situation, withal cannot but know, and must agree it to be so. As for strangers, and such as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the place, for perfecting their information in what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the common Maps, or a particular Scheme and draught of the Level, herewith intended, may chance to be defective in; they may please to know, that the place <hi>(the locus loci)</hi> we are upon, is a part of that wide, fair and fruitful Level, or Valley, extending it self not less than twenty Miles in length, between a continued series and range of Hills, Downs, or high grounds, lying at a pretty equal distance each from other all the way; beginning at the <hi>East-Kentish</hi> shore, and stretching it self, Westward, by <hi>Sandwich, Fordwich, Canterbury, Chartham, Chilham, Godmersham, Wy, Ashford,</hi> sometime in a direct, sometime in a winding course, as far at length, as to that famous spacious Level of <hi>Romney-marsh,</hi> and is washed and watered all along, at least from about <hi>Ashford,</hi> by a sweet and pleasant River running through the midst of it, as far as to <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and there by the Creek, or Haven, emptying it self into the Sea: nothing at all of obstruction, by the interposition of Hills, or high grounds, hindring, or controlling the Seas free play and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for so many miles together. The place then, with the parts, the tract above and below it, from the condition, or constitution of it, is plainly not unapt or uncapable of the Seas insinuation and influence.</p>
            <p>If any shall object, <hi>Canterburies</hi> being in the way, as an obstruction, or bar; they are easily enough answered. For although that City seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and indeed is, at this day, for the most part somewhat elevated above the pitch of the rest of the Valley or Level we are upon; yet not so much, as to desend it self many times from flouds, and overflowings in the lower, and most depressed parts of it, even by the Springs it stands upon, to her great damage and annoyance: towards the helping
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37360:5"/>
whereof, by the care and providence of former ages, it is very certain, and by digging Wells, Vaults, Cellars and the like, dayly experimented, that the most part of the City, not excepting the very heart and center of it, is made and raised ground; the tokens of foundations upon foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, to a very considerable depth, daily appearing, and the ground (as at <hi>Amsterdam, Venice</hi> and elsewhere) for supporting superstructures, in several places often stuck and stuff'd with Piles of wood, or long Poles and Stakes, forced into the ground, as Wells and Cellar-diggers have inform'd me. Nay, and as if where about now the Bull-stake market-place is kept, the River had sometime had its course or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, Pits and otherlike Tanners Utensils, have, not many years since, been met withal in digging for Cellars thereabouts. To this let me add, that my very next neighbour in <hi>Castle-street,</hi> within these thirty years sinking a Cellar, did at a good depth <hi>(five or six foot deep)</hi> light upon, and was put to some stop and stand, in his work, by a strong and well couched arched piece of <hi>Roman</hi> Tile or Brick, which he was fain to take, or break asunder, and remove, before he could proceed. Hereof I wàs an eye witness, and (for curiosity sake) took one of the Bricks or Tiles to my self, which with some other like <hi>Roman</hi> remains (some found in that, which is my own Garden) I keep by me to this day. However then, <hi>Canterbury</hi> may now seem to stand in the <hi>Aestua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> way; yet time was, when in probability it did not; when I mean the place, the soil which now the City occupies, as the rest of the whole valley both above and below it, was of too low a pitch, to be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the second enquiry, (whether probably the Sea did ever actually insinuate it self so far as to this place, and when) the answer is nothing so easie: Record of it, we have none. The best and eldest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we have now of the Condition, Scite and Constitution of these our Eastern Parts and Tract, we owe to <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> after him: from whom (alas) we have not the least spark of light to such a discovery: rather indeed the contrary; both the Sea-coast, and In-land parts, by his, and their relation; bearing in a manner one and the same face and figure then, as now. However, that the Level we

are upon, was sometime an <hi>Aestuary,</hi> or Arm of the Sea; several <hi>Criteria,</hi> or tokens, are not wanting. For example; besides what may be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inferr'd from this parcel of strange Teeth, and Bones now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der consideration; much (as I conceive) there is of probability for it, resulting from our Rivers name of <hi>Stoure,</hi> more anciently, not seldom both called and written <hi>Aesture, Esture,</hi> &amp;c. which I doubt not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and come from the Latin <hi>Aestuarium,</hi> and in process of time to have been corrupted and contracted into <hi>Sture</hi> and <hi>Stoure;</hi> giving name in part to <hi>Stourmouth,</hi> a place (a Parish) about six miles Eastward from <hi>Canterbury;</hi> so called from the Rivers disimboying there into the Sea, or Salt-water, flowing up thither: as also giving name to that Mannor of the Archbishops; at this day, and for some ages past called <hi>Westgate-Court,</hi> at <hi>Canterbury;</hi> but more anciently, as in the Conquerors time (witness <hi>Domesday-</hi>book) called, the Mannor of <hi>Esture</hi> and <hi>Esturesaete,</hi> from its situation by the <hi>Sture</hi> or <hi>Stoure.</hi> From which occasion doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, the late Lord <hi>Finches</hi> Seat in—about five or six miles nearer to the Spring head, at this day vulgarly miscalled, <hi>East-Steward;</hi> is of old sometime called <hi>Esture,</hi> sometime <hi>Aet-sture.</hi> From <hi>Saxon</hi> Monuments and Records I could easily trace the name up to a very high date, by many examples.</p>
            <p>But to leave that, and proceed to other <hi>Criteria;</hi> as by the Teeth and Bones now under consideration, we have an instance on that side of the Valley for the probability of the Seas <hi>quondam</hi> occupation of it; so I shall give you here another no less remarkable from the other, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site side of it. By credible relation and assurance then you may know, that at a place called <hi>Westbere,</hi> an obscure Village, about three miles from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Eastward, lying under the brow of the Hill stretching out by <hi>Upstreete,</hi> as far as to the West end of <hi>Sarr-wall,</hi> by which you make your entrance into <hi>Thanet;</hi> upon the like occasion to that here at <hi>Chartham,</hi> (the digging, or sinking of a Well) at a very great depth, store of Oyster and otherlike shells, together with an Iron Anchor, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rm and unimpaired, were found and turned up in our time. The like I have been told of an Anchor in our days digged up at <hi>Broome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe,</hi> on the same side of the Level somewhat above <hi>Canterbury,</hi> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

And although I can at present instance only in these few on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side the Valley; yet happily upon enquiry other might be found for confirming our conjecture. And I shall desire and hope, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ingenuous person will so fat oblige and incourage me, as upon this overture to help me in this research and scrutiny, by imparting to me, what either of his own knowledge, or credible relation from others, may conduce towards so noble a discovery.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mean time let us entertain our selves with our third Query, and see if happily somewhat may not thence result adminicular and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletory to what may be defective and wanting in the former. Our third Query now is, how in probability, and when this Valley or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, being once Sea-land, should come to be so quite deserted, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of the Sea, as it is at this day, the Sea not approaching it by so many, a dozen miles, or more? In answer whereof, I must needs say and grant, that in case this Level were once Sea, an <hi>Aestuary</hi> I mean, or Arm of it; so very long it was ago, as we may not reasonably think, that <hi>Canterbury</hi> (whether as a City, or never so mean a <hi>Pagus,</hi> or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage) was then <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> or a place inhabited; which happily it may have been, if not as long as <hi>Julius Caesars</hi> days, yet undoubtedly, not longafter. For an account we have of it (as of some other places in <hi>Kent)</hi> in the <hi>Romans</hi> time, both from <hi>Ptolemy</hi> the Geographer, <hi>Antoninus Itinerary</hi> and elsewhere. Now (as was hinted erewhile) elder Records either of <hi>Kent,</hi> or of <hi>Britain</hi> that we may confide in, as Authentick; we have none that I know of, before the <hi>Romans</hi> time: no written cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible evidences to help us in this scrutiny. We must therefore either sit us down, and rest contented to throw off all further inquiry, or else cast about for information as we can. Such as are for this latter, will tell you, that the world (all know) is very aged, many thousand years old, and that many and manifold are the alterations, changes and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which time hath made in several parts and quarters of the world, to the notice and discovery whereof, no written Record, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Tradition at this day, can reach or direct us; Tradition it self (longer liv'd many times than any written evidence) failing us for age. Of such a nature they conceive may this of the <hi>Aestuary</hi> be, so very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37360:7"/>
as time hath quite worn out the memory of it; withdrawn all light from us, that might conduct us in the scrutiny, and left us as men in the dark, without either <hi>vola,</hi> or <hi>vestigium,</hi> to stumble out our way, and rome and ramble at uncertainties. Such a one happily shall he be thought, that adventuring to conjecture at the reason and occasion of the Seas recess here, with an absolute valediction to the place of its wonted resort, shall pitch upon the Seas breaking, bursting and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving asunder that <hi>Isthmus,</hi> or neck of Land, between <hi>Gaule</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> rendring the latter of the same Continent with the former, such things (tis certain) have hapned elsewhere. Thus (saith <hi>Seneca)</hi> hath the Sea rent <hi>Spain,</hi> from the Continent of <hi>Africk.</hi> Thus (as he adds) by <hi>Deucalions</hi> flood, was <hi>Sicily</hi> cut from <hi>Italy.</hi> More instances of this kind may be found in Mr. <hi>Cambdens Cantium,</hi> and elsewhere. And although there be no certain evidence of such an accident here from ancient ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Historians, or Geographers; yet is the thing so strongly and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally argued, by him especially, as by <hi>Verstegan</hi> also, <hi>Twine</hi> and others before him; and the conjecture back'd with such plenty of pregnant and probable <hi>Criteria,</hi> by the former; that what others may think I know not; but were I of the Jury, I should more than incline to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with them, who would find for the <hi>Isthmus.</hi> Especially, when to the plenty of Arguments mustered up by Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> I shall have contributed this one, by him and the rest omitted, which is, that by a received constant Tradition, <hi>Romney-Marsh,</hi> that large and spacious Level, containing (saith Mr. <hi>Cambden)</hi> fourteen miles in length, and eight in breadth; was sometime Sea-land, lying wholly under Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, and is therefore of some not improperly called, the Seas gift; which having, when time was, forsaken it, and withdrawn his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted influence from it; the place thereupon became and continues firm Land. And if I may guess at the time and occasion of both that, and our <hi>Canterbury</hi> Levels recovery and riddance from the Sea, I shall (for my part, with submission to better judgments) be apt to pitch upon that of the Seas breaking through, and in time working and washing away that <hi>Isthmus,</hi> between Us and <hi>France.</hi> And then whereas before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <hi>Romney</hi> Level (which had and hath its <hi>Stoures</hi> too, or <hi>Aestuaria</hi> as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37360:7"/>
well as ours) and this other, not improbably (no high Lands, as we see, interposing for impeding their conjunotion) were but one and the same Level, and lay under the Seas and Salt-waters tyranny; now both the one and the other (the Sea having so much more play and elbow-room, than formerly by cleaving asunder the <hi>Isthmus)</hi> were rescued from it, and of an <hi>Aestuary,</hi> became such a rich and noble Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, or Level, as is second to none (I take it) in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am resolved to keep home and conceive my self no further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned than in our own Level. But if from hence any other shall take an hint to consider of the <hi>Nether-lands,</hi> or <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and enquire whether those in whole, or in part, may not have arisen out of, and been gained from the Sea, by the very same occasion, which is here conjecturally assigned for our <hi>Kentish</hi> Low-lands; I shall not at all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it, thinking it (for my part) a task not unworthy a learned, judicious, sober undertaker: and were I as much concern'd, and as well instructed there as here, I should not know how to purge my self of negligence, if I did not undertake it with the first.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To come, at length, to the fourth and last of our Queries, by what means the Sea once having its play there, (at <hi>Chartham)</hi> this Creature comes to lye and be found so deep in the ground, and under such a shelving bank? My answer is, that supposing this with the rest of the Level or Valley once occupied by the Sea, or Salt-water, that being a Creature which by fluxes and refluxes always is in motion, and thereby in time beating upon and working itself into the bank, or rising ground there, might at length so far undermine, eat into, and loosen it, as to fetch down so much mould, or earth upon, or over the place, as might lodge the Creature at so great a depth. Or else perhaps, the continual agitation of the Water might in time force, drive up, and cast over it, that great quantity of Ouse, Earth and other matter under which it lay. By the way, it is observed that the nature of the Soil here and there, is such, so loose, supple, rotten, and sandy, that meerly of it self, it is apt to sink and fall in; as was lately experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by a Saw-pit, digg'd hard by, which after a little time by the Earths giving way on each side of it, fell in, and fill'd up it self.</p>

Thus have you (gentle Readers) our <hi>Chartham News,</hi> or discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with the circumstances, and the use my little skill will serve me to make of them, in point either of History or Geography. <hi>Arcana</hi> they are, but whether <hi>tanti;</hi> whether I mean, grateful, or useful to the Publick, is left to the judicious Antiquaries, Naturalist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who are desired to take the matter, where the Historian hath left it. It hath been the Finders care, and good will, as to preserve, so to expose and communicate what he hath found: and if at length, to this of the parts, and by them, a full discovery of the whole, by the skill and dexterity of the learned in the School, and secrets of Nature, may be added, for the benefit of the Common-wealth of learning; both the Finder, and Relator will think their time and pains very well both bestowed, and recompensed.</p>
