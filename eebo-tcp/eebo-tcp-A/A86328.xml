            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <list>
               <item>1. Becauſe in their writings there is abundance of ſuperfluous words, by which they darken the counſel of God, and labour to ſubvert them that read and hear them, but we are commanded to <hi>lay aſide all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of naughtineſs, and to receive the ingrafted word of
<pb facs="tcp:118449:3"/>
God, which is able to ſave our ſouls,</hi> James. 1.21.</item>
               <item>2. Becauſe in the multitude of words there wants no ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.19. therefore I ſhall take heed of uſing any more then need.</item>
               <item>3. Large Volumes are in danger never to be read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; becauſe ſome will not, and others are poor, and cannot ſpare time or money for them.</item>
               <item>4. Becauſe I am commanded not to anſwer a fool according to his fooliſhneſs, leſt I be like him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.4. Now if theſe men have ſpoken many words wherein there wants no ſin, and have not conſented to wholſome words, even the words of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and the doctrine which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to godlineſs; then they <hi>are fools, knowing nothing, (as they ought to know)</hi> 1 Tim. 6.3, 4. <hi>but doting about queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſtrifes of words, whereof cometh envie, ſtrife, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, evil ſurmiſings, perverſe diſputings of men of corrupt mindes, and deſtitute of the truth; ſuppoſing that gain</hi> (viz. an hundred or two a year) <hi>is godlineſs: from ſuch</hi> we are commanded to <hi>turne away,</hi> and <hi>withdraw</hi> our ſelves: therefore none can juſtly take exception at theſe words: for if it doth appear ſtill, when the Reader hath peruſed my lines, that there is no folly in their words, then my folly will returne upon my ſelf, and they and their cauſe will be exalted.</item>

            <p>
               <hi>To this alſo agreeth the words of</hi> Peter, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5. If ye have taſted that the Lord is gracious, to whom coming, as unto a living ſtone, diſallowed indeed of men, but choſen of God, and precious, ye alſo, as living ſtones, are built up a ſpiritual houſe, an holy Prieſthood to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices holy and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>And again, it is alſo plain in the words of Chriſt to</hi> Peter, <hi>when</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid,</hi> Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God <hi>(then ſaith Chriſt to him)</hi> Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. <hi>Obſerve upon what Rock; not</hi> Peter, <hi>as the Papiſts ſay, for</hi> Peter <hi>is called</hi> a ſtone, <hi>but Chriſt is called a Rock,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.4. for they drank of that Rock which followed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118449:6"/>
them, and that Rock was Chriſt: <hi>and who, that is a Chriſtian, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that the Church of Chriſt is built upon the Rock Chriſt? and therefore</hi> David <hi>ſaith,</hi> 2 Sam. 22.2. The Lord is my Rock, fortreſs and deliverer: <hi>and verſe</hi> 47. The Lord liveth, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the God of the Rock of my ſalvation, <hi>&amp;c.

                  </gap> Queſtion is,</hi> How the Saints may or ought to build upon this Rock Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which is cleerly anſwered by theſe following Scriptures,</hi> Mat. <hi>7.24. in theſe words:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine and doth them, I will l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ken him to a wiſe man that built his houſe upon a Rock: and the rain deſcended, and the floods came and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe; and it fell not, becauſe it was founded upon a Rock. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From all which we learn that to build upon the Rock Chriſt, is to hear his ſayings, and do them: and thoſe that hear his ſayings, and do them not, are</hi> likened unto a fooliſh man that built his houſe upon the ſand <hi>&amp;c. and to this agreeth the ſaying of the Apoſtle,</hi> Act. 3.22, 23. for Moſes truly ſaid to the Fathers, A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you, of your brethren, like unto me; him ſhall ye hear, in all all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you: and it ſhall come to paſs, that every ſoul that will not hear that Prophet, ſhall be deſtroyed from the people: <hi>and that deſtruction is</hi> an ever laſting deſtruction from the preſence of God, and the glory of his power, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8 9. <hi>Now ſeeing theſe things are ſo, it ſtandeth every ſoul in hand to ſearch after the ſayings of this great Prophet Chriſt Jeſus; and in ſearching they ſhall finde, that he ſharply reproveth all thoſe that call him,</hi> Lord Lord <hi>and yet do not the things which he ſaith:</hi> Luke 6.46. <hi>and ſo ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.4. He that ſaith I knew him and keepeth not his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, is a lyer and the truth is not in him: <hi>and</hi> all Lyers ſhall have their part in that Lake which burreth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21 8. <hi>And thus we ſee the imminent danger that all thoſe are in, which ſay or think they are Chriſtians, and that they know Chriſt, and will call him Lord, Lord; and yet not do the things that he hath commanded them, nor keep his ſayings: the which danger to prevent, I ſhall briefly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118449:6"/>
by putting down his Commandments and ſayings in order as they were ſpoken by him, and practiſed by his Apoſtles and Saints in that generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And firſt, The ſayings of the Lord Chriſt after his Reſurrection, when he had obtained of God the Father</hi> all power both in heaven and earth, <hi>are as followeth,</hi> Mat. 28.18.19.20. And Jeſus came and ſpake unto them ſaying. All power is given unto me both in heaven and in earth: go ye therefore and teach all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you: and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this agreeth his words in Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. And he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature: he that believeth and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe are the words, ſayings, and Commandments of the Lord Chriſt, which we ought to hear and obey as aforeſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From all which words we obſerve, 1 That he commanded the Goſpel to be preached to every creature, or all Nations. 2 The end was, that they might believe it. 3 That thoſe which did believe it, ſhould be baptized into his name. 4 That thoſe baptized believers were after to be taught to obſerve all other things whatſoever Chriſt had commanded his Apoſtles to teach them. 5 To this practice,</hi> viz. <hi>to a people thus walking according to this rule, hearing his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and doing them, the Lord Chriſt hath promiſed his preſence, ſaying,</hi> And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world: <hi>but the end of the world is not yet, therefore Chriſt is ſtill with thoſe baptized believers which do thus walk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus have I ſhewed the order of the words, as they were ſpoken by the Lord himſelf: I ſhall now proceed to the example of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and ſee whether they did act accordingly, or whether they baptized children, as well as believing men and women; or whether</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt did baptize any children. And if it can be proved by any word of God, that any baptized little babes that cannot ſpeak or underſtand, then I confeſs they that practiſe it may be born with; and they which cry it down as Antichriſtian, ſuperſtition, and mans traditions, may be to blame: now therefore to the words and teſtimonies of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:118449:7"/>
               <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.3.4.5. <hi>where we read firſt, of</hi> the voice, of one crying in the wilderneſs, <hi>to</hi> prepare the way of the Lord, and to make his paths ſtraight: <hi>Secondly, that</hi> John <hi>baptized in that wilderneſs: and whom he baptized, is evident in the following words:</hi> And he preacht the Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of ſins: and there went out unto him all the Land of Judea, and they of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and were all baptized of him in the River of Jordan, confeſſing their ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus we ſee that all that were baptized of</hi> John <hi>of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of</hi> Judea <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>were ſuch as could and did confeſs their ſins. But little children that cannot ſpeak, cannot confeſs their ſins; therefore, none ſuch were baptized by</hi> John. <hi>See alſo</hi> Matth. 3.5 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus it being cleer by the Scriptures that</hi> John <hi>baptized men and women that could believe and confeſs their ſins, and not a word ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of ſucking children, I ſhall now proceed to the works of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, to whom Chriſt gave Commiſſion as aforeſaid, and ſee what they practiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Act. 2.40.41. <hi>we read; that</hi> when they preached and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people with many words to ſave themſelves from that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward generation, then they that gladly received his word, were baptized and added to the Church, &amp;c. <hi>But little babes of eight days, weeks, or months old, cannot gladly receive the word of God, becauſe they underſtand it not; therefore none ſuch were baptized there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But ſome will object, from ver.</hi> 39. <hi>that</hi> the Promiſe was to them and their children; and therefore children may be baptized.</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>I grant, the Promiſe was to them,</hi> verſ.38. <hi>that if they did repent; and be baptized in the name of Chriſt for the Remiſſion of ſins; they ſhould receive the gift of the Holy-Ghoſt: and this is true alſo to their children, if they did repent and obey the Goſpel, as aforeſaid: and ſo it is</hi> to us and to our children, <hi>though never ſo</hi> far off, <hi>upon the ſame condition of Faith, Repentance, and Baptiſm: for it is</hi> to all that the Lord our God ſhall call: <hi>but they muſt be</hi> called <hi>firſt, obſerve that,</hi> ver. 39. <hi>And thus is the objection fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, If ever the Apoſtle baptized children, it muſt needs be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118449:7"/>
now, according to their Argument who ſay,</hi> the Promiſe is to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>and therefore. But that they baptized no ſuch children, is evident, becauſe they that were baptized, were ſuch as could and did</hi> gladly receive the word, and continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine and fellowſhip, and breaking of bread and Prayer: <hi>all which little babes, that cannot ſpeak words, nor underſtand Reaſon, cannot poſſibly do: therefore none ſuch baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next place is</hi> Act. 8.12. <hi>where we read that</hi> when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were baptized both men and women, <hi>in expreſs terms: but we never read a word of little children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> ver. 36, 37. <hi>we read that the Eunuch ſaid to</hi> Philip, See, here is water, what hinders me to be baptized? and Philip ſaid, If thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou mayeſt. <hi>But ſuch lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle babes as theſe baptize, cannot believe with all their hearts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may not be baptized; neither do we yet in the leaſt ſee that any ſuch were baptized by the Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next is</hi> Act. 10.46, 47 48. <hi>in theſe words,</hi> Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized that have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Holy Ghoſt as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Ieſus. <hi>By all which we ſee, that no ſuch babes were here baptized: for all that were in this place baptized, were ſuch as had received the Holy Ghoſt as well as the Apoſtles: and</hi> they heard them ſpeak with tongues and magnifie God; <hi>which children, that cannot ſpeak at all, cannot poſſibly do, all rational men will grant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next is</hi> Lydia <hi>and her houſhould,</hi> Act. 16.14, 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now ſome ſay thus;</hi> Who knows but ſhe might have little children?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which I anſwer, if none know, then all ought to be ſilent, and not to believe and affirm things they know not; for that is wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly: but thus much we know: 1 That Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to baptize them which believed. 2 Hitherto we have found them baptizing of none elſe. 3 The Scripture ſpeaks of no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhe had, nor yet of any husband; and therefore ſilence gives no commands to obey, nor no Promiſes to believe, nor no examples to follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118449:8"/>
               <hi>Again, if ſhe had an husband, he was baptized; for ſhe and her houſhoald were baptized. Now if he had been baptized, he would ſurely have born the name in the hiſtory, rather then ſhe, being the head of the houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, we read,</hi> ver. 40. <hi>that when</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas <hi>came out of priſon,</hi> they entred into the houſe of Lydia, and comforted the brethren, and departed: <hi>but little babes are not capable of ſuch comfort, therefore no ſuch brethren in</hi> Lydia's <hi>houſe, nor any ground at all to believe it from Scripture nor Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next is the Jaylor, who</hi> was baptized with his houſhould: <hi>from whence ſome would draw the ſame Argument as from</hi> Lydia's, <hi>and perſwade us that there were children in his houſe: but the Text is plain againſt it; for it ſaith,</hi> Act. 16.32, 33 34. <hi>that</hi> they ſpake the word of the Lord to him, and to all in his houſe: and he took them the ſame hour of the night, and waſhed their ſtripes, and was baptized he and all his, ſtraight ways: and when he had brought them into his houſe, he ſet meat before them, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced believing in God with all his houſe. <hi>Thus the Scripture in plain words as it ſaith the one, that</hi> he and all his were baptized: <hi>ſo alſo it ſaith,</hi> he with all his houſe believed in God: <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Mr.</hi> Cook <hi>will evade the one by his learned Expoſition, in his 17 page, he may as well evade the other, and ſo conclude that none but he was baptized. But conſider the reſult of his labours: when he hath laboured by all his wit and skill to pervert the Text yet he confeſſeth that the</hi> Syriack. <hi>Tranſlation reads it thus:</hi> And he exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all the children of his houſe, <hi>even all of them,</hi> in the Faith of God. <hi>I pray let all rational men conſider what difference is between their all rejoycing and believing God, and exulting even all of them in the Faith of God; but that the man labours to</hi> dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Counſel of God by <hi>theſe words</hi> words without knowledge, <hi>As in Job 38.2. And thus</hi> the Lord taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſs: <hi>and</hi> the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wiſe that they are vain, 1 Cor. 3.19.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But one thing more I had like to have forgotten,</hi> viz. <hi>his ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſophiſtical anſwer to</hi> Act. 8.12. <hi>where the Text ſaith plainly, that</hi> when they believed, they were baptized both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>To this he anſwereth in his 16 page, that theſe words</hi> men and women <hi>are applyable to ſexes rather then to ages; and inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118449:8"/>
in</hi> Evah, <hi>who when</hi> Cain <hi>was born, ſhe ſaid,</hi> I have gotten a man from the Lord. <hi>But what is this to our purpoſe? for ſhe doth not ſay that this man believed the things concerning the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Jeſus Chriſt: but thoſe men and women,</hi> Act. 8.12. <hi>were ſuch as believed all theſe things: therefore your Argument is falſe, and your ſelf deceitful, and</hi> wiſe to do evil, <hi>as appeareth by this your</hi> cunning craftineſse, wherewith you lye in wait to deceive, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the laſt Text is (in</hi> Act. 18.8.) <hi>that</hi> Criſpus the chief Ruler believed in the Lord with all his houſe: and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed, and were baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus we have ſeen the command of Chriſt, and the practice of the Apoſtles agreeing together; by which the foundation of the Saints is diſcovered, upon which they ought to build, which is the words and ſayings of Chirſt, and the practice and example of his holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: but not a word that I can finde in all the holy Scriptures, or ſayings of Chriſt, the Prophets, or Apoſtles, about the Baptizing in a Font, nor baptizing little infants, that can neither ſpeak nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: my, not ſo much as the name of that abominable Idol the Font, is once mentioned in all the holy Scriptures; much leſs that the people of God ſhould ſacrifice their children to it, as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael <hi>once ſacrificed their Babes to</hi> Molech: <hi>See</hi> Jer. 32.35. <hi>Therefore we may moſt ſafely conclude, that it is none of the Councel of God: for</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> Act. 20.27. I declare unto you the whole Counſel of God: <hi>but in all</hi> Pauls <hi>writings, it is nowhere declared: therefore it is none of Gods Counſels, nor for us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now ſeeing there is no foundation nor footing for the Font, nor Infant-baptiſm in all the word of God, we muſt (if we will diſcover it) ſeek for it ſomewhere elſe: the which I confeſs is not worth the doing, were it not to diſcover and make manifeſt the folly of them that</hi> uncover it, <hi>and</hi> guard it, <hi>for infants baptiſm; and to that end, I ſhall do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Look into a book intituled</hi> A view of the Civill and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law, <hi>written by Sir</hi> Thomas Ridley <hi>Knight, and Doctor of the Civill Law, printed by</hi> William Turner <hi>Printer to the Univerſity of</hi> Oxford, 1634. <hi>(Cum privilegio.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In that book, pag. 176. he, although an enemy to us, yet confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118449:9"/>
that,</hi> the Rites of baptiſme in the primitive times were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Rivers and Fountaines where the perſons baptized re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Sacrament: and this manner of baptizing <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> the ancient Church entertained, from the example of Chriſt, who was baptized of <hi>John</hi> in the river of <hi>Jordan: and ſome ſay,</hi> that this was very tolerable in the of Eaſtern parts; <hi>but (ſaith he)</hi> moſt certaine it is, that it was moſt convenient for that time, becauſe their Converts were many, and men of years; a reaſon alſo may be <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> for that thoſe ages were otherwiſe unprovided of Fonts, and ſuch conveniences as are now in uſe. <hi>(Thus he confeſſeth that Fonts were not then in uſe.) Againe, ſaith he,</hi> And this hath been the cauſe why this manner of baptizing was reſumed in after-times, and other places: for <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> our venerable <hi>Bede</hi> telleth us of ſome that were baptized here in <hi>England</hi> in the river <hi>Swale,</hi> which runneth through part of <hi>York-ſhire</hi> in the North-riding; and he giveth the ſame reaſon. <hi>Nondum enim Oratoria vel Baptiſteria in ipſo exordio naſcententes ibi Eccleſiae poterant aedificari: Eccleſiaſt. hiſt. lib. 2. cap. 14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then he ſaith,</hi> The days we now live in, have no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of this rite of baptizing in rivers and fountaines, then the very name, and hence it is <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that we call our veſſels that containe the water of baptiſme, Fonts, or Fountaines. <hi>From all which, let the Reader conſider, 1. That he confeſſeth that baptiſm in the ancient times was adminiſtred in Rivers and Fountaines. 2. That nothing of that is remaining but only the name. 3. That from thence it is that they call thoſe veſſels they baptize in, Fonts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus we have begun to diſcover the foundation of the Font.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he proceedeth further, and confeſſeth, ſaying,</hi> This cuſtome of baptizing in Rivers and Fountaines being diſcontinued, or left off, Fonts were erected in private houſes. <hi>Hence let the Reader obſerve, 1. He ſaith the primitive practiſe was to baptize is in Rivers and Fountaines, which the ancient Churches received from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Saviour, who was baptized of</hi> John <hi>in the River of</hi> Jordan, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15, 16. 2. <hi>He ſaith that was left off: obſerve, They left off the example of Chriſt. 3. They erected Fonts in their own private houſes: obſerve here is the words of the Prophet</hi> Jeremiah <hi>fulfilled,</hi> Jer. 2.12 13.

in Babel, and have been reſtrained from Gods ſervice, and were then not in covenant with the Lord, as they were not; nor is his law ſet up as a rule to judge by among us: ſo that when God ſhall have brought us out of Babel, and ſet up his laws, and brought us into covenant with himſelf, according to <hi>Moſes,</hi> it ſhall then be as binding to us, that God brought us out of Babel, as to them, that he brought them out of Egypt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.14.15. <hi>They ſhall no more ſay, The Lord Liveth that brought them out of Egypt, but out of the north countryes,</hi> Jer. 23.7, 8, 9.</p>

               <p>In the one, God is as <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>Hagar,</hi> whoſe ſon ſhe had by him was to be caſt out under the Goſpel-eſtate; which was fulfilled in the caſting out of unbelievers from the ſociety of Saints, they being not to inherit the promiſe, that is Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.30. which work was then done, and ſhall be moſt certainly done againe in this age of ours. In the other, God is as <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Sarah,</hi> whoſe ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> being born of the free-woman, ſignifieth the ſtate of the Church under the Goſpel, under the name of <hi>Jeruſalem from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> which are a ſociety of believers joyned to the Lord Jeſus in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, in whom the <hi>better promiſes</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and made over to the Saints, <hi>born after the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 4.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſion.</hi> The covenant of works was after the covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> of grace; but being renewed in Chriſt, it is called <hi>new,</hi> and the new old, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. The now firſt covenant, though it hath not the beſt, yet, it hath many excellent promiſes neceſſary for the life annexed to it; which we wanting, bodily are reduced to great neceſſities; and the breaking thereof brought ruine and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſuddainly to the Jews.</p>
               <p>And though at this time it be not in eſteem among men, yet the propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42.19, 21. incourageth me, that after Gods ſervant comes, who the blind world accounts blind, though God ſaith he is his ſervant, and perfect, and which the Scripture before clearly ſhews was to come after the grand Apoſtacy of Antichriſt; I ſay, after he comes, the Lord will magnifie the law, make it great, though all the world have endeavoured to make nothing of it, or of no uſe at all a long time, when they ſhall againe judge by it, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118449:11"/>
puniſh by it, and rule by it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, and more, the Lord will make it honourable alſo; they ſhall never ſet up traditions in the place thereof again. O Parliament, This God will do; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will do this by you or not, and honour you herein or not, I do not know: you ſee it is my deſire, if it be his will, ye are witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and God alſo, that the work may be yours, who have dore much of the work of the Lord in the Nation; that the Honour here, and reward thereof hereafter, may be yours: and let me ſpeak freely to you thus, that if you will not do it, God in few yeers will not want them that will do it; upon whom, and whoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, the bleſſigs of God and the Nation will fall in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, who did that in their generation for them, was never done; it being then, and never untill then, fulfilled, that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 10.19. <hi>I will provoke you to jealouſie by them that are not a people;</hi> that is, ſome heathens, which none never yet did do, ſhould, as the Jews, nationally covenant with God in the covenant of <hi>Moſes;</hi> with which the Jews, as awaked, begin to thinke that people <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>-like ſteal away, or God gives away his birthright from him: the not doing whereof, delayes their call.

               <p>Now the way of Gods calling a people, and becoming a God to them nationally, is by giving them laws, and they taking them from him, and profeſſing ſubjection to them, as to their Gods commands whom they ought to ſerve.</p>

               <p>To the breach whereof, are added many curſes of body, ſoul, goods, name, family, earth, and heaven; all are ſhut up to men for it.</p>
               <p>The which giving of laws royally to his people, is the only work and prerogative royal of God; and therefore is the law moral cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Royal law,</hi> Jam. 2.8. and thus the Scripture ſaith, <hi>There is but one law-giver, who is able to ſave and deſtroy: who art thou that judgeſt another?</hi> Jam. 4.12.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:118449:17"/>Then I anſwer, You may as well diſown your baptiſm which you had by it, and be baptized again, as we are.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>2 I ſuppoſe you will not be ſo abſurd, as to own any unbaptized perſon for a Church-member (that hath an opportunity to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized) neither do I think any of you that are zealous in your own way, will have communion with any ſuch perſons in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or other Ordinances.</item>
                  <item>3 No people in Scripture ſince the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and his Aſcenſion (the time that all power was given into his hands to give to his Church Laws and Commandments) were ever called a Church of Chriſt without baptiſm; prove it if you can by the Scriptures. Therefore baptiſm doth conſtitute a true Church, being done upon right ſubjects, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as can believe and gladly receive the word of God; as in <hi>Act.</hi> 2, 41 <hi>they that gladly received the word were baptized, and the ſame day were added three thouſand ſouls.</hi> And ver. 47. <hi>the Lord added to the Church dayly ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4 Your ſelf ſaith than faith and intereſt in Chriſt conſtitutes a Chriſtian. Very well then: but why do you baptize ſuch as cannot believe in Chriſt, nor yet make out their Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace? it is cleer to all that will underſtand that if faith in Chriſt, and intereſt in the Covenant of Grace do conſtitute a Chriſtian, then they that do not believe in Chriſt, and cannot make out their intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, are no conſtituted Chriſtians; but all the infants baptized into the Church of <hi>England,</hi> could do neither; therefore no conſtituted Chriſtians. What they are to God, is nothing to you nor me: ſecret things belongs to God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Again, you ſay that joynt and orderly profeſſion of faith and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant doth conſtitute them a Church. Very well: and I pray then, is not repentance and baptiſm an orderly profeſſion of faith? doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Act.</hi> 2, 38. 1 <hi>Repent, and 2 be baptized,</hi> &amp;c. and, 3 <hi>So many of you as have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27 and is not put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on [Chriſt] profeſſion? Conſider it again, doth not a man that puts on a garment, profeſs to wear it to all that behold him, whilſt it is upon him? ſo likewiſe they that put on Chriſt by baptiſm, do [profeſs] to own [him] before all men: and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calleth it a liſting engaging ordinance, himſelf. I hope you will not deny his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118449:17"/>
Doctrine to be Orthodox, although you cavil with the Scriptures. And now ſeeing that baptiſm is an Ordinance by which believers do put on and profeſs Chriſt, then its evident out of your own mouth, that it conſtitutes a Church; or elſe you muſt ſay they are conſtituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they put on Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5 You ſay, that <hi>baptiſm is a ſign or pledge of peoples admiſſion into the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, if ſo, then it followeth that they are not in before, to any mans ſight: and if not in the Church, much leſs conſtituted and eſtabliſhed members of the Church.</p>
               <p>But you proceed to prove, by inſtancing the Thief upon the croſs to be ſaved without baptiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny it not, becauſe he declared openly his faith in Chriſt; and owned him, when he was diſowned almoſt of all; which ſheweth plainly, that if he might have had liberty to come down, he would have quickly been baptized into his name, and therefore the Lord accepting the will for the deed, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. he ſaid unto him, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> But what makes this for the baptizing of Infants, to tell us of a man that was ſaved and was never baptized at all? You might rather, if you would have dealt honeſtly with the Text, have proved that little babes may be ſaved, though not baptized, for alas they can profeſs no faith, nor confeſs no ſin: neither hath Chriſt anywhere required them to obey any command, before they can underſtand and believe the Goſpel: <hi>for what ſoever is not of faith is ſin,</hi> Rom. 14.23. But you are pleaſed to ſay, that <hi>we do not apply that Scripture right.</hi> And why, I pray? becauſe it ſpoyles your practice: but doth not the word <hi>what ſoever</hi> include all matters and duties we owe to God? Conſider it again: cannot the Scriptures be in quiet for you? But becauſe this offends you, we will give you another, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith its impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Now conſider whether you pleaſe God or no, when you baptize babes that have no faith in them: neither have you any word of God for it.</p>
               <p>Again, this your preſident of the Thief upon the Croſs, will not at all help you, except you finds ſome men in the like condition, or ſome men upon the Gallows, that would gladly come down, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new creatures; then I confeſs, as you ſay, 2 multitude of ſuch penitent ones might be reckoned to be in a ſaying condition, though
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118449:18"/>
not baptized. But ſir, I ſuppoſe that neither you nor I are in that ſtraight the poor Thief was in, as yet; therefore it wall be no plea for us: but if either of us be unbaptized, we have time and liberty enough to conſider our ways, and to turn our feet to the teſtimonies of the Lord: therefore let us make haſte, and not delay the time: ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59, 60.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, You tell us, that <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>was conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in or anon after the Apoſtles days, and by the Miniſtry of the word were converted from heatheniſm to Chriſtianity; and then perſons of yeers were baptized, upon profeſſion of Faith and Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What then? what is your Church now the better for that which was done 1600 yeers agone, if you walk not in the ſame footſteps which they did then? I can prove as well, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was then a conſtituted Church, according to the order of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. but I pray doth that make the Pope and his crew now to be a true Church? If they be, why do you ſeparate from them? But they are not, neither are you, though a true Church might be in <hi>England</hi> 1600 yeers agone, and poſſibly may be found now.</p>
               <p>Again, you ſay that <hi>they and their children were then admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Covenant and Church, as</hi> Abraham <hi>and his family were by Circumciſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I Anſwer, It ſtill remains for you to prove that they and their children were admitted into Church-fellowſhip: I deny it: prove it if you can, or elſe you have done nothing. As for <hi>Abraham</hi> and his family being circumciſed, I grant it, becauſe the Scriptures ſay ſo; but you have no Scripture for Infants baptiſm: if you have, ſhew it if you can: and as for that Covenant that Circumciſion was a token of, its far different from the Covenant now under the Goſpel, as I ſhall ſhew by and by.</p>
               <p>The next thing you ſpeak of, is a <hi>National Church,</hi> which you ſeem to prove thus: in that the Lord ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that <hi>in his ſeed all Nations ſhould be bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But he doth not ſay that All of All Nations ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor yet, that All of any Nation ſhall be bleſſed; and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that you think in your own Conſcience, that ſome in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not bleſſed; for by your writings you pronounce us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118449:18"/>
and I ſuppoſe there are many that live in known ſins, as drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, whoredom, wichcraft, murder, theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of your own Church, and yet you dare not judge them bleſſed in Chriſt: if you do, why do you hang them up every Aſſizes and Seſſions? If they be members of Chriſt, their bodies are <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>he that deſtroyeth the Temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy:</hi> therefore if your Argument be true, take heed what you do in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You bring this Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22, 27, 28. which ſaith, <hi>All the ends of the earth ſhall remember and turn to the Lord; and all kindreds of the Nations ſhall worſhip before him: for the kingdom is the Lords, and he is the Governour among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When that day ſhall come, and that Prophecie be fulfilled, we will grant you it is fulfilled: but for preſent, I think you will be our witneſſes that all Nations do not ſerve him: for the Turks, and Moors, and Indians, with many other, do not ſerve nor worſhip God; neither do all in this, Nation worſhip him as aforeſaid: but <hi>Peters</hi> words are true, if you pleaſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34, 35 <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>in every Nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted: for God is no reſpected of perſons.</hi> But there are many in this Nation which do not fear God and work righteouſneſs: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no National Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3 You ſay, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.23. that <hi>kings ſhall be nurſing fathers, and Queens ſhall be nurſing mothers to the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That it ſhall be ſo, I deny not; but prove you that it is ſo, if you can: As for <hi>Englands</hi> King and Queen, it is well known how they would have nurſed the Church, if they had but had their mindes: or if you pleaſe to ſide with them and the Cavaliers party, and own them for a Church, yet are the other that oppoſe them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minded: therefore you can have no National Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4 You ſay <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.15. that <hi>Chriſt ſhall ſprinkle many Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its granted: but it doth not follow, that he doth ſprinkle whole Nations: it is alſo true, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. that believers <hi>have their hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and their bodies waſhed with pure water:</hi> but it doth not follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that all men, and ſuch as are wicked and prophane, have their hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience: therefore no National
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118449:19"/>
Church. And I much wonder that you Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who for the generality of you hold and preach that Chriſt did not dye for all men (but onely for ſome few elect perſons) ſhould yet preach up national Churches, and impudently ſay all <hi>England</hi> are ſo far in Covenant, as all their children ought to be baptized. I confeſs you had all need to have ſeven yeers education at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> or <hi>Oxford,</hi> or elſe you could never make theſe things hang together, but that the people would ſee your folly.</p>
               <p n="5">5 You ſay from <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Did not Chriſt command his Apoſtles to go into all Nations, and preach and baptize?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But do not you know that they never baptized whole Nations, nor yet whole Cities? but moſt men hated and abuſed them, ſo as they were forced to ſhake the duſt off their feet againſt them: and we read but of ſeven Churches in all <hi>Aſta,</hi> which is one quarter of the world; and they were ſo far from converting and baptizing whole Nations, that we read but of four or five whole houſholds in all the Scriptures, that were baptized; therefore not likely to baptize whole Nations: but if they did any ſuch thing, we deſire to ſee it. Moreover, we grant you, if a whole Nation can be converted by the preaching of the word, they ought to be baptized: but you baptize little babes, that know not what the word is; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the primitive practice, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12.</p>
               <p n="6">6 You bring <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. which ſaith, <hi>The kingdoms of this world are become our Lords, and his Chriſts; and he ſhall raign for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I told you already, that I believe ſuch times ſhall be; but they are not yet; if they were, then we ſhould no longer need to pray, <hi>Thy kingdom come,</hi> and in that day Satan ſhall not deceive the Nations: See <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.3. but, Sir, I ſuppoſe theſe things are too hard for you to underſtand, though you be a ſcholar: for they are hid from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed to babes: See <hi>Luke</hi> 20.21. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p n="7">7 You ſay from <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.24. that <hi>the Nations of them that are ſaved ſhall walk in the light of the New Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thats granted: but that new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is not yet here below, for drunkards and wicked perſons to walk by: but <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. that its <hi>above, and is free, and is the mother of all</hi> the Saints.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:118449:19"/>8 Laſtly, you ſay, <hi>If a company of believers in one houſe have been called a Church domeſtical, then a multitude of believers in a City or Nation may be called a National Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, Thats granted, if they be all believers, as you ſaid at firſt: but little babes are not believers: therefore your Argument will not hold.</p>
               <p>One thing more I have to anſwer to you in your ſixth page, which is this.</p>
               <p>You ſay we affirm a negative; namely, that the baptiſm or ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Infants, is not the baptiſm of Chriſt <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and here you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us on to purpoſe, and tell us that we are ſuch as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, when he ſaith, <hi>The end of the Commandment is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, out of a pure heart, a good Conſcience, and faith unfeigned; from which ſome having ſwerved, have turned aſide unto vain jangling, deſiring to be teachers of the Law, underſtanding not what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm:</hi> and here you think you hit us home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sir, I muſt confeſs, now you have catched us out of our Element, and in your own: for we know you are ſcholars, and have learned to <hi>contend about words to no profit, which tends to the ſubverting of the hearers:</hi> but be it as it will.</p>
               <p>Seeing we erred in ſaying we affirm a Negative, we will either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our errour, or elſe ſhew you a preſident which may juſtifie us in our practice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is none that doth good, no not one:</hi> here <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth a Negative, ſaying, <hi>There is none,</hi> for <hi>there is,</hi> is an Affirmative: therefore if you had been by him you might have taught him to have ſaid, <hi>I deny that any doth good, no not one;</hi> and then he had ſpoke as like a ſcholar as your ſelf. Again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.5. the Lord ſaith by the Prophet, <hi>I am the Lord, and [there is] no God beſides me:</hi> now Sir, if you dare preſume to be a teacher here, it ſhould have been thus: <hi>I deny that any God is, but my ſelf.</hi> And I pray ſhew us the word <hi>negative</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture if you can. Laſtly, to conclude, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.20. When they ſent to <hi>John</hi> to know who he was, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He denyed not.</hi> I pray obſerve, if he denyed not, then he affirmed: and what did he affirm? <hi>Anſw. He ſaid, I am not the Chriſt:</hi> here <hi>John</hi> affirmed a negative, confeſſing and ſaying. <hi>I am not</hi> &amp;c. now that <hi>I am</hi> is to affirm, is evident: for verſ 23 he ſaith, [<hi>I am] the voice of one cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:118449:20"/>And now let me ſhew poor ſouls the myſtery of Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, about the affirming a negative. 1 The word <hi>negative</hi> is not to be found in all the Bible, but hatched up in the ſchools, and now is nurſed by them; and grown to ſuch a ſtature, that none muſt ſay they affirm a negative, without great diſhonour amongſt them: and yet to <hi>affirm,</hi> is but to <hi>ſay</hi> a thing <hi>is</hi> ſo; and to deny, is alſo to <hi>ſay</hi> a thing is <hi>not</hi> ſo: As if I ſhould ſay or affirm, when the Sun ſhines, it is day; and when it is down, I ſhould ſay or affirm it is night, all honeſt men will underſtand me without prejudice.</p>
               <p>Again, that man that ſaith, he will prove a Negative, is among ſcholars much derided, becauſe they ſtand upon punctilioes: but yet the thing may be honeſtly done, thus: If I ſay I will prove a man is not alive, if I ſhew others that he is dead, do not I prove he is not alive? Again, if I affirm or ſay a man is not in his houſe, if I go and ſhew others his houſe and he is not in it, do not I prove he is not in it, and ſo prove a negative, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is not there? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now ſeeing you will <hi>make us offenders for a word,</hi> may not we juſtly ſay that you are one of thoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3.4. in theſe words: <hi>If any teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholeſome words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Doctrine that is according to godlineſs, he is proud, and knoweth nothing; doting about Queſtions, and ſtrife of words, whereof cometh envies, ſtrifes railings, evil ſurmiſings, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe diſputings of men of corrupt mindes, deſtitute of the truth, ſuppoſing gain to be godlineſs,</hi> &amp;c. And now do not you doat about words, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>affirmative,</hi> and <hi>negative?</hi> whereby you gender envie, ſtrife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And do not you count gain godlineſe, <hi>viz.</hi> an hundred or two hundred a yeer, for Preaching and Baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants? and rather then you will part with it, you do diſpute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly, like a man of a corrupt minde, deſtitute of the truth as it is in Jeſus. I beſeech you, in the fear of God, conſider it.</p>
               <p>And know alſo, that although we have affirmed a Negative, yet you cannot juſtly apply that Scripture to us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> l. 5, 6, 7. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we deſire not to be <hi>teachers of the Law;</hi> and therefore Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith we are Antinomians, and deny the Law.</p>
               <p>But I anſwer: Both you and he deſire to be teachers of the Law; witneſs your running to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to prove Baptiſm of Infants and Church memberſhip from Circumciſion and the Old Covenant, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118449:20"/>
was <hi>faulty,</hi> and therefore <hi>done away,</hi> Heb. 8.7. and another to be eſtabliſhed upon <hi>better promiſes;</hi> verſ. 6. and in this I am ſure you nor Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> know not what you ſay, nor whereof you affirm: therefore take the Scripture wholly to your ſelves, and conſider it well.</p>
               <p>And thus, Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> I ſhall at preſent take leave of you for a time, and apply my ſelf to Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, in the firſt place, to your Poſitions; in the firſt of which, p. 3 you ſay thus: <hi>It hath pleaſed the holy Ghoſt to ſpeak of ſome things in the Scriptures more fully, and of others more ſparingly: and where God ſpake more ſparingly, the thing muſt needs be more difficult, and yet truth ſtill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But he never ſpeaks of Infants Baptiſm in all the Scripture, neither fully not ſparingly; therefore none of his Truth, nor ever was.</p>
               <p>But you inſtance in four particulars: but that which is pertinent to the matter in hand, is your fourth, wherein you ſay, <hi>The New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ſpeaketh more ſparingly of that which is more diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Old: and</hi> (ſay you) <hi>what need the ſame thing to be done twice, except men ſhould queſtion the authority of the Old? and if God ſhould reveal his minde in one part of the Scripture, what uſe ſhould we make of the other? Therefore</hi> (ſay you) <hi>how ſilent is the New Teſtament concerning a Chriſtian Magiſtracie! which made the Anabaptiſts of old deny it.</hi> And ſay you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Where finde you a Chriſtian in the New Teſtament that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed the place of a King or Parliament-man, or Juſtice of Peace, or the like? And ſo of an Oath before a Magiſtrate, of war, and of the Sabbath, how ſparing is the New Teſtament! and why?</hi> ſay you, <hi>becauſe it is ſaid enough in the Old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which I anſwer: You have ſpoken many words to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, except it be to deceive the hearts of the ſimple: for whereas you ſay, That which is ſpoken on in the Old Teſtament, need not be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of again; I anſwer: Infants baptiſm is nowhere ſpoken of, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Old nor New Teſtament; therefore you ought not for ſhame to ſpeak of it. 2. As for your ſaying, Where finde we a Chriſtian Magiſtrate in the New Teſtament?

of great authority under <hi>Candace,</hi> Queen of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> who had the charge of her treaſure, who beleeved, and was baptized by <hi>Philip,</hi> Act. 8.27.37, 38. and what ſay you to <hi>Eraſtus</hi> the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine of the City? <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.2, 3. and likewiſe of thoſe Saints of <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſhold, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.22.</p>
               <p>And for an Oath, did you never read in the New-Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. that <hi>an oath for confirmation, is an end of all ſtrife?</hi> And for War, did you never read, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.14. that the ſouldiers came to <hi>John</hi> and asked what they ſhould do? and he did not bid them lay down their arms; but <hi>be content with their wages,</hi> and <hi>do violence to no man.</hi> And did you never read of <hi>Cornelius</hi> a <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surion</hi> of the <hi>Italian</hi> band? <hi>Act.</hi> 10. and doth not the Apoſtle <hi>Peter put us in mind to ſubject Magiſtrates?</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13, 14 15. Likewiſe, <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Tit.</hi> ch. 3.1. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.2. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. Is not the Scripture full of theſe things? and yet do you call for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Surely you read ſo many other books, that you forget to read the Scripture. For I well remember, in your third poſition you ſay, that ſome 8 years agoe you had read ſome hundreds more then moſt of them you call Godly Chriſtians, and thought yourſelf as wiſe as moſt of them; and ſome thought you wiſer, you ſay: but it ſeems you are not yet wiſe enough to lay aſide thoſe hundreds of books, and give your ſelf wholly to read and ſtudy the Scriptures, <hi>which are able to make you wiſe to Salvation:</hi> if you were, you would be better acquainted with the matter contained in them.</p>
               <p>And thus I proceed to your ſecond poſition, finding your firſt ſo frothy and full of ſuperfluous words.</p>
               <p>In your ſecond, you ſay, that <hi>The great difficulty of a point, is no proof that it is not truth:</hi> and <hi>a thing is not therefore to be rejected as not of God, becauſe it is not eaſie to underſtand.</hi> You affirm alſo, that <hi>multitudes of ſilly ignorants do the ſame:</hi> In all which I ſhall not oppoſe you.</p>
               <p>But your next conſiderable is this: you ſay, <hi>If a ſubtill Pagan ſhould come amongſt the people, and diſpute that the Scripture is not the word of God, and that Chriſt Jeſus is not the Son of God, he would ſilence them more then the Anabaptiſt con do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> makes himſelf very ſuſpicious, and his words very unſavory, in that he rather ſideth with Pagans and Atheiſts, that deny both God, and Chriſt, and the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118449:21"/>
then with thoſe which are falſely called Anabaptiſts, though we honeſtly own God, and Chriſt, and the Scriptures; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to plead nothing elſe for our practiſe; for which cauſe he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out againſt us in his 10. poſition, calling us brute beaſts, and nothing but becauſe we call to him for Scripture for to prove his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: and yet now he makes as if the Atheiſts and Pagans had more to ſay for themſelves then we: all which I leave to God, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader to judge.</p>
               <p>Again, Mr. <hi>Bextar</hi> ſpeaks a great ſwelling word of vanity, ſaying, he will <hi>hazard all the reputation of his underſtanding on it, that there is ten times more to be ſaid for free-wil, then can be ſaid againſt Infants baptiſm: yea, it is twenty times more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; (and yet you offer to diſpute it with any man) and muſt it therefore be true?</hi> ſay you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Sir, as for the reputation of your underſtanding, I will not ſay what I judge its worth. 2. If you had ſaid there is ten times more to be ſaid for free-will, then is to be ſaid for Infants baptiſm, you had hit it right. Laſtly, whereas you ſay free-will is ſuch a difficult point, I am not of your judgement in that: for I beleive its eaſie to them that will underſtand, to know that no man, in himſelf, or of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (without God) hath any free-will or power to think or do that which is good: for <hi>In him we live, move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17.28. in and through God <hi>that gives all men life, and breath, and all things, to the end they may ſeek him.</hi> Act. 17.25, 26, 27. Even the wickedeſt, and Hypocrites: the worſt of men, have a will and power to do more good then they do; and that's one cauſe of their juſt condemnation: Moreover, its evident that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Balaam</hi> had a will and deſire to <hi>dy the death of the righteous, and that his latter end might be like unto theirs,</hi> Numb. 23.10. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith plainly, <hi>To will is preſent with me but how to performe that which is good, I know not:</hi> Rom. 7.18. by all which it is evident, that free-will is not ſuch a difficult point as you would make it: but its an eaſie matter with you to <hi>call Light darkneſs, and darkneſs light,</hi> Iſa. 5.20. But I leave this at preſent, and proceed to your fourth poſition, wherein you ſay.</p>
               <p>That if never ſo clear evidence of truth be produced, yet it will ſtill be dark to them that are uncapable of diſcerning it: for its Gods work to make people underſtand. And then you inſtance in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118449:22"/>
Author to the <hi>Heb.</hi> cap. 5.11, 12, 13 14. who had many things to ſay to them concerning <hi>Melchiſedec, which were hard to be uttered, becauſe their ears were dull of hearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We grant you all this: I That though there be never ſo cleer truth for a thing, yet it will ſtill be dark to ſome. But however, let us ſee ſome cleer evidence of truth firſt, and ſhew where its writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that babes muſt be baptized; and then if we do not believe it, be it upon us. We know it is Gods work to perſwade the heart, but its mans work to declare the truth, by which the heart is perſwaded. The Apoſtle often preacht very plainly, that men ſhould <hi>Repent and be baptized:</hi> but there were many that heard them which rejected their words though very plain, as they are ſtill upon record: but you bring us no Scripture for what you affirm about Infant-baptiſm, but call us <hi>unreaſonable men</hi> and <hi>bruit beaſts,</hi> for requiring Scripture of you for your practice: and yet you would bear the world in hand in this your Poſition, that you have proved cleer evidence of truth for it: but we will not believe it, but I ſay once more, ſhew us but where its written in the word of God. which alone <hi>is able to make us wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15 16, 17. and then if we will not nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe it, our blood be upon our ſelves: but till you ſhew us ſomething written, we have nothing to believe.</p>
               <p>As for your ſaying we had need ſtudy the controverſie at leaſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yeers; I anſwer: What Rule have you for that? Did the three thouſand in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41, 42. ſtudy this controverſie ſeven yeers, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days either? Conſider it again; and thoſe men and women, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12. that believed <hi>Philips</hi> preaching, and were baptized; and the Eunuch in the latter part of the chapter, and <hi>Lydia,</hi> and the Goaler <hi>Act.</hi> 16. and <hi>Criſpus</hi> the chief Ruler of the Synagogue, with his houſhold; and many of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who did not ſtand read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other books ſeven yeers; but hearing and believing, were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.8.</p>
               <p>You ſay further, that men think they can underſtand plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture if they hear it; but they cannot: and then you cry, <hi>O that pride would let men know, that they cannot underſtand the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Lecture of Geometry or Arithmetick that a man can read unto them;</hi> and <hi>read the Grammer to a boy in the Primer, and be underſtandeth not a word you ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is it poſſible you would make men believe they cannot
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118449:22"/>
underſtand plain Scripture if they hear it? but I pray try us with ſome firſt, and ſee: I confeſs we cannot underſtand this book of yours to be <hi>Plain Scripture-proof for Infants Church-memberſhip and baptiſm,</hi> becauſe you have packt it ſo full of ſuch whimſies as theſe, Geometry, Arithmetick, Grammer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Sir, we would have you to know, that the word of God is of another nature: for <hi>it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth light to the blinde, and underſtanding to the ſimple,</hi> Pſal. 19.7, 8. Yea, it makes men wiſer then their enemies, and gives them more underſtanding then all their teachers, yea more then the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.98, 99, 100. All which I believe you will finde to be true before we have done.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>Poſ.</hi> 4. <hi>When the cauſe is ſo difficult, we muſt follow the moſt probable way.</hi> So then; it ſeems its very difficult for you to prove that Infants ought to be baptized, by your own confeſſion; and indeed ſo I believe: for that muſt needs be very difficult to prove that there is not one word of God in all the Bible for. I cannot blame you for ſaying its difficult to prove. But you ſay we muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the moſt probable way; come on then, that we will.</p>
               <p>Now whether is it moſt probable that that practice which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where commanded nor written in Scripture, ſhould be of God, or of Satan? Judge ye. Now that Infant-baptiſm is ſuch a practiſe as is not written in Scripture, both Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> and your ſelf confeſs; and therefore in your 10 Poſition you do abuſe us, and call us bruit-beaſts for demanding a plain Scripture for it; therefore its not of God: and its moſt plain, that if that which is written in the word of God, be the way of God, then that which is not written in it, and yet practiſed as an ordinance of God, muſt needs be of Satan.</p>
               <p>In your 5 <hi>Poſition,</hi> in ſhort, you tell people that if any have taken up this opinion, and have not Read and ſtudyed Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> and Mr. <hi>Church,</hi> and other chief books, and been able to confute them, they have but diſcovered a ſeared Conſcience, which either dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on ſin without fear, or elſe do count error no ſin.</p>
               <p>To all which I anſwer: How now Mr. <hi>Baxter!</hi> Are you grown to this height? what, muſt not men obey what they finde written in the holy Scripture, till they have asked Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> and Mr. <hi>Churches</hi> counſel? I pray where learned you this divinity? at <hi>Rome?</hi> I thought all this time the holy Scriptures had been able to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118449:23"/>
make us wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith in Chriſt Jeſus: but it ſeems they are not, if you ſay true; but we muſt be beholding to Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> and Mr. <hi>Church.</hi> But I pray how did men before Mr <hi>Cobbet</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> books were written? and how do thoſe now that cannot come by their books, or never heard of them, if it be as you ſay? you may do well to ſend ſome men up and down the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to ſell them. But I believe this is but one of your ſcare crows, with which you uſe to affright ſilly ſouls, that ſet their faith in your wiſdom, and not in the power of God: but your folly is a making manifeſt, and light and freedom is breaking forth to them which you have kept in darkneſs and bondage.</p>
               <p>Now to your 6 Poſition, wherein you ſay, That you will <hi>diſcover a moſt frequent cauſe of mens falling into errors;</hi> which you ſay is this: <hi>All men in the beginning do receive many truths upon weak or falſe grounds; and ſo hold them a while, till they are beaten out of their old Arguments, and then preſently they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the cauſe it ſelf:</hi> and you are <hi>perſwaded this is Mr.</hi> Tombs <hi>his own caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As for Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> he is of age, and able to anſwer for himſelf, I queſtion not: and as for your ſaying that men receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm and other Truths upon weak grounds at firſt; I anſwer, I never knew any receive Infant-baptiſm upon any ground at all, weak nor ſtrong; neither can they: for they are not capable of what they do, becauſe they want underſtanding when they receive it: therefore you may well ſay, they are or may be quickly beaten off it again, when they come to reaſon with themſelves or others about it.</p>
               <p>But you ſay, <hi>Alas, there is far better grounds, which they are not aware of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is, it may be, becauſe you baptize them ſo ſoon: if you would let them alone till they are men and women, before you baptize them, as you have example in Scripture, they might receive baptiſm upon better grounds.</p>
               <p>In your 7 Poſition, you confeſs, <hi>ſome Divines have reaſoned very weakly for Infant-baptiſm, and uſed unfit phraſes, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed Scriptures: and to theſe ſome have wrote three or four books, and eaſily anſwered, and ſeem to triumph; and yet the truth is not ſhaken: but it may be, all the beſt Arguments and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118449:23"/>
Plain Scriptures have never been anſwered,</hi> ſay you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deſire to anſwer the Plain Scriptures no way, but by faith and obedience, by believing and doing of them: therefore if you know of any that ſpeaks of Infants-baptiſm, bring them forth, and I will be ſilent. The firſt I ſee: but as for your beſt Arguments you talk of, I look upon them but as ſo many <hi>cunning deviſed fables, wherewith you lye in wait to deceive ſimple ſouls,</hi> by ſpeaking things you ought not, for filthy lucre ſake, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.14.</p>
               <p>You ſay Poſ. 8. one ſound Argument is enough to prove any thing true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then either the great number of yours in the book of <hi>plain Scripture,</hi> are not ſound, or elſe you need not to have brought ſo many, by your own grant.</p>
               <p>But you ſay, <hi>What if all the Texts were put by ſave one? Were not that enough?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, its enough, if you can ſhew us but one: but I pray where is that one? I cannot finde it in all your book: but it ſeems you are afraid that all ſhould be put by ſave one: therefore you make this apologie: but I ſuppoſe all will do you little good.</p>
               <p>In your 9 Poſition, you ſay, <hi>The former and preſent cuſtoms of the holy Saints and Churches, ſhould be of great weight with humble Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the preſent cuſtoms of Churches now be according to the Primitive pattern, I grant it: elſe not. But I am ſure the cuſtoms of the Churches in the Apoſtles days was to baptize men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men when they believed with all their hearts, and gladly received the word. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. <hi>c.</hi> 8.12. <hi>v.</hi> 36, 37, 38. <hi>c.</hi> 10.47. <hi>c.</hi> 16.33, 34. <hi>c.</hi> 18 8. therefore I pray let this cuſtom be of weight to your ſelf; and do not baptize little babes that cannot believe, nor underſtand what they do; eſpecially becauſe you ſay there was weight in that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>We have no ſuch cuſtom, nor the Churches of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, you ſay that you can prove that Infants-baptiſm was uſed in the Church as high as to the Apoſtle, as there be many ſufficient hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories extant inform us; and that the deferring of baptiſm came in with the reſt of Popery, upon popiſh or heretical grounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> O Sir, have I now found you out? truly ſeeing I have, I muſt not conceal your wickedneſs, leſt I become guilty with you of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118449:24"/>
the blood of ſouls; and therefore I do by this declare to all men, that you are both a deceiver and a blaſphemer: the which charge I now come to prove.</p>
               <p>I That you are a deceiver, it is evident, in that you have entituled your book, <hi>Plain Scripture-proof for Infants Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and baptiſm;</hi> by which you perſwade many hundred ſouls, that there is plain Scripture indeed in the Bible for Infants-baptiſm, when there is no ſuch thing: but your ſelf confeſs, in your 9 Poſition that your proof is from ſome hiſtories extant, which you judge ſufficient. O that poor ignorant ſouls would but ſee and conſider your <hi>cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning craftineſs wherewith you lye in wait to deceive</hi> them, before it be too late.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That you are a blaſphemer, is plain, if the Scriptures may be heard to ſpeak: for you ſay deferring of baptiſm came in with the reſt of Popery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But Sir, do you not know that our glorious Lord Jeſus Chriſt deferred his baptiſm till he was thirty yeers of age? <hi>Luke</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. and yet he was the child of believing parents, I think you dare not deny. And now do you not ſee your wickedneſs in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that deferring of baptiſm came in with the reſt of Popery? or do you think wickedly that Chriſt brought in any part of popery? take heed.</p>
               <p>Again, doth not the Commiſſion of Chriſt defer baptiſm till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15 16. ſaying, <hi>He that believeth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſhall be ſaved?</hi> and doth not <hi>Philip</hi> defer baptiſm upon the ſame account to the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36, 37. when the Eunuch ſaid to him, <hi>See, here is water, what hinders me to be baptized? Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip ſaid, if thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou mayeſt:</hi> ſhewing by theſe words, plainly, that if he did not believe, it was to be deferred; and that unbelief would hinder. And thus is your folly made manifeſt; though I fear you will not ſee it: but however, I leave it to the conſideration of all rational men; deſiting that the Lord will give them wiſdom to conſider how you delude poor ſouls by this means, perſwading them that there is very plain Scripture for infants-baptiſm; when at laſt you confeſs there is none, but ſome hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, which you judge ſufficient: and thus have you made proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, and when they are made, they are <hi>ſevenfold more the children of Satan then they were before:</hi> for before, they were forced in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118449:24"/>
their non-age to receive the mark of the beaſt ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20. which was not received by a few deſpiſed people, as you ſay the Anabaptiſts are; but he cauſed all, both free and bond, rich and poor, ſmall and great, to receive it: yea, and that none may buy or ſell ſave he that had the mark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.16, 17. and this is moſt properly applyed to you: for there is never a ſmall child in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it were but eight days old, but you would look it ſhould be Rantized, and in that receive the mark on its forehead, namely, to be <hi>ſigned with the ſign of the croſs, in token,</hi> &amp;c. and this was ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal throughout <hi>England,</hi> that if any did but ſtand up to oppoſe it, they muſt neither buy nor ſell amongſt you; but muſt be impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, baniſhed, or hanged. So that all, both rich and poor, free and bond, ſmall and great, were glad to be and ſuffer their children to be baptized, or rather Rantized, or elſe they could not be ſuffered to live, for to buy and ſell amongſt you, to get a livelihood. And thus I have preſented you a glaſs to look in; that you may behold what manner of perſons you are.</p>
               <p>Again, its impoſſible that you ſhould apply theſe Scriptures to thoſe you call Anabaptiſts, becauſe now they have their liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their minde freely, they do not deſire ſmall and great to receive the mark of baptiſm which they practiſe, but onely great ones which can underſtand what they do, and give a resſon thereof; even as we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. <hi>They that gladly received the word, were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and added to them</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12. <hi>when they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Philips preaching, they were baptized both men and women.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 11.8. <hi>Criſpus the chief Ruler of the Synagogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the Lord with all his houſe: and many of the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hearing believed and were baptized:</hi> And thus you may ſue, that the more we do look in the glaſs of the Goſpel, which is the perfect <hi>Law of liberty</hi> to them that fear God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.12. the more we ſee our ſelves conformable to the image of Chriſt, and walking according to the Primitive pattern: and we are ſo far from compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling rich and poor, that we would have neither rich nor poor to be baptized until they believe the truth of the Goſpel, and amend their lives, and can give an account thereof to thoſe that ask them a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the hope that is in them with meekneſs.</p>
               <p>Again, you ſay Poſition 10. <hi>Evident Conſequences or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn by Reaſon from Scripture, are as true proof as the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118449:25"/>
very expreſs words of a Text: and if we have the words without the meaning and reaſon, we have no proof at all: for the devil uſed the words of the Scripture to Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which I anſwer, As for your ſaying, that Conſequences or Arguments drawn from Scripture, are as true proofs as Scripture; this is but one of your untruths: for moſt certain it is, that what the Scripture ſaith, we need not prove by Conſequence for that would be but <hi>darkening the Counſel of God, by words without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> as for example, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God created the heavens and earth,</hi> now what need you prove this by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? again, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>God ſaid, Let there be light: and there was light.</hi> And what can any Conſequence do in this caſe? And again, <hi>ver.</hi> 7.8. <hi>And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament, from the waters that were above the firmament; and it was ſo.</hi> And this I do believe without any Conſequence: and if you will deny it, becauſe it is plain Scripture without any Conſequence, you may if you pleaſe: but your folly will be manifeſt, as it is to me already. When you ſay, <hi>if we have the word without the meaning and reaſon, we have no proof at all;</hi> I anſwer, this is a moſt ſubtile ſophiſtry, much like to that of Satan when he beguiled <hi>Evah,</hi> ſaying, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt not dye; but your eys ſhall be opened, and you ſhall be at Gods, knowing both good and evil:</hi> all which was both true, and a lye: for they did learn to know evil by it to purpoſe; and as for good, they knew it before; and now they learned to know it was good by the loſs of it. And after the ſame manner is your reaſoning, when you ſay, If we have nothing but the bare words, without the meaning and reaſon we have no proof. To which I anſwer: The truth is, that if we have not the meaning of God, and the reaſon reaſon why he ſpeaks to us, how can we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand as we ought? but now, Sir, I ſhall make it appear, that both Gods meaning, and the reaſon of his meaning, is plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the ſons of men, by his word of truth; and ſo plainly, that if you or an Angel from heaven ſhall add to it, or take from it, you ſhall be accurſed; and he will add to you all the plagues written, and take your name out of the book of life. All which if you do not knows, I pray read <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19.</p>

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, Sir, You much miſtake the matter: for the Divells deceit did not ly in bringing the Scriptures, but in adding to, and taking from, as I ſhall make it appear, by comparing the words the Divell brought, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.6. and <hi>Luke</hi> 4.10 11. with thoſe words in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 91.11, 12. which are theſe. <hi>For he ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee [in all thy wayes] they ſhall bear thee up in their hands left thou daſh thy feet againſt a Stone.</hi> Theſe are the words of the Propheſie, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 91.11, 12. but the words of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are theſe: <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down;</hi> which is nowhere written; Juſt as you ſay <hi>Baytiſe your Children,</hi> which is no where written: but the Divell would prove he might, thus: <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, He ſhall give his</hi> Angells <hi>charge concerning thee [to keep thee]</hi> as in Luk. 14.10. <hi>and with their hands they ſhall bear thee up left [at any time]</hi> (that is added) <hi>thou daſh thy feet againſt a Stone.</hi> Thus it is clear, the tempter added [<hi>at any time,</hi>] and left cut [<hi>in all thy wayes.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.9, 10, 11.

that the tempter added <hi>Caſt thy ſelfe downe,</hi> and <hi>[at any time]</hi> and left out <hi>[in all thy wayes]</hi> So that here is both adding and diminiſhing, which is accurſed of God: and yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> takes the Divells part, and ſaith, <hi>the Divell uſed the words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to Chriſt.</hi> But this is but a ſmall fault with you, Sir, for you have learned to take the ſame leave your ſelfe, as I now ſhall make it appear, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thou be the Son of God,</hi> The Divell ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>caſt thy ſelf downe;</hi> which is nowhere written, as the Lord ſaith, but the contrary, <hi>viz. Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> So do you ſay,</p>

                  <hi>If you be the Children of God, and in Covenant, baptize your Children;</hi> which is nowhere written, but the contrary, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teach all Nations batizing them,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 28.19. And <hi>Preach the Goſpell to every Creature: he that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16.15, 16.

                  <hi>They that gladly received the word were baptized:</hi> but you know well (or elſe you have loſt your ſences) that ſuch Children as you baptize cannot gladly receive the word. Again, <hi>If thou believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt with all thine heart, thou maiſt.</hi> Act. 8.37. <hi>And when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the Kingdome of God and the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they were baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both men and women,</hi> Act. 8.11, 37. But you know that there is no Children in the Text; and you know alſo (if you be not wilfully blinde) that they cannot believe with all their hearts: but yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, you are ſo impudent, as to do the works of Satan; and as he tempted Chriſt, and would have had him <hi>caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe downe</hi> before Gods time was come to ſend his Angells to take him downe; and to that end, would have applied a promiſe falſly, ſaying, It is written, <hi>He ſhall give his Angells charge over thee, to keep thee,</hi> leaving out <hi>in all thy waies:</hi> even ſo do ye tempt men and women to baptize their Children, before Gods time is come, <hi>of his own will to beget them by his word of truth,</hi> James 1.18. That they might be born againe, not only of <hi>Water,</hi> but alſo of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> Joh. 3.5. And to that end, you tell them <hi>it is written</hi> they are Diſciples, and Church-members: and they were circumciſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118449:28"/>

                  </gap>pply and wreſt the Scriptures, putting in and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out what you pleaſe: and then when poor Souls aske you for plaine Scripture for Infants baptiſme, and would gladly ſee where it is written, then you tell them, the Divell brought the words of Scripture to Chriſt; and if they will have the words without the reaſons and conſequences, they have no proof: and thus you labour with your conſequences and reaſons, and <hi>words without knowledge, to darken the Counſell of God,</hi> Job 38.2. But I hope by this time your folly is made more manifeſt.</p>
               <p>But you proceed, and tell us, that <hi>if we have the meaning and reaſon, we have enough for evidence: for words are but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, Then it ſeems the meanings and reaſons you talke of without the word, are without ſence by your own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for you ſay. If we have the meanings and reaſons, we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for the words, they are but to expreſs ſence: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems if we be without the words of Scripture, we are without ſence. And thus you ſee, or may ſee, that God by weak inſtruments, can take you wiſe ones in your own craftineſs. But, good Sir, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der once againe are not the words of the Scriptures which were given by the inſpiration of the Spirit, as good and better ſence and reaſon then any words and reaſons you can ſpeake or give? if you deny this upon your ſecond thoughts. I muſt needs conclude, that you are far gone and very high flowne.</p>
               <p>But you are pleaſed to ſay further, <hi>Would it not make a man pitty ſuch ſenceleſs ignorant wretches, that will call for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words of Scripture, when they have evident conſequences? Is Scripture-reaſon no reaſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer. Sir, methinks you are very pitifull: but yet you are a miſerable comforter; for when you have done, you fall a railing on us calling us <hi>ſenceleſs ignorant wretches,</hi> that will call for expreſs words of Scripture, when we have your conſequence. But, Sir, I have told you already why we dare not truſt your conſequences. But you ſay, <hi>Is Scripture-reaſon no reaſon?</hi> I anſwer, Yes, its goodreaſon; and its that we would have from you: but you call us ignorant ſenceleſs wretches, for ſo doing. But there may be a miſtake betwixt us: for we call Scripture reaſon, written reaſon: now if you would
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118449:28"/>
but ſhew us where your reaſon is written in the book of God, the holy writings, the controverſie were at an end: but till then, you have done nothing. But you might inform the ignorant wretches, that the holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> in Engliſh are holy <hi>writings;</hi> for Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are writings; and holy Scriptures, are holy writings: and thus the people might learn to know what you mean by Scripture-reaſons; which are in plain Engliſh written reaſons.</p>
               <p>Further, You are pleaſed to ſay that <hi>we diſclaim Reaſon, and therefore not to be reaſoned with: and if we once renounce Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we are brute beaſts; and who will go to plead with a beaſt? its Reaſon that differeth a man from a beaſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sir, truly you do put me in minde how like one of your forefathers you are: for (to my beſt remembrance) you ſpeak his very words: and I queſtion not, but if you had an opportunity, you would do his deeds. The man I ſpeak of, was Doctor <hi>Story</hi> to Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> the Martyr, who ſuffered for what he ſaw in that dark age: The place where you may finde it, is in <hi>Fox</hi> his book of Martyrs, pag. 1972. in theſe following words:</p>

                  <p>After this, Doctor <hi>Story</hi> came in, to whom I ſaid, Mr. Doctor, you have done me great wrong, and without Law have ſtraightly impriſoned me, more like a dog then a man; and beſides this, you have broke promiſe with me: for you promiſed I ſhould be judged the next day after.</p>

                  <p>I am now come to keep promiſe with you. Was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a fantaſtical man as this is? Nay, he is no man, he is a beaſt: yea, theſe Hereticks be worſe then brute beaſts; for they will upon vain ſingularity take upon them to be wiſer then all men, being indeed very fools and Aſſe-heads, not able to maintain that which of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant obſtinacie they ſtand in.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philpot.</speaker>
                  <p>I am content to abide your railing judgement now, ſay what you will: yet I am no heretick, neither ſhall you or any other be able to prove that I hold any jot againſt the word of God, but as a Chriſtian man ought.</p>

                  <speaker>Philpot.</speaker>
                  <p>If I cannot prove what I have ſaid, by good authority, I will be content to be counted an heretick or ignorant perſon or what you pleaſe.</p>

                  <speaker>Philpot.</speaker>
                  <p>Its the ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.48. <hi>The word that I have ſpoken, the [ſame] ſhall judge you in the laſt day:</hi> and if in the laſt day, much more now our doings ought to be judged by it. I am ſure I have Chriſt my Judge on my ſide for this.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Thus you may ſee and conſider how like your forefather Doctor <hi>Story</hi> you ſpeak and behave your ſelf; and to that end, I have writ it; and that the Reader may conſider, that even as theſe wicked Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants dealt with the poor Martyrs that ſuffered in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days for that part of truth which they, then, ſaw, in thoſe times of ignorance and darkneſs, even ſo would Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren deal with us now, if they had but their liberty; witneſs theſe words of Doctor <hi>Story,</hi> compared with Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> tenth Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: by which it appeareth, that they are children of one father, whoſe works they do, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44.</p>
               <p>And now whereas you ſay we diſclaim Reaſon, I anſwer, Its but one of your falſe accuſations: we own all things written in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of truth, and they are better reaſon about heavenly matters, then any you can bring: for they are <hi>able to make us wiſe to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>But now I come to the great invincible Argument of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> which is this: ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter, Do you think the Lord Jeſus knew a good Argument, or the right way of diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? why how did he prove the Reſurrection to the Sadduces from that Text, I am the God of Abraham and Iſaas, and of Jasob? would not one of theſe men if they had ſtood by, have chiddeu Chriſt for this Argument, and have ſaid, Give us a Text that ſays the dead ſhall Riſe? what's this to the Reſurrection, that God is the God of Abraham? would not theſe have report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad that Chriſt could not confute the Sadduces, or bring any Scripture for his doctrine?</hi> thus far Mr. <hi>Baxter:</hi> the ſame ſaith Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> in his 24, and 25 pag.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:118449:29"/>To all which I anſwer, that the Lord Jeſus knew a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the right way of diſputing, better then Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cooke,</hi> or my ſelfe, or any man elſe, I humbly confeſs to his praiſe: and therefore I deſire to make uſe of his words that he hath already ſpoken, knowing that he hath reaſoned and proved all things better then I can.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> although he confeſs (for his own ends) that the Lord Chriſt knew the beſt reaſoning; yet he is not content with his reaſon but adds to it theſe words, in his 10 Poſition: 1. <hi>If God be the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>then it will follow that</hi> Abraham <hi>in ſoul is living 2. This is not directly proved from this Text; but another principle muſt be taken in to ſupport it,</hi> viz. <hi>That God is not the God of the dead, but the living. 3. If</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſoul be living, then his body muſt needs be raiſed. 4. If</hi> Abrahams <hi>body ſhall riſe, then there is a reſurrection, and others ſhall riſe alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer,
<list>
                     <item>1. Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in all theſe conſequences that he hath drawn, hath but darkened the councell of God ſpoken by the mouth of Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>2. The reſurrection is more plainly proved by the words of Chriſt, without all his conſequences, as appeareth by the word of the Text, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.35, 36, 37. <hi>But they that ſhall be accounted worthy to obtaine that world, and the reſurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage; neither can they dy any more, for they are equall with Angells, and are the Children of God, being the Children of the reſurrection.</hi> Thus Chriſt himſelfe (in plaine terms) hath proved the reſurrection already, ſpeaking plainly of the happineſs of thoſe that ſhall obtaine the reſurrection from the dead: and then when he had done, he concludes, that the reſurrection of the dead is ſo plain that even <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewed it at the Buſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> prove, if he can, that Chriſt did draw any conſequences from his owne words, but left them barely as he ſpake them, as ſufficient proof, without the help of any of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.</item>
                     <item>4. If Chriſt had uſed never ſo many consequences to prove any thing, yet his words were all Scripture, and infallibly true; So true, that whoſoever of Men or Angels, ſhould add to, or take from it, they were accurſed. But Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> are none ſuch: therefore we weigh them not.</item>

               <p>I anſwer, So Chriſt did give them two Scriptures, though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is ſo blind he cannot ſee them: for he telleth us, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. of the world to come; and the Reſurrection from the dead, in plaine tearms ſaying,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They which ſhall be accounted worthy to obtaine that world, and the reſurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.</hi> And in <hi>ver.</hi> 37. he ſaith, that the dead are raiſed. And we would have Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and all men know, that we take all the ſayings of Chriſt to be as good Scripture, and of as great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as any part of the Bible: therefore now Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> folly and wickedneſs is manifeſt, who would inſinuate into peoples mindes, that Chriſt did not bring Scripture to prove the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead; but they muſt help him by their conſequences.</p>
               <p>But their deceit lieth in this; namely, in that they did conclude, that becauſe Chriſt did not bring ſome other Scripture that was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before to prove the reſurrection, therefore he proved it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: never minding that what he ſaid was [<hi>Scripture</hi>] and what he approved of is [<hi>approved</hi>] and ought to be approved of all, without murmurings or diſputings.</p>
               <p>But now to make their folly manifeſt, I will reaſon with them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way: and if they prove as plainely that Infants ought to be baptized, as Chirſt did there prove that the dead ſhould riſe, they ſhall have it, and I will confeſs my ſelfe in an errour. And now to the matter.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Mark 12.25. <hi>For when they ſhall riſe from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage.</hi> Now do you ſhew a Scripture that ſaith, <hi>And when they ſhall baptize little Children, they ſhall</hi> &amp;c.</item>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its one thing for a man to uſe words to expreſs himſelfe to thoſe that will not believe the Scriptures as they are written; and its another thing to bring the holy Scriptures to ſhew men a Rule to walk by, and what their duty is in matters of faith and obedience.</p>
               <p>We will freely give Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> leave (or any man) to expreſs themſelves how they can to cauſe men to underſtand and believe the holy Scriptures as they are written: but this we dare not allow, neither to them nor our ſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> to put men upon believing or doing any thing as a duty, that is not written in the holy Scriptures. And herein lyeth the depth of all deceipts: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe Chriſt expounded the Scriptures of the Prophets, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men will take in hand to expound his expositions; as if we could make them plainer then he hath left them; or make anything true that is not written in them.</p>
               <p>Again, becauſe <hi>Philip opened the Scriptures</hi> to the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. therefore men will take in hand to open the words of <hi>Philip,</hi> ſo as to make them appear otherwiſe then they are written: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the plainer manifeſtation of the truth, I deſire all impartial men to conſider theſe following things:
<list>
                     <item>1 If I would prove to any man by the Scriptures, that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the heavens and the earth, then I muſt bring a Scripture that ſpeaks of Gods creating the heavens and the earth, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</hi> Again,</item>
                     <item>2 If I would prove that God created man upright, I muſt bring a Scripture that ſaith ſo, as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. <hi>Lo, this onely have I found that God hath made man upright</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>3 If I will prove that all men ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall were finners, I muſt bring a Scripture that ſpeaks ſo as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>For all have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>4 If I would prove that God ſent his ſon to redeem thoſe ſinners, I muſt bring a Scripture that ſaith ſo, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 115. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief,</hi> and <hi>c. 2.6. Who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time,</hi>

12.25, 26. for when they ſhall riſe from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>As touching the dead, that they ſhall Riſe, have ye not read?</hi> &amp;c. And what if Chriſt had not ſpoken nor named the Reſurrection of the dead at all in this place? if it be proved anywhere in Scripture, its enough: for Chriſt ſpake many times darkly and in parables to them that were without, but expounded all things to his Diſciples, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.33.34. with <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.10, 11. and its moſt plain, <hi>Job.</hi> 5.28, 29. that Chirſt faith thus, <hi>The hour is coming in which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth; they that have done good unto the Reſurrection of life: and they that have done evil unto the Reſurrection of damnation:</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And now let Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> or any man elſe, prove that either Chriſt, <hi>Moſes,</hi> any of the Prophets or Apoſtles, did ever ſpeak one word about baptizing of infants, and then we will grant it: and if this be not rational and honeſt, let even our enemies judge.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if I would prove that men and women ſhould, be baptized when they believe the word preached, I muſt bring a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that ſays ſo; as <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12. <hi>When they believed Philips preaching, they were baptized both men and women:</hi> and ver. 37. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now if Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> or any man, will prove that little babes ſhould be baptized, let them bring one Scripture to prove it, and then they will do honeſtly; otherwiſe I muſt needs conclude (with all that fear God aright) that they are meer deceivers of men, and unjuſt Stewards to Chriſt, whom they profeſs to ſerve.</p>
               <p>But now a word to Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> who in his ſeventh page ſaith, that <hi>we never read in the Scriptures, Go</hi> Henry Haggar, <hi>and</hi> James Brown, <hi>teach all Nations, and baptize,</hi> &amp;c. nor do we read that Chriſt gave a command to you two to preach the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like <hi>cunning deviſed fables</hi> hath Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> in his ſeventh page.</p>
               <p>To all which, I anſwer, This is but a ſubtile ſophiſtry of Mr.<hi>Cook</hi> to <hi>deceive the heart of the ſimple:</hi> but eaſily diſcovered by them to whom the Lord hath given underſtanding as thus: we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118449:31"/>
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or Mr. <hi>C.</hi> to bring a Scripture that ſaith, <hi>Go William Cook,</hi> or <hi>Go Richard Baxter, and baptize children that cannot ſpeak nor underſtand what you preach,</hi> neither do we deſire a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that ſaith, <hi>Go Mr. Baxter, and Mr. Cook, and teach all Nations, and baptize all the children that you can lay your hands on.</hi> But we deſire you or any man to prove by the holy Scriptures, that Chriſt did ever ſay to [any] of his diſciples, <hi>Go and baptize chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> or that ever any that preached in the name of the Lord, did baptize children, either under Law or Goſpel; and we will grant it. Give us command or example to ſhew us where it ought to be done, or ever was done, and you do like men: but till then, as I have told you before, I tell you again, that you are <hi>unreaſonable men,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> prayed to be delivered from.</p>
               <p>But now we can prove that Chriſt commanded thoſe which he ſent to preach, to baptize thoſe that did believe, which was likewiſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by them, as I have ſhewed before, by theſe Scriptures, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.18.19.20. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12. and <hi>ver.</hi> 37. <hi>c.</hi> 10.47.48. <hi>c.</hi> 16.32, 33, 34. <hi>c.</hi> 18.8. to which I refer the Reader. And what they did, Saints in all ages are commanded to do: for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be ye followers of me, and mark them that walk ſo as you have us for an example,</hi> Phil. 3.17. Again <hi>thoſe things which you have learned and heard, and ſeen in me, do; and the God of peace ſhall be with you,</hi> cap. 4.9. But now we have heard and learned that <hi>Paul</hi> and the other diſciples did baptize men and women when they believed; therefore, if we do the ſame, the God of peace will be with us: but we never heard nor learned in all the Scriptures, that they baptized babes of a week, or month, or yeer old: therefore we dare not do it, left we ſhould be counted ſuch as tranſgreſs, and abide nor in the Doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But I remember what Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> ſaith to theſe Scriptures, in his fourth objection, pag. 91. that <hi>theſe are the chiefeſt ſtrong holds of the Anabaptiſts:</hi> and being purſued, hither we run for refuge: but all in vain (as he ſaith.) To which I anſwer, Its well the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts do run to the word of God for refuge: they are then ſure to be ſafe, without all queſtion: for <hi>his word is ſetled in heaven,</hi> Pſa. 119.89. and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.31. <hi>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my diſciples indeed, and you ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free.</hi> And again, <hi>cap.</hi> 15.7. <hi>If you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118449:32"/>
in me, and my [words] abide in you, ask what you will, and it ſhall be done unto you:</hi> and <hi>the word is able to ſave our ſouls,</hi> Jam. 1.21. and <hi>the Lord will have reſpect to them that are of contrite ſpirits, and tremble at his word,</hi> Iſa. 66.2. but, <hi>whoſe deſpiſeth the word ſhall be deſtroyed; but he that regardeth the Commandment, ſhall be rewarded.</hi> Pro. 13.13. And thus its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that if we run to the word for refuge, we do wiſely, and are ſafe in ſo doing.</p>
               <p>But as for Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> he hath never a word to run to for Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm, as he himſelf confeſſes, pag. 30. in his fifth Argument, in theſe words: <hi>In expreſs terms, ſo infants baptiſm is not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor a thouſand things more, which get we are bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall now conclude with ſhewing ſome undenyable Reaſons why the word of God muſt beunderſtood and obeyed, as it is written, without adding to, or taking from:
<list>
                     <item>1 Becauſe God did never without words make known his minde to the ſons of men: therefore we read that <hi>God at ſundry times in divers manners ſpake to our fathers by the Prophets, but now in theſe laſt days he hath ſpoken by his own ſon,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 1.12.</item>
                     <item>2 By words the minde of God is compleatly made known, ſo that to <hi>fear God, and keep his Commandments, is the whole duty of man,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.12, 13.</item>
                     <item>3 Becauſe Chriſt blames men for erring from the Scriptures, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>You erre becauſe you know not the Scriptures,</hi> Mark 12.24.</item>
                     <item>4 Becauſe we are commanded to hear the words of Chriſt <hi>in all things what ſoever he ſhall ſay unto us,</hi> Act. 3.22.</item>
                     <item>5 Becauſe <hi>they that conſent not to wholſom words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and the Doctrine which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to godlineſs, are proud,</hi> or fools, <hi>knowing nothing,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.3, 4.</item>
                     <item>6 Becauſe the Scriptures are <hi>able to make us wiſe to ſalvation, through faith in Jeſus;</hi> and <hi>to make the man of God perfect, and throughly to furniſh us to all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15, 16, 17.</item>
                     <item>7 Becauſe when <hi>Paul</hi> left the Church in a dangerous condition becauſe of deceivers, he committed them <hi>to God, and to the word of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118449:32"/>
his grace,</hi> affirming it is <hi>able to build them up, and to give them an inheritance amongſt them that are ſanctified.</hi>

                     <item>8 Becauſe if men or Angels ſhall preach <hi>any other Goſpel then what is already preached, they ſhall be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1.8.9.</item>
                     <item>9 Becauſe thoſe that preach are commanded <hi>to preach the [word] in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.12. and not their own words.</item>
                     <item>10 Becauſe <hi>Chriſt will judge all men by his [words] that he hath [ſpoken] in the laſt day:</hi> and then, <hi>they which do add to his word, he will add to them all the plagues written; and thoſe that diminiſh from it, he will take their names out of the book of life, and their part out of the holy City,</hi> and <hi>he will come in flaming fire, to render vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not his holy Goſpel,</hi> Joh. 12.48. Rev. 22.18, 19. 2 Thef. 2.7, 8, 9.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, I ſhall propound theſe following Queries, with a deſire to have them anſwered by any who will or can.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Whether God doth require the ſons of men to believe any thing in point of Juſtification, that is not recorded in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of truth.</item>
                  <item>2 Whether God doth require or command us to obey any thing after believing which is not contained in the word of truth?</item>
                  <item>3 Whether the Saints have any ground to believe the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dead, and eternal life in glory, but as it is recorded in Scripture.</item>
                  <item>4 Whether if a man believe and obey all the known precepts and promiſes contained in the word of God (as much as in him lyeth) will God condemn and puniſh him at the great day, becauſe he hath believed and done no more.</item>
                  <item>5 If the Scriptures be not a perfect rule of faith and obedience (without the help of any mans inventions) what is? Or who may we truſt? or at whoſe mouth muſt we ſeek wiſdom?</item>
                  <item>6 If the Scriptures ought to be believed and obeyed as they are written, then how dare ſome deny faith in, and obedience to ſome part of them; and impoſe things not written in the Scriptures, to be obeyed in ſtead of the ordinances of Chriſt?</item>
                  <item>7 Whether there be any ſin or corruption incident to man, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118449:33"/>
the Scriptures doth not reprove and make manifeſt in expreſs terms.</item>
                  <item>8 Whether there be any vertue or praiſe in any thing that the beſt of men ever did, but what is expreſly commanded or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Scriptures of truth?</item>
                  <item>9 I appeal to every mans Conſcience in the ſight of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Conſciences do not condemn them when they walk contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what is written in the Scripture.</item>
                  <item>10 Whether every mans Conſcience do not juſtifie him when he walks according to what is contained in the word of God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now if all theſe Queries be granted (as they are ſtated) to be true; then it followeth, that thoſe that teach and perſwade men to do any thing in matter of Juſtification or ſalvation, more or leſs then is plainly written and expreſſed in the word of God, are ſuch as do add to or take from what God hath ſpoken to the ſons of men for inſtruction, and are guilty of thoſe plagues pronounced, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19. but infants baptiſm is nowhere written nor expreſſed in all the Scriptures, as Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> do confeſs: therefore they, and all they that plead for it, are guilty of the plagues aforeſaid, except they repent.</p>
               <p>And thus have I anſwe<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ten Poſitions, which he ſaith pag. 3. muſt neceſſarily be well underſtood, before we can underſtand the point in hand. So that the Reader muſt take notice, that if theſe Poſitions be not well underſtood to be true, then all the reſt of his book cannot be underſtood to be true by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. For, ſaith he, <hi>If people be miſtaken in that which goeth before, no wonder if they deny the conſequents, or that which followeth after</hi> &amp;c. So that if I have fully anſwered theſe Poſitions, I need ſay but little to the reſt of the book. All which I leave to the Reader to consider of. But howſoever, I ſhall not fail (by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of God) to ſpeak ſo much to the two firſt parts of his book, as may undermine his building, and lay it in the duſt.</p>
               <p>As for the laſt part of his book, from the 162 page to the end; himſelf confeſſeth that they are but ſuch vain contendings as he is like to be guilty of, and Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> alſo, as you may ſee in his Epiſtle to the Church at <hi>Bewdley</hi> towards the latter end.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> Arguments, being the ſame with his, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of both tending to prove that infants are in Covenant, and that they are Church-members: and Diſciples of Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118449:33"/>
ought to be baptized: for which cauſe I ſhall now come to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their Arguments in general, and to ſhew by the Scriptures why infants that cannot ſpeak words nor underſtand Reaſon, cannot be Church-members under the Goſpel, nor Chriſts Diſciples: the which being cleered, it will plainly appear, they are not fit ſubjects for baptiſm by their own grant.</p>
               <p>For the cleering of which, I ſhall firſt ſpeak ſomething concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> upon which Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> do pretend to build, making the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural ſeed under the law, all one with the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſpiritual ſeed born of the ſpirit under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which, I thus Reaſon:</p>
               <p n="1">1 That there is two Covenants, is evident, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. in theſe words; <hi>for theſe are the two Covenants.</hi> Now if there be two Covenants, then either we are under the old Covenant ſtill, or elſe the new is come in place: but that we are not under the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſtill, is evident, becauſe Chriſt is come, whoſe blood is the blood of the new Covenant, which is everlaſting <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. he ſaith, <hi>This cup is the New-Teſtament in my blood:</hi> giving us to underſtand, that as the old Covenant or Teſtament was ſealed with the blood of Bulls, and Goats, and Calves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19, 20. So the new Covenant that is <hi>eſtabliſhed upon better promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> is ſealed and confirmed by the blood of Chriſt the Son of God, who hath obtained <hi>a more excellent miniſtery,</hi> in that he is <hi>the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of a better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8.6. for finding fault with the firſt, he ſaith, <hi>Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael and Judab. not according to the former,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. what is that? he will <hi>put his Laws, in their minds, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people:</hi> which Covenant the Saints are now under, and are heirs of theſe <hi>better promiſes</hi> upon which it is eſtabliſhed: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> applyeth the ſame to the Saints, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. ſaying (as God hath ſaid) <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people,</hi> &amp;c. And thus have I proved, that we are not under the old Covenant, which did properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the fleſhly ſeed, which had but the promiſe of

an earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> under the curſe; and <hi>Jeruſalem which is in bondage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with her children,</hi> See <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24.25. but believers are under the new Covenant, which hath better promiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhall inherit that <hi>new Heaven and new Earth wherein dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth righteonſneſs,</hi> and that <hi>new Jeruſalem which is above, and is free, and is the mother us of all;</hi> ſee 2 Pet. 3.13. with Gal. 4.26.</p>
               <p>Againe, I believe <hi>Paul</hi> knew as well the intent and meaning of the Covenant of God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Cooke;</hi> and yet he applieth it not to a fleſhly ſeed, as appeareth thus: <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. God ſaid unto <hi>Abraham, I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God to thee and thy ſeed</hi> &amp;c. Now the Queſtion is, who are the ſeed to whom the Covenant and promiſes do belong? which <hi>Paul</hi> anſwereth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. ſaying, <hi>Now to Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes made: be ſaith not to [ſeeds] as of many, but as of one; and to thy ſeed, which is [Chrſt.]</hi> Thus we ſee that it is not every one that is born of the fleſh to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that had right to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and priviledges thereof; but as he ſaith, ver. 29. <hi>If ye be Chriſts, then are ye</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe, as it is written,</hi> Rom. 4.13. The promiſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be the heir of the world, was not to him nor his ſeed according to the Law, but according to the righteouſneſs of Faith, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7.8. <hi>Neither becauſe they are the ſeed of Abraham are they all Children, but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be Called:</hi> [that is] ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>They that are the Children of the fleſh, are not the Children of God; but the Children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> were not the Children of the Covenant, nor heirs of the promiſe by fleſhly birth, much leſs can the [Children] of beleeving Gentiles, that are inferior to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> be in Covenant: for, <hi>that which is born of fleſh, is fleſh.</hi> Joh. 3.6.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Apoſtle doth not ſay that it was <hi>Eſan,</hi> though he was the elder (that was in Covenant) but <hi>Jacob,</hi> though the younger, who beleeved in the God of his Father <hi>Iſaac.</hi> And indeed I do much wonder how the Preachers of the Chureh of <hi>England</hi> dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118449:34"/>
that beleevers Children are in Covenant before beleeving, by vertue of their Parents faith: and yet they hold that God did hate and had reprobated <hi>Eſau,</hi> before he was born, or had done good or evill; and ſo notwithſtanding his Parents (<hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecea</hi>) were both precious beleivers, yet <hi>Eſau</hi> their own Child was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Covenant before he was born, nor after, by their own grant.</p>
               <p>Thus all men may ſee how they confound their own principles; no marvell then although they labour to confound other mens: and if this very thing were but well weighed, and rightly conſidered, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to diſcover the folly and falſhood of all Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> arguments.</p>
               <p>Againe, If beleivers Children be in Covenant, becauſe they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers Children; then grace comes by generation, and not by rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: the which to affirme, is abſurd.</p>
               <p>Againe, If beleivers Children be in Covenant by vertue of their beleiving Parents; then all the World ever ſince righteous <hi>Noah</hi> muſt needs be in Covenant, for they and we all came of righteous <hi>Noah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Font uncovered,</hi> pag. 45. That he doth not hold falling from the inward efficacy of grace, and true ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, juſtification and adoption,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So then it ſeems by his own confeſſion, its not true; and then it muſt needs be falſe; and its well if they fall from falſe grace, and falſe ſanctification, and falſe juſtification, and falſe adoption: for they that fall from falſe, muſt needs fall to true, as certainely as they which fall from true, muſt needs fall to falſe: or elſe they fall from nothing, but abide as they were.</p>
               <p>But to make the folly of theſe wiſe men manifeſt, I pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with me, 1. what the new Covenant is, and then 2. you ſhall judge whether Infants are, or can be in it or no: <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8.9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>The Lord ſaith, <hi>The daies come when I will make a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the houſe of Iſrael and Judah, not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers when I tooke them by the hand to lead them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, &amp;c. <hi>but this is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael; after thoſe daies ſaith the Lord, I will put my laws in their mind and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, &amp; they ſhall be to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118449:35"/>
me a people: and they ſhall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: for all ſhall know me from the leaſt to the greateſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is the new Covenat of [grace.] Now that Children that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak nor underſtand cannot be in it, is evident, by the following reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they that are in this Covenant, have the Laws of God put in their minds, and written in their hearts: but little babes that cannot ſpeak nor underſtand, have not the Laws of God in their minds, nor written in their hearts: therefore they are not in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Now that ſuch little Children are not in a capacity to know the mind and Laws of God, is moſt plaine, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14, 15, 16. <hi>Behold, a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his name</hi> Immanuel: <hi>butter and hony ſhall he eat, that he may know how to refuſe the evil, and chuſe the good: for before the child ſhall know how to refuſe the evil and chuſe the good, the Land that thou abherreſt ſhall be for ſaken of both her Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus its evident, that even the Lord Chriſt, as he came in the fleſh of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> there was a time in which he was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſcerning between things which differ: and therefore it is ſaid againe, that <hi>he grew and waxed ſtrong in ſpirit; and the grace of God was upon him,</hi> Luke 2.40. And againe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus increaſed in wiſedome and ſtature, and in favour with God and man,</hi> ver. 52.</p>
               <p>From all which I conclude that if it were thus with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt according to the fleſh, as he was man; much leſs do other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren underſtand the Laws of God in their non-age to have them writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts and minds: and therefore not in Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be ſome for want of wiſdome will object, that <hi>upon this account Chriſt will be excluded the Covenant in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer, Such people know not what they ſay: for <hi>the Lord hath given him for a Covenant of the people, and for a light of the Gentiles,</hi> Iſa. 42, 6. chap. 49, 8. And he is <hi>the Mediator of the new Covenant,</hi> Heb. 12.2.4. And his blood is <hi>the blood of the everlaſting Covenant,</hi> chap. 13.20. with Luke 22.40. And he is the ſeed to whom all the promiſes were made; and <hi>in him they are yea, and in him amen,</hi> Gal. 3.15, with Cor.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118449:35"/>
1.20. and without him could be no Covenant of life and peace; for he is the ſubſtance and life of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Therefore vain and fooliſh it would be for any man to make ſuch an objection.</p>
               <p>Again, thoſe that are in the new Covenant, ſhall know the Lord, from the greateſt to the leaſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.11. but little babes born of the fleſh, of a week or a month old, cannot know the Lord: for they know not their own parents, nor their right hand from their left, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.11. therefore the Lord ſaith plainly, that children are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, yea the children of thoſe which worſhip and do ſacrifice to the devil. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.37.38. in theſe words, <hi>They ſacrifice their ſons and daughters to devils, and ſhed innocent blood, even the blood of their ſons and daughters, whom they ſacrificed to the idols of Canaan:</hi> therefore little babes, though innocent, are not nor cannot be in Covenant: for <hi>that which is born of fleſh is fleſh;</hi> but the new Covenant is a ſpiritual Covenant, and they which enter into it, muſt be born again: for thoſe that worſhip God, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. Thus have I plainly proved, that little babes that cannot ſpeak words, nor underſtand Reaſon, cannot poſſibly be in the new Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But now followeth that great and unanſwerable objection, as Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſuppoſeth, which is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If children be not in Covenant, they cannot be ſaved: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his 21 and 22 Arguments, pag. 71, 72. <hi>that Doctrine that leaveth us no ſound grounded hope of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and ſalvation of any dying infants in the world, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly falſe Doctrine. But that Doctrine which denies any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be members of the viſible Church, doth leave us no ſound grounded hope of the juſtification and ſalvation of any Infants in the world: therefore it is certainly falſe Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame ſaith Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> in his 13. Argument, pag. 44. <hi>That Doctrine and practice is to be abhorred as moſt contrary to the Covenant of God which puts the Infants of Chriſtians into the ſame condition with the children of Turks and Infidels, and leaves them in the viſible kingdom of the devil, as no viſible members of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the Doctrine of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts is ſuch, therefore to be abhorred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which I anſwer: firſt, denying that any children are ſaved
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118449:36"/>
by vertue of viſible Churth-memberſhip, or being in the Covenant, as believers are: and let Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> or any for them, prove it by the Scriptures if they can.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer: there is no difference between the children of believers and unbelievers in their non-age: for the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are but innocent, when we make the beſt of them: and the children of unbelievers alſo are innocent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.37, 38. yea, though their parents be ſuch as worſhip and do ſacrifice to the devil, yet the Lord hath pronounced them innocent, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. ſaying, <hi>They ſhed innocent blood, [even] the blood of their ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whom they ſacrificed unto the Idols of Canaan.</hi> Thus it is plainly proved by the word of the Lord, that the children of the murtherers and Idolaters that worſhipped and ſacrificed to the devil (as <hi>ver.</hi> 37.) were innocent: and thoſe that are innocent, God will not deſtroy. See <hi>Exed.</hi> 23.7. with <hi>Job</hi> 22.30. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.16, 17.</p>
               <p>Again, there can be no difference between the children of believers and unbelievers, becauſe no ſuch children have actual ſin: and the beſt of children of men have that which is called original ſin: <hi>viz.</hi> the ſin that came by <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, for which they muſt all dye, and return to their duſt, even the beſt of Saints, as well as the worſt of ſinners: for its appointed for all once to dye, and after that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth judgement: but the Scripture doth not ſay that any ſhall be judged according to their original ſin, or condemned for <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion; but it ſaith, <hi>They ſhall be judged according to their works,</hi> Rev. 20.13. and that <hi>every one ſhall receive according to that he hath [done] in his body, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.10. therefore no ground to fear the ſalvation of children dying in their non-age: for although they muſt dye for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, yet Chriſt is become their Reſurrection, and they have no actual ſin to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. For, <hi>Whoſoever committeth ſin, tranſgreſſeth the Law, for ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the the Law,</hi> Joh. 3.4. and <hi>where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 4.15. but in ſuch little babes there is no Law, therefore there can be no tranſgreſſion imputed. And indeed I much wonder that men ſhould be ſo wicked, as to think that God, who is ſo merciful as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the worſt of ſinners their ſins and tranſgreſſions, ſhould yet caſt poor babes into hell and everlaſting torments for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:118449:36"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But hath God one way to ſave Men and Women, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to ſave little Children?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, or elſe Children muſt never be ſaved, as I ſhall ſhew, thus: for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. that <hi>as by the offence of one, Judgement came upon all to condemnation; [even ſo] by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all to juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if none but men and women that can hear underſtand, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive the Goſpell, may partake of the benefits of Chriſts death, to life and ſalvation; then no Infants that are capable of receiving faith, (which <hi>cometh by hearing</hi> the word preached) could have any ſalvation by him. But that ſome Infants as ſaved by him, all will grant.</p>
               <p>Therefore I conclude,</p>
               <p>Firſt, concerning Infants that fell in <hi>Adam</hi> without any actuall ſin, or knowledge of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion: [even ſo] they dying in their infancy, before they know good or evill, they are ſaved by vertue of Chriſts death, without any actuall faith, or knowledge of Chriſts obedience; or elſe it is not <hi>even ſo,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. ſaith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, concerning Men and Women that have lived to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit actuall ſins againſt conſcience and knowledge, of ſuch God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth actuall faith in Chriſt, and actuall obedience to Chriſt; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, they have no promiſe of ſalvation by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And thus its plain, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. As <hi>by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one</hi> (viz. Adam) <hi>Judgement came upon all to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> [even ſo] <hi>by the righteouſneſs of one</hi> (viz. Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>the free gift came upon all to juſtification of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, that God hath one way to bring Men and Women to life and ſalvation, and another way to bring little baces to it, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, thus.</p>
               <p>We find the Lord ſpeaking words to Men and Women, that are to be underſtood and obſerved by them that have Ears to hear, and Hearts to underſtand: and therefore we find the holy Ghoſt crying out ſo oft in the Scriptures, to <hi>them that have Ears to hear,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches:</hi> ſee Rev. 2.7. ver. 11. ver. 17. ver. 29. chap. 3.6. ver. 13. and 22. with many more places to that purpoſe: but we never find him calling to little babes in the fleſh to hear and obey Commandments, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive pomiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:118449:37"/>Again, we find the Scripture pronouncing life and Salvation to all thoſe that beleive in Chriſt, and obey his voice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15, 16. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. but we never read that litte Children are promiſed it upon theſe terms.</p>
               <p>Again, the Scripture threatneth death and damnation to <hi>thoſe that know not God, and obey not the Goſpell of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of God, and the glory of his power.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.7, 8, 6. But little babes, of 8 daies, weeks; or months old, cannot know God, nor yet obey the Goſpell of Chriſt: for <hi>they know not their right hand from their left:</hi> and yet we find them not threatned with this puniſhment: and if it were but this, it were enough to ſatisfy all rationall men fearing God, that God hath one way to bring Men and Women to life and ſalvation, and another way to bring little babes to it: (that is to ſay,) he requireth faith in Chriſt and obedience to Chriſt, as neceſſary to ſalvation, to thoſe of ripe years; but in Infants he requireth none: let any man prove it by Scripture, if he can.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Gods ordinary means by which he bringeth Men and Women to life and ſalvation, is by the preaching of the Goſpell, which is <hi>the power of God to ſalvation to every one that beleiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> Rom. 1.16. and <hi>it pleaſeth God by the fooliſhneſs of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſave them which believe;</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21. <hi>for with the heart man beleiveth unto righteouſneſs; but with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation,</hi> Rom. 10.10.</p>
               <p>But little babes, that can neither ſpeak nor underſtand, cannot beleive with the heart unto righteouſneſs, nor confeſs with the mouth unto ſalvation: for they cannot ſpeak at all: therefore they are not ſaved by that ordinary means that Men and Women are ſaved by. And thus is their great and invincible objection, (or rather ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill) anſwered clearly and plainly by the Scriptures of truth.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, they may as well debar little babes from food, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He that will not worke, let him not eat,</hi> as to debar them of ſalvation, becauſe they are not Church-members: for it is as eaſie for babes to worke and get their own bread; as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the work of a Church-member. Therefore he that gives them food without labour in their non-age, will alſo give them ſalvation without obſerving of Church-ordinances: for the Scripture ſpeaketh to Men and Women that have Ears to hear, and not to babes in their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:118449:37"/>Thus having taken away the chief ground upon which Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> build, I ſhall now proceed to ſhew the rottenneſs of their building, by the following Arguments; by which I come to ſhew, that ſuch infants as they baptize cannot be Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, neither can Church-memberſhip do them any good, but rather the contrary.</p>

               <p>My third Argument is from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe, he wrote to them at <hi>Corinth,</hi> which were <hi>Saints by</hi> calling, <hi>with</hi> all <hi>that in</hi> every <hi>place call upon the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. and in ver. 10. he exhorts and beſeecheth them to <hi>ſpeak all one thing;</hi> ver. 12. he ſaith, that Every <hi>one of them did ſpeak; and one ſaid I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollo, and I am of Cephas, and I am of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>infants</hi> that cannot ſpeak nor underſtand, cannot call upon the name of the Lord Jeſus, as <hi>ver.</hi> 2. nor ſpeak all one thing, as <hi>ver.</hi> 10. (for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118449:38"/>
ſpeak at all) neither can they ſay for their parts who they are of, whether of <hi>Paul, Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or Chriſt:</p>
               <p>Therefore no <hi>infants</hi> that could not ſpeak nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, were members of the Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> its evident, for every one that was a member there, could ſpeak, and ſay they were of one of theſe.</p>

               <p>My fifth Argument is from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. compared with <hi>ch.</hi> 11.28, 29. which words are theſe: <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? and the bread that we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? for we being many, are one bread and one body: for we are</hi> all <hi>partakers of that one, bread:</hi> and <hi>Whoſoever doth eat of this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, and eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords body</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But <hi>infants</hi> that can neither ſpeak nor underſtand, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern the Lords body from the world (as it is ſanctified and ſeparated from it by faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) neither can they diſcern his body broken

               <p>Therefore ſuch <hi>infants</hi> are no viſible Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: or if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> or any will yet have it ſo, then we muſt needs conclude with the Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. that they <hi>eat and drink damnation to themſelves, not diſcerning the Lords body:</hi> which would be abſurd.</p>

               <p>I Anſwer; firſt, it diſcovers but a wicked cavilling ſpirit: for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience telleth them, that both men and women did partake of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its the communion of the body, as I have proved: and that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are members of the body of Chriſt, which is the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, 23.

Again, that women are members of the body, is evident: for <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.4, 5. Saith, <hi>Every man that prayeth or propheſieth with his head covered diſhonoureth his head; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry woman that prayeth or propheſieth with her head uncovered, diſhonoureth her head:</hi> and ver. 11. he ſaith, <hi>the man is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the woman, nor the woman without the man in the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 9.36. <hi>There was at Joppa a certain Diſciple whoſe name was Dorcas, a woman full of good works.</hi> By which we ſee, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were Diſciples.

               <p>Now as concerning the word <hi>man</hi> in the Text, it is no more then

               <p>But <hi>Paul</hi> did ſend ſalutations to <hi>all</hi> the Saints at <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> and ſo did all that were with him at <hi>Rome.</hi> By all which it appeareth plainly, that <hi>all</hi> the Saints at <hi>Rome</hi> were capable of ſending ſalutations, and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> Saint at <hi>Philippi</hi> was capable of receiving ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations from them: but little <hi>Children</hi> that can neither ſpeak nor underſtand, are capable of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p>There yet remaineth many probable Arguments, by which it might be made manifeſt to every impartiall Reader, that Infants which can neither ſpeak nor underſtand, cannot be viſible Church-members upon the earth: but there would (I know) be many ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwers made to them; which would take much with thoſe that have their faith ſet in other mens wiſdoms, and not in the power and

wiſedom of the word of God, as we read, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4, 5. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall omit them, becauſe theſe are undeniable, having not only the word [Church] in generall in them, but also ſuch words as ſpeak to [every] Saint in Chriſt and member in particular, as the word [all] the Saints, [every] Saint in Chriſt, and [every] one of you, and [every] branch in me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>But for example, I ſhall give you one probable Argument from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. in theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thy Brother ſin againſt thee, go and tell him his fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and him alone: if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy Brother: if not, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, every word may be eſtabliſhed: and if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church: and if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be to thee an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man and a Publican.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which I argue thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt, If it be the duty of Church-members to watch over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and proceed in order according to this rule, then they muſt be ſuch as underſtand this rule.</p>
               <p>But little [babes] of 8 daies, weeks, or months old, cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this rule:</p>
               <p>Therefore they cannot be viſible Church-members.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If it be the duty of [Church-members] to tell one another of their fault, then they muſt be ſuch as can both ſpeak and judge what a fault is, or elſe how can they tell one another of their faults.</p>
               <p>But little Babes can neither ſpeak nor judge in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p>Therefore they cannot be [Church-members.]</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the faults of particular [members] in ſuch caſes may and muſt be brought before the whole Church, for them to hear and judge; then the whole Church ought to be ſuch as can judge and likewiſe declare their minds.</p>
               <p>But little Infants are not ſuch;</p>
               <p>Therefore no viſible [Church-members.]</p>
               <p>But it may be the objection againſt all this will be, That this rule doth not reach or concern all Church-members, becauſe the word <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>every one,</hi> or <hi>whole Church,</hi> is not found in the text. But I ſhall leave it to the judgement of the wiſe, that fear God, and are worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of him in ſpirit and truth.</p>

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:118449:42"/>Many more ſuch Arguments as this might be brought, of which the time would fail to relate, therefore I ſhall omit them, and proceed to prove in oppoſition to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> other Arguments, that little Children, that cannot ſpeak words, nor underſtand the Goſpell if they hear it, are not nor cannot be Chriſts Diſciples.</p>

               <p>If thoſe Diſciples which Chriſt commanded the Apoſtles to baptize, muſt be firſt made ſo, then they were not ſo born: if they had, they ſhould not have need to be made ſo.

               <p>Here Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and I muſt have ſome diſcourſe before we part a for he telleth us of divers waies to make Diſciples, beſides teaching of them; which in plain terms is to ſay, There is divers waies to make Scholars, beſides or without teaching of them: which to me is a Paradox.</p>
               <p>Again, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> being very willing to prove Infants Diſciples, ſaith, page 22. line 1, 2, 3. that <hi>its enough to make them Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118449:43"/>
that they are devoted to learning if they live; and that they are conſecrated to Chriſt as their Maſter, who can teach them hereafter:</hi> So that he would prove them Diſciples or Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars firſt, and have them taught afterwards: ſtrange doctrine, and unheard-of Divinity! the which leſt any ſhould object againſt, he ſtoutly backs with a learned Argument, as he would have it, thus.</p>
               <p>Is it not a common thing to call the whole Nation of Turks, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi> old and young? why then may we not call our ſelves and our Children Diſciples of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>And then he tells us another ſtory of a man that hired a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to teach him and all his Children, and were they not all then Diſciples of that Philoſopher?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But is this Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> plain Scripture-proof that he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us of in the title of his book? I do much admire that a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing ſo much ſeriouſneſs in his matters, and ſoundneſs in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tenderneſs of conſcience, and zeal for truth as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth (in his firſt chap. page 2) ſhould ſo turn aſide his ears from the truth of the word of God, unto ſuch fables as theſe, as if he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make the Apoſtles words true upon himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3.4. which are theſe: <hi>The time will come, when they will not endure ſound doctrine; but after their own luſts ſhall they heap to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves teachers, having itching ears: and they ſhall turn aſide their ears from the truth, and be turned unto fables,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But let me a little ſpeak to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his own language, leſt he be wiſe in his own conceit, and think I cannot anſwer ſuch learned Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe I ſhould grant that little Children, as ſoon as they go to Schoole and begin to learn their letters, are Scholars; doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that they are then fit to learn the things of God, and be immediately (nay long before that) the Diſciples of Chriſt? I think not; for the Lord Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John 2.12. If I have told you earthly things, and you beleive them not; how ſhall you beleive if I tell you Heavenly?</hi> But ſuch Children that go newly to Schoole to learn their letters, you may tell them of many earthly things, that they cannot underſtand nor beleive at all.</p>
               <p>Againe, What if we grant Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that little Children are Scholars the firſt day they are ſent to Schoole, and having learned
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118449:43"/>
but the firſt letters? This would make nothing for his purpoſe: for do we ever know any man ſo idle, and fooliſh, and void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as to ſend his Child to Schoole to learn its letters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for it could ſpeak or underſtand? would not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf ſay ſuch a man were void of reaſon? but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth affirn ſuch to be Diſciples of Chriſt, and would have them ſent to Chrits Schoole: but if this be equity or godly wiſdome, let the godly wife conſider and judge.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would teach men by parallels (and lay aſide the word of God, he might have made the compariſon thus: As little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the firſt day they go to Schoole to learn their letters, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Scholars and Diſciples of Men; even ſo thoſe <hi>little Children,</hi> or babes in Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.21. the firſt day they go to Chriſts Schools to learn <hi>the firſt principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 6. may be alſo called the Scholars or Diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, as men commonly call all the Turks old and young that are born of the fleſh into [<hi>Mahomets</hi>] Kingdome, which is of this [world] [<hi>Mahometans</hi>] [even ſo] we call all converts old and young, which are born again of the Spirit into the Kingdome of [Chriſt] which is not of this [world] <hi>(Chriſtians.)</hi> By old and young converts, I do not mean beleivers born of the Spirit, and their Children, as they are born of the fleſh: but I mean ſuch as are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.13, 13. in theſe words: <hi>I write to you little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe your sins are forgiven you for his names ſake; I write <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <p>Now as for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s man that hired the Philoſopher to teach his children, he neither telleth us what man it was nor how old his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were, nor what the Philoſophers name was: and therefore I ſhall paſs that over, as a cunning deviſed fable, not worth the anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and proceed to the next, which is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That mothers can teach their children partly by action and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118449:44"/>
geſture, and partly by voice, to take off from vices, and infom in vertue. And methinks</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye ſhould not make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant leſs teachable then ſome brutes. But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>nurſes witell you more in this, then I can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O excellent Divinity, and plain Scripture proof! from where we learn theſe two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that if it be a piece of good Divinity to prove that litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that can neither ſpeak nor underſtand, are the Diſciples of Chriſt, then Nurſes are better Divines then Mr. <hi>Baxter:</hi> for (ſaith he) they can tell you more is this then I can, pag. 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſaith, <hi>What will you make an Infant leſ teachable then ſome bruits?</hi> from whence Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſeems to imply, that ſome bruits are capable of being Chriſts Diſciples; or elſe why ſhould he ſay, Will you have infants leſs teachable then ſome bruits? As if he ſhould ſay, Some brutes are teachable enough to be made his diſciples: and, what will you deny infants to be his diſciples? methinks (ſaith he) we ſhould not make an infantieſs decible then ſome brutes.</p>
               <p>I remember he crieth out againſt Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> in pag. 19. for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing ridiculouſly, when he proveth plainly out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.89, 90. that the heavens and earth are Gods ſervans, in his anſwer to his proving infants, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.41, 41. and if ſervints, then diſciples, ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> In anſwer to which, Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> ſaith, The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the earth are his ſervants, are they therefore his diſciples? to which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> for want of a better anſwer ſaith, <hi>O what cauſe have we all to look to the tenderneſs of our Conſciences in time, before engagement in a ſinful cauſe hath ben<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>med and made the word of God to be of none effect tous!</hi> But I leave it to the impartial Reader to judge whether the ſame ſayings may not more fitly be applyed to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in this place? I hope Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is not ſo void of judgement, as to think brutes teachable enough to be made Chriſts diſciples: but I am ſure his words imply no leſs.</p>
               <p>Indeed I remember Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth ſay in the beginning of his book, that he will not meddle with ſuch Arguments as other men have wrote of before, but new ones that never yet were handled: and I muſt confeſs theſe are ſuch new ones as I never heard; but how much to the purpoſe, I leave it to the Reader wiſely to conſider, and then judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:118449:44"/>Again, he hath another Argument from <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. the which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, doth prove Infants diſciples, to all that will not groſly overlook the Text, and pervent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> An heavy charge againſt us, I confeſs, to be perverters of the Scripture: but how true it will prove, you ſhall ſee by and by. The whole ſubſtance of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Argument, in the 15, and 16 pag. of his book, is this, from <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Why put ye yokes upon the neeks of the diſciples?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But that yoke was, to be circumciſed according to the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> children as well as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were circumciſed; therefore children as well as parents are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.</p>
               <p>But I wonder what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would do with this Argument, if we ſhould give it him, and anſwer nothing to it: I confeſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ignorant and ſottiſh people, that do pin their faith upon Mr. <hi>B.</hi> words, it may be taking: out amongſt thoſe that are of noble ſpirits to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures</hi> before they believe, as the noble Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11, 12. it can have no influence, nor take no impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe its but half an Argument, and ſo he hath done his work that he hath taken in hand but to halves.</p>
               <p>If we grant him all he ſays that it is but half an Argument is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, thus: The yoke that they would have put upon the neck of the diſciples, was to be circumciſed according to the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> but according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> none were circumciſed but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children, therefore none elſe are diſciples, and therefore none but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children are to be baptized, by his own grant. And ſo he hath done but half his work as I told you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> pleaſe; I will lead him ſtep by ſtep into the right underſtanding of this Scripture, by Gods aſſiſtance, thus: What was the yoke? <hi>Anſw.</hi> To be circumciſed according to the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> and who was it laid upon then under the Law? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Upon the Jews and their children. And who would they have laid it upon? <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Upon the diſciples; as is plain in theſe words, <hi>Why put ye a yeke upon the neck of the diſeiples?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who are diſciples?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here ſticks the queſtion ſtill, and it remains ſtill for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> or Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> to prove infants diſciples, and then we grant they are thoſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118449:45"/>
upon whom the falſe teachers would have put the yoke of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion: but the diſciples of Chriſt are ſuch as could deny themſelves, and take up his croſs and follow him, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. but little infants that can neither ſpeak nor underſtand, cannot ſo do: therefore no diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I ſhall cleer it by the words of the Text, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of no children there, thus: <hi>Act.</hi> 15.7. we read, that <hi>when there had been much diſputing Peter roſe up and ſaid unto them, Men and brethren, you know that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth ſhould hear the word of the Goſpel, and believe:</hi> and ver. 8. <hi>God that knoweth the hearts, bare them witneſs, giving them the Holy Ghoſt, even as he did to us:</hi> ver. 9 <hi>and put no difference between them and us, purifying their hearts by believing. Now therefore,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, ver. 10. <hi>why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the diſciples?</hi> &amp;c. But now who were theſe diſciples? <hi>Anſw.</hi> v. 7. thoſe that heard the word of the Goſpel by the mouth of <hi>Peter,</hi> and believed; to whom God alſo gave the Holy Ghoſt, and purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their hearts by faith, as is plain, ver. 89. but little infants that can neither ſpeak nor underſtand, could not hear the word of God, and believe by <hi>Peters</hi> preaching: therefore they are not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this place.</p>
               <p>Another Argument that Mr.<hi>B.</hi> hath, to prove infants diſciples, is in pag. 18, 19. thus: <hi>If infants are capable of being Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, then they are capable of being Chriſts diſciples.</hi> And he proves them ſervants, from <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.41, 42, where the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the yeer of Jubilee to ſet free all their brethren with their little ones; for they are my ſervants: whence he concludes his Argument thus: <hi>If God calls them ſervants, why may not we call them diſciples?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, Methinks its very ſtrange he ſhould take upon him to prove children diſciples, and when he cannot find ſuch a word in all the Scriptures, then he would turn us off with the word Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and preſume to call it Diſciples; and then ſay, If God call them one thing, why may not we call them another? It ſeems Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will take leave in this thing, to walk contrary to God; and therefore I dare not truſt him in another. But I will ſhew him, not onely in things, but alſo in perſons, that we muſt not call them
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118449:45"/>
Diſciples of Chriſt, which God calleth Servants: for in <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.9. chap. 27.6. chap. 43.10. in all theſe places God calleth <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ehadrezer</hi> his Servant, the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> an Enemy to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom the Lord made uſe of to deſtroy it, and make it an aſtoniſhment and an hiſſing: but yet I hope Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not take leave to call him Chriſts Diſciple: if he doth, I think his folly will be manifeſt to all men, as it is now to me.</p>
               <p>Another ſuch Argument he hath, page 21. where he reaſons thus: <hi>If Infants be capable of being Chriſts ſubjects, then they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being his Diſciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A learned Argument, and I will endeavour that all men may ſee the depth of it, thus: All the Children in this Nation are capable of being Subjects of this Common-wealth; therefore they are capable of being Univerſity-Scholars: This is the ſame with Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: but what truth is in either, I leave to the wiſe to judge. That Infants are capable of being ſubjects here or in any Kingdome upon earth, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirms, page 21. and therefore I need not prove it.</p>
               <p>Thus having anſwered I proceed to his third Argument, page 22. which is this: <hi>If Chriſt would have ſome Children received as Diſciples, then they are Diſciples: but Chriſt would have ſome Children received as Diſciples; Therefore.</hi> All the queſtion (ſaith he) is of the Antecedent (namely) whether Chriſt would have ſome Infants received as Diſciples or no: the which he ſeems to prove, by theſe Scriptures, in his 22 page <hi>Luke</hi> 2.47, 48. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.5. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.41. the which Scriptures I ſhall ſet downe at large to the view of all, that they may ſee and conſider whether they prove ſuch things as he brings them for, or not.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures ſpeak thus: <hi>Luke</hi> 2.47, 48. <hi>And all that heard him were aſtoniſhed at his underſtanding, and anſwers: when they ſaw him they were amazed; and his Mother ſaid unto him, Son, why haſt thou ſo dealt with us? behold, thy Father and I have ſought thee ſorrowing.</hi> Mat. 19.5. <hi>And ſaid, For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife; and they twain ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> Mar. 9.41. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall give you a cup of water to drinke in my name, becauſe ye belong to me, verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall not loſe his reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:118449:46"/>Now what the two firſt Scriptures are to the purpoſe, I leave to all that can read and underſtand Eagliſh to judge. But it may be he will ſay the Printer hath done him wrong. I anſwer, Then I have done him none, as all may ſee, that read the place, and conſider the quotations page 22. and I looked alſo in his <hi>Errata,</hi> but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſpoken of it: and truly I dare be no interpreter of his meaning, without his words: therefore it remaineth that I onely ſpeak to that. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.41. and <hi>Luke</hi> 9.47. Which I find after were quoted in that page, thus: <hi>And Jeſus pereeiving the thoughts of their hearts, took a Child and ſet him by him, and ſaid, Whoſoever ſhall receive this Child in my name, and whoſoever ſhall give a cup of water to you to drinke in my name, ſhall not loſe their reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt, Let the Reader take notice that the word <hi>Diſciple</hi> is not to be found in the Text, therefore it cannot prove Infants Diſciples: for if we prove the reſurrection and the eternall judgement, we muſt bring a Scripture that ſpeask of the word <hi>reſurrection</hi> and <hi>eternall judgement:</hi> and ſo did Chriſt to the <hi>Saddnees;</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That the dead ſhall riſe, is evident,</hi> and his ſayings we take for as good Scripture as any is in the Bible, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith we would not, in his tenth poſition; to the anſwer of which I refer you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To that in <hi>Mark</hi> 9.41. its evident he ſpeaks to the twelve, ſaying, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall give you a cup of water,</hi> &amp;c. And that he ſpake of actuall believers, is evident, ver. 42. in theſe words: <hi>And whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that beleive in me,</hi> &amp;c. Now that little Infants, that can neither ſpeak nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, are beleivers in Chriſt, I utterly deny (and let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> or any man prove it by Scripture if they can.) for <hi>Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10.17. therefore he ſpeaks of ſuch little ones as <hi>John</hi> writes to, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.12. which had <hi>known the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, To that in <hi>Luke</hi> 9.48. <hi>Whoſoever receiveth this Child in my name, receiveth me,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, The Lord Chriſt himſelf anſwereth, or rather cleareth this to purpoſe, as you may read <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. at large. Now that <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> do ſpeak of one and the ſame thing, is clear, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>Luke</hi> 9.46. which words are theſe: <hi>Then there aroſe a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118449:46"/>
reaſoning among themſelves, which of them ſhould be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt:</hi> with Mat: 18.1. which words are theſe: <hi>At the ſame time came the Diſciples unto Jeſus, ſaying, Who is the greateſt in the Kingdome of Heaven?</hi> by this we ſee it is all one thing. Now to the following words of Chriſt, which are theſe: <hi>And Jeſus called a little Child unto him, and ſet him in the midſt of them, and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, Except ye be converted and become as little children, you ſhall not enter into the kingdome of heaven. Whoſoever therefore ſhall humble himſelf as this little Child, the ſame is the greateſt in the Kingdom of heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve, He doth not ſay that the little Child was or ſhould be greateſt in the Kingdome of heaven; but whoſoever of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples did humble themſelves as this little Child, the ſame is greateſt, <hi>&amp;c..</hi> And then ſaith he, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Whoſo ſhall receive one ſuch little Child in my name, receiveth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is plain and clear (as the mouth of the Lord himſelf hath ſpoken it) what children he would have received as Diſciples in his name: not little children of a few dayes old, that can neither ſpeak nor underſtand; but ſuch as humble themſelves, and are converted from their ſins, and become as little children.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, <hi>How do you mean they ſhould become as little children?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I mean as Chriſt in this place, that they ſhould be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and converted; and as <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. that they ſhould become <hi>Children in malice, but in underſtanding be ye men:</hi> and as <hi>Peter</hi> meaneth 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. that men ſhould <hi>Lay aſide all malice, and all guile, and hypocriſies, and envies and all evil ſpeakings and as new-borne Babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word that they may grow thereby:</hi> and whoſoever ſhall receive one ſuch little one as a Diſciple, in the name of Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth me ſaith Chriſt: bur whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that believe in him it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the Sea (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.5.6.)</p>
               <p>Again if we ſhall underſtand that little Children are believers in this place, then it followeth, that whoſoever is a believer, and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his ſon betimes, as <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſeth, It were better for him to have a milſtone hanged about his neck, and to be drowned in the

depth of the Sea: for certain we are, that whoſoever correcteth his Child, will offend him. And thus you ſee the abſurdity which will follow.</p>
               <p>Thus having anſwered all his Arguments, or rather Cavils, that have any weight in them, or colour upon them; I leave it to the wiſe to judge, and proceed to prove, that little children, that can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeak nor underſtand, are not nor cannot be Chriſts Diſciples. And having proved already, both by Scripture and reaſon, that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt are ſuch as are capable of the teachings of Chriſt, I go to my ſecond Argument.</p>

               <p>If this be the mark that Chriſt hath given to all men to know his Diſciples by, (namely) if they love one another as he hath loved them, then no man can know little Infants, that can neither ſpeak nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, to be the Diſciples of Chriſt, becauſe they cannot ſo love one another as Chriſt hath loved them, neither do they know it is their duty.</p>

                  <hi>And the Diſciples came and ſaid unto him, Why ſpeakeſt thou unto them in Parables? He anſwered and ſaid unto them, Becauſe it is given to you to know the myſteries of the Kingdome; but to others it is not given:</hi> From whence I argue thus:</p>
               <p>If the Diſciples of Chriſt be ſuch as it is given unto to know the myſteries of the Kingdome of heaven; then little children that do not know the myſteries of the Kingdom, are not his Diſciples.</p>

               <p>Therefore children (to whom it is not given) cannot be Chriſts diſciples.</p>
               <p>But I remember Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaid, <hi>If God call children Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, why may not we call them diſciples?</hi> Now it may be he will object (here) and ſay, <hi>If Chriſt ſay that little children are of

the kingdom of heaven, Why may not we ſay they underſtand the myſteries of the kingdom?</hi> I anſwer, The cauſe is plain: all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that are free-born ſubjects in a kingdom, are of that kingdom, and belong to that kingdom, and may enjoy all the priviledges in that kingdom, ſo far as little children need to enjoy: but yet none of them know the myſteries of the Government and Order of that kingdom, nor the Rights and Cuſtoms of it, till they come to underſtanding to learn them; and when they learn, then they are ſcholars or diſciples; and to them that learn <hi>it is given to know</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So alſo I believe that little children, according to the Scriptures, do belong to the kingdom of heaven, and partake of the priviledges of divine protection and likewiſe of the redemption that is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus although they know nor believe nothing of it, till they be of yeers and diſcretion to be diſciples of Chriſt, and begin to learn of him; and then, <hi>To them it is given to know the myſteries of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>My ninth Argument is from <hi>Luke</hi> 14.33. in theſe words: <hi>So likewiſe whoſoever he be of you that forſaketh not all that he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118449:49"/>
hath, cannot be my diſciple.</hi> From whence I reaſon thus:</p>
               <p>If none can be Chriſts diſciples, but ſuch as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering before what it will coſt, are willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all that they have, yea and their own lives alſo for his ſake; then little children, that can neither conſider what it will coſt, nor yet reſolve in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what to do, cannot poſſibly be Chriſts diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>But none can be Chriſts diſciples, without they have the uſe of their Will, Reaſon, and Affections, ſo far as to conſider before what it will coſt, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve after, whatſoever it coſt, to forſake all, and their own lives alſo, as is proved by all theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37, 38. and <hi>Mark</hi> 8.34. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24, 25.</p>
               <p>Therefore, they which ſay little children, that can do none of theſe things, are Chriſts diſciples, it is much to be feared that they never yet learned to know what a diſciple of Chriſt is, and are none them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſhewed the deceit of Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Arguments in general, by which they would prove that Infants are Church-members and Chriſts diſciples, and ſo fit ſubjects for Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm; I leave it to the view of all, both friend and foe; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to anſwer Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> eight Arguments, by which he ſaith he proveth the Anabaptiſts way of Baptizing ſinful.</p>
               <p>His firſt Argument is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If there be no word of precept or example for baptizing the childe of any one Chriſtian at yeers of diſcretion; then to delay their baptiſm till yeers of diſcretion, and then to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize them, is not the Scripture-way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there is no one word of precept or example, in all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for the baptizing of the childs of any one Chriſtian at yeers of diſeretion:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:118449:49"/>
                  <hi>Therefore, to defer it till then, and then to baptize them, is not the Scripture-way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I would gladly know whether. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> do or dare judge <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Jeſus to be no Chriſtian, who ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.46, 47. <hi>My ſoul doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour,</hi> &amp;c. if he will deny her to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who rejoyced in God her Saviour, then I will be bold to ſay he doth not know what a Chriſtian is, yea and that he is none himſelf.</p>
               <p>Again, if he confeſs her to be a Chriſtian, then his Argument is worth nothing: for her childe. <hi>viz.</hi> her Son Jeſus, was baptized at yeers of diſcretion, when he was thirty yeers of age, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. And thus I have given him an example. And our way of baptizing of people at yeers of diſcretion, is a Scripture-way, and therefore not ſinful.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall retort his Argument upon himſelf, that all men may ſee his folly; thus:</p>
               <p>If there be no word of precept nor example in all the Scripture, for baptizing the childe of any Chriſtian before they come to yeers of diſcretion; then [ſo] to baptize them, is not the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-way.</p>
               <p>But there is no word of precept nor example in all the Scripture for baptizing the childe of any one Chriſtian before yeers of diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Therefore, to baptize them before yeers of diſcretion, is not the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-way, and therefore ſinful.</p>
               <p>And thus is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> wounded with the edge of his own ſword, and his folly manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Now to the ſecond Argument which is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That practice which is utterly inconſiſtent with the obeying of Chriſts rule for baptiſm, is a ſinful practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the baptizing of children of Chriſtians at yeers of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is utterly inconſiſtent with obedience to the rule for ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore, ſuch baptizing is a ſinful practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the ſame with the firſt Argument; therefore the ſame anſwer may ſerve. But yet to make Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s folly manifeſt, I ſhall give him his Argument again, thus:</p>
               <p>That practice which is utterly inconſiſtent with the obeying of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118449:50"/>
Chriſts rule for Baptiſm, is a ſinful practice.</p>
               <p>But the baptizing of children of Chriſtians, or others, before they come to yeers of diſcretion, is utterly inconſiſtent with the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſts rule:</p>
               <p>Therefore, it is a ſinful practice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would make us offenders for doing of nothing, that is to ſay, for not baptizing children in their non-age;</p>
               <p>I anſwer: He can never make it a ſin, till he ſhew us what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand we have broke in not baptizing them: for, all ſin is the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of ſome law: therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> But there is no law nor command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all the Scripture to baptize little babes that cannot ſpeak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to yeers of diſcretion: Therefore, no ſin to let it alone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is both precept and example for baptizing men and women at yeers of diſcretion, <hi>viz.</hi> when they believe, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12. <hi>When they believed Philips preaching, they were baptized, both men and women.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 10.48. <hi>Peter</hi> commanded them to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now ſeeing there is both precept and example for it, therefore it is no ſin to baptize men and women at yeers of diſcretion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Mr. <hi>Baxters,</hi> Mr. <hi>Halls,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> way of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing is ſinful, is evident,</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe they baptize little babes before they come to yeers of diſcretion, for which they have neither precept nor example, therefore utterly inconſiſtent with Chriſts rule for baptiſm, and a ſinful practice, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf hath granted in theſe former Arguments: and thus out of his own mouth he is judged and condemned for a ſinner.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this their way of baptizing infants before they come to yeers of diſcretion, is ſinful, I further prove,</p>
               <p>Becauſe they, by their tradition of Rantizing or Sprinkling babes before they underſtand and believe the Goſpel, do make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt (which is, To baptize men and women when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and underſtand) of none effect; and ſo, <hi>in vain</hi> they worſhip God: and they which <hi>take his name in vain,</hi> he will <hi>not hold them guiltleſs.</hi> See <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.7, 8, 9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.8, 9. and thus they binde two ſins together, and in the one they ſhall not go unpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:118449:50"/>Now to his Third Argument, which is drawn from that which he hath ſpoken already, as he himſelf confeſſes: which he layeth down thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That practiſe which goeth upon meer uncertainty, and hath no Scripture-Rule to guide it, is not according to the will of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the practiſe of baptizing of children of Chriſtians at age, goes upon meer uncertainties and hath no Scripture-rule to guide it:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therfore it is not according to the will of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who would think Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> could have chopped one Argument into ſo many pieces, to multiply words? for this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the ſame in ſubſtance with the two former, onely put downe in other words. But I further anſwer thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That to baptize men and women when they believe, is not an uncertain rule, but very certain, both from the command of Chriſt, and example of the Apoſtles, as <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. [He that believes and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.] And <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. [They that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word were baptized and added], <hi>&amp;c. chap.</hi> 8.12. [When they believed <hi>Philips</hi> preaching, they were baptized both men and women.] And verſ. 37. [If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayeſt be baptized.] Thus we ſee that it is guided by Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule; and therefore it is moſt certain, by Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> grant.</p>
               <p>But I muſt needs give Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> his owne Argument againe, thus:</p>
               <p>That practice which goeth upon meer uncertainty, and hath no Scripture-rule to guide it, is not according to the will of Chriſt (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>)</p>
               <p>But (ſay I) the practice of Baptizing little Babes before they come to years of diſcretion, goes upon meer uncertainties, having no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-rule to guide it:</p>
               <p>Therefore it is not according to the will of Chriſt, by Mr. Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters owne confeſſion.</p>
               <p>His fourth Argument is this: <hi>That practice which will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fill the Church with perpetual contentions, (as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a matter that cannt be determined by any known rule, is not according to the minde of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the practice of baptizing Chriſtians children at age, upon
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:118449:51"/>
their profeſſion, is ſuch as will neceſſarily fill the Church with perpetual contentions:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore it is not according to the mind of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the baptizing of men and women when they believe, is a matter that can be and is determined by a known rule in Scripture; therefore no juſt cauſe of contentions, becauſe it is acccording to the will and minde of Chriſt, as I have proved by thoſe Scriptures quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the a foreſaid Argument.</p>
               <p>Again, I ſhall retort his owne Argument upon himſelf thus:</p>
               <p>That practice which will neceſſarily fill the Church with perpetual contentions (as being about a matter that cannot be determined by any known Rule) is not according to the minde of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But the practice of baptizing little Babes before they come to years of diſcretion, is a thing which there is no known rule for in all the word of God:</p>
               <p>Therefore it is not according to the minde of Chriſt, and there is juſt cauſe to contend againſt it, and that perpetually.</p>
               <p>And thus, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I have thrown your owne Arguments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your owne head, and you are fallen into the ſame pit which you digged for others; and thus is your folly manifeſted in the fourth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>Your fifth Argument is thus: <hi>That doctrine which would turn the Ordinance of Baptiſme out of the Churches of the Saints (or neer turn it out) is contrary to the doctrine of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>this Doctrine of theirs (that thoſe onely ſhould be baptized that are directly made Diſciples by the preaching of men ſent, according to the text,</hi> Mat. 28.19, 20.) <hi>would turn baptiſme for the moſt part out of the Churches of the Saints:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore it is contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer: It ſeemes it is Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> judgement, that they which preach and baptiſe according to the Commandment Chriſt hath given to his Diſeiples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. are thoſe which turn baptiſme out of the Church: and yet he will not ſhew us one Scripture to prove that any elſe ever were baptized but ſuch as were made Diſciples according to the will and minde of Chriſt, <hi>(viz.)</hi> by the preaching of the Goſpel. But I confeſs ſuch a Doctrine doth not almoſt, but altogether turne Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> baptiſme out of the Church: for <hi>we have no ſuch cuſtome, nor the Churches of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118449:51"/>
God,</hi> as to baptize little Babes that can neither ſpeak, nor underſtand what the Goſpel is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall give Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> his owne Argument at firſt, thus: That Doctrine which would turn the Ordinance of Chriſts bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm out of the Church (or neer out) is contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But this Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> and the reſt of the Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> which is, that all Children ſhould be baptized in their non-age, according to their practice doth turne the baptiſme of Chriſt, (which is, to baptize men and women when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) quite out of the Churches of the Saints:</p>
               <p>Therefore it is contrary to the doctrine of Chriſt, and is to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred as ſinful.</p>
               <p>And thus is Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſword turned with the edge againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>To Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſixth Argument, which is againſt the manner of baptizing by dipping, the which he makes a breach of the ſixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment (Thou ſhalt not kill) and therefore no Ordinance of God, but an hainous ſin; and ſo exhorts the Magiſtrates (pag. 134. and pag. 136. in the concluſion of his Argument) to deſtroy the Anabaptiſts as well as highway-murderers.</p>
               <p>To which I ſhall anſwer in order as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Obſerve how Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> proves it murther: he uſeth not one Scripture, therefore none can believe him, that deſires to make the word of God a ground of their Faith. But he laboureth to prove it thus; by affirming out of his owne mouth onely, that its flat mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being ordinarily uſed. And then inſinuates, thus: <hi>Its undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any underſtanding man: for</hi> (ſaith he again)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which directly tendeth to the overthrow of mens lives, being wilfully uſed, is plain murther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But dipping men over head in cold water, ordinarily doth tend to the overthrow of their health and lives:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore wilful murder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In all this, the Reader ſhall do well to obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath uſed many vain words which prove nothing, except we grant him that dipping people after this manner doth tend to the overthrow of mens lives: which we cannot do, becauſe Scripture and experience hath taught us the contrary, as I ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:118449:52"/>But he proceeds thus: <hi>I dare ſay that in Cities like</hi> London, <hi>and among the Gentlewomen that have been tenderly brought up and ancient People, and weak People, and Shopkeepers, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally women that take but little of the cold ayr, the dipping them in cold water in the courſe of nature would kill hundreds and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, either ſuddenly, or by caſting them into ſome Chronical diſeaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Obſerve: all Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> proof is nothing but he dare ſay ſo; let the Reader obſerve that: but was there ever ſuch a piece of Divinity ſeen as this? Surely Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is much afraid of loſing of Gentlewomen that are tenderly brought up, and ſuch as take but little of the cold ayr, and Shopkeepers: he knoweth well that ſuch uſually have the heavieſt purſes; and if he loſe them, he loſeth a great part of his Religion; as its well known to moſt men, that they will preach no longer then they are paid for it; nay they will be ſure of it beforehand: and therefore now he ſpeaks things that he ought not, for filthy lucres ſake, (<hi>Titus</hi> 1.11.) ſaying in effect, that if they obey the Ordinance of Chriſt, it will kill hundreds and thouſands of them, if not ſuddenly yet afterwards: He could not nor dare not poſitively ſay <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> becauſe there are hundreds and thouſands now alive not onely baptized people, but alſo others, yea of his owne judgement, that can prove him a falſe ſpeaker, by what they have ſeen and known.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems it will caſt them into diſeaſes that will kill them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But he did not tell us how long after: it may be they might have dyed as ſoon, if they had never been dipped: for all muſt dye afterward, or elſe never; therefore every fool may ſee his folly in this. But he deſperately proceeds, like a man reſolved not to <hi>take heed to his tongue,</hi> which as <hi>James</hi> ſaith, chap. 3.6. <hi>is ſet on fire of hell,</hi> and wherein is a world of iniquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I know not <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> what trick a covetous Landlord can find out to get his Tenants to dye apace, that he might have new fines and heriots, likelier then to encourage ſuch preachers, that he may get them all to turne Anabaptiſts; and covetous Phyſitinas (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) ſhould no be much againſt them: Catarrhes and Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which are the two great fountains of moſt mortal diſeaſes in mans body, could ſcarce have a more notable means to produce
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118449:52"/>
where they are not, or to increaſe them where they are: Appolexies, Lethargies, Palſies and all Comatious diſeaſes would be promoted by it: So would Cephalalgies, Hemicranies, Phthiſes debelity of the Stomack, Crudities and almoſt all Feavers Diſſenteries, Diarrhaeas. Collick, Iliack Paſſions Convulſions, Spaſmes, Tremors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all Hepatick, Splenetick Pulmoniack Perſons Hypocondriachs, will ſoon have enough of it: in a word, its good for nothing but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch men out of the world that are burdenſome, and to rank Church-yards.</q> And all this is proved by Mr. <hi>Baxters dare ſay ſo.</hi> Sound Divinity, and plain Scripture-proof; even ſuch as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath made uſe of all over his book. But was there ever ſuch doctrine as this preach'd by Chriſt or any of his Diſciples? would not any Rational indifferent man take Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for a Mountebanck rather then a Divine, and that he hath more skill in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring bodies then ſouls? And may not any man that hath read and beleived the Scriptures, and deſires to walk according to that bleſſed rule preſcribed in them, and to contend earneſtly for the faith once delivered to the Saints by them; may not ſuch ſay of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer, when he would have turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the deputy from the faith, <hi>O full of all ſubtility and all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe! thou Child of the Devil, thou enemy of all righteouſneſs; wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert the right wayes of the Lord?</hi>) And though I cannot ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt be blinde for a ſeaſon;</hi> yet I can truly and with a good Conſcience ſay he is ſpiritually blind already, and to prove it to his face: for <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the Saints that have <hi>the eyes of their underſtanding opened</hi> to give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to <hi>add to their faith vertue, and to vertue knowledg, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience godlineſs, and to godlineſs brotherly kindneſs, and to bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindneſs charity: but he that lacketh theſe things, is blind, and cannot ſee afar off, and hath forgotten that himſelf was purged from his old ſins,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9.&amp;c. but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath ſhewed any of theſe forenamed vertues in all this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I leave it to the wiſe to judge.</p>
               <p>But I leave him to ſtand or fall to his maſter, and proceed to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a fool according to his fooliſhneſs as I am commanded, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.5. leſt he be wiſe in his own conceit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:118449:53"/>And firſt, if it be the only way for covetous Landlords and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, as he ſaith; then if the Devil had not put it in their heads before, yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (like a diligent Servant) hath done it now.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as concerning his new-found diſeaſes he talks of, I ſhall ask him two queſtions:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether he can ſay in his conſcience that he ever did know of his owne knowledge any baptized perſon dye of it, or fell into any of theſe diſeaſes afterwards? I queſtion not, if he had known any ſuch, he would have put downe their names in his book; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all rational people know, that they may fall into ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe after they are dipped in water, and yet that not be in the cauſe of it, no more then it is to them that never were dipped. Againe, we have through mercy plenty of faithful witneſſes, both old and young, Gentlewomen and Ladies wiſe and honourable, with many other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both of ſtrong and weak conſtitutions, that can prove Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> a falſe accuſer, and an inventer of evil things in this particular. And as for my owne part, I can boldly ſay with a good conſcience, in the preſence of God, to his glory, that I have known many weak and ſickly before, that have recovered health and ſtrength afterwards: and ſome immediately, in a few dayes; yea and that when they have been ſo ill, that all Doctors have given them over: but I never knew any miſcarry in my life; ſo mightily hath God gone along with us, owning his owne Ordinance</p>
               <p>If any ſhall be ſo fooliſh as to ſay, that people become Ranters afterwards, and thats a ſign of judgement, and not of Gods own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as his owne ordinance.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that is after they are again gone away from the faith, and deny the Ordinance of Chriſt which once they owned: then, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>It had been better for them that they had never known the way of truth, then after they have known it to turn from the holy Commandment once delivered to them.</hi> But more of this in anſwer to his laſt Argument.</p>
               <p>My ſecond Queſtion is to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Whether he be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in his conſcience that ſome or all of theſe diſeaſes that he ſpeaks of, do not frequently reign upon a multitude of perſons in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> or elſewhere, that never were dipped in cold water: let him or any man deny if they can. Now if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> do know none of his own knowledg that have periſhed or are like to periſh by dipping,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:118449:53"/>
by any of his aforeſaid ſtrange diſeaſes, and is alſo convinced in conſcience that thouſands in the Nation do dye of them that were never dipped in cold water, then let all impartial people judge whether Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be a good tree, by the fruit he bringeth forth. If his intentions ſeem in his owne eyes to be good, and that he aym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hereby to undelude ſome ſouls, and keep others from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded; yet he muſt needs be one of thoſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. which <hi>do evil, that good may come thereof; whoſe damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks of, is Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his ſalv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up all this, with ſaying that they may be baptized in warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, I am not of his Judgement in that; for I believe its his weakneſs.</p>
               <p>But then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, we cannot agree among our ſelves; and therefore people have no reaſon to believe us.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, We do not deſire people to believe us, if we did agree never ſo well, but to ſearch the Scripture, to ſee whether the things we ſpeak be ſo or no, like the noble <hi>Bereans, Acts</hi> 17.11. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to believe: we would not have them hanged out of the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe not us, as Mr, <hi>Baxter</hi> would have us, becauſe we believe not him: but we know the Wheat and Tares muſt grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the field, which is the world, until the harveſt, according to the commandment of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What if we do not agree together in every thing, doth it follow therefore that the truth muſt not be believed and practiſed? I hope not: for its eaſie to prove that the Diſciples of Chriſt in the firſt Churches did differ in their judgements, although it was not their wiſdome, nor yet to the glory of God; when one was of <hi>Paul,</hi> and another of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and another of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and another of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I believe that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were not of one minde, when the contention grew ſo ſharp between them that they parted; and walked no more together, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.39. and likewiſe <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood him to the face.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is no marvel he telleth us of this, becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his brethren the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> agree ſo well: doth not one hold for baptiſme with the ſign of the Croſs, and another againſt it?
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:118449:54"/>
for Baptiſm in a Font, and another in a Baſon? one for baptizing children of believers onely, and others for the baptizing of all? one for Railes, and bowing at the Altar, and others againſt it? one for the Common-prayer-book, and others for the Scotch Directory? nay, do not they perſecute one another to Priſon, Baniſhment, even death it ſelf ſometimes? If Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Argument be good, then let all people take good heed how they believe him and his brethren: and ſo I deſire they may do however, except they bring plainer Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-proofes then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath done in his book for Infants Church-member-ſhip and baptiſme.</p>
               <p>The next remarkable thing of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> is denying of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of believers to be the cuſtome of the Church in the primitive times; and he is not aſhamed to give the Scripture the lye before all men, ſaying, It is not proved by any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And why is it not proved, I pray? it may be, becauſe our Tranſlators have not put the word <hi>Baptize</hi> into Engliſh, and called it Dipping, therefore he will not grant it: but yet I queſtion not the proving of it by the Scripture, notwithſtanding his ſubtil evaſions of the truth, ſaying, <hi>They might well be ſaid to go downe into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe the country was mountainous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer; If this be all that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> have to prove it was not dipping in thoſe dayes, I think I have more to prove it was dipping: and firſt, I ſhall take what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his Brethren have granted me: for Mr. Baxter in his 135. page ſaith, the word ſignifieth as well to <hi>waſh</hi> as to <hi>Dip:</hi> ſo that by his owne words, it ſignifies Dipping as well as Waſhing. And in the Catechiſme made by the learned of the Land, when they queſtion what is the outward form in baptiſme; their owne anſwer is, <hi>Water, wherein the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon baptized is dipped,</hi> &amp;c. thus much <hi>(as Paul ſaith to the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens) Acts</hi> 17.28. their owne Poets confeſs.</p>
               <p>From whence I argue thus: If the word do ſignifie <hi>Dipping</hi> as well as <hi>Waſhing,</hi> then they can no more blame us for <hi>practiſing</hi> dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, then we may blame them for practiſing waſhing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the word ſignifie Dipping and Waſhing one as well as another, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and others ſay it doth, then how are they to be blamed that do neither; but onely ſprinkle a few drops of water upon the face of a child? for if the word ſignifie both Dipping and Waſhing, and ſprinkling be neither Dipping nor
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118449:54"/>
waſhing, then they have deluded the People all this while, and at leaft there quarters of the People of this Nation are ſtill unbaptized. And what an horrible thing is this, that a whole Nation almoſt ſhould thus be deceived by a company of learned ſelf-ſeeking Men, who profeſs themſelves to be eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, and to teach others that they ſhould not deceive, and as yet have not taught themſelves?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the word ſignifie both waſhing and dipping, then it muſt needs be waſhing by dipping, or wetting all over: for who can waſh a thing that is not wet?</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> objection, that Chriſt ſaith, Ye need not but waſh the ſeet, and ye are <hi>Clean every whit;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, If Chriſt had ſpoken that about baptiſme, as he did about waſhing the Diſciples feet, to teach them humility, it had been a good proofe: but he did not; therefore its none: but for to ſhew their humility, and make them clean every whit from pride, the waſhing one anothers feet did ſhew it, as well as if they had waſhed their whole Bodies: but now Chriſt, when he ſpeaketh of baptizing believers <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. he doth not ſay, He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is baptized on his <hi>Feet,</hi> ſhall be ſaved every wit; but, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved:</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> and the Eunuch went both down into the water, and he baptized him, and not his feet only; for then they ſhould not have needed to have both gone down into the water. Again, If the word <hi>him</hi> or <hi>them</hi> includes the whole man or men, as all that have underſtanding will confeſs it doth, if they be not partial in this caſe; then whole man or men and women were baptized of <hi>John</hi> in the River of <hi>Jordane</hi> confeſſing their ſins, and of <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 8.12. and the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.10. that when Chriſt was baptized, he came up out of the water: which plainly ſheweth, that he went firſt down into the water, or elſe how could he come out of it? and the Scripture ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 3.23. that <hi>John baptized in Enon, neer to Salem, becauſe there was much water there,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath given a learned anſwer to that Scripture: <hi>(viz.)</hi> That Travellers report that the River <hi>Enon</hi> where <hi>John</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, is but a little Brook, that a man may almoſt ſtep over: and that he had from ſome lying Traveller or other: for the Proverb is, that <hi>Travellers may ly by authority.</hi> O fearfull wickedneſs: and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118449:55"/>
ſurely want of the fear of God, and love to the truth of his word, that a Divine, a profeſſed teacher of others ſhould turn aſide his eares from the truth of the Scripture, that ſaith <hi>there was much water there,</hi> and that was the cauſe that they carried there to baptize; I ſay, that he ſhould turn aſide his ears from ſuch plain Scripture, to believe a Man, nay a travelling Man, who are ſuſpected of all Men to be lyers in many things. A deſperate afrront to the word of God which is true from the beginning. Why may not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Sir <hi>John Mandevil</hi> as well as another, that telleth us of Men that are born with but one foot, and yet go as faſt with it as we can do with two; and it is ſo big, that in the heat of the day they can lay them down on their backs, and hold up their foot againſt the Sun, and it ſhades their whole Body? and of other Men that have no head at all, but their eyes and their mouth ſtand in their Breſts? This is Travellers news, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will believe it: and Sir <hi>John</hi> was to believed be (for ought I know) as ſoon as the Taveller that told Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that the River <hi>Enon</hi> was but a little Brooke that a man might almoſt ſtep over. But its a good turn the <hi>almoſt</hi> is in: but is this Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> plain Scripture-proof? Then the Lord be praiſed that hath delivered my Soul from believing of him and ſuch as he is: and let every poore Soul labour to <hi>ſave themſelves</hi> (as Peter ſaith, Acts 2.40.) <hi>out of the hands of ſuch an untoward gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> which ſpeak things they ought not, and believe Travellers reports rather then the truth of the word of God, and all for filthy lucres ſake.</p>
               <p>But again, What if we grant that the Travellers words are true, will it therefore follow that the River <hi>Enon</hi> is no bigger in no place, then it was where the Traveller could almoſt ſtep over? Are there not many Rivers in <hi>England</hi> that are very little in ſome places, and yet in other places very large? I cannot think but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth know that it is ſo: and if ſo, then <hi>Enon</hi> might have much water in another place though but a little where the Traveller was.</p>
               <p>Further, He ſaith the Jaylor in the night in his houſe was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: but the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>He tooke them the ſame hour of the night and waſhed their Stripes. and was baptized he and all his ſtraightway; and then he brought them into his houſe, and ſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> meat before them and rejoyced believing in God with all his houſe.</hi> Now if the Jayler took <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> it implies they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118449:55"/>
took them out: and the next words prove it plainly; for it ſaith, <hi>He brought them into his houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next is this: Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, that we deſperately conclude, that if it be Gods way, he will ſave our lives, how probable ſoever the danger may ſeem to be: to which he anſwereth four things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſaith this is to beg the queſtion, nay he ſaith he hath ſhewed, and is a ſhewing, that it is not Gods way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If he hath ſhewed any thing already in theſe ſix Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which do prove baptizing of believers not to be Gods way. I leave it to the Reader to judge, when he hath conſidered his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and my Anſwers, and compared them both with the word of God, by which we ought to try all things.</p>
               <p>Againe, He ſaith he hath ſhewed, and is a ſhewing, that it is not Gods way: by which the Reader may take notice, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is conſcious to himſelf that he hath not yet proved it to any purpoſe; and therefore he ſaith he is a ſhewing that it is not the way of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Well then, we will take notice how he proves it hereafter: for by his owne confeſſion, it ſeems he hath not proved it yet.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith God muſt not be temped. This was the Devils trick, to have drawn Chriſt, under pretence of Scripture, and of truſting God, to have caſt himſelf into danger of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But therefore that way which the Devil tempted Chriſt to walk in, was never the way of God: but baptizing men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men when they do believe, hath been and is the way of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12.</p>
               <p>Again, whereas you ſay the Devil tempted Chriſt by pretending the Scripture; I anſwer, it is true, he did ſo: but there was no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that ſaid <hi>Caſt thy ſelf downe,</hi> nor yet that ſaid, <hi>He ſhall keep thee [at any time]</hi> as I have ſhewed you already at large, in anſwer to your tenth Poſition. And ſo likewiſe when [you] tempt men and women to baptize their little children, you alſo pretend Scripture; but you have none that ſay they ſhould or ought to be baptized, nor any Scripture that ſheweth that ever they were baptized in all the word of God, and therefore I well remember how angry you are with us in your 10 Poſition, for asking you for a Scripture to prove baptiſme of Infants, calling of us <hi>bruit beaſts,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore whoſe practice
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118449:56"/>
is moſt like the tempters, yours or ours, I leave it to the impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſay, we might have ſaid to the Diſciples, That if it were Gods command to keep the Sabbath, then they needed not to rub the ears of corne; for God could ſuſtain them without.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So we might, if it had been Gods command ſo to keep the Sabbath, as not to eat on the Sabbath day: but it was not; for they might eat and did eat on the Sabbath dayes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.22, 23, 24, 25. although they were not to kindle files, to bake, or ſeeth, or roſt on that day: and therefore this your Objection is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for there is both command and example to baptize men and women when they believe, all the world over: See <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. with <hi>Act.</hi> 10.48. and chap. 8.12. but there is no command nor example to compel or perſwade men to faſt on the Sabbath day more then of another day; therefore your Argument is frothy, and vain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You ſay, If it were a Duty, yet when it is inconſiſtent with a greater duty, it is at any time ſinful; for it is alwaies a ſin to prefer a leſs duty before a greater: But the duty of ſelf-preſervation is a moral duty and baptizing is but poſitive; therefore it is a ſin to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it before ſelf-preſervation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now I hope Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath laid himſelf open to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; ſo that all men may know him to be one of thoſe that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1, 2. in theſe words: <hi>This know alſo, that in the laſt daies perillous times ſhall come: for men ſhall be lovers of their owne ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers,</hi> &amp;c. Now whether it doth not appear that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is a lover of his owne ſelf more then of Chriſt, when he prefers ſelf-preſervation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obeying the command of Chriſt, and following the example of Chriſt; I leave it to them that fear God to judge: for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If ye love me, keep my commandments,</hi> John 14.15. and <hi>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me,</hi> verſ. 21. <hi>But he that loveth Father and Mother, Wife or Children; yea or his one life, better then me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is not worthy of me:</hi> and, <hi>He that will ſave his life ſhall loſe it,</hi> Mat. 10.27, 38, 39. And truely if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> make ſo much of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt into the water, how will he follow him through the fire, if he ſhould be called to it? It is very probable he would write as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118449:56"/>
big a book againſt ſuffering with Chriſt, as he hath now done againſt obeying of Chriſt in this Ordinance of baptiſme; of which Chriſt ſaith thus: <hi>It becometh</hi> (not onely him, but alſo) <hi>us to fulfil all righteouſneſs,</hi> Matth. 3.15. and yet for all this, it is Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> judgement that ſelf-preſervation doth become us better then fulfilling of righteouſneſs in obeying this command, or following this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I deſire the Reader may diligently, and in the fear of God conſider how like Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> counſel to us, is unto <hi>Peters</hi> counſel to the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16, 21, 22, 23. <hi>When Chriſt began to ſhew to his Diſciples that he muſt ſuffer many things of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and chiefe Prieſts, and Scribes, and be killed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then Peter began to be rebuke him, ſaying, Be it far from thee Lord; this ſhall not be unto thee:</hi> even ſo doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſay to us, and eſpecially to Gentlewomen old and weak People, and Shopkeepers, and women that take but little of the cold ayre, then he tells them, O be it far from you; this ſhall not be unto you: for I dare ſay, in the courſe of nature, it will kill hundreds and thouſands of you, either ſuddenly, or by caſting you into ſome Chronical diſeaſe <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus we ſee how Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> counſel and <hi>Peters</hi> do agree in theſe caſes; therefore let all that truely fear God, learn of Chriſt to anſwer Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as he anſwered St. <hi>Peter,</hi> verſe. 23. in theſe words; <hi>Get thee behind me Satan; for thou art an offence unto me; for thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I leave what I have written to the judgement of them that fear God: and proceed to his ſeventh Argument.</p>
               <p>His ſeventh Argument (as he ſaith) is againſt another wickedneſs in the manner of baptizing, which he ſaith is our dipping of Perſons naked, as is uſual with the modeſteſt that he hath heard of; which, he ſaith further, is a breach of the ſeventh Commandment, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery,</hi> and therefore is intolerable wickedneſs, and not Gods Ordinance. To all which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I am ſure it is an intolerable wickedneſs in Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and a breach of the ninth Commandment, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs againſt thy Neighbour,</hi> for him to ſay we baptize people naked; and a thing which he never ſaw with his eyes, as he confeſſeth when he ſaith he hears ſo. It may be indeed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118449:57"/>
that ſome which he accounts Chriſtians, have ſo little grace, and of the fear of God in them, as to tell him ſuch lies as theſe, and he is willing to belive them; although for my part I believe I have bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and been at the baptizing of many hundreds, if not a thouſand, and never ſaw any baptized naked in my life, neither is it allowed nor approved of amongſt any that I know of. But ſuppoſe that ſome men have been baptized naked, when there were none but men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would this be ſuch an unheard-of wickedneſs as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> talks of? or can it be a breach of the ſeventh Commandment for men to ſee each other naked? or if it be ſuch an immodeſt thing as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks of, then the Diſciples of Chriſt were immodeſt, and broke the ſeventh Commandment; for they were together a fiſhing, and <hi>Peter</hi> was naked amongſt them, the Word ſaith expreſly, <hi>John</hi> 21.7. therefore if at any time any ſhould have baptized a man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, being none but men together, it is not ſuch an offence as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would make it to be. I do not think but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will allow that men may go into the water together to bathe them, and yet not ſin.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth confidently charge us with baptizing Maids naked, as if he took it for granted that it were certainly true: and therefore he breaks out into theſe words, and ſaith, <hi>If Mr.</hi> Tombes <hi>could baptize all the Maids in</hi> Bewdly <hi>naked, and think it no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſty, he hath loſt his common ingenuity and modeſty with the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I confeſs if he doth ſuch things, I ſhould think he had loſt his modeſty indeed: but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould firſt prove that Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> or any man elſe did ever baptize any Maid or Women na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, in any place in <hi>England:</hi> he ſhould prove this firſt, and then he did ſomething, and had ſome ground to reaſon thus: but till then, he doth but wickedly labour, by <hi>ſaying all manner of evil ſayings on us falſly,</hi> (as Mat. 5.11.) to caſt dirt upon the truth of Chriſt, 1. by ſuppoſing the thing to be ſo without proof, ſaying, [If] Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> could do ſuch things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. by inſinuating into the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men and women, perſwading them that it is ſo, (without queſtion) and ſaying, Is not every good man ſenſible of the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his owne heart, and that he needs all helps againſt it? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and would it be no tempation to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> to be frequently imployed in baptizing Maids naked? let him ſearch and judge: Methinkes (ſaith
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118449:57"/>
he) the very mention of it, could I avoid it, is immodeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I wonder why Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, If he could avoid it: what, could he not avoid ſpeaking of untruths? Is he predeſtinated to be a Lyer, and inſinuate into peoples hearts, as if the things were certainly true, which are but his owne ſuppoſitions?</p>
               <p>And then he ſaith again, Methink, Miniſters ſhould have regard to themſelves, and not go ſo frequently into the cold water ſo often to baptize others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Truely they are careful enough; for they never meddle with ſo good a work: but I know Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is a lover of his own ſelf, and can give others of his brethren the ſame counſel; and great need; for good men are ſcarce; they had need take heed they do not kill themſelves in the ſervice of Chriſt. But it is very like that the <hi>zeal of Gods houſe</hi> will never <hi>eat up</hi> nor deſtroy Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> nor his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Prieſts of <hi>England:</hi> for I never knew any of them go into the water to baptize either men or women, for it is againſt their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; therefore he might well hold his peace in that thing: and if the Anabaptiſts do it and it be ſo dangerous as he ſaith it, his beſt way is to let them baptize as many as they will, and then they will kill themſelves the ſooner, if it be as he ſay, and then he ſhall be quit of them.</p>
               <p>But to conclude. 1. We finde that in the daies of Chriſt and the Apoſties they baptized both men and women in Rivers: See <hi>Mark</hi> 1.5. with <hi>Acts</hi> 1.12. verſ. 37, 38. and <hi>in AEnon near to Salem, becauſe there was much water there,</hi> John 3.23. all this was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of and practiced by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Now if they baptized men and women in Rivers, where there was much water; we will be bold to follow their good holy, and righteous Example, notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> foul mouth, who doth not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſlander and bely us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo the Lord Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; therefore we can through mercy well bear it, knowing that <hi>the Servant is not greater then his Lord; and if they have called the maſter of the houſe Beelzebub how much more them of his houſhold?</hi> Through mercy we can rejoyce that we are counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer any reproaches for the name of our Lord Jeſus. But let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his Brethren know, that they muſt one day give an account of all their words and actions to him that is ready to judge the quick and dead at his appearing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.5. who will come
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:118449:58"/>
with ten thouſands of his Saints to execute judgement upon, and <hi>to convince all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have ſpoken againſt him:</hi> And then all Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſerious proteſtations for the truth in one place of his Book, chap. 1. pag. 2, 3. and his cunning inſinuations againſt the truth almoſt all over his Book, will do him little good: for then thoſe which now are ſo zealous, that they thinke they ſhould do God good ſervice if they ſhould kill us, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. will ſee their error. But I heartily deſire Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and the reſt of his Brethren may ſee theirs before, if poſſible.</p>
               <p>And now to your eighth Argument, which is as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That party and practiſe which hath been ſtill branded and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with Gods eminent Judgements but never evidently with his bleſſings, is not likely to be the way of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Anabaptiſts way and practice is ſuch: Therefore not likely to be of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame ſaith Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> in his 19. Argument, in his <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaurded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which I anſwer, If this Argument be good, then thus: the <hi>Amorites</hi> were followed on with bleſſings, and enjoyed the beſt of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> 400. yeers together, while the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were in bondage and in miſery; will you therefore conclude that the <hi>Amorites</hi> were the Children of God, and that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not the Children of God? And likewiſe remember the poverty and ſufferings of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Diſciples; and how they were branded as much for Hereticks, and wicked perſons, and ſuch as knew not the Law, and were accurſed, <hi>John</hi> 7.39. as you now brand us: but dare you ſay that they were not Goods People? Truly I remember the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.3, 4, 5. that when he ſaw the proſperity of the wicked, and that they were not in trouble, nor plagued like other men, that he had like to have ſtumbled at their proſperity, and to have ſaid that they were Gods People: but it ſeems ye have ſtumbled, and are fallen, ſo as to ſpeak evill of Gods People, becauſe of their ſufferings. You further ſay, What an hinderance the Anabaptiſts were to the Goſpel in <hi>Germany,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the moſt painefull godly Miniſters: there be few Divines of note who do not bear witneſs of it frequently in their writings as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Melancthon, Illyricus; Zuinglius, Bullinger, Leo Juda,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118449:58"/>
Calvin,</hi> with multitudes more: and in pag. 140. you tell us <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglius</hi> was conſtrained to reſiſt them with all his ſtrength: but it ſeems that was too little; for you tell us preſently that the Senate was fain to deal with them with baniſhments, priſon, and death: and then you tell us that <hi>Calvin</hi> did write a Treatiſe againſt them, wherein he ſheweth (page 141.) that the Anabaptiſts were divided eſpecially into two Sect; one more moderate and ſimple, that did boaſt of Scripture; and pleaded Scripture with confidence for all they held: but the other was a ſort called <hi>Libertines,</hi> which were above Scriptures and theſe (you ſay, pag. 142.) are ſuch as forſake their Wives and Children, and laying by all labour, do live idly, and feed on other mens labours: and when they abourd with filthy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable luſt, they ſay its the command of their heavenly Father; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading Women and honeſt Matrons that its impoſſible they ſhould be partakers of the Kingdom of Heaven, unleſs they filthily proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute their Bodies; alledging that we muſt renounce all things we love beſt, and that all kinds of infamy are to be ſwallowed by the godly for Chriſts ſake; and that Publicans and Harlots go firſt into the Kingdom of Heaven: and of the treachery, lying, and ſedition wherewith theſe People everywhere do abound, there is no end nor meaſure. And, I pray (ſay you) are theſe your vertues? do you yet thinke they deſigne nothing diſhoneſt? or can you deny the truth of theſe things? no, (you ſay) nor can any man ſhew you one of the Anabaptiſts who is not blemiſhed with ſome of theſe forenamed wickedneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I hope by this time you have vented your deadly poyſon (that lay under your tongue) againſt the Anabaptiſts.</p>
               <p>To all which I anſwer, firſt, If all theſe things ſhould be true that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſaid, (as they are not) yet it ſeems Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Religion is ſo tottering and ready to fall, that he is faine to underprop it with the Anabaptiſts failings; or rather with the groſſeſt wickedneſs of thoſe that have Apoſtatized from us; and is glad to diſcover the groſs darkneſs of the worſt of men, or elſe his own light is ſo ſmall, that it will not ſhine: and when he hath reckoned up the worſt of all wickedneſs that thoſe that have apoſtized from us have committed, he would lay it all upon us; and wickedly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there is none of us free from it. And when he ſhould prove what he promiſeth, (namely) that the Anabaptiſts hindred the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118449:59"/>
preaching of the Goſpel in <hi>Germany,</hi> his proof is nothing, but telling us moſt writers of thoſe times do teſtifie it.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, He might as well have asked his fellow-Preiſts if it had been lawfull to take Tythes, and he had been ſure to have had the teſtimony both of their words and writings for it, as he hath now againſt the Anabaptiſts. And we know very well, that the poor Anabaptiſts had rich and potent Enemies wrote the ſtories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: for by Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own confeſſion, pag. 140 and 141. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was conſtrained to diſpute and try his ſtrength with the poor Anabaptiſts: and when he could not ſtop their mouths, he had the help of the Senate, who impriſoned, baniſhed, and put them to death: ſuch Arguments (I confeſs) as neither <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Peter,</hi> nor <hi>John</hi> could anſwer, but were forced to yeeld to them, and ſuffer as <hi>Hereticks, peſtilent Fellows, movers of Sedition,</hi> and <hi>ringleaders of Sects:</hi> ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 24.5. and ſo were theſe Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts ſerved at <hi>Germany:</hi> for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, pag. 140. They did not ſuffer as Anabaptiſts, but as men perjured , diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and ſeditious: and ſo I thought indeed: for as there is no ſuch way to have a ſilly ſheep worried and torn in pieces, as to put on a Bears skin on the top of him: ſo theſe learned Divines (as they call themſelves) know very well that the only way to have the Anabaptiſts priſoned, or baniſhed, or hanged, is to cloth them with all the filthy names and reproaches they can deviſe, and then all people will be ready to ſtone them: for alaſs they think whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Preiſts and Teachers ſay, muſt needs be true: or if any ſhould queſtion it, he is preſently ſuſpected to be an <hi>Heretick</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt. And this is Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> way, pag. 136. he would by Logick prove that we are guilty of the breach of the ſixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, becauſe we dip men in water; and then he cries out to the Magiſtrate to hang us up as ſoon as high way-murderers: and this is and hath been the practice of their fore-Fathers in the Prophets times, and Chriſt and the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, You tell us that <hi>Calvin</hi> wrote a Book againſt them: very well then; it ſeems <hi>Zuinglius</hi> diſputed with them, and rendered them odious to the Magiſtrate, and caſt out their name as filth for the Son Mans ſake, as you do ours now, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. and ſo the Magiſtrate priſoned, and baniſhed, and hanged them: and when they were dead and laid in their Graves, <hi>Calvin</hi> falls a writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118449:59"/>
them, when he was ſure they were paſt anſwering for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I write to you, and Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> while you are alive, and may anſwer for your ſelves; therefore I expect an anſwer from you: if you have any thing to ſay according to truth, or elſe you may forbear.</p>
               <p>But now to <hi>Calvins</hi> Letter, wherein you ſay, pag. 141. he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Anabaptiſts are divided into two ſorts: one of which did boaſt of Scripture, and pleaded Scripture with great confidence for all they held.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If they boaſted of the holy Scriptures, they boaſted of no evil, but of that which is good; which we ought to make our boaſt of, and to rejoyee in: for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 Cor. 11.10. <hi>As the truth of Chriſt is in me, no man can ſtop me of this boaſting,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>in God we will boaſt all the day long, and praiſe his name for ever,</hi> Pſa. 44.8. and if you would boaſt of them more then you do, it would be better for you.</p>
               <p>But you ſay further, they pleaded Scripture with confidence for all they held.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I wonder <hi>Calvin</hi> and you were not aſhamed to ſpeak of theſe things: what, doth it diſpleaſe you to hear men plead Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for what they hold? are you ſuch enemies to the holy Scriptures, which are able to make us wiſe to ſalvation? then take heed leſt while you boaſt your ſelves to be wiſe without them, or above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, you become not fools: for <hi>the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wiſe, that they are but vain;</hi> and <hi>takes the wiſe in their own craftineſs:</hi> therefore let no man boaſt nor glory in man, but in God and his word. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. but Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> and you have found out a way beyond the Scripture, affirming that there are a thouſand things not written in the word of God, which you ought to obey; to which you have a large anſwer to your tenth Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this point, if that be the worſt you and <hi>Calvin</hi> can ſay of thoſe Anbaptiſts (namely) that they made their boaſt of the Scripture, and pleaded Scripture for all they held; I ſhall not be aſhamed to owne them for Chriſtians, before all men.</p>
               <p>And as for your other ſort you talk of, which are above Scripture, and confound all things good and bad, God and Satan together; I, and all that own Scriptures, do deny and defie them and their wayes
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118449:60"/>
as abominable and deteſtable; and you do very wickedly to call them <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> thereby to caſt odiums upon us: for your ſelf confeſs, pag. 141. that <hi>Calvin</hi> calls them <hi>Libertines;</hi> and why then I pray, are you ſo wicked and malicious as to call them <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts?</hi> I ſuppoſe all men that are impartial and rational, will ſee your folly and wickedneſs: for in the concluſion of all you would heap all their wickedneſs upon our heads, pag. 142. ſaying, No man can ſhew you one man of the Anabaptiſts that is not tainted with ſome of theſe foreſaid wickedneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If any one of us ſhould ſay we never were lyers, then we ſhould be ſtill lyers, like your ſelf: for <hi>all men are lyers,</hi> or have been: and <hi>there is none righteous, no not one; but all are gone out of the way, and with their tongues have uſed deceit: the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Aſps is under their lips: their mouth ful of curſing and bitterneſs, and their feet ſwift to ſhed blood.</hi> See Rom. 3.10, 11, 12, 13, 14 15. and ſo are yours (Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) or elſe you would never perſwade the Magiſtrates to hang up the Anbaptiſts as well as highway-murderers, page 136. but this I confeſs is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all men, before faith and repentance: for the Lord Chriſt ſaith, that thoſe 18 upon whom the Tower of <hi>Siloam</hi> fell, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.2, 3 4. were not greater ſinners then others; but except they repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ſhould all likewiſe periſh: and ſo muſt you (Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) and others; for God is no reſpecter of pers;ons. Againe, I read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus to the Saints; <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankinde, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdome of God:</hi> and in the 11. verſ. he ſaith, <hi>Such were ſome of you: but now ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, and juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Now if there were ſuch in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as had been thus wicked, and yet were waſhed, juſtified, and ſanctified from their ſins by the Lord Jeſus; then I dare not ſay but ſuch as have been groſs ſinners, may have repented and converted, and come into the Churches of the Anabaptiſts (as you call them) in theſe dayes: for I finde that Chriſt <hi>came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance;</hi> and even thoſe that killed the Lord of life
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118449:60"/>
obtained mercy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.13. with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36, 37, 38, 39. and ſo did <hi>Paul</hi> the worſt of ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, 16. therefore if any that are now Anabaptiſts, have formerly been groſs ſinners, it was while they were of your Church, and its no more then ſome of the beſt of Saints have been, before converſion and repentance. But I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would make the world believe that the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts are all ſo now, after they become Anabaptiſts; and would make that the cauſe of it; and would perſwade the world that its our principle and judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had known any ſuch in fellowſhip with us when he wrote his Book, he ſhould have done well to have named them: but neither Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh, Paul Hobſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> are in fellowſhip with the Anabaptiſts: and as for Mr. <hi>Erbery</hi> and others that have apoſtatized, what have we to do with them? we have caſt them out from us long ſince, and they are returned to you againe. As for Mr. <hi>Denis</hi> amongſt the Levellers, he confeſſed his fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and man, and obtained mercy: and then what have you to do to play the Devils part to accuſe him againe? I believe his offence was not bigger then <hi>Peters,</hi> who denyed and forſwore his Maſter: its like therefore if you had lived in thoſe dayes you would have been ſo wicked as to have cryed downe Chriſt and his wayes, as you do now, and have ſaid (with the reſt of your fore-Fathers the Scribes and Phariſees) Its not likely that he and his way ſhould be of God; for in his proſperity none followed him but a company of poor people that knew not the Law, and were accurſed: As for the Scribes and Phariſees, and Wiſe-men, and Rulers, few or none of them were ſo ſimple as to be led aſide with him: and now ſee what an end he comes to, and how God followeth him on with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: one of his owne Diſciples betrayed him, and ſold him for 30 pieces of ſilver; and the other denyed and forſwore him. See what they are; one a covetous wretch and a Traytor, and the other a lyer, for he ſaid he knew not his Maſter; and a perjured fellow, for he forſwore him; and their followers the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> ſuch as denyed the Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. and were inceſtuous perſons: And afterwards <hi>Peter</hi> and ſome of the Saints diſſembled, ſo as other were fain to withſtand them to the face, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. Now is it poſſible that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould be ſo blinded as to conclude, that becauſe of theſe things happening amongſt them, that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118449:61"/>
therefore they were not the People of God, and their way not the way of God? Surely he ſpeaketh evil of things he knows not: for he cannot poſſible prove worſe things among us that are in fellowſhip, then there were ſome in thoſe Churches; but now ſince he and Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> (in his nineteenth Argument) have begun, I am ingaged to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them according to their fooliſhneſs, leſt they be wiſe in their own conceits, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.5.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I much wonder that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> ſhould reaſon thus againſt the Anbaptiſts, when none are more deeply under the ſame condemnation then themſelves. Its ſtrange they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of others for lying, and are ſo notorious in it themſelves: for the very Title of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> book is a lye; for he calls it <hi>Plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-proof for infants Churchmemberſhip and Baptiſme,</hi> and brings not one Scripture to prove either.</p>
               <p>Now for Treachery, let them remember Mr. <hi>Love</hi> who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for a Traytor. And for Perjury, its eaſie to prove moſt of the Prieſts in <hi>England</hi> perjured: for they have renounced the Biſhops and their Orders, which once they took an oath to he true unto. And as for diſobedience to the Magiſtrates, and ſtlrring up of ſedition in the Nation, its dayly manifeſt by their praying and preaching, to all that hear them. And as for idleneſs, I would have them for ſhame to forbear ſpeaking of that: for they are all idle, and know not how to work; and were brought up idle, and are ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which go up and downe not working at all: nay, they think it a great diſhonour to their cloth to put their hands to labour: and if you be not the men that live upon other mens labours, when you would take away the tenth of all their increaſe and labours by a Law, let the poor people judge.</p>
               <p>Now as for your ſaying that the Anabaptiſt deſert their wives, its a lye among the reſt of your evil invented things: for there is none amongſt us that do or dare do ſuch wickedneſs: or if you know any ſuch, why do not you proſecute them according to Law? you have a Law to hang up your owne Church-members for ſuch things, and then why do you ſpare us? We may know by this, your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is falſe: for if we did as you report wickedly, we were ſure of no mercy at your hands: and you are very ſimple, if theſe things be true, that you do not proſecute the Anabaptiſts, and get them hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the way, and then they ſhould not trouble you: but your
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:118449:61"/>
tongues are no ſlanders, as it happens:, and that I hope all men will ſhortly ſee.</p>
               <p>But I pray let us look a little further into your Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſee, are not all the whores, and rogues, and theeves, and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and witches, that are hanged all the year through, at every Aſſizes or Seſſions, are they not of your Church? did you not baptize them into it, in their Infancy? and have they not continued in it ſome of them many yeers? Nay, is it not your practiſe in the Gayles after they are condemned, to give them the Sacrament on the Sunday, and one Church-member to hang up another on the Munday-morning? And yet for all this, are you ſo audacious as to ſay the Churches of the Anabaptiſts cannot be of God, becauſe they have corrupt members amongſt them? Who ſeeth not your wickedneſs and partiality? And now may I not be bold to uſe the words of the Lord Chriſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.3, 4, 5.) to you Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and to you Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> and others? <hi>And why beholdeſt thou the mote that is in thy Brothers eye, but conſidereſt not the beam that is in thine own eye? or how wilt thou ſay to thy Brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye, and behold a beame is in thine own? Thou Hypocrite, firſt caſt out the beame out of thine own eye, and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to caſt out the mote out of thy Brothers eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now leſt you or any ſhould think I deal too hardly with you in this caſe, I anſwer you according to your folly, leſt you ſhould be wiſe in your own conceits; and that I am commanded to do by the word of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.5. But to paſs by the poor deluded people that are hanged up for their oftences every Aſſizes and Seſſions, we will now come to the teachers and leaders of them, and ſee what they do, and and how they behave themſelves for examples: and now I ſhall not trouble you with outlandiſh news from <hi>Germany</hi> and other places beyond the Seas, neither will I fooliſhly, and maliciouſly invent things againſt you; but I will refer you to a book that is printed by the order and authority of Parliament, intituled, <hi>The firſt Century of ſcandalous, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Prieſts,</hi> &amp;c. printed by <hi>George Miller,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Black-Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi> wherein you ſhall find the Perſons names, the places where they had their benefices, and the reaſons why they were ſequeſtred. And that you may the better underſtand what manner of creatures theſe Miniſters and Teachers were, I ſhall briefly put down the names
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118449:62"/>
and cauſes of ſome few of them word for word, as it is in the book, which was printed by the authority of Parliament; to which I refer the reader for further information: where you ſhall find no leſs then a whole hundred of theſe vile and abominable wretches, called Miniſters of Chriſt by ſome, and ſo lookt upon, as if the Parliament had done them wrong. All theſe were found in eight or nine Counties at moſt, about <hi>London:</hi> therefore we may judge how many of theſe Locuſts are in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> (amongſt the Covenanters) and in <hi>Wales:</hi> of which perſons, and their practices, I now come to ſpeak particularly.</p>

the World why they ordered them to be ſequeſtred,) and what they have recorded of theſe men, and the groſſeſt of their wickedneſs, is proved by no leſs then five or ſix witneſſes, as is affirmed in the Epiſtle to the Reader: but the truth is, I ſhould not once have mentioned any of theſe things, but as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11.

                  <item>6. Conſider how the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> are verified in theſe men, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. which are theſe: <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and to reſerve the unjuſt unto the day of judgement, to be puniſhed; but chiefly them that walk after the fleſh in the luſt of uncleanneſs, and deſpiſe goverment: preſumptuous are they, ſelf-willed; they are not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Angels which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accuſation againſt them before the Lord. But theſe, as natural bruit-beaſts made to be taken and deſtroyed ſpeak evil of things they underſtand not; and ſhall utterly periſh in their own corruptions, and ſhall receive the reward of unrighteouſneſs, as they count it pleaſure to ryot in the day time. Spots they are, and blemiſhes, ſporting themſelves with their own deceivings, while they feaſt with you; having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot ceaſe to ſin; beguiling unſtable ſouls: an heart they have exerciſed with covetous practices: Curſed Children, which have for ſaken the right way, and gone aſtray, following the way of</hi> Balaam <hi>the ſon of</hi> Bozor <hi>who loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs, but was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumbe Aſs ſpeaking with mans voice, forbad the madneſs of that Prophet. Theſe are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempeſt, to whom the miſt of darkneſs is reſerved for ever. For when they ſpeak great ſwelling words of vanity, they allure through the luſt of the fleſh, through much wantonneſs, thoſe that were clean eſcaped from them that live in error: while they promiſe others liberty, they themſelves are the ſervants of corruption,</hi> &amp;c. So that we may ſay with <hi>Jer.</hi> 5, 30, 31. <hi>A wonderful &amp; horrible thing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in the Land: the Prophets propheſie falſly, and the Prieſts

               <p>And now in all that I have written, none can juſtly ſay that I have wronged or abuſed them at all: for 1. I do but repeat what is recorded (and that by the conſent of thoſe then in Authority) of their words and actions: and 2. I compared them with theſe forenamed Scriptures, to the end that we might know and judge of them by their fruits: but there are ſome are more transformed into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of righteouſneſs, and can (as <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion) <hi>out of zeal perſecute the Church of God,</hi> thinking they ſhould do God good ſervice if they ſhould kill us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. with <hi>John</hi> 16.1, 2. and theſe are a generation which, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. are <hi>pure in their owne eyes, and yet are not waſhed from their filthineſs:</hi> and notwithstanding they preach and propheſie in the name of Chriſt, and call him Lord Lord; yet they do not the things he ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.46. but cauſe diviſions and offences, contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; witneſs their Rantizing of Babes, inſtead of baptizing of men and women when they believe, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12. So that they contend not for the Faith once delivered to the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. but for a new up-ſtart buſineſs which themſelves confeſs they cannot finde written in the Scripture: See Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> tenth Poſition, pag. 8. and Mr. <hi>Halls</hi> fifth Argument, pag. 30. therefore <hi>they ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their owne bellies; and by good words and fair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple</hi> Rom. 16.17, 18.</p>
               <p>Thus having made an end with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I ſhall conclude with Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> laſt end of his <hi>font uncovered,</hi> pag. 46. where he ſeems to anſwer this objection.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But what need you write ſo much, in anſwering ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle? it ſeems your cauſe is not good, you take ſo much pains about it: why did you not anſwer as briefly as the other party propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This objection Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> makes againſt himſelf; by which all men may perceive, that he is ſenſible of his owne vanity, in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying words without knowledge, whereby he hath laboured to darken the counſel of God, which is already ſo plainly declared in the Scriptures of truth: and yet notwithſtanding his being ſo ſenſible, he laboureth to hide himſelf under this cloke, 1. by making the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:118449:66"/>
and 2. then to anſwer it himſelf, thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſaith the truth oft lies deep, and will not eaſily be found out: as it is more pretious then Gold and Silver, ſo it requires more diligent ſearch: Gold-mines are not obvious to every eye; much skill and labour are requiſite to finde them out: and bring the Gold to light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sir, I am afraid indeed that this is your Gold that you have deceived ſo many poor ſouls withall, which you have taken great pains to dig out of the mountain of ancient Fathers, the mines of mens inventions: and indeed you may well compare your work to digging, for you have digged deep to hide your counſel from the Lord, like thoſe in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29.15. But, Sir, we would have you underſtand that the ſayings and commandments of [Chriſt] and practice of the [Apoſtles] are the right Silver and Gold-mines, to which we have digged through all your deceivableneſs of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, falſe conſequences, Syllogiſms, and Sophiſtries; and are come to that ſure Rock, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.47.48. which is the ſayings of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But what have you to do to call Chriſt Lord, Lord, and yet will not do the things which he ſaith or commands you, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.46. which is, to preach the Goſpel to all, and baptize them that believe it, and gladly receive it, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. with 2.41. chap. 8.12. this Gold will indure the fire, and the building will ſtand upon this foundation, in deſpight of all the power and wiſdome from beneath; when your tradition of rantizing little Babes will fall and periſh with the uſing, after the commandments and Doctrines of men, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your great pains and skill which you exerciſe dayly to uphold it: and your folly will be manifeſt to all in time, as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to ſome, who obſerve what a heap of confuſed ſtuff you make of Chriſtianing (as you call it) or rather cozening pour Children in their Cradles, which you plead for: and when you have done, you have made them ſeven times harder to be coverted to the Faith of the Goſpel, then they were before; becauſe now they plead (as you have taught them) that they are Chriſtians, members of Chriſt, Children of God, and heirs of heaven, made ſo in their baptiſm before ever they knew it: and that they cannot fall away: for you ſay, <hi>Once in Chriſt and alwaies in Chriſt;</hi> and ſo all the men and women in <hi>England,</hi> that were baptized in their infancie, muſt needs be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118449:67"/>
by a conſequence: and if this be not the broad and eaſie way, judge all men. But if this Gold be not Braſs, by which you deceive poor ſouls, I am miſtaken: for notwithſtanding that it is affirmed they are made Chriſtians, and they are within Covenant, and they are Church-members in their infancie; yet 20 or 30 years after you preach to them, to convert them, and to bring them into Covenant, or elſe you will tell them thouſands that were baptized in their infancie, they will be damned. Who ſeeth not your folly? ſurely I cannot think but ſome of you ſee it your ſelves: yet I confeſs the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>evil men and ſeducers ſhall wax worſe and worſe; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and being deceived,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.13. But (Sirs) you know that by this craft you get your wealth, ſome an hundred a year, ſome two hundred, ſome more, ſome leſs; therefore I confeſs, Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> you may ſay you have been in the Silver and Gold-mines: but take heed that the earth do not fall upon you, and ſwallow you up: for ſuch caſualties do ſometimes happen to thoſe that work under the ground in darkneſs; and you will not come to the light, leſt your deeds ſhould be manifeſt: but if you ſhall eſcape judgement in this world, yet remember the day is coming in which men ſhall call to the mountains to fall upon them, and to cover them from tha face of him that ſhall ſit upon the throne; whoſe commands of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing men and women when they believe and underſtand the truth, have you made of none effect, by Rantizing Infants before they can beleive, underſtand, or give a reaſon of their Faith: which things are utterly unprofitable amongſt men, and abominable, in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>But you ſay again, that though we have now briefly propounded our judgements in theſe Papers; yet it is known what large diſcourſes we have made amongſt the People, and how many treatiſes are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If we have had large diſcourſes amongſt the people, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare nothing but the word of God to them; you cannot blame us: for it is lawful to preach the word <hi>both in ſeaſon and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> and thereby to reprove, rebuke and exhort with all long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and doctrine, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. Secondly, whereas you ſay we have written may treatiſes on this ſubject, I anſwer, That is becauſe you have written ſo many againſt it: but yet our Treatiſes do not exceed yours in bigneſs, ſo much as yours do exceed ours, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118449:67"/>
thus: we you gave about a quarter of a ſheet of paper, and you have anſwered it in ſeven ſheets: and now I have anſwered yours and Mr. <hi>Baxters,</hi> which conſiſts of neer ſixty ſheets, in about eighteen ſheets. Now let all men judge betwixt us.</p>

                  <item>2. Your Rantizing or cozening of poor Babes in their Cradles: take away that, and you have no Church. But others who have faithfully preached the Goſpell, and converted Souls to the faith, and baptized them to in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, have a far greater.</item>
                  <item>3. Your Tythes or forced maintenance, <hi>The wages of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. after which you all go aſtray: take away that, and we may preach who will, for all you. By which it appeareth, you are all hirelings, and will labour no longer then you are paid for it: neither do you care for the flock, any longer then you are paid for it: by all which you make that old papiſtical Proverb good upon your ſelves
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118449:68"/>
(which is) <hi>No peny, no Pater-noſter:</hi> ſo ſay all you in effect, <hi>No money, no Preaching,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>4 The Magiſtrates ſword, by which you have been upholden theſe many yeers, unto which you have applied your ſelves: when poor Souls out of conſcience have denied you to eat of the Milke of that flock which you never ſed, and to taſte of the fruit of that Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard which you never planted, then you have gone to the Magiſtrate for aſſiſtance that you might take it away by force; pleading that you have right to it from the Scripture, and that you can prove your right by the Scripture, when it is no ſuch thing. And thus have you made the Kings and Rulers of the Nations drunk with the Wine of the wrath of your fornications, and have cauſed them by your delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to give their power and ſtrength to the Beaſt, and to make warre with the Lamb; but he ſhall overcome them: for he is <hi>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings;</hi> and they that are with him <hi>are called, and choſen, and faithfull:</hi> See Rev. 17.13, 14. Theſe therefore are the reaſons of our diſſenting from you,</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe you take Tythes, or a forced maintenance, even from thoſe which you call Hereticks: whereas the Prieſts under the Law, when they were at the worſt, never demanded Tythes of the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Gentiles that were not of their religion, but counted it an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination.</p>
               <p>Againe, Though Tythes were by the Law to be paid to the Preiſts by the people under the Law, yet when the Gentiles were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the preaching of the Goſpell, and queſtioned what things they ſhould obſerve concerning the Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.24. the Apoſtles anſwer was, ver. 28, 29. <hi>It ſeemeth good to the holy-Ghoſt and us to lay upon you no greater burden then theſe neceſſary things:</hi> viz. <hi>That you abſtain from meats offered to Idols, and from blood, and from things ſtrangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep your ſelves, you ſhall do well,</hi> &amp;c. theſe we ſee were neceſſary things: and this was all the burthen, as conſerning the Law, that it ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and the Apoſtles to lay upon the Gentiles; wherein there is not one word nor ſillable ſpoken about that intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable burthen of Tythes, which is Antichriſtian, and denieth Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, who changed the prieſthood, and therefore there is of neceſſity a change of the law, ſee <hi>Heb</hi> 7.11, 12. Now ſeeing that both the Prieſthood and Law are changed, I pray where is your
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:118449:68"/>
ground to take Tythes as Prieſts? or what law compels the people to pay Tythes to you, as unto Prieſts? anſwer, if you can.</p>
               <p>But it may be you will ſay, you are Miniſters of the Goſpel; and the Miniſters of the Goſpel muſt live of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then it ſeems you have granted they muſt not live of the Law: but Tythes are by the Law: therefore they muſt not live by Tythes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas you ſay they muſt live of the Goſpel; I anſwer: why do you not then, and be quiet, and take what people will give you, and eat what is ſet before you, as Chriſt hath commanded Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Miniſters to do, and be content? <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.10. with <hi>Luke</hi> 10.6.7. But it may be you will ſay this maintenance, is not ſufficient: and if it be left to the people, they will ſtarve you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be not enough, then you may labour with your hands the thing that is good, to ſupply your wants, as <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles did, which were as good, and better Miniſters of Chriſt then you are: See <hi>Act.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11, 12. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.7 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas you ſay, (as I have heard ſome) that the people would ſtarve their Miniſters if it were left to them; I anſwer, Then they are no Chriſtians, as you have born them in hand they were: for if they were Chriſtians, they durſt not let their Teachers ſtarve, if he took but any honeſt courſe to live. But to conclude, the truth is, if you can neither truſt God for a livelyhood whilſt you are about his work; nor be content with what the people will freely give you; nor yet labour with your hands to ſupply the reſt of your wants; you are not yet fit for the work of the miniſtery: and therefore you may leave it to thoſe that are better able to go through the work; and to be content with the wages that Chriſt hath allowed them.</p>
               <p>Your next is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Who goeth a warfare at his owne Charge?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true: neither do any go a warfare at their enemies charges: but the Separates and Anabaptiſts you ſay, are your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: therefore you cannot in conſcience expect any from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you war not for them, but againſt them. All you can have from that Scripture is, that you ſhould have charges of them you fight for: and if they judge the quarrel good that you have in hand, its but reaſon they ſhould maintain you in it: but it muſt be freely or

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true: but you never planted the Vineyard of the Separates and Anabaptiſts, as you call them, therefore you may not eat of the fruit of their labours, except you buy it, or take it from them wickedly by force: nay, you ſay we are not the Lords Vineyard, but rather an accurſed people, like the ground that brings forth thornes and thiſtles: therefore you cannot poſſibly expect any fruit of us: for men cannot gather grapes of thornes, nor figs of thiſtles.</p>
               <p>Again, you will ſay, <hi>Who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Truth: but you do not feed the flocks of the ſeparated people and Anabaptiſts; nay, you will and do ſay, they are not the flock of Chriſt, but Wolves and Tygers: therefore, if there be milk to be had amongſt them, you have no right to it, becauſe you feed them not; neither can you in the ſecond place expect any from them, becauſe you deny them to be a flock.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, You will ſay, <hi>We muſt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the corn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is not true; but what is that to the other beaſts that tread out no corn, but rather deſtroyeth it, and will not ſuffer it to grow till the Harveſt; but will pull up Wheat and Tares together, contrary to the command of the Lord of the Harveſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.28, 29, 30. and this is one reaſon of our diſſenting or departing from all thoſe Churches whoſe Miniſters do thus covet after the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of unrighteouſneſs, whoſe Prieſts teach for hire, and whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets divine for money; and yet are ſo impudent as to lean upon the Lord, and to ſay, <hi>Is not the Lord amongſt us? and no evil can come upon us,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.14, 15. with Micah 3.11.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is their pride, becauſe they plead humane learning to be the glory of their Miniſtry, as appeareth by their ſlighting of all thoſe that have not ſerved an apprentiſhip at <hi>Cambridge</hi> or <hi>Oxford;</hi> calling themſelves Orthodox Divines, and the other illiterate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick men: and ſometimes, when you are ſo put to it, that you have nothing to ſay for your ſelves, then you will confeſs that learning
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:118449:69"/>
is but the hand-maid, and grace is the Miſtreſs. But I pray what part of Scripture do you finde this ſaying written in? or is not rather one of your cunningly deviſed fables, which <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith he never fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. But doth any wiſe Chriſtian think that grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the heart of a man or woman, cannot do her own work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a maid? or did any man ever read in the Scripture that humane learning was graces hand-maid? if there be ſuch a place, let us ſee it: but if there be not, for ſhame leave this idle fantaſtical reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and know, that it is but to ſet up ſelf, and fleſh, and the Devil in mens hearts: <hi>for he that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16.15, 15. if they indure to the end, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.13. and Chriſts ſheep are thoſe that <hi>hear his voice and follow him, and he give will them eternal life, and none ſhall pluk them out of his band.</hi> John 10.27, 28. but he doth not ſay, If they have humane learning, or if they were educated at <hi>Cambridge</hi> or <hi>Oxford,</hi> or at ſome Univerſity: nay, God is ſo far from taking delight in the words that mans wiſdome teacheth, that he ſaith he will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and bring to nothing the underſtanding of the prudent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19. and he chuſeth not many wiſe men after the fleſh, nor many mighty, nor many noble; but <hi>God hath choſen</hi> (as James ſaith, chap. 2.5.) <hi>the poor in this world rich in Faith, and heirs of the kingdome promiſed to them that love him:</hi> and <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe;</hi> and God hath choſen <hi>the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty and baſe things, and things that are diſpiſed, hath God choſen:</hi> yea, and <hi>things that are not to bring to nought things that are:</hi> and this he doth, <hi>that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence,</hi> See 1 Cor. 1.26, 27, 28, 29. and yet you will glory in your humane leaning, ſaying at leaſt, it is graces handmaid; when the truth is, if grace be truely in the heart of a man, it is able to do its work without an handmaid: for the Lord ſaith, <hi>My grace is ſufficient;</hi> and his ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. and the Lord is ſo far from ſetting up learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men above unlearned, that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke.</hi> 10.21. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed them to Babes; even ſo, O Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> And it was alwaies Gods way, (or for the moſt part) to chuſe his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:118449:70"/>
out of unlearned men, and honeſt labouring men, that knew what it was to get their living by the ſweat of their brows; and not ſuch as were brought up idly, ſo that they cannot dig, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to beg: and therefore prove unjuſt Stewards. Theſe are not fit to be Miniſters of Chriſt, becauſe they muſt preach for hire, or elſe they cannot live; therefore they muſt pleaſe men, and have mens perſons in admiration becauſe of advantage, as <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, ver. 16. or elſe men will give them little or no wages: but the Lord choſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of perſons, as <hi>Moſes</hi> a Sepherd, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Eliſha</hi> a plow-man, as he was plowing, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.19, 20. <hi>David</hi> a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, as he followed the Ews great with yong, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.70, 71. <hi>Amos</hi> an herds-man, and one that gathered Sycomore: <hi>The Lord took him as he followed the flock, and ſaid, Go propheſie to my people Iſrael,</hi> Amos 7.14, 15. and Fiſhermen, as they were about their honeſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and mending their nets, like people that intended ſtill to follow their callings; them Chriſt called to follow him, and to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: he did not ſay to them, as the learned Prieſts now a daies to honeſt tradeſmen, You muſt abide in your calling; you muſt not preach, but leave that to the learned Divines that have been brought up to it: you muſt not preſume to take ſuch a work upon you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Chriſt was not of their minds, as you may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Likewiſe he choſe ignorant and unlearned men, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> yea, and they were ſo when he had left them, (in the judgement of the learned Prieſts and Rulers) as appeareth, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.13. Thus all men may ſee how contrary the Prieſts of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do walk to Chriſt and his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But Chriſt was able to teach them all wiſedome, and did give them extraordinary gifts for the perfecting of his work: but now there is none ſuch; therefore men muſt get abilities by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a groſs miſtake, for we have nothing elſe to do but to beleive and obey that word which was by them preached, when they were ſo indued with thoſe gifts aforeſaid. And now if any man preach, he muſt preach that word, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2, 3, 4. for that is able to do all the work of converſion and ſanctification, and to make us wiſe to ſalvation through faith in Jeſus, and to make the man of God perfect, and throughly to furniſh him unto all good works, chap. 3.15, 16, 17. And if men or Angels preach any
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:118449:70"/>
other Goſpell then what they preached, let them be accurſed: ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. and therefore we are commanded to ſtand faſt, and hold the traditions which they have taught us, whether by word or epiſtle: ſee 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.15. and the Lord Chriſt prayeth for all thoſe that ſhall believe in him through their word, <hi>John</hi> 17.20. therefore they are the Preachers by whom I do believe; and the word is already preached that I muſt believe and obey: therefore no need of a little dirty humane learning, to make a man a preacher of that which is ſo plainly preached already, but every Engliſh man may declare it to his Native Country-Men, and ſo may Men in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas you ſay Chriſt taught them then himſelf: I anſwer, ſo he doth now teach thoſe that deſire to be taught of him: and I queſtion not but ſome are ſo well taught by him that they are able to ſtop any of your mouths by ſound Doctrine, that ſhall oppoſe them. And thus have I given you another reaſon of our diſſenting from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third reaſon is their lying &amp; deceit, even when they are exerciſed in the holy ordinances of Chriſt, as I ſhall make appear, by ſhewing the depth of their deceits concerning their baptizing of Infants, which they have no word of God for, but have ſucceſſively brought it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them from <hi>Rome,</hi> as appeareth thus: When <hi>Luther</hi> and others ſeparated from <hi>Rome,</hi> they were not baptized againe after they ſeparated, but brought <hi>Romes</hi> baptiſme along with them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they confeſs that it is a falſe antichriſtian Church, a den of theeves, a cage of unclean and hatefull birds, from which all Gods people are commanded to ſeparate, and touch no unclean thing; and then he will receive them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. yet they will and do ſtill touch their baptiſm, which is the ground and root from whence all other branches do ſpring: for without baptiſm there is no viſible Church, all will grant, that own ordinances: but they being thus far charged, they preſently fly from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and plead their own innocency and purity in ſeparating from them: the which I deny, ſo long as they retain the Popes or Divels baptiſm. But they will tell, that the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> have given us great ſatisfaction, in ſhewing the reaſons why Infants ought to be baptized; which are as followeth in the Sacraments, or things ſo called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt. What is required of perſons that are to be baptized?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:118449:71"/>
                  <hi>Anſw. Repentance, whereby they forſake ſin; and Faith, whereby they ſtedfaſtly believe the promiſes of God made to them in that Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why then are infants baptized when by reaſon of their tender age they cannot perform it?</hi> namely, this faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Their owne anſwer again is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Yes; They do perform it, by their ſureties, which promiſe and vow both</hi> (that is to ſay, both faith and repentance) <hi>in their names.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, thus far we have drove the matter; and now we will hear what the Scriptures ſay for themſelves, and the children they anſwer for, thus:</p>
               <p>When a poor Child is to be Chriſtened, as they call it, (or rather cozened, as I call it,) then the Miniſter doth demand of the Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Godmothers (as they call them), theſe enſuing queſtions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Doſt thou forſake the Devil and all his works, the vain pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the ſinful luſts of the fleſh, ſo as thou wilt not follow or be led by them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. I forſake them all.</hi> I ſay, It is well if they do.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Doſt thou believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian faith?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. All this I ſtedfaſtly believe.</hi> I ſay, it is well if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them firſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Wilt thou be baptized into this Faith?</hi> ſaith the Prieſt to the ſureties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. It is my deſire,</hi> ſay they: when they never intended it, becauſe according to their owne judgement, they were baptized in their infancie, before they knew it. Thus all rational men may ſee what abominable lyes they tell, when they are about baptizing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; the God-Fathers and God-mothers ſaying it is their deſire to be baptized into that faith, when there is no ſuch thing intended: and then they take the poor child (that knew nothing of what they ſaid or did together) and ſprinkle a few drops of water upon its face, putting to or taking the name of Chriſt in vain over it; and then they ſay it is a Chriſtian, and fall a praying <hi>that it may lead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of its life according to this beginning.</hi> And now let all that fear God judge whether there be not wickedneſs, lying,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118449:71"/>
and deceit uſed in them baptizing, or ingrafting members into the Church of <hi>England;</hi> yea, ſuch lying and deceit, as all men may ſee, if they be not wilfully blinde. Therefore now let all men take heed henceforward, how they ſatisfie themſelves with ſuch frothy ſtuff, with ſuch lying and deceit, inſtead of the truth of Jeſus Chriſt, which is able to ſave their ſouls that cleave to it, and contend earneſtly for it: but all lyers, &amp; whoſoever doth either love or make lies, ſhall have their part in that lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone; which is the ſecond death: See <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. with chap. 22.15.</p>
               <p>But now the great Objection by which men think to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the guilt of all this evil, is this: O, ſay they, but we have laid aſide the Common-prayer-Book, and we will no longer owne the things therein contained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then it ſeems you grant that it was not of God, but of Satan; and therefore you have laid it aſide: for if it were of God, it is your grievous ſin to lay it a ſide, and not practice it: for you, and I, and all Chriſtians, ought to lay down our lives for the truth of Chriſt, rather then let it be laid aſide.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But have you laid aſide your baptiſme that you had by the Common-prayer-Book? I ſpeak to all you that are 16 or 20 years of age, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: if you have not, how have you laid aſide the Common prayer-Book? or why do you lay it aſide, and yet retain the baptiſme that you had accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, and the rules preſcribed in it? is not this plain diſſembling, deceiving your ſelves, and mocking of God? conſider it well in the fear of God, before it be too late: had you ever any baptiſme but that you had in your infancie? or were you baptized ſince you believed? if you were not, then you are ſtill unbaptized perſons, and no viſible Chriſtians by profeſſion, becauſe you have not put on Jeſus Chriſt, by being baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ſince you believed: See <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26, 27. you have but received Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer-Book-baptiſm, which is full of lyes and deceit, as I have already proved at large, ſhewing that the Godfathers and Godmothers ſtood by and ſaid they deſired to be baptized, when they never meant it: and then their taking the poor Babes that ſaid nor knew nothing of their doings, and baptizing them, and making them Chriſtians as they think, before they know either Chriſt or their owne Parents, or their right hand from their left. Thus have you the third reaſon at large, why we ſeparate or diſſent from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which is the Prieſts lying and deceiving the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by falſe baptiſm inſtead of a true.</p>
               <p>Our fourth and laſt Reaſon is, the Prieſts their teachers cruelty and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſtineſs: for they are them that would build up. <hi>Sion</hi> with blood, &amp; <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with iniquity; as <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.10, 11. for they do not onely preach for hire, and divine for mony; but they would have the life and blood of all that will not be of their minde and judgement; and the weapons of their warfare are not mighty through God, by his Spirit, and the ſword of the Spirit, which is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:118449:72"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:118449:72"/>
the word of God, to caſt downe high imaginations of men, and to ſtop their mouths by ſound doctrine, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17. but the weapons of their warfare are carnal, and mighty through the Magiſtrates, to pull downe mens houſes, and hale them to Priſon, and convert them with Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſtocks, and whips, and Gallowes; theſe are the weapons of their warfare: men muſt believe as they believe, or elſe be hanged or baniſhed, or at leaſt be impriſoned, and diſabled to get an honeſt living by the labour of their hands. And how doth this their doings agree with that ſaying in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.16, 17. which ſaith, that <hi>none might buy or ſell, but they that worſhipped the beaſt and his Image, and received his Mark,</hi> &amp;c. let all that fear God, and underſtand themſelves, judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But they do not perſecute now: for now all opinions have liberty enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We will never thank them for it: for we know it is againſt their wills, witneſs Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> incenſing the Magiſtrate againſt us, to cut us off as ſoon as highway-murderers; and their dayly preachings and printings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant: therefore praiſed be the great God, in whom we truſt, who hath changed the times and ſeaſons at his pleaſure, for the good of them that fear him; and hath given his Churches reſt for a little ſeaſon, to the end we might renew our ſtrength, and walk in the comfort of the holy Ghoſt, and be edified. And thus have you four reaſons at large of our diſſenting or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe of the Prieſts or — Miniſters covetouſneſs, as appeareth by their taking tythes and forced maintenance greedily; looking every one for his gaine from his owne quarters, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.11.</item>
                  <item>2. The Miniſters pride, in advancing themſelves, by reaſon of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning, above thoſe that have the Spirit and truth of God in them more then they.</item>
                  <item>3. Becauſe of the Miniſters deceit and falſhood, in adminiſtring Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts baptiſm, piecing and patching of it together with lyes and deceits, to make the poor people believe it is the baptiſm of Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>4. Reaſon is, their cruelty and bloodthiſtineſs as aforeſaid, in that they would have all ſuffer that are not of their minds, and believe as they believe; being the ſame that is done at <hi>Rome,</hi> to thoſe that will not believe as the Church believe. From all which I reaſon thus:</item>
               </list>
               <p>If theſe things be in the Teachers and Leaders of the people, what may we expect from the poor deluded people, thus blindly led, but onely Chriſts words fulfilled, <hi>(viz.) If the blind lead the blind, they will both fall into the ditch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having laboured to manifeſt the truth of Chriſt to thoſe that know it not, and to vindicate the truth againſt thoſe that do ſpeak evil of it, and the profeſſors of the ſame; I having alſo laboured to make the folly and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of deceivers (who transform themſelves into Miniſters of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) manifeſt to all; I commit my lines to the view of all, both friends and enemies; not doubting the favourable acceptance of the one, not at all fearing the ſubtilty nor malice of the other: but deſiring the bleſſing of God upon my weak and unworthy labours, for the good of all men, I remain,</p>
