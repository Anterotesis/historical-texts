         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREAMBLE.</head>
            <p>IF all that which is comprehended, and may be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
apprehended, by every <hi>Contemplative Soul,</hi>
ſeriouſly meditating the <hi>Words</hi> and Actions of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>Redeemer</hi> whilſt he continued upon earth, it would
unqueſtionly be believed, that St. <hi>John</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt,
did not Hyperbolize, when in the verſe concluding
his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> he affirmed, that, beſides what he had
therein expreſſed, <hi>Jeſes did many other things, which
if they ſhould be all written, he ſuppoſed that even
the world it ſelf, could not contain the Books that
ſhould be written.</hi> Therefore, it cannot be juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that all which is contained in that brief <hi>Form of
Prayer</hi> recommended to his <hi>Diſciples</hi> then living, can
poſſibly be made forth explicitely in every Eſſential and
Circumſtantial pertinency thereof, by the ſingle Faculty
of any one <hi>contemplative Believer,</hi> how large ſoever his
Intellectual Capacity may be: much leſs can it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from me, who, by what I have endeavoured to
raiſe up my Soul thereby to entertain the true Spirit of
<hi>Prayer,</hi> can reach to but a part of thoſe <hi>Notions,</hi> which
may be extracted from that <hi>Body of Devotion,</hi> whereby
the powerful and true performance of our duty in <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
is evidenced and preſerved: yet for as much as it
hath been much ſtifled in this laſt Generation, by meer
<hi>Formalites,</hi> and by multiplying ſuch vain words as
our <hi>Saviour</hi> terms <hi>Babling;</hi> and in regard, ſome alſo
<pb facs="tcp:95657:4"/>
(in other reſpects good and Pious men) have totally
neglected that wholeſome Form of Words; and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſuperſtitiouſly repeated them for faſhionſake onely,
without any ſence of what is thereby petitioned for, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
toward the advance of Gods Glory, or of their own
well-being; I have added my <hi>Mite,</hi> to rectifie that
which I think ought to be reformed.</p>
            <p>2. It cannot be denyed, but that many have made an
Idolatrous and ſuperſtitious uſe of Gods written Word,
and particularly of this ſuperlative <hi>Form of Prayer,</hi>
as if the bare repetition thereof (even in an unknown
Tongue) were a <hi>Charm</hi> effectual to ſuch ends as they
fancy, though they neither underſtand the meaning of the
Words, nor (if they do) endeavour ſo to conform their
devotion and affections thereto, that it may be made
acceptable according to his intention who preſcribed it:
For, he gave it to be uſed either <hi>literally,</hi> or in the ſence
of his <hi>Original words</hi> indifferently, as alſo to be a
<hi>ſtanding Patern,</hi> whereby all verbal and mental Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſhould be regulated, leſt we ſometimes blaſpheam
God, or curſe our ſelves inſtead of praying for Bleſſings;
or, leſt we err by that vain babling, which our <hi>Saviour</hi>
reprehended in the hypocritical <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.
Chriſt Jeſus</hi> very well knew, both by his Divine Wiſdom,
and experimentally, by aſſuming our <hi>humane Nature,</hi>
all our defects and infirmities, and therefore gratiouſly
provided this <hi>Expedient</hi> for preventing ſuch errors; and,
the whole <hi>Catholick Church</hi> hath found juſt Cauſe to
praiſe him for that Condeſcention, being one ſpecial
means to preſerve the principal <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> from
being totally adulterated, or elſe quite buried, under the
rubbiſh of <hi>humane Inventions;</hi> as it was when <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh
Idolatries</hi> firſt crept in; and as now it is, where
the <hi>myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> is almoſt at higheſt: For,
<pb facs="tcp:95657:4"/>
though the ſpirituality and true life of Religion and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worſhip, conſiſteth not altogether in <hi>outward For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities,</hi>
yet, unleſs it hath ſome bodily exiſtence, and
external Clothing whereby it may be made perceptible,
and apprehenſive, in ſome degree, by our <hi>humane Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi>
it could neither be known, or long retained;
though there may be ſome intellectual glimmerings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in ſuch as are ſupernaturally illuminated: much leſs
could it be communicated from man to man, by thoſe
<hi>corporeal Organs,</hi> which are the <hi>Mediums</hi> whereby
the affections and inclinations of our ſouls are made
known to our ſelves and other men; upon which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
I am perſwaded that they who totally neglect,
and they who ſuperſtitiouſly affect his <hi>Form of Prayer,</hi>
are equally reproveable.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge there is in many, an excellent gift of
<hi>extempore</hi> vocal Prayer, pertinent to the ſtirring up of
Devotion and Pious Affections in themſelves and other
men; and with much reverence I comply therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and aſſent thereto when I am admitted to partake
in their Devotions; yea, and without envying Gods
diſpenſations to them, by whom I ſee my ſelf to be far
excelled: For, he who diſpenſeth his Gifts as he pleaſeth,
made <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was inferiour to <hi>Moſes</hi> in other
Graces, ſuperiour to him in <hi>vocal expreſſions.</hi> I inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
confeſs my ſelf alſo to be ſometimes aſhamed to
be ſilent where ſuch duties are performed; but, my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
modeſty, and my want of memory (or ſomewhat
worſe) renders me fearful to ſpeak before an <hi>Aſſembly.</hi>
Perhaps, my ſecret pride tempts me to preſerve by ſilence
a better opinion in others of my ability in that kinde,
then I have; But, whatſoever occaſions it in me, I
ſuſpect that better men then I are otherwhile liable to
the ſame temptation through the ſame defect, and may
<pb facs="tcp:95657:5"/>
have need of premeditated words. To ſay the whole
Truth, my <hi>verbal Devotions</hi> are frequently ſo broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
diſ-joynted parts, and ſo diſſatisfactory to my ſelf, that
I cannot hope they will be plauſible to my hearers, unleſs
I had time to put them into better order; which when I
have done in the beſt mode I can, I think defective, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
I have perfited my Devotions with that <hi>Prayer,</hi>
whereupon I have grounded my enſuing <hi>Meditations;</hi>
and am perſwaded, that <hi>Form</hi> is not always added ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly
to other Prayers; and that their Devotions
are acceptable, who in ſincerity, and with a true deſire
to expreſs their neceſſities, or thankfulneſs to God, offer
up unto him their prayers or praiſes in words wanting
Grammatical coherence, and in ſuch Language as they
are able: For, if we are pleaſed to hear our little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſtammer out their wants and affections, in ſuch
imperfect terms as they are capable of, though it be <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi>
much more doth our <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> who
better knows our Infirmities (and requires no more of
any man then he hath given him) take delight in their
good endeavours, who proſecute them as they are able,
though in much childiſh weakneſs; which appears by
his <hi>Sons</hi> care taken to prevent the deſpiſing and offending
of ſuch, by their ſtronger brethren. He knew alſo, that
the <hi>moſt perfect</hi> could not attain to that perfection
without means of improvement, and therefore left
them this <hi>Form of Prayer;</hi> which, if right uſe be
thereof made, may be to the wiſeſt of them, great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
many wayes.</p>
            <p>4. I know well, that not a few, who ſeem to have
acquired moſt perfections, and to be better qualified for
performance of ſuch Duties then many of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
are otherwhile fain to uſe <hi>ſet Forms of Prayer</hi>
compoſed by their <hi>National Churches,</hi> or by particular
<pb facs="tcp:95657:5"/>
pious men; and I ſuppoſe it to be a great weakneſs in
them, who for no other reſpect, are offended thereat, or
with ſuch as therein joyn: For, if it be allowable to
joyn in a <hi>vocal extempore Prayer,</hi> with him, the ſcope
of whoſe Petitions we cannot know until we hear them,
(and whoſe Prayers are at that time, a <hi>ſet Form</hi> to his
Auditory, if not to him who ſpeaks them) doubtleſs we
may with leſs ſcruple pray with another, whoſe words we
know beforehand, and wherein we finde nothing repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to this <hi>Patern</hi> left us by our <hi>Saviour.</hi> In ſuch
<hi>Prayers</hi> or <hi>Praiſes,</hi> whether publick on private, <hi>Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi>
or ſet Forms, I can joyn with any perſon or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
profeſſing, Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſo they be not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly,
willingly, malitiouſly, and impenitently, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in Doctrine or manners; though there may be ſome
deficiency or ſuperfluity in <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Forms;</hi> and in
ſuch conrformities, I demean my ſelf without giving
cauſe of diſturbance to their Devotions with whom I
communicate; yea, and without uncharitably cenſuing
them in my heart, as to that which is contrary to my
Judgement. For, I know the beſt men, and the beſt
humane Forms, have their defects, and that their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and divine Myſteries are known to them but in
part. Therefore when in their Preachings or Divine
Worſhippings, I hear and heed ought which to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
is not Orthodox or comely; or expreſſions
inſiſted upon, or attributes given to <hi>perſons,</hi> or <hi>things,</hi> of
whoſe truth I am not certain; then, inſtead of abſolute
compliance therein, I waving that, lift up my heart in
ſecret to God, beſeeching him to pardon what is miſdone
or miſſaid, by others, or miſunderſtood by me, if I
have miſapprehended their pious meanings.</p>
            <p>5. The Forms of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſes</hi> dictated by the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and recorded in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> or other
<pb facs="tcp:95657:6"/>
Books of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> I can uſe without ſcruple
in the ſame words, either in the Original, or in any other
Language that I underſand, as occaſions require: but,
not without premeditating the <hi>diſtinct Myſteries</hi> in
them contained, whereby I may be conſcientiouſly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
what particular <hi>Myſtery,</hi> is touched in the whole
and in every particle, leſt (as I ſaid before) I may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
blaſpheam or curſe inſtead of praying, by miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
that to one, which is properly appliable to another:
And thoſe <hi>Maledictions</hi> to my <hi>own Enemies,</hi> which
are intended onely to the <hi>Adverſaries of Chriſt:</hi> or,
left I take thoſe Attributes to my ſelf in my ſingle Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
which are properly due to none but to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
and to me and others, no otherwiſe, then as we are
Members of his <hi>Myſtical Body.</hi> This is not ſo much
heeded by ſome as it ought to be, who make frequent uſe
of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes at adventure, in their publick and
private Devotions. With much <hi>precaution</hi> therefore, I
endeavour as I am able, to pray and praiſe GOD, in
thoſe words of his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I finde recorded in the
<hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> with reſpect to what was <hi>Legally,</hi> and
to what was <hi>evangelically</hi> to be conſidered; knowing
it required much heed to avoid ſuch miſtakes as we
might elſe incur, by a negligent uſe of them. But this
<hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> which I have now meditated upon, is
made ſo plain and ſo ſuitable to the whole, and to every
individual Member of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Myſtical Body, as alſo
to the meaneſt capacities, that it may ſafely be repeated
ſingly and joyntly in the <hi>literal ſence.</hi> Yet I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
(and I think am not therein deceived) that,
God hath permitted many wiſer men then I am, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to miſapprehenſions, in the duties of <hi>Praiſe</hi> and
<hi>Prayer,</hi> and particularly, in the uſe of this unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<hi>Form;</hi> and perhaps hath ſo permitted it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:95657:6"/>
to prove and exerciſe their <hi>Humility, Patience, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
and <hi>Love;</hi> which being well conſidered, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with that <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> which ought to be
preſerved without Infringement (and from over-far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
the limits thereof) would qualifie the Conteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
diſſenting Brethren, and therefore I have here, to
that end, precautioned ſo much as I conceive may be
pertinently extracted from the ſubject I have now in
hand; and it gives me occaſion of many particular hints
to that purpoſe; For,</p>
            <q>
               <l>This is a <hi>Charm,</hi> made by the beſt <hi>Phyſician,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Which (if applyed without ſuperſtition)</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cures</hi> and <hi>ſecures;</hi> Tis a <hi>Catholicon,</hi>

               </l>
               <l>For every <hi>Change,</hi> in every <hi>Time</hi> and Place;</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Single</hi> or <hi>Congregated,</hi> if, they <hi>pray it</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Hallowed with <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> as well as <hi>ſay it:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For <hi>ſaid in words it may be, yet not pray'd,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And, <hi>pray'd it may be, though in</hi> words, <hi>not ſaid:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who ever, therefore, ſhall not be partaker</l>
               <l>Of profit by it, cannot blame the <hi>Maker.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>6 Some, overſtrictly, confine other men, within their
juriſdiction, to their <hi>ſet Forms of Prayers and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi>
upon ſuch penalties is are unmercifully deſtructive
to the peace, eſtates, relations and perſons of thoſe who
are by them compelled; becauſe, their tender unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Conſciences will not permit that complyance which
is required, leſt they ſhould thereby violate that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which they believe is owing to a <hi>Superior Power,</hi>
and to him who is the ſole Judge in all Cauſes relating
to his own <hi>Supremacy:</hi> And, if that be unfeignedly
<pb facs="tcp:95657:7"/>
their <hi>Plea,</hi> without reſpect to any carnal ſelf-ends, and no
unqueſtionable Evidence produced, proving that their
Principles or practices tend to the violation of the <hi>Moral
Law,</hi> or to the breach of the <hi>Common Peace,</hi> by their
default, it ſeems very hard meaſure to compel them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Law <hi>of Nature,</hi> or the ancient Priviledges
of their <hi>Nation,</hi> actively to ſubmit unto that which is
offenſive to their Conſciences in reſpect of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to that <hi>Light</hi> which is in them; eſpecially,
when they are queſtioned upon <hi>bare ſuſpitions,</hi> or by the
<hi>clandeſtine Informations</hi> of perſons having no good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
as alſo, before they ſhall be convinced of erring, by
better Arguments then <hi>compulſion,</hi> and the <hi>arbitrary
will and pleaſure</hi> of thoſe, who are neither authorized
to judge of matters relating to God alone; nor have
means to take true cagnizance of ſuch ſecrets as cannot
certainly be known to any but to God himſelf. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents
of ſuch inforcements are not onely deſtructive to
their perſons and Families, who are compelled if they
ſubmit not; or, hazzardous to their ſouls who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
contrary to what they believe in their hearts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
they become thereby guilty, of that which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
of God (to whom alſo, that is unpleaſing which is
unwillingly performed, though it be what he himſelf
commandeth;) but, it is alſo miſchievous, or at leaſt
unprofitable to the <hi>Impoſers,</hi> as will be made
probable in what followes. <hi>To the clean all things are
clean,</hi> and that which defiles one will not defile another,
if conſcienciouſly acted without any meer carnal
and ſelf-end. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid (Rom. 14 14.) he was
perſwaded by Chriſt Jeſus, That <hi>there is nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
in it ſelf; yet, to him who believeth any thing
to be unclean, to him it is unclean;</hi> And, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
we are exhorted in the ſame Chapter, to follow
<pb facs="tcp:95657:7"/>
thoſe things which tend to peace, and whereby we may
edifie one another, without giving juſt cauſe of offence to
our weak Brethren; or, of blaſpheaming, to them who
are without; or, of infringing the <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi>
which permitteth the profeſſion, practiſe or omiſſion of
<hi>things indifferent,</hi> ſo far forth as they are honeſt, juſt, of
good report among good men, and tending to edification
in the love and fear of God, And it is very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the inforcing ſuch things, one way or another,
produceth one of the moſt miſchievous conſequences in
the world, both to thoſe who compel them, and to them
among whom they live: for, when they have conſtrained
men by hope or fear of temporary advantages or diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
to deſtroy their <hi>Conſciences</hi> (which makes
them men of no Conſciences, and thereby ſuch as have
alſo no God) they do by that imprudence, add none to
their own <hi>Party,</hi> but ſuch wicked <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Traytors,</hi> as otherwhile become a Plague both to
thoſe who offered violence to their pretended conſciences;
and to all other good men with whom they have to do:
for, whatſoever <hi>Oaths</hi> they take, whatſoever <hi>Covenants</hi>
they make, whatſoever <hi>Ingagements</hi> they enter into, they
uſually become falſe and perfidious to thoſe who truſted
them, as ſoon as they finde it may be to their particular
advantage; And I have long obſerved, that thoſe <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
in Divine Worſhip,</hi> which are ſubmitted unto
through fear, and even thoſe principles of <hi>Truth</hi> which
are profeſſed for <hi>carnal ends</hi> onely, did never make any
ſuch to be the <hi>better men;</hi> and I therefore wonder what
they hope to get by it, who by compulſion make <hi>proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes</hi>
or <hi>Conformiſts</hi> to their Judgement and Practice,
thoſe who are neither truly ſerviceable to God, to their
Country, or to whom they are compelled; except it be for
this end, that when ſuch <hi>Impoſers</hi> have ſervices
<pb facs="tcp:95657:8"/>
to be done, which none but the moſt <hi>damnable Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanes</hi>
will do, they may know where to finde them.</p>
            <p>7. I am no accepter of <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Parties,</hi> further
then I finde them qualified according to the Principles
of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Truth:</hi> therefore, execuſe me, though I
am bold to ſay, there are ſome other ſo unreaſonably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
to all <hi>Forms, Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> how
expedient ſoever to prevent diſorder and cure Ignorance,
(although not evil in themſelves) that they can hardly
be prevailed upon by any Arguments to conform unto
them in their own perſons, or to allow them to others
whoſe conſciences incline them thereunto; though they
cannot make forth, how without ſome of them, they and
other men could have ſo eaſily been made acquainted with
the ſoul and ſpiritual exiſtence of <hi>Religion,</hi> had they
wanted a bodily form whereby it might be rendred appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive.
Theſe Oppugners of all Formalities in <hi>Divine
Worſhip,</hi> which are not in poſitive terms commanded
(though not countermanded in the written Word of
God) do not well heed that the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> and
even they themſelves admit ſome ſuch to be neceſſary,
or at leaſt expedient; as, admitting women to participate
in the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> with many
more. Nor obſerve they, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> hath
permitted the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to tolerate the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of ſuch <hi>Ceremonies</hi> for a time, as might tend
to prevent <hi>Perſecution,</hi> advance <hi>Piety,</hi> or elſe to the
preſervation of <hi>civil Peace</hi> and <hi>humane
Society,</hi> though
not warranted in expreſs terms. And that <hi>Liberty</hi>
ſeemeth approveable by the practice of the <hi>Primitive
Church,</hi> when the neceſſities of times, places, or the
conſtitutions of the people did rationally require it; and
when no more was impoſed on weak Believers, then they
had ſtrength to bear; ſuch things as were then ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:95657:8"/>
being injoyned or permitted, but at ſome times, in ſome
places, and upon emergent occaſions, to be ſo long onely,
and no longer continued; and no other force uſed but
<hi>loving compellations,</hi> by <hi>reaſonable Arguments;</hi> and no
wrong is done to them upon whom ſuch force irreſiſtably
prevails: Nor are ſuch things juſtly reputed burthenſome,
which neceſſity requireth (though they have accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſome evil <hi>Conſequence</hi>) when they evidently prevent
greater evils. Such was the circumciſing of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
the obſerving of the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
of things ſtrangled, or offered to Idols, or eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or not eating of meats, with other ſuch, whereof
ſome were longer, and ſome leſs while continued, laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and reaſumed by <hi>particular Churches;</hi> and rejected
again as occaſion required without <hi>Schiſm.</hi> This So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and <hi>Chriſtian prudence,</hi> being now imitated,
would renew tbat <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>brotherly Concord,</hi>
which is almoſt Vniverſally deſtroyed by a barbarous vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
or imprudent Zeal, to the hazzad of all true
Piety and Morality, through their intemperancy, who
more deſire to accompliſh their own ſelf-will, then the
Will of God: For the moſt part of diſſenting Parties
are equally ſuperſtitious and injurious, both to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and others in things which they oppugne or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
when their uſe or not uſing them is magiſterially
required or denyed; eſpecially, when ſuch things, as are
<hi>expedient,</hi> and at ſome other times not ſo, are at all
times obſtinately inſiſted upon, as thoſe were by ſome of
Old, which are called <hi>Beggerly Rudiments;</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
whereof when they were needful, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
their continuance when needleſs, is as abſurd
a practice, as to take from thoſe who would learn to read,
the liberty of naming the <hi>letters,</hi> and ſpelling them ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
after ſyllable, to make up the words; and to enjoyn
<pb facs="tcp:95657:9"/>
all thoſe who can read perfectly, to do the ſame; yet
(though it be not heeded by all) the like abſurdity may
be obſerved in what relates to the duty and gift of <hi>Prayer</hi>
and <hi>Thankſgivings;</hi> and that many wiſe and good men
(as I think) in other reſpects, have erred both in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and practice, by inclining over-much to the Left-hand, or to the Right.</p>
            <p>8. I acknowledge it is an excellent gift to be able to
pray and ſpeak publickly, without premeditation upon
all occaſions, with a ſober confidence, in words perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to the matter in hand, and to the neceſſities of
thoſe to whom we ſpeak, or for whom we pray; ſo it be
done with a ſincere heart, and a true ſence of that for
which we are petitioners; as alſo, with a reverend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Majeſty of God: But all have not this <hi>gift,</hi>
who have that opinion of themſelves; for, this <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
may be onely a branch of the <hi>gift of Prayer</hi> in the
vocal part thereof, and may be ſo well counterfeited, that
none but God himſelf, can diſcern the frothineſs of it:
for, he that hath a ſtrong <hi>retentive Memory,</hi> a <hi>volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Tongue,</hi> and but an ordinary <hi>natural Wit,</hi> may by
long endeavouring to get his <hi>Livelyhood,</hi> or catch <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
thereby, (plauſibly and without heſitation) act o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that, which he hath often read or heard ſpoken by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men; and ſo well perſonate the ſame, that it may
ſeem to proceed from an extraordinary gift of the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt;</hi> yet, be nothing ſo; and his many good words
flow from carnal affections, inclining him to ſeek the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing
of ſome pleaſing <hi>ſelf-end,</hi> by the practice
thereof; and his performances amount to no more then the
<hi>Actors of Interludes</hi> attain unto in other Countries,
where their <hi>Comedies</hi> and <hi>Tragedies,</hi> are not penned
for them to their hands, as with us: for, the <hi>Actors</hi>
having firſt deſigned a <hi>Plot</hi> among themſelves, ſpeak
<pb facs="tcp:95657:9"/>
extemporarily, by the ſtrength of their natural Wit,
according to their <hi>general Deſign,</hi> as occaſions are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
given; and otherwhile, he that hath moſt <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
if he hath alſo impudence and confidence enough,
wins moſt applauſe, becauſe the greateſt number of the
<hi>Auditory</hi> being more ignorant then he, perceive not the
abſurdities committed in a quick and ſudden delivery;
and ſo perhaps it frequently happeneth among ſpeakers
and hearers of <hi>extempore Prayers</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. The true <hi>Gift of Prayer,</hi> though it is alſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in <hi>words,</hi> conſiſteth not wholly in <hi>vocal expreſſions,</hi>
but principally in ſuch a <hi>frame of Spirit,</hi> as enables us
according as the Apoſtle exhoreth, to <hi>Pray continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
not thereby intending we ſhould be always ſpeaking
or bearing, to the neglect of other neceſſary duties, but
that we ſhould as much as poſſibly keep our hearts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in ſuch a temper (by retaining implicitely what
is at ſometimes to be explicitely uttered) that, ſuch <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculations,</hi>
and upliftings of the heart as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Thankſgivings,</hi> may be at all
times in readineſs to be vocally or internally applyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every occasion offered. And <hi>ſet Forms of Prayer,</hi>
uſed in <hi>National Churches,</hi> or <hi>particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
or <hi>private Families,</hi> are not to be deſpiſed as if
no effects of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> for, ſo far forth as they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intermixture of meer <hi>humane Inventions,</hi> or <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
additions,</hi> they are outflowings from the
<hi>Spirit of Prayer,</hi> and often helpful to teach the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
how to pray in ſecret; there being very many who
had no other viſible means of Inſtruction, who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
by Gods bleſſing thereupon, have been thereby ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
both to pray as they ought to do, and alſo to inſtruct
others. Moreover, ſomewhat pertinent to that duty is
otherwhile thereby brought to their remembrances, who
<pb facs="tcp:95657:10"/>
had been elſe in a total ignorance of that Duty; and it
may be brings likewiſe advantages to them who are moſt
knowing; yea to many who now think thoſe <hi>Forms</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
needleſs. Doubtleſs therefore, thoſe <hi>Forms</hi>
are ſtill profitable to ſome, and might be ſo to more, if
they were not ſo wilfully impoſed and oppoſed as they
are, to the violation of the <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and
<hi>Charity</hi> on both ſides. For, if all men could believe,
at they rationally may, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currently
aſſiſting to many who pray without premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in <hi>extempore</hi> words, they might as reaſonably
believe, that the Prayers compoſed in a time of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
by thoſe pious men, who in many ſufferings
(even to the loſs of their lives) teſtified their ſincerity,
are ſtill aſſiſted and accompanied by the ſame Spirit,
which firſt dictated them in ſuch words, as might nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be unacceptable to God, nor an offenſive ſtumbling-block
to the weak Converts of thoſe times wherein they
were compoſed. And, if this be granted, Why ſhould
we not likewiſe think, that all thoſe <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi>
and Praiſe whatſoever, which were at any time Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
inſpired by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, (whether ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
or by premeditation) will always be effectual for
them, who ſhall pray in the ſame Form, with the ſame
integrity of heart, and with the ſame intentions, when
the neceſſities or occaſions are the ſame? eſpecially
when upon well weighing the words, they ſhall and may,
if need be, tacitely or explicitely wave ſuch of them
(or their commonly received ſence) as the mutability
of <hi>events,</hi> or the <hi>practice of the times</hi> (or their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding
of them) hath made offenſive to them, or
the conſciences of their <hi>weak Brethren,</hi> to whom of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
may be thereby given? For, this is no more then
we do (if we do as we ſhould) when we pray in the
<pb facs="tcp:95657:10"/>
words of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, the literal ſence whereof may
be in ſome places retained, and muſt be waved in ſome
other, leſt we pervert the meaning of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. In thus uſing our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
if we become offenſive to any againſt our wills, it
is an offence rather <hi>taken</hi> then <hi>given;</hi> yea, ſuch an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
as will of neceſſity be, and cannot be totally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
whether we joyn with others in their Forms of
Prayer and Praiſe, or abſent our ſelves from them;
becauſe, whether we communicate or not, we ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
ſome weak Brethren, on one hand or the other,
unleſs we will exclude all from being our <hi>Brethren in
Chriſt,</hi> who are not altogether one with us in our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and practice in each circumſtance; which I ſhall
never do, in regard, in ſuch things at we differ upon,
it fares with us, as with ſuch as paint the ſimilitude of a
<hi>City</hi> or <hi>Caſtle,</hi> which may much differ in the portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
yet each ſeveral reſemblance be true; becauſe,
the ſeveral <hi>ſtations,</hi> in which the <hi>Artiſts</hi> take view of
the place will occaſion a great diſſimilitude of that
which is repreſented. We therefore, in ſuch things as
I now treat of, can by no means be preſerved blameleſs
or excuſed, but by taking heed that we ſin not againſt
our own Conſciences or knowledge in what we do, nor
judge uncharitably of thoſe who in like manner believe
and act, as they are perſwaded in their hearts; and in
proſecuting that whereby, (if it be offenſive) greater
offences may be avoided. This being well conſidered;
as alſo, that there is no <hi>publick Liturgy,</hi> or <hi>private
ſet Form of Prayer,</hi> extant to my knowledge, in the
Chriſtian world ſo abſolutely perfected of all occaſions,
perſons, times, places, but that it may juſtly, admit of
ſome additions or alterations, except onely this which
was recommended to his Church by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and is
<pb facs="tcp:95657:11"/>
therefore commonly called The <hi>LORDS
PRAYER:</hi> this we ought to adhere unto as the
onely <hi>ſtanding Form and Pattern</hi> to be Vniverſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by all Chriſtians, as it hath been by all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
ever ſince the firſt inſtitution thereof; and
wherein, they ought unanimously to joyn without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
until the <hi>Kingdom</hi> comes to perfection on earth,
which we thereby pray for. Herein, we may all together
joyn in words comprehending every particular Member
of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and his whole <hi>Myſtical Body,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as it were with one mouth for and in the name of all.
And it contracts a <hi>common treaſure</hi> of Mercies
(though not in the Popiſh ſence, or to be diſpoſable as
that Church fancies) out of which every Individual
Member of the true <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> is relieved
and provided for, both to his temporary and ſpiritual
well-being: yea, many millions before they had any
more then a potential Being, as alſo many after they
had a viſible Being, were and are benefited thereby, and
reduced from being deſpiſers or heedleſs of that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Proviſion which was made for them; and to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
whereof their own prayers, whilſt they were in
that minde could not elſe have brought them; no nor
any other <hi>Mediator,</hi> but the Author of this <hi>Prayer.</hi>
Nevertheleſs, this excellent <hi>Form</hi> ought neither to be
ſuperſtitiouſly uſed as it is by ſome, or compulſively
impoſed upon any, who is conſcienciouſly ſcrupulous of
uſing it, until he ſhall be fully convinced of that whereof
he doubteth. The Chriſtian Liberty which I take
unto my ſelf, and allow to all other men, in things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to God and their Conſciences, I have as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were from time to time offered, declared in ſeveral
<hi>Tracts</hi> heretofore written, intending nothing in a
diſreſpective way of oppoſition, to any <hi>National
<pb facs="tcp:95657:11"/>
Churches,</hi> or <hi>Particular Congregations,</hi> or <hi>Perſons,</hi>
except to the malignant Conventicle of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> onely;
but that all they who have proteſted againſt it, may agree
together in that <hi>Truth,</hi> to the glory of God, and to the
mutual edifying of each other in love. For,</p>
            <q>
               <l>The <hi>Spouſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath Daughters many a one;</l>
               <l>But, ſo fair as their <hi>Mother,</hi> ſhe hath none:</l>
               <l>However, to the blackeſt, fair befal;</l>
               <l>For, I have an affection for them all.</l>
            </q>
            <p>11. I have made this <hi>Preamble</hi> larger then I thought
it would have been when I began; but it is not material
whether I preach in the <hi>Porch,</hi> or in the <hi>Church,</hi> ſo I
teach true Doctrine, and may reſpectively be heard.
Many <hi>Precautions,</hi> appearing neceſſary to prevent ſuch
Objections as might probably obſtruct my good purpoſe,
have occaſioned the ſpinning of ſo long a thread: yet, I
ſhall preſume to make a little longer, to clear the way
to a right underſtanding and uſe of that which <hi>Chriſt</hi>
hath left to his <hi>Church,</hi> both for a <hi>Pattern</hi> of Prayer
and Praiſe, and to make that more plain which I have
touched upon before. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will have that,
and all <hi>Publick Prayers,</hi> made in the <hi>Latine Tongue,</hi>
as being now the holy <hi>Catholick Language;</hi> and as if
the Vnity of the Church in Prayer, conſiſted in ſpeaking
the ſame words, though not underſtood: which is an
<hi>Antichriſtian Principle,</hi> wherein lieth a grand cheat.
Some, who joyn in words that they underſtand not, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in Conſcience toward God to do as they are taught,
(and knowing no other way of ſerving and worſhipping)
may, as I believe, pray in and by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> helping
them in their ignorance, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to imply: but
the Doctrine and practice of their <hi>Teachers,</hi> is directly
<pb facs="tcp:95657:12"/>
contradictory to that Apoſtles practice, and demonſtrates
by what ſpirit they are guided. We ought to pray both
in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and with our underſtanding alſo, as far
as it will extend. This <hi>Prayer</hi> may be uſed in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
words, or in any other Language, by them who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it, and in our Mother-tongue, tranſlated into
ſuch words as contain the true ſenſe thereof. It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends,
as is aforeſaid, explicitely or implicitely, all
things whatſoever eſſentially pertinent to the glory of
God, and the well-being of his people in general and in
particular, throughout all times, and upon all occaſions:
inſomuch, that by conforming to that <hi>Pattern,</hi> or the
ſenſe thereof, though in variety of Languages, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church</hi> may be truly ſaid to retain an <hi>Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Prayer,</hi> and be preſerved guiltleſs of offering
by <hi>ſtrange fire,</hi> and of making petitions repugnant to
Gods will, or contradictory to each other, or unprofitable
to the <hi>Petitioners,</hi> though the Devotions of individual
perſons, be not perfectly hallowed according to the purity
of the whole <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> Yet ſtill, a meer formal and
ſuperſtitious uſe thereof, makes it not onely ineffectual,
but offenſive, in ſtead of being an Oblation acceptable to
God. As when it is but <hi>verbally</hi> repeated for faſhion
ſake, without reverence or heed to what we ſay; or, when
according to the Popiſh mode, ſo or ſo many <hi>Pater Noſters</hi>
(as they call them) are huddled up by tale, and a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſneſs
aſcribed to ſuch ridiculous performances;
which is not onely by them attributed to that empty Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
but a <hi>Supererogation</hi> alſo, deſerving ſo much
over and above the ſupplying of each Petitioners
perſonal wants, to increaſe their <hi>Church-Treaſury,</hi>
that it affords enough (as they pretend) to ſell, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to the advantage of whom their <hi>Supreme Officer</hi>
pleaſeth, to eaſe or deliver out of her feigned <hi>Purgatory,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95657:12"/>
them whoſe own merits were not ſufficient to diſcharge
them thence, by the merits of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This, and
other ſuperſtitious abuſes of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> hath
cauſed many to miſapprehend or neglect the right uſe
thereof; and the ignorance which is in ſome well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Believers, of that large portion of their duties, and
of Gods revealed will and gracious intentions, couched
in thoſe few words, hath made them prefer their own and
other mens imperfect conceptions before it, and to offer up
ſometimes fooliſh, uncharitable, &amp; preſumptuous requeſts,
tending onely to the fulfilling of their own luſts, and leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
out with many vain Tautologies and repetitions,
rendring it otherwhile weariſome to themſelves, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleaſing to God or men. I being deſirous to prevent
and cure ſuch vanities and errors in my ſelf and others,
was inclined to endeavour it by ſeriouſly meditating this
<hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> dictated by our Saviour, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice what other men had thence extracted, even
by wholly depending on the aſſiſtance of that <hi>Spirit</hi> which
can beſt inform what was intended by the <hi>Author,</hi> leſt I
might be pre-poſſeſſed with ſuch Notions and Opinions,
as have miſled others into a miſunderſtanding. And, I
beſeech all thoſe to whom theſe <hi>Meditations</hi> may come,
even in the love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and for his ſake and
their own, not to read them by ſcraps, without heeding
the whole Context, (as it hath oft happened both to the
Readers diſadvantage and mine, in peruſing ſome of my
former Writings:) nor to preſuppoſe that I have inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any Clauſe with an intent to pleaſe or diſpleaſe any
for my own perſonal advantage, or to the injurious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
of any who are of a contrary judgement to
mine; leſt that prejudice begets hatred, and lets into
them ſuch an evil Spirit as will never be driven out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
by any <hi>Charmers,</hi> though the Charmer charm ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo wiſely;</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95657:13"/>
12. To proſecute my intention without interruption,
God lately gave me a fit opportunity, by ſhutting me up, as
it were, from the world, and the world from me; which
being declared with ſuch circumſtances as occurred, may
perhaps make that which I have meditated, the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
to ſome; and to that end I will here inſert it. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the great <hi>Mortality</hi> yet continuing, and wherein
God evidently viſited his own <hi>Houſhold,</hi> his Enemies
took not onely notice thereof with inſultation, as if it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerned them in the way of correction, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
alſo they ſhould be advantaged thereby. At the
ſame time my little Family, conſiſting of three perſons
onely, was viſited; and I, with my dear <hi>Conſort,</hi>
long detained in daily expectation of Gods Divine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
concerning our perſons; yet with confidence whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we were ſmitten or ſpared; lived or died, it would be
in mercy: for, having nothing left to make us in love
with this world, we had placed our beſt hopes in the
world it come; whereby, ſufficiently comforted, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
Gods <hi>Angel</hi> under our roof without fear of
<hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> believing he was ſent rather for good,
then to do any execution to our detriment. To uphold
this belief, God had extraordinarily prepared before that
day of trial, ſuch a competency of things needful in
ſickneſs and health, to ſupply all wants, during ſuch a
time, as that Viſitation was likely to laſt, (or our lives,
if it long continued) that, we caſt aſide all care and
fear of the future, applying our ſelves to that only which
beſt befitted out preſent condition, as free from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
diſturbances, as if Health, Wealth, and Liberty,
had been at full enjoyed, and neither Peſtilence, War, or
Famine, within a thouſand miles of our Habitation.
When I ſought the World, I loſt it, with all I had
therein; ſo that if God had not inclined his Servants
<pb facs="tcp:95657:13"/>
to provide for me, I might truly have ſung this old
Catch,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Now I am a Gallant; for, my Friends have left me</l>
               <l>Neither Money in my Purſe, nor a Rag to ſhift me.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But, they have been inſtrumental by their charity, to
add one ſignal <hi>Experiment</hi> more, to thoſe many which
I have heretofore had of the fulfilling of this conditional
promiſe, <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things ſhall be miniſtred unto you:</hi> For, though
I am a very negligent <hi>Seeker,</hi> carrying about me many
pricks in the fleſh, and pull-backs tempting from that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the mercy of God ſufficiently ſupplied what was then
wanting; and, by that portion of a <hi>diſcerning Spirit</hi>
which he hath given me, I think it may be truly ſaid, he
hath fed me by <hi>Angels,</hi> by <hi>Men,</hi> yea, and ſometimes by
<hi>Ravens,</hi> ſo that few men in my time, of my degree, can
ſay, he bad ſuch kind friends with ſo little deſert, or
ſo many malicious enemies without juſt cauſe; and both
ſo neceſſary to make me well pleaſed with my Lot.</p>
            <p>13. This made me deſirous to ſpend thoſe days of
recluſe, (which for ought I knew might be my laſt) in
what might glorifie God, ſo far forth as my weakneſs
would extend, and to leave behind me ſomewhat, when
dead, whereby my friends might mind me to their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
with comfort, as well as to give my enemies occaſion
to ſay they are glad they ſhall be no more troubled with
me. <hi>Providence</hi> then inclined my heart to contemplate
the foreſaid <hi>Prayer,</hi> when I ſeemed but ill accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to proſecute ſuch an undertaking: for it was in the
eleventh <hi>Climacterical</hi> year of my life, and when, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
other bodily infirmities, I was frequently aſſaulted
with ſuch as were perhaps <hi>Peſtilential</hi> Symptomes, and
<pb facs="tcp:95657:14"/>
the Keeping of two Fires, requiring more then my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
ſeemed likely long to maintain, proſecuted my <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations</hi>
all the day-time, even in that room wherein my
Family, and all Viſitants talked and diſpatched their
affairs, yet was neither diverted or diſcompoſed thereby,
but, by Gods aſſiſtance, finiſhed my undertaking within a
ſhort time after the recovery of my Servant (whoſe life
God ſpared) not gathering ought, as <hi>Bees</hi> do, from
flowers growing without me, but, ſpinning out like the
<hi>Silk-worm,</hi> that onely which God had ſtored up within
me. And having put into <hi>words,</hi> that which was as
it were diſtilled out of my heart by fire, (as were my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances</hi>
to this <hi>Nation</hi> in the great Peſtilence this
time forty years) I do now, as a Teſtimonial of my thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
bequeathe it to my friends, by whoſe Charity, I
was then, and heretofore, ſeaſonably furniſhed with ſuch
neceſſaries as have hitherto preſerved me and mine from
likely rnine: and in the firſt place offer it for a Thank-Oblation
to <hi>God,</hi> who enabled me to finiſh it during
thoſe few days which I might probably have conceived
would have concluded my life. <hi>GOD the Father,
GOD the Son, GOD the Holy Ghoſt, one Eternal
Deity, always joyntly co-operating intrinſecally by
inviſible workings, (and diſtinctly, in what is exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
perſonated by a triple manifeſtation thereof to
our humane Capacities) ſanctifie me, and all my
thoughts, words and actions, to his glory, now and
for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>OUr bleſſed <hi>Redeemer,</hi> having in the words next
preceding theſe, reprehended theſe who uſed
ſuch vain <hi>Repetitions</hi> in praying, as the <hi>Heathens</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95657:15"/>
did (who thought to be heard for their much bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or that God elſe knew not, or would not heed
their wants) It pleaſed him for preventing ſuch
practices and miſapprehenſions, to leave this <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Form</hi> and <hi>Pattern of Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe,</hi> to his
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> for all future Generations;
including therein one <hi>conditional Petition,</hi> not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
without performance of that condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
to wit, <hi>the forgiveneſs of our ſins;</hi> which
condition is both <hi>Affirmatively</hi> and <hi>Negatively</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in theſe words next following: <hi>If you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
men their Treſpaſſes, then will your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forgive you: But, if you forgive not them, then
will not your heavenly Father forgive you.</hi> This <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution</hi>
is heedfully to be obſerved at all times, leſt
our Prayers be turned into ſin, and we imprecate a
<hi>Curſe</hi> upon our ſelves inſtead of a <hi>Bleſſing:</hi> For, God
is <hi>Love,</hi> and whoſoever brings a Petition into his
Preſence, with a malitious or implacable heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his Brother or Neighbour, ſhall have all his
ſuits rejected, and his ſins (even his ſins formerly
forgiven) recharged upon him, and be laid in priſon
until he hath pay'd the utmoſt farthing of his debts.
That qualification for Prayer, is in this Generation
very defective in a great number: And perhaps it
proceeds from a want of Charity in this kinde,
(whereof their own conſciences accuſe them) that ſo
many have neglected the uſe of this <hi>Prayer;</hi> even
becauſe they <hi>cannot forgive as they would be forgiven;</hi>
and therefore are afraid to ſpeak in that Form of
words; not conſidering that God remembers that
condition though they mention it not in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
nor peradventure obſerve that, (though God
ſets before us his <hi>Love and free forgiveneſs</hi> to be a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95657:15"/>
Pattern whereto he requires conformity as near as
poſſible we can) he is not ſo ſevere as to expect our
forgiveneſs ſhould equal his in perfection, but onely
in that proportion which our finite and frail nature
is capable of. This <hi>Hint</hi> is proper to the <hi>Fifth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,</hi>
yet not impertinently here offered to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
becauſe peradventure, ſome may meet it
here upon the <hi>threſhold,</hi> who will never look further
into the <hi>Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> prefixed to this
<hi>Prayer</hi> contain a <hi>Precept</hi> or Injunction, teaching how
to pray it: For, the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner pray ye,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, <hi>When ye
pray, ſay thus: Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. whereof little more
need to be ſaid, then what the words and authority
of the <hi>Author</hi> ſufficiently explains and warrants, to
take away all ſcruple of praying both in the ſame
words, and according to their Genuine ſence in
ſuch other words, as the Spirit of God ſhall dictate
unto our underſtandings upon ſuch occaſions as are
offered; for the two <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> by the words afore-ſpecified,
the one biddding us to pray <hi>in this manner,</hi>
and the other, <hi>to ſay thus,</hi> makes this aſſertion
doubtleſs; and they are very ignorant, who ſhall
either ſuſpect the lawful uſe of a <hi>Form</hi> ſo authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
or that the help to Devotion thereby intended,
was not as well vouchſafed to direct and inlarge our
conceptions in whatſoever is pertinent to the duty
of Prayer, as to reſtrain us from vain Tautologies, or
other ſuperfluous impertinencies.</p>
            <p>3. As it is hinted in my preceding <hi>Preamble,</hi> our
humane Capacity is not capable of ſpiritual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
(or to communicate them intelligibly to each
other) unleſs they are imbodied in ſome <hi>ſenſible
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95657:16"/>
Form:</hi> Therefore, in that reſpect, this may be
called the <hi>Body of Prayer;</hi> and I finde it conſiſts of
a <hi>Preface, ſix Petitions,</hi> and an <hi>Epilogue</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.
The <hi>Preface</hi> is comprehended in theſe
words, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven;</hi> in which
there are ſeveral particulars obſervable: firſt, that
this Prayer is not ſingly perſonated by this word
MY, but, by the Pronoun Collective OUR, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
many perſons myſteriouſly incorporated;
which implies that it is not to be offered up to God,
by Individual perſons or congregations, with reſpect
to themſelves onely, or to their perſonal duties or
neceſſities, but, with regard alſo to the whole <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church-Militant,</hi> and to the neceſſities of every
member thereof, in being, or in a potentiality of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
yea, in ſome reſpects with regard to thoſe
Saints whoſe <hi>quondam</hi> viſible being is at an end for
a while, conſidering their <hi>Reſurrection</hi> to life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
with all the Priviledges of the <hi>Everlaſting
Kingdom</hi> petitioned for in this Prayer, belonging to
the <hi>Quick</hi> and <hi>Dead,</hi> and concerns their Bodies now
in the Grave, no leſs then their bodies who yet
live; and therefore they are to be comprehended
In our Prayers, in ſuch reſpects, with thoſe alſo,
who <hi>were</hi> or <hi>ſhall be,</hi> as well as on the behalf of our
ſelves and of thoſe who yet live, in regard they are
Objects of the Univerſal <hi>Faith, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi>
as well as we; and their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections</hi> no
leſs neceſſary to be pray'd for, then the <hi>Kingdom to
come,</hi> though both will come to paſs notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we pray not for them. This <hi>Doctrine</hi> will not
be juſtly offenſive to any, but to ſuch as are very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
or prepoſſeſſed with much prejudice: For,
this intends not prayers for the Dead, according
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95657:16"/>
to the ſuperſtitious practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
nor upon ſuch conſiderations, nor to ſuch purpoſes,
as when they pray for Souls departed out of this
life. But, the <hi>Saints</hi> now at reſt from their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and bodily endeavours, having ſtill (poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
at leaſt) a ſpiritual Communion with us and we
with them, as members of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Myſtical Body
(and who having as much right as we to what apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to the <hi>eternal Kingdom</hi>) are no more to be
excluded totally out of our Prayers, who yet live,
then we were out of their Prayers, and the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> before we were born;
it being to me doubtleſs that their Devotions were
then exhibited on our behalf, by the Example of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> our Head, of whom it is teſtified, <hi>John</hi> I7. I9.
that, when he prayed for his Apoſtles, he ſaid, <hi>I
pray not for theſe alone, but for them alſo who ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on me through their word.</hi> This Prayer extends
alſo, to the preſervation of all other <hi>Creatures,</hi>
which being, as it were the <hi>Sons</hi> of God by <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
are ſaid to groan together with us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20.
Even they receive benefit with us, by this prayer,
toward their ſubſiſtance and perpetuity, which is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically
ſignified by <hi>daily bread.</hi> For, a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inſtinct inclines them to demonſtrate, in ſome
ſort, that which is equivalent with a deſire of what is
wanting, though they neither know what they lack
or whence it comes: Even the <hi>vegetative Plants</hi>
and <hi>Herbs</hi> evidence it by their drooping, when
they have over-much or too little rain, or fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and by their refreshment with ſhowres or
heat; ſo do the Beaſts alſo, when none being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to relieve them, they bellow, and lift up their
voices in their kinde, for want of meat. For theſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95657:17"/>
reſpects, the ſcope which this Prayer hath in my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
inclines my deſire in the uſe thereof,
to extend it to all things and perſons, that <hi>were, are,</hi>
or <hi>ſhall be,</hi> for procuring of whatſoever is therein
explicitely or implicitely comprehended, as having
an Univerſal Relation: For, Priviledges there are
which the <hi>Saints</hi> Univerſally enjoy by a <hi>Spiritual
Communion,</hi> not heeded by the world, which will be
demonſtrated more at large by my Meditations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the twelve Articles of our Faith, commonly
called the Apoſtles Creed, if God gives me time
and means to make it publick, and if I recover that
part of it, which was taken from me, and being but
ſhort notes to bring things to remembrance, will be
of no uſe to thoſe who have them.</p>
            <p>4. By the right uſe of this <hi>Prayer,</hi> every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is united in his Mediation, the
whole agreeing with the <hi>Head,</hi> and with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in all Requeſts without contradiction; whereof
I know not how we could have had an aſſurance,
ſave by this <hi>Medium:</hi> For, the ſpeaking it in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Languages, Times</hi> or <hi>Places</hi> makes no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
difference, or material diſ-junction; nor do the
involuntary miſtakes, or infirmities of the weakeſt
Members render their Sacrifice unacceptable, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual;
becauſe he to whom their Addreſſes are
made can and doth reconcile ſuch differences; and
the <hi>whole Body</hi> being ingratiated by the dignity of
that <hi>Head,</hi> the moſt ignorant and inſenſible parts
thereof (if they ſeparate not themſelves willfully
and maliciouſly) are partakers of that <hi>Faith</hi> which is
in the <hi>whole,</hi> and of whatſoever is imparted thereto,
or conferred thereupon, by the merit and mediation
of their <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Mediator;</hi> yea, as truely as the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95657:17"/>
Inferiour members of our <hi>Natural Bodies,</hi> whilſt
they continue in their places, injoy the benefits to
them pertaining; and ſo far forth, as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of them, as the <hi>Tongue, Eyes, Ears</hi> and
<hi>Heart,</hi> though the other can neither ſpeak, ſee, hear
or underſtand as theſe do: And the knowledge of
this may be a great means of conſolation to many a
poor weak Member of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is ſenſible of his
perſonal defects. It is alſo by this participation
onely, that we make good our affectionate deſires
and verbal ingagements or promiſes, to pray for
our Friends or Relations in their ſeveral neceſſities,
abſent or preſent; which we cannot ſo often
and ſo particularly remember as we would, if
it were not done by an Univerſal concurrence in
this mode of praying to our heavenly Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom, that which was but once prayed for in
Faith, continues always, as if we were always pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and as if it were the joynt-act of the whole
<hi>Catholick Church;</hi> for which reſpect neither
ſhould a due application of this Prayer be neglected,
or the great advantages, thereby vouchſafed be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfully
heeded. Moreover, by <hi>Chriſts</hi> teaching
us in this <hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> to ſay <hi>Our Father,</hi> and
not <hi>My Father,</hi> I do conceive that in all our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
and Petitions, we ought to have ſtill heed
and regard to the neceſſities and welfare of others,
as aforeſaid, as well as to our own; eſpecially, of
our <hi>Brethren</hi> relating to the ſame <hi>Father,</hi> though
for the preſent they be rebellious children; and that
we ſhould be wary, we ſeek not the advance of a
<hi>ſelf-intereſt,</hi> by a <hi>Publick detriments</hi> or, to the
wrong of any <hi>private perſon;</hi> or, to the infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Chriſtian Charity,</hi> the want whereof makes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95657:18"/>
all Prayers ineffectual to them, who ſhall ſo
pray.</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>Father,</hi> there meant to whom our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
are to be made, and ſaid to be in <hi>Heaven,</hi> is
the firſt Perſon of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> (the other two
Perſons, to wit, the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> being impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
to be understood as one with him in the ſame
<hi>Deity</hi>) and we being a <hi>Brotherhood</hi> relating to the
ſame <hi>Father,</hi> warrants the fore-going Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
God is the <hi>Father</hi> of all corporeal and ſpiritual
created <hi>Beings;</hi> and by that <hi>Appellative,</hi> we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to hope and believe that we ſhall obtain
whatſoever we petition for in this Prayer, taught
us by his beſt beloved <hi>Son,</hi> even to the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
thereof; though we our ſelves neither know
or can minde all that is comprehended in thoſe
words; becauſe, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 26. <hi>The Spirit
helpeth our infirmities, making interceſſion for us, with
groanings that cannot be expreſſed.</hi> This <hi>Form</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
nothing repugnant to his Fathers Will; and
<hi>Chriſt</hi> hath aſſured us, That <hi>whatſoever we ſhall ask
of his heavenly Father in his Name ſhall be obtained;</hi>
and doubtleſs it will be no bar to this aſſurance,
when we ask according to his own direction; yet,
(knowing our infirmities) to confirm us in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
without wavering, he hath made it probable by
Inferences drawn from our common experience,
<hi>Luke</hi> 11. The one from that prevalency which <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
importunity</hi> hath upon ſuch Friends, as have
but little ſence of our neceſſities; and the other
drawn from the good effects which proceed even
from our imperfect natural affections, who are but
<hi>earthly Fathers:</hi> For ſaid he, If a Son ſhall ask
bread of any of you, who is a Father, will he give him
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95657:18"/>
a ſtone? If he ſhall ask Fiſh, will he give him a Ser<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>?
Or, if he ask an Egg, will he give him a <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="4+ letters">
                     <desc>••••…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
Thereupon, he made this Inference: <hi>If then, you
being evil know how to give good gifts to your children,
how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the
holy Spirit to him that asketh it?</hi> Yea, he having
given his only Son for us, when we were his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
why ſhould we diſtruſt that he will give us all
other good things being reconciled unto him by his
pretious blood? For, we have not onely this GOD
<hi>Almighty</hi> to our <hi>Father</hi> by Creation, as all other
Creatures have (which obligeth us relatively both
to him and to them) but we are his Children alſo by
Adoption, admitted thereunto by Grace through
his beſt beloved Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> thereto begotten by
Faith in him; and he having drawn up a Petition
for us, taught us how to exhibit it, and warranted
us to prefer it unto him as our <hi>Father,</hi> what ſhould
diſcourage us from it? or what can reaſonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
us to any other Form or Courſe? The tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which we know to be in a good natural Father,
is a ſtrong Argument to preſerve us from deſpairing
to obtain any thing in his power which he knows
needful. But, GOD is more truely our <hi>Father,</hi>
then our Fathers in the fleſh; for without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
in our Generation, we had neither been
conceived nor born into the world; or if his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
had not given us ſhape, nouriſhment, and
preſervation till the birth; and he knoweth and ſtill
mindeth what he begets; whereas our <hi>fleſhly fathers</hi>
ſeldom minde more then the ſatisfying of their fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſires when they beget us; and know not what
they beget until they ſee it brought forth: <hi>Iſaith</hi>
ſaith, 63. 16. unto God, <hi>Doubtleſs then art our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95657:19"/>
though</hi> Abraham <hi>be ignorant of us, and Iſrael
acknowledge us not; Thou, O Lord, art our Father,
our Redeemer, and thy Name is everlaſting.</hi> Theſe
conſiderations with the many demonſtrations which
we have had of Gods infinite <hi>Love, Wiſdom</hi> and
<hi>Power,</hi> may aſſure he is neither ignorant of what is
beſt for us, nor unable, nor unwilling to confer
it.</p>
            <p>6. Though this be ſufficiently demonſtrated, it
may be yet further illuſtrated and aſcertained by
contemplating this ſhort <hi>Preface;</hi> for to incourage
us in this Duty, and to increaſe and ſtrengthen our
Faith in proſecution thereof, He, whom we are to
ſollicite is ſaid to be <hi>Our Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
Not the Father of our Fleſh onely, the beſt of
which Fathers is both imperfect and partial, even in
the exerciſe of natural affections toward his own
children; neither equally diſtributing it among
them, nor able to beſtow upon them whom he moſt
loves, all thoſe things which he knows neceſſary;
nor is wiſe enough to know what is beſt for them;
nor ſure of his own being, ſo long as his Children
may want his protection, or continuing aſſiſtance to
provide for them; whereas Our <hi>Father,</hi> by this
Prayer invoked, is evidenced by the relative Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun
WHICH (conſidered with the words next
preceding and following it) to have an eternal Al-ſufficiency
to grant whatſoever is asked. For this
word ART, being a Verb of the preſent Tenſe,
comprehending all Time, <hi>paſt, preſent,</hi> and <hi>to come,</hi>
denotes that <hi>Time</hi> (if Eternity may be ſo called)
which is GODS <hi>Time</hi> onely, and which belongs
to none but to him who is <hi>Eternity it ſelf:</hi> For, we
cannot <hi>ſay truely of,</hi> or <hi>to</hi> any other, <hi>He is,</hi> or <hi>Thou
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95657:19"/>
art;</hi> becauſe, before we can ſpeak or think out
theſe words, he, of whom, or to whom, we ſpeak,
is in ſomewhat changed from what he was, though
it is not perceived. Therefore, when <hi>Moſes</hi> asked
of GOD, what he ſhould anſwer, if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
who ſent him; God ſaid, Tell him <hi>I AM,</hi>
ſent thee; and when GOD ſpeaketh of himſelf,
as GOD the <hi>Father</hi> in the firſt Perſon, he ſaid, <hi>I
AM the Lord thy God;</hi> when he ſpeaketh to his
<hi>Son</hi> the ſecond Perſon, he ſaith, <hi>Thou</hi> ART <hi>my
beloved Son, &amp;c.</hi> and when the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> the third
Perſon is ſpoken of, it is ſaid, <hi>He IS the Comforter,</hi>
&amp;c. all being in the <hi>preſent Tenſe,</hi> which is <hi>Eternal.</hi>
This ſence being collected by me from the connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe words in this <hi>Preface, Our Father which
art in heaven,</hi> much fortifies my Faith in their
uſe; and that which I extract from the laſt
word in this <hi>Preface</hi> adds a little more thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>7. For <hi>Heaven,</hi> (which is the place of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
reſidence, to whom this Prayer is to be made)
may ſomewhat more illuſtrate his <hi>Almightineſs,</hi>
and mindes us to approach his Preſence with awful
reverence, though that <hi>Appellative</hi> may embolden
us alſo in our Addreſſes. <hi>Heaven</hi> is that <hi>Beauty of
Holineſs, Joy</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> wherein GOD dwelleth:
It is an <hi>Infinite Object,</hi> ſupernaturally intelligible,
whereof I cannot apprehend ſo much by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
means to me knowable, as by turning my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Eye</hi> into my ſelf, to contemplate that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
Heaven, which appears within me; for
that <hi>receptacle,</hi> ſeems to me, infinitely more large
then that <hi>Heaven,</hi> which I ſee above me and round
about me, with corporeal eyes; and he, who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95657:20"/>
that way, finds GOD to have therein an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
ſhall ſee more of <hi>him,</hi> and of <hi>heaven,</hi> then
by any other proſpect whilſt he is in the fleſh; and
thereby, know more of <hi>Hell</hi> alſo, if God be not
there, as in his own place: Yet <hi>Heaven</hi> is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
conceived to be a circumſcribed place, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to ſuit it to humane Capacities, which cannot
apprehend Objects beyond the extent of our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
underſtandings; But, ſo much thereof as is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
may give us intellectual Notions, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of his glorious and inexpreſſible Majeſty to
whom we pray, when we conſider, That, <hi>Heaven is
his Throne, and Earth his Foot-ſtool;</hi> as alſo, That
<hi>the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him:</hi> and
from thence we may infallibly conclude that we can
have no ſecret ſufferings, oppreſſions or afflictions
whatſoever, which he cannot take notice of in his
Residency; or, any Oppreſſors ſo powerful, or
highly exalted, that, he cannot reach them to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us from them; in regard he is both <hi>Vbiquitary,</hi>
and ſo Inthroned, that neither we or they can be
concealed from his <hi>Eye,</hi> or ſecured from his <hi>Hand;</hi>
which is manifeſted by theſe words, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.
<hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit? or whither ſhall I
free from thy Preſence? If I aſcend into Heaven, thou
art there: If I deſcend into Hell, thou art there. If I
take the wings of the morning, &amp; dwell in the uttermoſt
parts of the ſea: Even there ſhall thy hand lead me, and
thy right hand uphold me. If I ſay, darkneſs ſhall cover
me: even the night ſhall be light about me,</hi> &amp;c. Which
Scripture infers, that our <hi>Heavenly Father</hi> being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where, His reſidence in Heaven, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
to His reſidence in all other places at the
ſame time: For, we muſt not imagine he is ſo in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95657:20"/>
               <hi>Heaven,</hi> as a circumſcribed Body is in a finite place,
as all Created things are; or, as the <hi>ſoul</hi> is in the
<hi>body,</hi> which is ſaid to be <hi>wholly in the whole, and in
every part thereof:</hi> For though that illuſtrates
GODS being in his whole Creation, as the ſoul
thereof; and as truely as any ſimilitude can, it never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
cometh far ſhort of expreſſing it to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
who are ſo ignorant of our own <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
that, moſt are doubtful whether the <hi>ſoul</hi> be in
the <hi>body</hi> or the <hi>body</hi> in the <hi>ſoul.</hi> In my private
Judgement, I think the ſoul contains the body; and
was partly thereto induced by this accidental ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
A Gentlewoman of my Acquaintance,
had her Leg cut off cloſe below the Knee, who
many years after that Leg was buried, ſeemed to
be ſo ſenſible of motion in her Feet and Toes, and
of itchings in the Leg and Foot, that, ſometimes
before ſhe was aware what ſhe did, ſhe would ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
reach down her hand to ſcratch the place, as
if her Leg had ſtill been there, and then laugh at
her miſtake. From whence I collect that her <hi>ſoul</hi>
(ſtill extended an <hi>animating Faculty,</hi> to the whole
dimenſion of her body, when a part thereof had
been long cut off) is rather the container of the
<hi>body,</hi> then contained therein; becauſe, though that
part had no being wherein that operation might be
actually exerciſed, as in a part of the <hi>body,</hi> the ſoul
was as intire as before. This digreſſion, I leave to be
conſidered by others as their Judgement ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
them, and perhaps it may be of ſome uſe.</p>
            <p>8. Indeed our <hi>Almighty Fathers</hi> reſidence in <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
and his univerſal Preſence is unexpreſſable;
therefore, we muſt like weaned Children, in this
and in all other ſuch like Myſteries, meekly ſubmit
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95657:21"/>
to ſuch illuſtrations as God hath vouchſafed, and
makes us capable of, without admitting imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
curioſities, contenting our ſelves with thoſe
diſpenſations, which will then be rendred ſufficient
for us; and make that acceptable to him, which we
ſhall believe and do, upon that account: And if we
be but as wary as we may be, of what he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to preſerve us from worſhipping him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our own <hi>Fancies,</hi> we ſhall not be guilty
of ſuch groſs <hi>Idolatries</hi> or <hi>Superſtitions,</hi> as they are,
who make to themſelves <hi>graven Images,</hi> or ſuch <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Ideas,</hi> as may derogate from the Majeſty of
God; and obſcure the knowledge of him revealed
in his Word, to their own confuſion; and cauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to the hazzard of their Souls and Bodies, to
ſin againſt their own Conſciences, by compelling or
alluring them, to diſobey God rather then men:
which miſchieves cannot be avoyded by thoſe who
are not at all times careful to examine and try all
<hi>ſpirits</hi> by the true <hi>Standard;</hi> not onely their own
<hi>Light,</hi> and the <hi>Lights</hi> which are ſet up by <hi>humane
Authorities,</hi> but thoſe <hi>Revelations</hi> alſo, that ſeem to
be Angelically inſpired, what Infallibility ſoever
ſhall be to them aſcribed: For the <hi>Devil</hi> can tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himſelf into an <hi>Angel of Light;</hi> and theſe later
times, are ſo full of Deluſions and Impoſtures, that
none ſhall eſcape them but they, who unfeignedly
and diligently, endeavour thus to do; therewith
imploring Gods promiſed aſſiſtance, and truſting
thereupon. To theſe, are due the promiſes both
of this life, and of that which is to come, and they
ſhall obtain their deſire at full, in due time upon
earth, or have what is here wanting, ſupplied with a
ſuperabundance, upon their ſouls hereafter. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95657:21"/>
ſpeculative <hi>Notions,</hi> I might expreſs by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
<hi>Heaven,</hi> the place of Gods Reſidence,
and ſuch as are warrantable by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi>
but, they cannot be yet born; and I fear I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
or, may in what follows, expreſs ſo much
more, then ſome will be pleaſed withal, that I ſhall
looſe more Friends then I gain by it; but I will
diſcharge my Conſcience, and Gods Will be done;
Let other men do ſo, without any ſiniſter ſelf-ends,
and I ſhall take no offence thereat. This is part of
that which I expreſs or implicitely contemplate,
when I repeat the preface to the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi>
Now I proceed to the <hi>Petitions.</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95657:22"/>
happineſs alſo, ſhould move us by his <hi>exemplary
Love,</hi> ſo unfeignedly to love him, and one another
for his ſake, that, it may be accepted of, as a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of his whole Law: For the ſame <hi>Philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
which is evidenced by his vouchſafing this
<hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> was manifeſt alſo in the Law of
the <hi>Ten Commandments;</hi> the <hi>firſt Table</hi> whereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
primarily to himſelf, is as pertinent to that
which tends to the preſervation and happineſs of the
<hi>humane Nature,</hi> as that which is contained in the
<hi>ſecond Table</hi> (if not more) as I have made
it evident by my <hi>Meditations</hi> upon the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Hallowed be thy Name.</hi> This is the firſt <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and for the better underſtanding of what is
therein prayed for, the meaning of theſe two words,
HALLOWED and NAME muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
and made known. A <hi>Name,</hi> is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>Perſons</hi> and things are diſtinguiſhed each from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and whereby it may be aſcertained, who, or
what it is, whereof we ſpeak: to which purpoſe,
though there is no Name pronounceable by Men or
Angels, which can define God as he is, it hath
pleaſed him to make himſelf in part known by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Attributes,</hi> ſome communicable, and
ſome incommunicable to any Creature, as I could
demonſtrate by enumerating thoſe <hi>Names</hi> of GOD
which are mentioned in Holy Scripture. But, I will
wave that, and inſert ſo much onely, as I conceive
tends to an intelligent uſe of this Prayer. Our
<hi>Engliſh-tongue</hi> as well as the Hebrew, hath a <hi>Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammaton,</hi>
whereby GOD may be Named; to
wit, GOOD, which ſeems by our Saviours words to
be incommunicable to any other; for ſaid he,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95657:23"/>
                  <hi>There is none</hi> GOOD <hi>but</hi> GOD. He and his <hi>Name</hi>
are one. He is <hi>Goodneſs, Wiſdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Love
it ſelf</hi> in the abſtract, with whatſoever is ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
excellent; and by his <hi>Name</hi> I underſtand his
<hi>Eternal Eſſence,</hi> and all his incommunicable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
to be meant, as alſo, that in them he is to be
ſanctified, and honoured. And, whereas we are
commanded <hi>Not to take his Name in Vain,</hi> I conceive
that intends as well affirmatively the hallowing of it
according to this Prayer, as negatively forbidding
the prophanation thereof; which conſiſts not onely
in calling him by Name, as it were, to witneſs the
Truth of what we affirm or deny; but alſo in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto him with due Reverence in Faith; with an
undoubted belief of his Promiſes; with a true ſence
of that which we petition for; and with heedful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that we profeſs his Name in ſincerity, and not
formally alone, as many do, who are called <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
without regard to conform to the Doctrine
and Practice of his <hi>Evangelical Law,</hi> which is the
greateſt prophanation of GODS <hi>Name,</hi> and
more diſhonour thereto, then all the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and Blaſphemies of <hi>Jews, Turks</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The word <hi>Hallowed</hi> or <hi>Sanctified</hi> is ambiguous,
having various ſignifications, and is derived from a
Primitive Root, uſed in ſo differing a ſence, that it is
ſometimes applyed to perſons, who are as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
and contrary to each other, as moſt differing
things are; to wit, SAINTS and SEPARATISTS,
for to <hi>ſeparate</hi> is to <hi>ſanctifie,</hi> and to ſanctifie is to
ſeparate. But herein is the difference between the
<hi>Saint</hi> and the <hi>Separatiſt,</hi> as the words are now uſed.
The firſt willingly ſeparates himſelf from the <hi>myſtery
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95657:23"/>
of Iniquity,</hi> and as much as in him lyeth from all
the Errrors, Vanities and wickedneſſes of the world,
with an upright heart: The other wilfully ſeparates
from the <hi>Truth,</hi> and from the <hi>Societies</hi> of all the
Faithful profeſſors thereof, for meer carnal ends,
with a perverſe heart: and as there are many Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
and reputed <hi>Saints</hi> who are nothing leſs, ſo
there are many branded for <hi>Schiſmatical Separatiſts,</hi>
who are far from deſerving it. To be <hi>Hallowed</hi> or
Sanctified according to our common acceptation of
theſe words, is to be ſeparated from that which is
called <hi>prophane</hi> or <hi>common,</hi> to be uſed in the ſervice
of God, or to ſome other end, which is eſteemed
more honourable then that for which it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
employ'd, though perhaps it is thereby ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more prophaned, and diſhonoured. The
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> now called <hi>Jews,</hi> were <hi>ſeparated,</hi> or <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,</hi>
as we term it, from all other <hi>Nations,</hi> to be a
peculiar people to God, and are ſtill by ſome called
<hi>the holy people,</hi> though as we mean by <hi>Holy,</hi> I know
no Nation in the world leſs meriting that Title, no,
not his <hi>Holineſs of Rome.</hi> But, that which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by <hi>Hallowing</hi> or <hi>Sanctifying</hi> the <hi>Name</hi> of
GOD, and what we ought to contribute thereunto,
is to magnifie him, to ſpeak of his Excellency upon
all occaſions; to ſeparate it, in our eſteem and
love of his Perfection, ſo far from and above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
imaginable and real Objects whatſoever, that
they ſhall be rather deſpiſed and hated then admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to any degree of eſtimation anſwerable thereto.
I have no means at this time of my recluſe, to take
advice from the <hi>Dead</hi> or the <hi>Living,</hi> from <hi>Books</hi> or
<hi>men;</hi> and therefore cannot inform my ſelf how the
<hi>School-men</hi> underſtand this <hi>Term,</hi> or any other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95657:24"/>
part of this <hi>Prayer;</hi> and perhaps it would but make
me the leſs diligent, to harken what the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
GOD ſpeaketh to my heart. By help of that Spirit,
it ſeemed unto me diſcovered, that, there is a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Holineſs,</hi> or ſeparation conſiderable in relation
to God, touching which I may perhaps deliver that
which many will not approve; nevertheleſs I will
freely declare my judgement, as I uſually do in
ſuch matters. God ſeems unto me Sanctified and
ſeparated by way of ſuperexcellency, from all other
who are called Lords or Gods; from all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Eſſences; from all intelligible Beings; and
from all the potentialities which <hi>were, are</hi> or <hi>ſhall be,</hi>
in material and intelligible <hi>Eſſences</hi> united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and is one <hi>eternal Being,</hi> Hallowed by three
glorious Manifeſtations, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy</hi> Lord
GOD the <hi>Father,</hi> GOD the <hi>Son,</hi> and GOD the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> co-equal and co-eternal. This I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in order to the ſanctification or hallowing of
GODS <hi>Name,</hi> and much more then I can expreſs;
yet this peradventure, is more then the capacity of
many can apprehend.</p>
               <p>5. I will therefore endeavour to ſute to the
meaneſt Capacitie, what I think petitioned for in
this Clauſe, and declare what I conceive is required
from us, toward ſanctifying the Name of our <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father,</hi> both negatively and affirmatively.
We muſt not imagine this daily duty is required of
us, becauſe Gods <hi>Name</hi> cannot otherwiſe be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ſanctified, or that we merit ought from him
by ſo praying: For, his <hi>Name</hi> ſhall be Hallowed,
whether we neglect or perform that duty; and
when we have thereunto contributed all that we
can, we are unprofitable ſervants. This is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95657:24"/>
in our daily Addreſſes, to keep us mindeful of
what we ought to deſire, and endeavour toward that
which will be done, whether we deſire it or not;
and that thoſe invaluable bleſſings which God of
his free Grace hath promiſed for performances
(which in themſelves are worth leſs then nothing)
may be conferred upon us by his <hi>Mercy,</hi> without
infringement of his <hi>Juſtice.</hi> His <hi>Name</hi> is ſo pure
in it ſelf, that no pollutions of ours can defile it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they revert always back upon our ſelves, if we
wilfully aſperſe it; and all that we can do toward
the <hi>hallowing</hi> of it, is, as I ſaid before, to ſpeak
well of his <hi>Name,</hi> and to magnifie it above all other
<hi>Names,</hi> which when we ſo do, his acceptance onely
makes it valuable. There is no other Name by
which <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> are ſaved, or by which they can
be preſerved from relapſe; and therefore, all knees
in Heaven and Earth, ought to bow thereunto with
reverence; I mean, to the <hi>Eſſential Name,</hi> not to
the <hi>literal expreſſion</hi> or vocal ſound thereof, which is
an Idolatrous or at leaſt a ſuperſtitious Fancy, as is
the aſcribing of a Divine Holineſs to any <hi>humane
Medium,</hi> intended to be but inſtrumental to bring us
to him who is moſt Holy; yea, it is Idolatrous, though
that adoration be given to a Creature ſeparated
from all other, by as glorious a ſanctification, as
the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin Maries,</hi> and the reſt of GOD'S
moſt eminent <hi>Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath wrapt up implicitely, our
<hi>Intereſt</hi> with our heavenly <hi>Fathers</hi> in this <hi>Petition:</hi>
For, as in the Firſt Commandment of the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>
GODS injoyning us to have no other Gods
but himſelf onely, intended thereby our <hi>Good,</hi> as
well as his own <hi>Glory;</hi> ſo did his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95657:25"/>
in teaching us to pray that our Fathers Name may
be Hallowed; for, as by obedience to the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
and ſeparating him and our ſelves from
all falſe reputed gods, with whatſoever elſe we
affect more then God; and by aſcribing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Divine Worſhip to him alone, we ſhall
not onely prevent the aſcribing his incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Attributes to baſe unworthy Creatures, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
<hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Devils,</hi> as the Heathen did; and
thereby avoyd that diſhonouring of him, by Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>perſons, places</hi> or <hi>things common</hi> into a <hi>part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip
with the Divinity of God,</hi> as it is uſual with
ſome in theſe times: But we ſhall alſo eſcape
thereby many miſchievous diſadvantages, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
great benefits: For, mankinde was plunged
into manifold perplexities, fears, deſpairs and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable
hopes, by that multiplicity of falſe gods which
the Firſt-times had forged, to the inſlaving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of their conſceiences and perſons; for, they
not knowing how to pleaſe one of their faigned
gods without incurring the disfavour of another, it
occaſioned perpetual anxieties and inſupportable
burthens, by erecting and furniſhing magnificent
Temples; offering frequent <hi>Hecatombs,</hi> and other
coſtly Sacrifices; viſiting Oracles and Shrines;
giving rich preſents; with innumerable other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
Ceremonies, to pacifie and ingratiate
themſelves with thoſe <hi>Hobgoblings,</hi> which their own
deluded fancies had created, and ſet up to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored.
And no fewer are their diſtractions, and
the miſchiefs on them incumbent in theſe days, who
have in another mode <hi>Separated,</hi> Canonized and
Hallowed (as they call it) <hi>Perſons, Places,</hi> and <hi>things
common,</hi> to participate with GOD, and his CHRIST,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95657:25"/>
in that which is proper and communicable to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
They have conſecrated for <hi>Saints,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to give them Thrones in Heaven, who, for
ought any man living knows, may be Devils in Hell.
They have Hallowed unto them Temples, Oratories,
Shrines, Altars and temporary poſſeſſions; They
have made them their <hi>Patrons,</hi> and the peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
of their Countries, Families, Perſons and
Affairs; yea, and of their Religion, (though
they never profeſſed or favoured it:) They have <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi>
them from all other, and <hi>Hallowed</hi> them to
be their perſonal Advocates, making them equal
with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Mediatorſhip;</hi> yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
preferred them before him. They have dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
unto them <hi>days, times,</hi> their <hi>goods, poſſeſſions,</hi>
yea, and their <hi>Children</hi> to paſs through the Fire of
their ſuperſtitious <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Obſervations,</hi> as the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> did their Children to <hi>Moloch,</hi> out of a
ſlaviſh fear, which nevertheleſs accompanies them
to their Graves. They have hazzarded, and many
of them loſt their lives by long Pilgrimages, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
penances, and other ſuch like improfitable
undertakings thought to be Meritorious, which God
required not at their hands, but abhors them; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
no more but thoſe <hi>reaſonable Services,</hi> which
he himſelf hath commanded, and may be performed,
with acceptance, through his promiſed aſſiſtance;
and with eaſe and comfort, both to ſoul and body, in
all ſuch duties as he injoyns; and in all ſuch trials, as
he expoſeth us unto: And when it ſucceeds otherwiſe,
to our temporal or ſpiritual damage, it it becauſe we
<hi>Hallow</hi> ſuch things as are not to be Hallowed, and
neglect to Hallow GODS <hi>Name</hi> as we ought to do,
above all other <hi>Names</hi> and things: yea, the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95657:26"/>
of ſo many other <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>things,</hi> inſtead
of out <hi>Heavenly Fathers</hi> Name, which ſhould ſingly
and ſolely be ſeparated and ſanctified, hath been the
prime cauſe of all thoſe many <hi>Sects, Hereſies, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries,
Diviſions, Quarrels, Wars</hi> and <hi>Murthers</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Nations, Neighbours and Brethren through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the World; and, the reſpect of Chriſt to us, as
well as to the glory of his <hi>Father,</hi> in teaching us to
pray for the ſanctifying of his <hi>Name,</hi> is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his great love and Mercy to <hi>mankinde.</hi>

               <p>1. THis <hi>Petition</hi> conſiſts of but of three words;

word hath an emphaſis which makes their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion

that ſence which is plainly expreſſed; to wit,
that there is a <hi>Kingdom yet to come,</hi> which we ought
to pray for. The middle word, ſhews that there
is ſuch an <hi>expectant Kingdom;</hi> The firſt word THY,
that it is <hi>his Kingdom</hi> to whom we pray: The laſt
word COME, that it is to be expected. I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

We in <hi>Engliſh</hi> call him a <hi>King,</hi> which is a word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95657:26"/>
from what is ſignified by theſe two Old <hi>Saxon</hi>

the Kings of the Earth might officiate, as much
as is poſſible, in imitation of their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> the
Supream <hi>King of Heaven and Earth.</hi> I know no
people under Heaven, except theſe Nations within
our <hi>Brittiſh Iſles,</hi> who have a <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Title,</hi> for
their <hi>Supream Governor</hi> in their own Language,
which ſo truely conſtitutes him a <hi>Regulated Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi>
and whoſe ſignification ſo mindes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligeth
him to Govern accordingly: For, theſe
words, <hi>Emperour, Grand-Seignior, Prince, Duke,</hi>
or ſuch-like, with thoſe words whereby in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
of other Countries they intend him who
with us is called a <hi>King,</hi> ſignifie nothing but an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<hi>Superiority</hi> and <hi>priority of Dignity,</hi> without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating
ought purpoſed thereby, for the welfare
of their <hi>Subjects;</hi> as the common interpretations
of ſo many of thoſe <hi>Appellations,</hi> as I know, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
Such <hi>Names</hi> were at firſt aſcribed either by
baſe flatterers, or elſe aſſumed to themſelves, by
thoſe who affected and uſurped an exorbitant <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power,</hi> in the exerciſe whereof the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Tiles were an incouragement, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to oblige them to no more then to Govern by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95657:27"/>
their will and pleaſure only. Whereas the word <hi>King</hi>
in our tongue implies that our Soveraign ſhould be
both <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Powerful,</hi> and as <hi>wiſe</hi> as <hi>powerful; (Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
comprehending Juſtice, Mercy, and all other
Virtues) and our <hi>Law</hi> preſuppoſing him alſo, ſo to be
at all times (becauſe to be otherwiſe, deſtroys the

Maxime; A King can do no wrong.</hi> Such as the <hi>king</hi> is,
ſuch is the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>Government;</hi> and ſuch will be
the <hi>people;</hi> as we find it to have been in all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the Earth. But, the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> for
whoſe coming we pray, are ſtabliſhed by <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and
<hi>Power</hi> ſo perfect, that no wrongs can be done by
the King thereof, nor any ſuffered by thoſe who
are under him, by any unrighteous Law in that
<hi>Kingdom;</hi> and happy are thoſe <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
of thoſe Kingdoms who endeavour to Govern
and Obey according to the righteouſneſs of that
<hi>King,</hi> and the Conſtitutions of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> ſo

<hi>Kingdom</hi> is partly come into thoſe in this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who belong thereunto, to ſhew it forth to
<hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> in the Kingdoms of this wold
by their Doctrine, Life and Converſation, that the
Contemners thereof may be inexcuſable: For
though it ſeems to be a <hi>Kingdom</hi> not now in being,
but to come hereafter, it is an <hi>Eternal Kingdom,</hi>
which <hi>now is, always was,</hi> and <hi>ever ſhall be,</hi> without
beginning or ending; and, is termed a <hi>Kingdom to
come,</hi> in reſpect of that more full manifeſtation which
it ſhall have, here upon Earth, and within the <hi>Saints,</hi>
who are and ſhall be ſharers therein, reigning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Some call it the <hi>fifth Monarchie</hi>
(as it is, in relation to thoſe <hi>Monarchies</hi> propheſied
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95657:27"/>
of by <hi>Daniel</hi>) but it is the <hi>firſt</hi> that ever was, and
the <hi>laſt</hi> that ever ſhall be in Heaven or Earth; and
is ſuch a <hi>Kingdom</hi> as we are not able (in the ſtate
wherein we yet be) to conceive, much leſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
in that mode wherein it ſhall be manifeſted,
though we have many metaphorical deſcriptions of
it, whereby we may apprehend ſo much of the Glory
of it, as may make us believe and expect it with
joy.</p>
               <p>2. The Soveraignty of this Kingdom was eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the <hi>Deity</hi> before all worlds, and after the <hi>Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
was joyntly and diſtinctly exerciſed by the <hi>Father,
Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> according as the <hi>Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
thereof, were decreed before time, and eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by occurrences in the <hi>progreſs of Time,</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I will declare ſo much as God hath revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> During that, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
point of <hi>Time</hi> which was called <hi>Beginning</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the firſt of thoſe five <hi>Notions,</hi> wherein I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all things to be included, to wit <hi>Eternity, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
Time, End</hi> and <hi>Everlaſting</hi>) even in that
<hi>Moment</hi> of <hi>Beginning,</hi> and immediately after the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
and <hi>Adam</hi> were created and Fell; the Prince of
the <hi>Spirits</hi> elapſed began to Uſurp a part of <hi>Gods
Kingdom,</hi> by that permiſſive Power which he ſtill
retained; and he forthwith practiſed upon inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Man,</hi> on whom God had conferred a <hi>Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi>
under himſelf over all ſubceleſtial Creatures:
And <hi>Adam</hi> being compounded of thoſe Elements,
which rendred him ſubject to mutability, the <hi>Devil,</hi>
prevailing by ſubtlety, drew him to diſobedience and
rebellion; which, God foreknowing might (had
he ſo pleaſed) either have prevented it, or in a
moment deſtroyed the <hi>Vſurper</hi> with all his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95657:28"/>
But this conſiſted not with his <hi>Eternal
Decree,</hi> whereby mankinde was to have experience
in a natural way of that <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> which our
<hi>Firſt-Parents</hi> deſired to know. Therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſame Decree, God ſuffered that part
of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> which was to be viſible on Earth, to
be for a while ſhared between two <hi>contradictory
Powers:</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> to continue in poſſeſſion of
what he had Uſurped, and his <hi>Eternal Son</hi> (to whom
the whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> by right appertained) to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
alſo his <hi>Kingly Office</hi> therein, ſo far forth, as
neither his <hi>Intereſt,</hi> with that which is really <hi>good</hi>
might be totally deſtroyed, not the <hi>Devils power</hi> ſo
limited, that the utmoſt extent of <hi>evil</hi> might not be
fully known; ſo here hath been ever ſince, two
<hi>Militant Kingdoms</hi> upon the Earth, contending for
<hi>Superiority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Incarnate Son of GOD was firſt exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
inaugurated, when it was ſaid, that <hi>The ſeed
of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents head,</hi> and the
<hi>Meſſiah</hi> was then ſpiritually conceived by Faith in
the hearts of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and there began this
Kingdom to be firſt in the earth, though the ſeed of
the <hi>Serpent,</hi> did alſo fructifie by that ſeminal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
which he had injected to make entrance for
his Kingdom: And when their two firſt Children
being born into the world, Had attained ability to
demonſtrate unto which Kingdom they adhered, the
<hi>Conteſt</hi> which hath ever ſince been maintained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, did preſently begin: <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his
Brother <hi>Abel</hi> upon that quarrel; and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
thereof, together with <hi>Cains</hi> male-contented
Demeanour, gave occaſion of GODS declaring
ſomewhat unto him, which I conceive to be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95657:28"/>
to their conſideration whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
were to be exerciſed under tyrannous <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
in all future Generations, until his <hi>Son</hi> ſhall
bring them to an end, by aſſuming the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
For, before <hi>Cain</hi> had ſlain his Brother,
God ſaid, That <hi>he ſhould Rule over him, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
be ſubjected unto him.</hi> Moreover, after the
murther was committed, and when GOD had ſo
curſed <hi>Cain</hi> for it, (who was the firſt Tyrannous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſer
of his Authority) that by the judgement of his
own conſcience, he ſeemed worthily expoſed to
ſlaughter by every one who met him; God never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
affirmed, that, whoſoever ſlew him, his
blood ſhould be avenged ſevenfold upon the ſlayer;
and it is written that God ſet a Mark upon him, to
prevent his ſlaughter; from whence it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
(as I think) that all <hi>Private perſons</hi>
ought to be wary they lay not violent hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe to whom God hath ſubjected them, how
wicked ſoever they be, leſt, that <hi>Mark</hi> be fouud
upon them, which renders them liable to a <hi>ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Vengeance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The viſible Kingdom of GOD our <hi>Father,
How it was conferred upon his Son; What oppoſition
it ſhould have in the world by Kings and Nations; The
Vanitie of their Reaſons of State; the fruitleſneſs of
the Plots, Counſels and confederacies of the people:
The eſtabliſhment of his Throne upon his holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the ſpiritual</hi> Sion, <hi>in deſpight of oppoſition; The
proclamation of what was eternally decreed concerning
it; The Vniverſality and powerfulneſs of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
How it will beſeem all earthly Kings, and their
ſubordinate Judges, and Officers to demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
under him; VVhat will befal to them
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95657:29"/>
who ſhall be rebellious or refractory, and the happineſs
of all thoſe who ſhall do homage unto him, and be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
as they ought to be:</hi> All this was foretold in the
ſecond <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which is a Literal, not a <hi>Typical</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the true <hi>David;</hi>
Yet, this Kingdom had for a long time, a very ſlow
increaſe, was confined to a very narrow circuit, and
hath been from that time hitherto alſo, of ſmall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation
in reſpect of the Kingdoms of this World;
except onely in the days of <hi>Enos</hi> and <hi>Noah;</hi> for in the
days of <hi>Enos</hi> it is recorded, that <hi>men began to call upon
the Name of the Lord:</hi> and in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> this
<hi>King of kings,</hi> aſſumed the ſole Government of his
<hi>Kingdom</hi> into his own hands; proclaimed his fore-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Judgements to all his Subjects for their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
and rebellions; and, at the time appointed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
his ſentence of Condemnation to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of all the Oppreſſors, Tyrants, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the Earth, by <hi>VVater;</hi> as he will after
<hi>Chriſts</hi> laſt coming, by <hi>Fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and what will then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of his proud and malicious Enemies, it may
eaſily be foreſeen.</p>
               <p>5. A while after the <hi>Deluge,</hi> during the <hi>Paternal
Kingſhip</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Kingdom of our Father pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed:
but within a few years after the Flood, the
kingdom of the Devil begun to be again inlarged;
and, that of GOD, to be thruſt into a little Room,
and for ſome Generations to be viſible in a few Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
onely, ſo obſcured, that, the world took ſmall
notice thereof, uutil the times of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſuah,</hi>
in whoſe days the judgements executed upon <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
and on the <hi>Cananites</hi> made it evidently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that there was a more Powerful <hi>King,</hi> then
thoſe who uſurped the Kingdoms of the Earth.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95657:29"/>
And though this Kingdom was again after that, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured
ſeveral times, by their wickedneſs who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
obedience thereto; yet, the power of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
more and more, eſpecially, during the Reign
of <hi>David, Solomon, Jehoſophat, Ezekias</hi> and other
Kings of <hi>Judah;</hi> yea, and was much heeded by the
prevalency which it had, in ſome degree, upon <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,
Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> three of the
greateſt; Earthly <hi>Monarchs,</hi> who were conſtrained to
confeſs the power of their <hi>Supream Soveraign;</hi> and,
it had ſome other manifeſtations thereof before the
true King thereof appeared in the Fleſh: But, then
it began to ſhew it ſelf, in another mode, ſo differing
from all temporary Kingdoms, that it ſeemed to the
men of the world, to have nothing in it like a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and the <hi>King</hi> thereof to be nothing leſs then a
King. For, a mean Carpenter was his reputed Father;
a poor Virgin was his true Mother; when he was
born, ſhe had no Pallace, but a deſpicable Inne to
give her entertainment; No Chamber to lodge in,
but a Stall with Beaſts; No Cradle under a rich
Canopy to lay this King in, but a Manger; No He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds,
but Shepherds to proclaim his Birth, and call
him a high and mighty Prince, as is uſuall at the
Birth of Kings; But, that defect was recompenced
with a Complement more Magnificent then the
<hi>Nativity-Ceremonies,</hi> of all other Kings put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
For, a glorious <hi>Angel</hi> brought them a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to publiſh it; A <hi>Celeſtial Army</hi> celebrated
his Birth, with a <hi>Nativity-Song;</hi> and the <hi>kings of the
Eaſt</hi> came to do him homage, and brought him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
being directed unto him by a <hi>Star.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. When years had rendred him fit to exerciſe
his <hi>Kingſhip,</hi> according to what was proper to the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95657:30"/>
Initiation thereof; he had no great Pallace to dwell
in; no not a place wherein to reſt his head. He
had no Princes, Dukes; Marqueſſes or Earls to attend
him, but a few deſpiſed Fiſher-men; inſtead of a
triumphant Chariot, he rode through <hi>jeruſalem,</hi>
upon the ſilly Foal of an Aſs; and inſtead of a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
the people put their Garments under
him. When he came to be Inthroned, with his
Title in three Languages written over his head,
his Royal Apparel, was a Purple Robe contemptuouſly
caſt upon him; he was ſcornfully ſaluted as
<hi>King</hi> in mockage onely, reviled and ſpit upon; To
be a <hi>Septer,</hi> they gave him a <hi>Reed;</hi> inſtead of a <hi>golden
wreath</hi> beſet with pretious Stones, they Crowned him
with ſharpe <hi>Thorns;</hi> his <hi>Throne</hi> was a <hi>Croſs,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they nailed his hands and his feet; There he gave
up his Ghoſt, and having no Sepulchre of his own,
was buried in another mans Grave. This is quite
contrary to the mode and pomp, of the Kings and
Kingdoms of this world; yet, even then, (as at his
Birth) his dignity was extraordinarily evidenced; for
by the power of his Almighty God-head, he, to the
affrighting of his Enemies, obſcured the Sun by a
a ſupernatural Eclipſe; he rent the Vail of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſhook the whole Globe of the Earth; raiſed the
Dead but of their Graves, and himſelf again to life;
conquered Death and Hell; ſhewed himſelf alive to
his Diſciples, aſcended up to Heaven in their ſight;
and, when the Devil and his confederates ſuppoſed
his Kingdom to be everlaſtingly at an end; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſo ſignally powerful, in that external weakneſs
and contempt whereby it ſeemed to be diſabled, if
not annihilated; that, it deſtroyed, all the ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Temples of the Gentles, with thoſe gods which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95657:30"/>
they therein worſhipped; yea, the Temple and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of his Crucifiers, who boaſted and truſted in the
holineſs thereof; and this <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> will at
laſt, utterly root out of the world, that <hi>myſtery of iniquity,</hi>
which hath been raiſed up ſince the ſubverſion
of heatheniſh and Jewiſh Oppoſers thereof; even
that great <hi>Malignant Kingdom</hi> (with all the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters
and vaſſals thereof) which hath now tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
in ſeveral forms over the <hi>Saints,</hi> and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the <hi>King of kings</hi> almoſt ſix thouſand
years. But notwithſtanding all this, Chriſts now
pretended <hi>Vicar,</hi> though he calls himſelf the <hi>ſervant
of the ſervants of God,</hi> and makes counterfeit
ſhews of humility (as many others do) is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with ſuch a <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and therefore, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
his into ſuch a one, as makes it apparent he
hath accepted of as much as he could get, of that
offer with <hi>Chriſt</hi> refuſed, when the Devil tendered
unto him the Kingoms of the world, with all the
glory of them, on condition he would fall down
and worſhip him.</p>
               <p>7. It ſeems by what is recorded of the Tribe of
<hi>Iſſacher</hi> to their commendation, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 12. that
we are to take notice of what concerns the <hi>times
wherein we live,</hi> and perhaps it will not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> here mentioned, to add what
I am inclined to expreſs, by occaſion of Letters and
Reports much credited concerning an Army of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
repairing toward the Ancient Habitation of
their Fore-fathers, which, was heretofore a <hi>viſible
Province</hi> of that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> until the Inhabitants for
their Treaſon and Murther committed againſt
their <hi>Soveraign Lord,</hi> (or the greateſt party of that
Nation) were thereupon rejected, and ſcattered
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95657:31"/>
through the world, to wander as Vagabonds like
<hi>Cain</hi> (their Type) without any certain abiding
place. That is, the condition of thoſe who at this
day are called <hi>Jews;</hi> but whether they are aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Off-ſpring of the Patriarks <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi>
and <hi>Jacob,</hi> neither I nor they know, as I believe:
For, I underſtand not how they in theſe parts of the
world commonly reputed to be of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
and of thoſe other Tribes which adhering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
continued in their own Country, until about forty
years after the Crucifying of their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
know whether they are Jews or not ſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that throughout <hi>Europe</hi> (as Hiſtories in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us) they were not onely baniſhed and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from place to place, but the Records of their
Genealogies taken away alſo, and burnt. A great
number likewiſe (if not the greateſt number) of
thoſe whom we term <hi>Jews,</hi> are probably ſuch Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the Countries wherein they have long
lived, who imbracing the <hi>Jewiſh Hereſie,</hi> made
themſelves liable to that heavy curſe, which they
imprecated upon themſelves and their Poſterity,
who, when they crucified <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wiſhed his Blood
might be upon their heads, and the heads of their
Children. Theſe therefore, I ſuſpect to be in no
better eſtate, then they, of whom it was ſaid,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>They ſhall be made of the Synagogue
of Sathan, becauſe they ſaid they were Jews, but were
not ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. They, who are now reported to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and to be the Poſterity of thoſe
who were carried out of their own Country before
the <hi>Babyloniſh Captivity,</hi> and ſaid to have been ever
ſince obſcured, as it were, from the world, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95657:31"/>
now repairing to poſſeſs the inheritance of their
Fore-fathers, are not to us aſcertained to be ſuch
as they are famed, or to have made that egreſs, and
progreſs lately reported; For, we have yet received
no Letters, that I hear of, from any of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
or Factors trading in or near thoſe parts;
(but all ſeems to come from one root) I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
believe neither matter of Fact, nor what ſome
conjecture will be the conſequence of that Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
till better evidence thereof; nor will miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſure
their charitable hope, who already belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
what they hear, conceive it may poſſibly be a
Preparatory, to that Converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> which
is by them expected. I confeſs I have heretofore
ſtagger'd to and fro, between my hope and fear
concerning that people; For, there are ſeveral
places in the Old Teſtament, ſo variouſly interpreted
by Learned and Pious men, that I dare not peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
conclude one way or other, becauſe thoſe
Prophecies are not yet unqueſtionably unſealed to
me; And perhaps left Ambiguous for Probation
of our Faith and Conſtancy, who were to live in
this laſt Age of the World, wherein there would
be ſo many great Impoſtures and falſe Miracles, as
have been foretold. We buſie our ſelves in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which little or nothing belong unto us, out of
a vain curioſity; and by miſtaking the true meaning
of what we read in Holy Scripture, ſuppoſe that
which was never intended, neglecting the mean
while our duties in that which is plainly declared,
and more concerns us. As in ſeveral places of S. <hi>Pauls</hi>
Epiſtles, particularly touching the <hi>Jews, Rom.</hi> 9.
which (as wiſer men then I, underſtand it) did prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
relate to that Nation in the Apoſtles time,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95657:32"/>
and to abate the <hi>Gentiles</hi> preſuming on themſelves,
as alſo their miſcenſure of the Jewiſh total Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Rejection, rather then to infer ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
as many ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>9. I will look to my own calling, and ſeek to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
my ſafe ſtanding, as God by his Grace enables
me, praying for the Calling and Converſion of
<hi>Jews, Turks, Heathens,</hi> and for all <hi>Heatheniſh and
Jewiſh Chriſtians</hi> in Gods time and mode; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them as I find they are, until I more plainly
perceive what God and they will do. I believe the
Viſion of <hi>dry Bones,</hi> which received Fleſh and Life,
concerns both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> And know, if
God ſo pleaſeth, a Nation may be born and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
in a day; and that a people may be kept
hidden from the reſt of this wide world, in ſome
part thereof, till he may thence bring them forth
again in his appointed time, none knowing how,
or from whence, as he doth <hi>Swallows</hi> and other
Birds in their ſeaſons; which yearly come we know
not from whence, and go we know not whither.
Nevertheleſs, I do not think he will do all that he
can, or that we are bound to believe, what Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
of dark places in Holy Scripture, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
to be the meaning wherein the wiſeſt of
them contradict each other; eſpecially when it
concerns not our <hi>ſaving Faith,</hi> but the Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Reſtoration of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to an earthly Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Who, for ought I yet hear, have given us ſo
little ſhow of a Repentance preparatory to their
Converſion, that this may be a temptation to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hardning of them, and of Apoſtacy in ſome
among us, if God prevent it not. For, it ſeems
not to me improbable (conſidering the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95657:32"/>
of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdom) but that, the
grand <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and all other petty <hi>Antichriſts</hi>
with their confederates, will improve their ſeveral
<hi>Myſteries of iniquity</hi> to the utmoſt, that their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Prince the Devil,</hi> may gather together a Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pretending to be <hi>Jews</hi> extraordinarily congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
by <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> to delude thoſe who
profeſs a belief in the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> already come.
We were by our <hi>Saviour</hi> forewarned to take heed
we were not then deceived, in regard many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
would come in his <hi>Name,</hi> to the deluding
even of the <hi>Elect</hi> ſo far as poſſible: And when he
had foretold the ſignes and wonders which ſhould
precede his <hi>ſecond coming</hi> (being ſuch as have been
more frequent in our dayes then in any one Age
(nay, I think more then in many Ages) ſince <hi>Chriſts</hi>
Aſcenſion, he added, that in the dayes he ſpake of,
falſe <hi>Chriſts</hi> and falſe <hi>Prophets</hi> ſhould ariſe, ſhewing
ſuch ſignes and wonders that it would hazzard the
<hi>Elect</hi> as aforeſaid. Therefore ſaid he, <hi>Whoſoever
ſhall ſay, Loe here is Chriſt, loe there is Chriſt, believe
it not. If they ſhall ſay unto you, He is in the Deſert,
go not out: Or, if they ſhall ſay he is in the ſecret
Chamber, believe it not: For, as the Lightning
cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth into the Weſt, ſo
ſhall the coming of the Son of Man be.</hi> It is ſaid in
another place, that, the <hi>Kingdom of GOD</hi> is
within thoſe who belong thereunto; which, if we
find it to be in us, we ſhall be able to diſcern <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures;</hi>
and if it be not ſo with us, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
who are now famed to be come into the Deſerts of
<hi>Arabia,</hi> will nothing avail us, to what purpoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they come.</p>
               <p>10. Their <hi>Temporal Kingdom</hi> concerns them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95657:33"/>
and not us who claim intereſt in a better, and
know that the moſt glorious earthly Kingdoms are
but Vanities and Snares in reſpect thereof; And if
there be any Propheſie in the Old Teſtament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
relating; and unſealed to them and others, it is
not ſo to me, and until it ſhall be ſo opened) that I
may be aſſured thereof (and till I ſhall think it alſo
more pertinent to Gods glory then yet I do) my
belief will be ſuſpended. That <hi>midnight</hi> is very
near, or not far off, of which it was ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi>
25. 6. <hi>Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go forth to
meet him;</hi> But, this is not ſuch an <hi>Outcry,</hi> but made
by the Voices of men only, which are ſo deceitful,
that we ſee cauſe almoſt every day, to believe the
contrary of that which we believed yeſterday. I
therefore cannot believe it will be any other <hi>Voice,</hi>
then that of the <hi>anointing Spirit</hi> within the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom,</hi> which muſt prepare them
for that whereof no outward Intelligencers can
give a certain Information; becauſe the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom</hi> depends not upon <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Obſervations,</hi> but upon that evidence within
us, which is confirmed by the <hi>Word</hi> infallibly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and cheriſhed by that <hi>Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Oyl</hi> which the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> never had in their
Veſſels; nor they, who pretend they have it to
ſell. I heartily pray we may be found among thoſe
<hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> who were watchful, that we may diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the <hi>Bridegrooms</hi> voice from Impoſtors, leſt we
be ſhut out from entering when he cometh.</p>
               <p>11. I hereby intend nothing in oppoſition to
them who believe the <hi>Rumors</hi> aforementioned, but
leave them to credit them as they are perſwaded,
until they find cauſe to the contrary, expecting
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95657:33"/>
from them the like indulgence to me: For, if I
hear unqueſtionably, that ſuch a remainder of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
by Miracles and Divine inſtinct, are come into
their antient Inheritance, ſhall there be ſetled by
way of preparation; Then having Repentance
wrought in them, ſhall have their eyes opened to
ſee by Faith, and confeſs with their mouthes, that
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> whom their brethren betrayed, ſold and
crucified, was their <hi>promised King,</hi> I ſhall know it
is of God, and rejoyce in it as much as any: But,
till then, I ſhall be warie of giving credit to what I,
hear, and wiſh all other men ſo to do, leaſt they be
deluded, by miſtaking the meaning of thoſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
who foretold the bringing back the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> to their Country, thinking thoſe
<hi>Predictions</hi> which were fulfilled before, and at
<hi>Chriſts</hi> firſt coming, are ſtill expectant, as relating
to their <hi>Temporal Kingdom.</hi> For, I believe that
the gathering together of the diſperſed <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
preſaged by the Prophets, intended not thoſe only
which were <hi>Jews</hi> according to the Fleſh, but thoſe
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> who are the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
by Faith, diſperſed throughout the World,
and ſuch Jews as <hi>Paul</hi> meant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29. where
he ſaith, <hi>He is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is that circumciſion, which is outwardly in the
fleſh; but, he is a jew who is one inwardly, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
is that of the heart, and in the Spirit, not
in the Letter;</hi> which being ſo, we may juſtly ſuſpect
they have miſtaken the meaning of the Prophets
who apply their predictions to ſuch a carnal Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the <hi>jews</hi> as is now expected. That <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,</hi>
as I believe, might be cured by obſerving,
that immediately after ſuch Prophecies as foretold
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95657:34"/>
their temporal Reſtauration, the coming of <hi>Chriſts
Kingdom</hi> is frequently preſaged in the Texts follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſame Chapters. If there ſeem to be any
Propheſie which predicts ſuch a returning of the
<hi>jews,</hi> as is now looked for after the <hi>Birth, Death,</hi>
and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of our <hi>Redeemer;</hi> Let it be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
whether it means any more then a return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Countrey by way of Preparation to
their Spiritual returning unto the Kingdom of their
rejected King; or whether (as I rather believe)
the main intent of all the Prophets who Propheſied
ought in relation to what ſhould be after <hi>Chriſts</hi>
Aſcention (when the Partition-Wall was broken
down, and <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> made one people) had
not reſpect to <hi>Chriſts Kingdom</hi> only on Earth, as it
ſhould be manifeſted at his <hi>firſt coming,</hi> or at the
<hi>ſecond,</hi> till the end of the World. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in his 60.
Chapter and to the end of his Propheſie; and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
in the laſt of his Propheſie; concur with St.
<hi>John</hi> in the laſt of his <hi>Revelation,</hi> in predicting the
glory of that <hi>Spiritual Kingdom;</hi> which, though it
be upon <hi>Earth,</hi> will not be an <hi>Earthly Kingdom,</hi>
nor ſo inglorious as that will be at beſt, in reſpect
thereof, which ſhall be confined to <hi>Sion,</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> For, <hi>When the new
Heaven and the new Earth ſhall be created, the old
Name ſhall be left as a curſe, and the Servants of the
Lord called by a new Name,</hi> Eſa. 65. This, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Propheſies</hi> concerning <hi>Chriſts Kingdom to come
upon Earth,</hi> are (as I underſtand him) well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
by my good friend, Mr. <hi>T. M.</hi> of <hi>W. Senior,</hi>
in a Tract of his which I have lately ſeen, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the <hi>Jews</hi> temporary <hi>condition</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi>
ſo far forth as they ſeem to concern them by way of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95657:34"/>
preparation to what ſhall be hereafter: For, their
antient Country, being (as I think) a part of that
Garden which God planted Eaſtward in <hi>Eden,</hi> ſhall
no doubt, when Chriſts Kingdom more viſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
have many Propheſies there locally, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally,
as well as ſpiritually fulfilled; and my intent
is not to contradict what other men believe of that
<hi>Myſterie,</hi> but, rather to prevent ſuch miſtakes as
may be repugnant to the Eſſentiality thereof. When
I contemplate the ſaid Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his
perſonal Reign here on Earth, looking backward,
and forward, upon that Experimental knowledg of
<hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> which <hi>Mankind</hi> is likely to acquire, in
the <hi>Six days</hi> of a 1000 Years apiece; and the
Knowledg alſo, which will be gotten in that <hi>ſeventh
part</hi> of time wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come, both to
the full Illuſtration, and deſtruction of all that is
<hi>Evil,</hi> and to the plenary Demonſtration and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of all that is <hi>Good,</hi> for reſtoring the <hi>Saints</hi>
who ſhall live and reign with him, to that <hi>Paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
Eſtate,</hi> out of which our firſt Parents were
excluded: When (I ſay) I contemplate this, I have
ſuch a ſtrong deſire to expreſs what I glimmeringly
apprehend of it, that, being unable to perform it,
it makes me ſo ſick and faint in Body and Spirit,
when I attempt it, that <hi>I</hi> am forced to deſiſt from
thoſe contemplatings to recover ſtrength, leſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
by the variety of <hi>Notions; I</hi> might in that
weakneſs, either extend my expreſſions to more then
this Generation can yet bear; or, to that which
may be miſapprehended; being forced to cry out in
my heart with St. <hi>Paul: Oh the depth of the riches
both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! How
unſearchable are his Judgments! And his Wayes paſt
finding out!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

12. I ſet no bounds to Gods <hi>Mercy,</hi> nor am
hopeleſs of the extent thereof to any whilſt they
are in the fleſh, until they have utterly excluded
themſelves by wilful malicious and final obſtinacy,
and who they are <hi>I</hi> cannot certainly know; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
neither judge peremptorily of any, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to pray for them: No not to pray for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of <hi>Antichriſtian Prelates,</hi> who have perverted
the true intent of <hi>Evangelical Epiſcopacy,</hi> which <hi>I</hi>
reverence: For, <hi>I</hi> believe it poſſible for ſome of
them to repent and be ſaved, though they are the
worſt of all men who ſeem to be Members of
<hi>Chriſts</hi> Viſible Church: Nor am <hi>I</hi> incredulous that
there <hi>are, were,</hi> and <hi>ſhall be,</hi> in every Age, a <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of thoſe called <hi>Jews</hi> (though the worſt of all
men without the Viſible Church) preſerved accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Election of God,</hi> and brought into
<hi>Chriſts</hi> Fold: But, whether there ſhall be ſuch an
<hi>Vniverſal return</hi> as ſome think, <hi>I</hi> am yet doubtful,
it being nothing pertinent to my perſonal ſaving
Faith. For, though it was expedient (as <hi>David</hi>
Prophetically prayed in the 59 <hi>Pſalm</hi>) that they
ſhould be <hi>ſcattered and not utterly rooted out,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
Gods people mindful both of his <hi>Mercy</hi> and
<hi>Severity;</hi> yet by the words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi>
and <hi>chief Prieſts</hi> (the Repreſentatives of that
Nation) <hi>John</hi> 7. 34. <hi>Ye ſhall ſeek me and not find
me, and where I am there ye ſhall not come</hi> (as alſo
by what <hi>David</hi> preſaged of their diſtempered com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
when they ſhould make ſhew of preparing
to a Return in the <hi>Evening of the World</hi>) we
may have cauſe to be jealous that the preparations
now rumoured, are but a <hi>Preludium</hi> to ſome deſigne
of the <hi>Devil,</hi> to ſtir up and bring together GOG
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95657:35"/>
and MAGOG, all open and ſecret Enemies of
<hi>Chriſts Kingdom,</hi> to proſecute their laſt Attempt
againſt it; For, I hear not of, any change, in thoſe
<hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> from their Apoſtacies and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Blaſphemies; but only, a ſeeking after their
old earthly Inheritance, and things merely perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to this life; whereof there is no promiſe to
them who firſt ſeek not the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
We are not, as ſome imagine, to depend on the
<hi>Jews Vniverſal calling,</hi> as if the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſhould not be compleated until then: For, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancy
is not grounded upon what they or any
other ſhall do. We were of thoſe Nations, who
ſate heretofore in <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and in the <hi>ſhadows of
Death;</hi> but have now a <hi>Light</hi> ſhining upon us to
the increaſe and confirmation of our Joy. A Son
is born unto us, upon whoſe ſhoulder the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is impoſed: his <hi>Name</hi> is <hi>Wonderful, Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi>
the <hi>Mighty GOD,</hi> the <hi>Everlaſting Father,</hi> the
<hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> of whoſe Government there ſhall
be no end. The Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> is already
ſetled upon him, and the <hi>Jews</hi> do ſeek in vain to
bring to paſs what they hope for, as appears, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.
who affirms they ſhould ſay in the pride of their
hearts, <hi>The Bricks are fallen down, but we will build
it with hewen ſtones;</hi> But, <hi>They turn not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to
him who ſmote them, nor ſeek the Lord of Hoſts;</hi>
and for that cauſe, ſaith the ſame Prophet, <hi>They
ſhall be cut off, head and tail, root and branch, in one
day, even their Leaders, and they that led them.</hi>
Moreover he preſaged what horrid confuſions ſhould
come upon them; and that GODS hand after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
viſitations, ſhould be ſtill ſtretched out againſt
them; That, but a Remnant of them ſhould return,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95657:36"/>
though they were as numerous as the Sea-ſands;
and that a paſſege ſhould be made for that <hi>Remnant</hi>
as miraculous as when they came out of <hi>Egypt,
Iſa.</hi> the 9, 10, &amp; 11. Chapters. Theſe Prophecies
conſidered with what ye find, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 75. and in other
Scriptures, incline me to believe that whatſoever is
predicted concerning the <hi>Iſrael of God,</hi> after the
Aſcenſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> relateth not ſingly to <hi>Jews</hi>
or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but to both as they are united and
made one People in him; and I leave them who
think otherwiſe to their own Judgment, till they
ſee cauſe to the contrary, as freely as I deſire upon
the ſame terms to enjoy my own; For, be it ſtill
REMEMBRED, that this is cautionarily intended,
without purpoſing, ought in oppoſition to what is
believed by others upon better information then I
have yet had.</p>
               <p>13. I will a little more enlarge my ſelf as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe Prophecies relating to the <hi>Jews:</hi> for when
my heart inclines me to expreſs what I think perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to Gods Glory in my Generation, it will be
required at my hands if I neglect it, though my
<hi>Cautions</hi> and <hi>Remembrances</hi> be little regarded. The
foreſaid <hi>Rumour</hi> ſeems but a trifling occaſion, yet,
that impreſſion which I perceive it hath upon many,
and the event which it may have if there be any
truth in it, makes that very conſiderable which I
offer to be heeded. He, whom we believe to be
<hi>the Antichriſt,</hi> hoping to divert us from taking
him to be that <hi>Myſtical man,</hi> hath a long time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and cauſed it to be written and preached
that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt be a <hi>Jew;</hi> And now, perhaps,
the <hi>Devil</hi> (who firſt laid the foundation of his <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and <hi>myſterie of Iniquity</hi>) is hatching ſomewhat
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95657:36"/>
to improve that <hi>Fallacy</hi> by a <hi>Jewiſh deſigne,</hi> and by
cheriſhing an Opinion that the <hi>Jews</hi> are to have
their Temporary Kingdom eſtabliſhed again in the
Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> And many Prophecies (which I
am perſwaded never intended it) are interpreted
to that purpoſe, by ſome who would not have made
ſuch interpretations, if they had heeded what evil
conſequences it may produce. Let therefore my
<hi>Caveats</hi> be well heeded (though I am worth little
regard) leſt we concurring with the <hi>Jews,</hi> in miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
their Prophets, invalid the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and all Orthodox Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Chriſtians, made of thoſe Predictions which
foretold the ſpiritual Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and
ſtrengthen the <hi>Jews</hi> in their <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and infidelity,
to the deſtroying alſo of our <hi>ſaving Faith.</hi> For, if
we grant thoſe Scriptures ought ſo to be interpreted
as they are by ſome among us; then, the <hi>Jews</hi> will
affirm that thoſe Scriptures alſo, ought ſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
whereby we are confirmed in believing the
true <hi>Meſſias</hi> is come: Yea, this they will then
ſay, notwithſtanding all we ſhall alledg to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if we varie from that ſenſe in which they
were applied by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and we
ſhall thereby ſhake the Foundation of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
in regard thoſe Prophecies now interpreted to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the <hi>Jews</hi> recovering a Temporal Kingdom, after
the Aſcenſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are ſome of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
upon which our Belief is grounded. Much
is expreſſed of GODS love and reſpect to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
and <hi>Sion,</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> and no doubt, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Seats of Gods <hi>onward worſhip,</hi> and the moſt
eminent Places of their Habitation, who were then
his choſen people, he had reſpect unto them for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95657:37"/>
their ſakes, and loved them more then all the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of <hi>Jacob.</hi> But, after the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and by them crucified, it were a very low and
miſ-beſeeming Opinion of GODS love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
to imagine he had any reſpect thereunto, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had made it a Deſolate and Ruinous heap.
For my part, I do not believe that he hath any more
regard of that <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> then of our City of
<hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Tower-hill</hi> annexed; or that the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things, which were to be fulfilled after Chriſts
Incarnation and <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> and predicted by the
Prophets, had relation any otherwiſe then to the
<hi>Spiritual Sion,</hi> and that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
from Heaven. It is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 19, 20.
(to the Church of Chriſt Typified by <hi>Sion) The
Sun ſhall be no more thy Light by day, neither for
brightneſs ſhall the Moon give Light unto thee; The
Sun ſhall no more go down, neither ſhall the Moon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
her Light, for the Lord ſhall be thine everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Light:</hi> To the ſame effect, it is ſaid thus, <hi>Rev.</hi>
21. of the New <hi>Jeruſalem, The City had no need
of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it, for
the glory of God doth enlighten it, and the Lamb is
the Light thereof.</hi> This is not likely to intend that
<hi>Earthly Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi>
where there will be need of the Sun and Moon,
whilſt they are in Heaven, even in a literal ſenſe,
in which ſenſe, that Scripture had no relation to
the <hi>Jews;</hi> nor many other things which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by the ſame Prophet, but in a Myſtical ſenſe
onely, With reference to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> united
in the Kingdom of <hi>Christ,</hi> after the partition-Wall
was broken down; according to that interpretation
which <hi>I</hi> believe our Saviour made of them when he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95657:37"/>
opened the Book of <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Prophecie, and finding
theſe words, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is
upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to Preach
good tidings unto the meek, he hath ſent me to bind
up the broken hearted, to proclaim, liberty to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and opening of the Priſon to them that are
bound,</hi> &amp;c. And a little after it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall
build the old Waſts, they ſhall raiſe up the former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations,
and they shall repair the waſt Cities, the
Deſolation of many generations,</hi> &amp;c. And after all
this, he added, that, <hi>this Prophecie,</hi> was that day
fulfilled in their ſight; and if then fulfilled, there is
not ſuch a fulfilling to come as is expected in a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
mode; But, a compleating of that Spiritual
Kingdom which was then begun. Meditate ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
the Prophecies of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> beginning at the
60 Chapter, to the laſt, and they will evidence that
though there be ſome hints particularly relating to
the Kingdom and Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whilſt they
were under the <hi>Law,</hi> their principal intent, was
the Eſtate of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom,</hi> both at his <hi>firſt
coming,</hi> and afterward, until his <hi>ſecond coming</hi> to
Raign more viſibly upon Earth; and to demonſtra<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
unto his Church, conſiſting both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
made one Flock, what ſhould befall them by
reaſon of their many prevarications after his firſt
coming; which have ſince that time, been equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to the Jewiſh Apoſtacies before, and at his
firſt <hi>Advent.</hi> For, I will be bold to tell this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have followed the
<hi>Jews</hi> ſince the coming of Chriſt, in all their former
Deviations, as, if they had taken them for their
Pattern, yea, juſt as they did from the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Moſes</hi> gave unto them the <hi>Law,</hi> until their <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:95657:38"/>
came: And if he come not again quickly,
the Profeſſors of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> will be as much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
as they, and fall by degrees into an Apaſtacy
and Obduration parallel to theirs; But, I hope
God will prevent it, by making the Apoſtacies, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures,
and wickedneſſes of depraved <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> now called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to be at laſt as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to the Kingdom of Chriſt, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs
of the <hi>Jews</hi> was to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at his firſt
coming. That which firſt occaſioned ſome (who
ſeem to inſiſt on it as an Article of our <hi>ſaving Faith</hi>)
to believe there will be ſuch a Reſtoration of the
<hi>Jews</hi> to their Temporary Kingdom as is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
was the vain curioſity of thoſe <hi>Chriſtian
Doctors,</hi> who, to be reputed Learned in <hi>Rabbinical
Myſteries</hi> followed the Interpretations of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Rabbins,</hi> who lived ſince the <hi>Aſcenſion;</hi> Some
of whoſe malicious falſhoods in perverting the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
made by their <hi>Rabbies</hi> before Chriſts
firſt coming, I long ſince diſcovered, in my Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the <hi>ſecond Pſalm;</hi> particular the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood
of <hi>Rabbi Solomon,</hi> who in his Expoſition of
that <hi>Pſalm</hi>(written in a Language known then to
few but themſelves) confeſſed it was by their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
expounded literally of Chriſt to come; But,
then was, as he ſaid, to be expounded literally of
<hi>David,</hi> to anſwer <hi>Hereticks,</hi> meaning the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
This Expoſition of mine upon the <hi>ſecond
Pſalm,</hi> with nine other <hi>Pſalms,</hi> was loſt in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
when my Houſe was plundred, not likely to
be recovered. What might be ſaid more to this
purpoſe, would fill a Volume by it ſelf and take
up more time then I can ſpare at preſent, All
therefore which I profeſs to believe touching the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95657:38"/>
Calling and Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is this; That
as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the Evening they shall return,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 59. That is, they having, notwithſtanding the
Preaching of the Goſpel, now almoſt 1700 years,
run rambling and ſnarling like Dogs round about
the City in their impenitence, grumbling and unſatisfied,
ſhall return in the <hi>Evening of the world,</hi> in the
beginning of that <hi>ſeventh day of a thouſand years,</hi> in
which <hi>Chriſts</hi> perſonal Raign is to begin; (at leaſt
ſo many of them whoſe incredulity, as <hi>Pauls</hi> did,
proceeded from ignorance onely, and not from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice)
For, then he, who at his firſt coming ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them who believed not, <hi>VVhere I am, thither
cannot you come,</hi> ſhall come again to them; and
they ſeeing him whom they crucified and pierced
in his Glory ſhining round about them, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw
him at his <hi>Converſion,</hi> ſhall with hearty penitence
mourn over him, as one lementing for his onely
Son; and then ſhall the Joy of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of their <hi>Chriſt</hi> begin to be at full
upon earth, and be full in perfection at the cloſe of
that day.</p>
               <p>14. I have been ſo large in this ſeeming <hi>digreſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
becauſe I fear there are many Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo
weak and wavering, that if they ſhould ſee a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
prevalency wrought out by the <hi>Jews,</hi> whilſt
they perſevered in their malitious <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> they
would be more prone (as it ſeems intimated by one
of the Prophets) <hi>To take them by their garments, and
ſay, We will go with you,</hi> and take ſhare with them
in a ſuch temporal King and Kingdom, as they look
for; rather then continue conſtant (in perſecution)
to him whom they have profeſſed. Pardon this
fear, for, I have ſeen too many cauſes of it, as well
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95657:39"/>
in other reſpects, as by the miſapprehenſions of ſome
who tranſported beyond ſobriety, have raiſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conjectures
from the <hi>Rumors</hi> aforementioned, of
accompliſhing that thereby, which they had formerly
reſolved within themſelves, to be the fore-determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Decree of God. For, they ſeem to believe
that it will ſhortly ſucceed in the mode by them
fancied, and as they themſelves wiſh it might be.
Indeed, <hi>If</hi> (as the Proverb is) <hi>whiſhes were Thrushes,
we might all eat Birds:</hi> But, I believe it will not ſo
fall out. The digging for a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> in a great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
by the ſound whereof (as the Report goes) the
<hi>Nation</hi> muſt be gathered together, may be a long
work; and it is ſufficient to diſcover that the whole
matter may be fabulous, on juſtly ſuſpected ſo to be;
or that (if it be not a Jeer or a device to befool
ſome) there is an <hi>Impoſture</hi> as aforeſaid hatching, to
a worſe end. For, what uſefulness is there of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rial
Trumpet,</hi> digg'd out of the Earth, to proclaim
the approach of the <hi>Eternal King</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom;</hi>
or to call a <hi>Nation</hi> out of every nook in the wide
world? Such <hi>whimſies</hi> I am not taken withal, nor
can believe the perfecting that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which we
look for upon the earth, depends on ſuch Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
as are fancied by many, in other modes. To
gain credit to the aforeſaid <hi>Rumour,</hi> it is written,
that they who call themſelves <hi>Iſraelites</hi> have a wiſe
and holy <hi>Prophet</hi> among them to be their <hi>Conducter,</hi>
by whom their <hi>Deſign</hi> is carried on; and ſome with
us do ſuppoſe him to be <hi>Elias,</hi> though <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf
hath told us he is come already: And ſome other
think him to be that <hi>beloved Diſciple,</hi> mentioned
in the 21 Chapter of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, where
our Saviour preſaging in what mode <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95657:39"/>
ſuffer, and he then asking, What that Diſciple
ſhould do? was thus anſwered, <hi>If I will that he tarry
till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me:</hi>
Whereupon ſome inferred, <hi>that Diſciple he ſhould not
die,</hi> though (as was then averred in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing)
<hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid not ſo; nor (as I believe) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it ſhould be ſo underſtood; yet, that <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi>
is retained by ſome to this day, and now
(as I hear) made use of to countenance the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<hi>Rumour,</hi> whereof; I confeſs my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous,
for the reaſons afore expreſſed. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
when ſuch an occaſion was given to have it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> would not have left that ambiguous
which was miſunderſtood; and ſo l believe of every
myſterious expreſſion, which is neceſſary to be
known by all men as pertinent to their Salvation;
unleſs it be to make us wary by what <hi>Spirit</hi> we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
holy Scripture; leſt that which leads into all
<hi>Truth</hi> may by our negligence, or vain curioſity
lead us into errors if miſapprehended. If there be
any point mentioned in holy Scripture, relating to
the <hi>Kingdom to come,</hi> which is <hi>topical,</hi> or <hi>national,</hi> let
them look to it whom it concerns; for, I conceive not
that it any otherwiſe concerns us, then as it ſhall
have an <hi>Univerſal Locality</hi> upon earth, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to any <hi>Nation</hi> or <hi>Place</hi> in particular, as appears
to me, by the words of our <hi>Saviour</hi> to the woman of
<hi>Samaria, John</hi> 4. 21, 22, 33. <hi>Woman,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>believe
me, the hour cometh when ye ſhall neither in this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
or in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>worſhip the Father. Ye worſhip
ye know not what,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But, the hour cometh, and now
is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip in Spirit
and Truth,</hi> &amp;c. VVhence I collect, that if <hi>Place</hi>
were not eſſential to the true VVorship of God,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95657:40"/>
when <hi>Chriſt firſt came</hi> into the world, it will be leſs
eſſential thereunto at his <hi>ſecond coming,</hi> or to have it
limited to a narrower extent, then to the whole
Earth and all Nations.</p>
               <p>15. I am not doubtful, but that in the laſt times
there will be ſome extraordinary and eminent
tranſactions, (and ſome in the next year after this
1665. and during four or five and thirty years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
1666.) in relation to the approaching <hi>Kingdom
of Chriſt;</hi> and to thoſe who have been ſo many
Ages reputed the Off-ſpring of the <hi>Patriarks</hi> ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
throughout the world; and I believe God will
in his own time fulfil all his <hi>Judgements</hi> threatned for
their Apoſtacies and obſtinacies; as alſo his gratious
<hi>promiſes</hi> made unto their <hi>Fore-fathers;</hi> but when that
will be accompliſed, that or in what manner will be
done, which is expected concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> I leave
it to Gods good pleaſure, and unto them, to ſearch
in what mode it will be, who think it concerns
them, more then I do; who am contented with thoſe
<hi>manifeſtations</hi> which I finde in the Word of God, not
repugnant to each other, or above my underſtanding.
There will be ſuch <hi>Signs, VVonders</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi>
as have been fore-told; as alſo, extraordinary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
by <hi>Divine Providence</hi> before <hi>Chriſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Advent,</hi> which the <hi>Elect</hi> ſhall have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
means to know, and make ſuch uſe of, as moſt
tends to Gods Glory, and to preſerve them faithful
to the end. Yet, unſafe it may be, and an occaſion
of multiplying needleſs fears, and troubles upon
our ſelves, to make ſuch <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdom
and <hi>Raign upon Earth,</hi> or ſuch <hi>ſigns</hi> of its approach
as are not plainly warranted by the VVord of God,
whoſe hidden wayes are paſt our finding out; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95657:40"/>
ſo much as is revealed will be obſcure to them, whoſe
unſanctified hearts ſeek after it in <hi>curioſity</hi> onely;
or, with more deſire to finde them ſutable to their,
<hi>own imaginations</hi> (that they may have ſomewhat
wherein to glory) then to make their <hi>ways</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to Gods. VVe are much taken with <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties,</hi>
eſpecially when we our ſelves firſt bring them
to light; and very apt ſuperſtitiouſly to repute
things <hi>holy</hi> or <hi>unholy,</hi> which Have neither <hi>holineſs</hi> or
<hi>unholineſs</hi> in them, except by our abuſe. VVe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
ſome <hi>unholy</hi> which are <hi>ſanctified;</hi> ſome other
to be <hi>holy,</hi> which have no <hi>holineſs</hi> in them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that which is moſt contrary: For Example;
That is ſaid to be the <hi>Holy-land,</hi> which hath been
during many Ages the moſt accurſed of all Lands:
That to be a <hi>holy War,</hi> which was but a wicked-poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
divertiſement of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> to prevent the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
of his growing <hi>Grandeur,</hi> by the Kings
and Princes, whom by that <hi>Engine,</hi> he fool'd into
an employment far from home. That is ſaid to be a
<hi>holy Nation,</hi> which hath had a long time, no more
holineſs in it, them <hi>Judas</hi> who betrayed <hi>Chriſt;</hi> They
are invocated and hallow'd as Saints, and holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
who were Traytors both to God and men;
and whilſt they lived, not reputed ſo holy aſ ſome
of their Neighbours. And that <hi>Croſs</hi> whereon our
bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> was crucified, is not onely called
<hi>holy,</hi> but reputed worthy of <hi>Divine honor</hi> alſo, and
hath many coſtly buildings dedicated thereunto, and
the chips of it ſold for precious Relicks at dear
rates; though in truth it is not ſo holy as the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
at Tibourn,</hi> becauſe that was intended for the
execution of <hi>Juſtice</hi> upon <hi>Malefactors</hi> only, though
perhaps innocents do ſuffer thereupon, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95657:41"/>
while. We have many Inventions of our own. The
<hi>Devil</hi> hath ſo many deceitful <hi>Wiles</hi> alſo, whereby to
make falſe ſhows, that he is promoting, Gods <hi>VVork</hi>
with him, in every <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> that, I ſuſpend my
belief of <hi>new Apparitions,</hi> until I am fully convinced
by a better <hi>Light</hi> then mine own, bearing witneſs
thereunto; and therefore, have here thruſt in ſuch
<hi>Caveats</hi> as came into my heart, to be a <hi>memorandum</hi>
both to my ſelf and others; believing that, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<hi>Gods Kingdom</hi> comes openly into the world,
or inviſibly into my heart (where I feel it to be in
ſome degree) it will always evidence it ſelf without
deluſion: For, it is the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of our <hi>heavenly
Father,</hi> which we are taught to petition for in
this Prayer, and nothing like the Kingdoms of this
world.</p>
               <p>16. This is that <hi>Kingdom</hi> whoſe coming the
<hi>Saints</hi> have long expected; and though I miſ-judge
not of their ſo doing, who call it the <hi>Fifth-Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
I think that Title too mean an Appellative, in
regard it is an <hi>Eternal Kingdom,</hi> having no relation
to <hi>Earthly Monarchies</hi> in reſpect of their <hi>preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
or otherwiſe; but an <hi>Abſolute Kingdom</hi> depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on it ſelf and on him onely, who is the Supream
King thereof. And when it comes into the World,
it will be little available to thoſe who ſhall not find
it to be in ſome meaſure come (or ſo coming) into
their hearts, that they may be made one with it, and
with the <hi>King</hi> thereof, by <hi>Faith and Love.</hi> This is
not a <hi>Kingdom</hi> like that of the <hi>Nations</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
fooliſhly deſired when GOD raigned over
them; nor is this <hi>King</hi> ſuch a one as many other
have as ſottiſhly coveted, and when they had him
cried out to God to be delivered from him, becauſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95657:41"/>
of thoſe oppreſſions and ſlaviſh burthens, which his
ignorance, wilfulneſs, pride, luxury and vanities
brought on them; not conſidering, that their own
baſe flatteries, and the much wickedneſs which is in
themſelves, had perhaps occaſioned thoſe defects
and exorbitances, which were in him; nor heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they perpetuate a reciprocal increaſe of
deſtructive ſins and miſchiefs in and upon each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
But, each Party ſo blames, and is ſo jealous
of the other, without obſerving what is amiſs in it
ſelf, that neither take care of amendment; nor is ſo
diligent to get, and exerciſe the means of doing
what is good, as to be Maſters of power enough to
do what evil they liſt, and to whomſoever they
pleaſe. With this <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> it is not ſo;
the <hi>Soveraign</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> thereof are inſeparably
one in <hi>Love;</hi> the <hi>ſervices</hi> to them belonging are
perfect Freedom; and they are <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> in
the abſtract: the <hi>Kings</hi> of this world neither love to
hear of this Kingdom, nor believe it will ever come;
yet they are often in much fear of it, and for the moſt
part enemies to them who profeſs the belief and
expectation thereof; yea, very jealous (how inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
ſoever they behave themſelves) that, under
pretence of Devotion, they plot and proſecute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
to the ſubverſion of their <hi>Dominions,</hi> or Royal
<hi>Prerogatives.</hi> And, we lately had experience that
ſome conſci entious perſons may be deluded, and
miſled to the deſtruction of their own perſons, and
other mens, (or of their peace, at the leaſt) by
taking into their hands that <hi>Sword,</hi> which belongs
not to <hi>private men in</hi> that mode, as if they thought
the coming of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> were attainable as well
by the <hi>activity</hi> of the Saints in <hi>Fighting,</hi> as by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95657:42"/>
                  <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>praying;</hi> whereas, they who are
guided by ſound and ſober <hi>Principles,</hi> do believe and
wait for that which they call the <hi>Fifth-Monarchy,</hi>
in Gods own <hi>VVay</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> according to his own
good pleaſure, and with that <hi>patience</hi> which becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Saints,</hi> without preſuming peremptorily, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
in what <hi>manner</hi> CHRIST ſhall appear and
Raign upon the Earth, otherwiſe then is plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the <hi>holy Scriptures;</hi> and contenting
themſelves with ſuch glimmerings thereof in myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Figures, as may be ſufficient to raiſe <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative
Souls,</hi> above that which they hear and ſee;
For, theſe know that their frail, narrow, earthen
Veſſels are not able to comprehend the Glory of it
at full. They who have not attained to this mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and prudence, do ſometimes give juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of offence or ſuſpition to the <hi>Civil Powers,</hi>
as aforeſaid, by miſunderſtanding holy Scriptures and
Prophecies, concerning the <hi>Kingdom</hi> here prayed
for, ſuppoſing it is to be conquered by the <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sword</hi> in their hands; and that the binding of
<hi>Kings</hi> in Chains, and <hi>Princes</hi> in fetters of Iron, with
ſuch like expreſſions, are to be underſtood in a groſs
literal ſence; whereas, if the <hi>temporal Sword,</hi>
ſhall be any way uſeful toward introducing of this
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> it will be but preparatorily onely, in the
hands of the <hi>Enemies</hi> thereof to do execution upon
each other, according to that Prophecie of <hi>Haggai,
Their Riders ſhall come down, every one by the Sword
of his brother,</hi> Hag. 2. 22.</p>
               <p>17. The <hi>VVeapons</hi> of our <hi>VVarfare</hi> are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
but ſpiritual; and the little heed taken thereof,
inclines me often to mention it: For, it is the <hi>two-edged
ſword</hi> of the <hi>VVord</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> proceeding out
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95657:42"/>
of his Mouth, whom <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1. 16. ſaw ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the midſt between the ſeven Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
which muſt overthrow the ſtrong holds of
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and his confederates, obſtructing the
Advent of this Kingdom; toward the exaltation
whereof, our <hi>Saviour</hi> might have obtained when
he was upon the Earth, a more powerful aſſiſtance
then that <hi>Sword</hi> (had he ſo pleaſed) by praying for
it to his Father, even <hi>more then twelve Legions of
Angels.</hi> But, ſo far was he from approving the uſe
of <hi>Temporal Swords,</hi> or outward violence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that when a <hi>Diſciple</hi> of his
drew ſuch a Sword in defence of his perſon being
betrayed (and thereby cut off the ear of <hi>Malchus,</hi>
a confederate in the Treaſon) he healed the wound,
commanding the Sword to be put up, and ſaid; that
<hi>Whoſoever made uſe of the Sword</hi> (to the purpoſe
aforeſaid, as <hi>I</hi> conceive) <hi>ſhould periſh by the Sword.</hi>
This we have ſeen fulfilled upon ſome, who ſeemed
zealous of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> believe it hath
often heretofore, and may hereafter be fulfilled upon
many to their deſtruction in the fleſh, to whoſe
ſouls GOD will be merciful, if their zeal were
not a cloke for ſecret pride and malice unrepented
of. For, God otherwhile permitteth, even ſome
who are true Children, and <hi>Subjects</hi> to his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
to be tranſported into ſuch Extravagancies as
their natural corruption inclines them unto, and
to be thereby liable to open ſufferings in the fleſh;
and to be nevertheleſs partakers in ſecret of his
<hi>Everlaſting Mercie;</hi> partly, to make other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> the more watchful and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to examine by what ſpirit they are moved; and
partly (as <hi>I</hi> conceive) to bring ſomewhat pertinent
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95657:43"/>
to their conſiderations alſo, who are as over-zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
another way, in ſeeking more to eſtabliſh their
own Kingdoms then <hi>Chriſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. This laſt Clauſe, I have inſerted, to prevent
ſuch miſtakes as may occaſion the giving juſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or of infringing the <hi>Civil peace,</hi> or of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing
our <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſion,</hi> by imprudent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
or uncharitable Actings; and I hope it will
have ſome good and ſeaſonable effects: For, the
Spiritual Adverſary is cunning, and ſo well knows
how to work upon our Melancholy Diſtempers,
that, even in thoſe things whereof our Natural
ſences are moſt capable, we may be much deluded,
as by many Experiments may be Demonſtrated.
(For example) A <hi>Divine</hi> Preaching in a Cathedral
Church, one of the Auditorie ſuddenly cried out,
as if he had been afrighted with fire, whereupon
a great part of the Aſſembly (they themſelves not
knowing why) apprehending the Church to be on
fire, ſuddenly and haſtily tumbled out of their ſeats
one over another to get out of the doors, and ſo
obſtructed the paſſage, that ſome were troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot, and ſome ſtifled in the throng; in which
fright, one thought he ſaw the fire, another that
he heard it crackle, another, that he felt the mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Lead drop upon him, with ſuch like miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
whereof there was no cauſe at all by fire
or otherwiſe. Likewiſe, an Acquaintance of mine
being at Sea, (where a ſuppoſition in the night, that
the Ship had ſprung a leak, put them into a general
pannick fright) he ſitting in his Cabbin, fancied
that he felt the cold water come up to his feet, then
to his knees, ſoon after to his belly; which (as it
uſually fates with them who ſeldom go into cold
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95657:43"/>
water) made him pant, and ſo think his breath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away thereby, that, he ſhould immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
his ſoul; Yet, there was no water entred into
the Ship. This he told me in ſuch a manner, as if
he had been then ſenſible of that diſtemper by his
miſapprehenſion. Much more therefore, may our
Fancies delude us by Spiritual miſapprehenſions, if
we be not watie of ſurprizes; eſpecially when ſuch.
imaginary Objects, and falſe Repreſentations of
our frail deluded ſenſes are heightned by that which
is cunningly ſuggeſted by the Devil. Perhaps, it
will be thought by ſome, that in this and ſome other
Expreſſions, I ramble from the matter in hand:
But be it known, that the way of a <hi>Contemplative
Soul,</hi> being like that of an <hi>Eagles</hi> in the Aire,
(which is the Hieroglyphick thereof) tends direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
toward what it ſeeks, though it appears not ſo to
the beholders; and to what quarter ſoever it flies,
minds that <hi>Carkas</hi> which is the true nouriſhment
thereof.</p>
               <p>19. Having declared what <hi>Kingdom</hi> that is which
we pray for, I will now ſhew unto whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs,
which is evidenced by this pronoun THY.
It may be collected from what I have already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed:
Yet, that whereunto my <hi>Meditation</hi>
thereupon leads me, will not be uſeleſs. The word
THY, implies, that this Kingdom is our Fathers
to whom we pray: Not a Kingdom to be poſſeſſed
by a ſingle Perſon whom we know not, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may be a Stranger and a Tyrant, or ſuch a one
who will ſuppoſe (as moſt earthly Kings do) that it
was conferred upon him, meerly for his own ſake,
without reſpect to the welfare of the people under
his Juriſdiction; as if the Commonalty of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95657:44"/>
had been born to no other purpoſe, but to be
inſlaved to their Will, or to be Servants at beſt, to
advance their Pomp, and to be ſerviceable to their
Luſts. But, this is not to be feared, when this
<hi>Kingdom</hi> ſhall come. We know whoſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is, and who shall Reign over it. It is our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Kingdom,</hi> and that aſſures us (as is before
hinted) that in praying for it, we petition for that
which tends not only to our Fathers Honor, but to
our own Preferment alſo. We have no poſſibility
to be totally freed from the Tyrannies of Temporary
Governments and Governours, but by the coming
of this Kingdom; For neither <hi>Democracy,</hi> nor
<hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> nor a <hi>Monarchy</hi> regulated, nor any
other humane Form of Government, how often
ſoever we change Perſons, is free from corruptions,
or the increaſe of them likely to have a ſtop, until
this <hi>Kingdom</hi> comes, which (were it but in reſpect
of that alone) will make us partakers of the greateſt
<hi>Temporal Mercy</hi> that may be enjoyed upon the
Earth next to our deliverance from Sin: For, ſo
intolerable are the Deficiencies and Oppreſſions of
<hi>Supream Governours,</hi> throughout moſt Kingdoms
of the World, in relation both to <hi>Temporal</hi> and
<hi>Spiritual Intereſts,</hi> that ſome <hi>Nations</hi> care not who
comes to Reign over them, ſo they may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from their preſent <hi>Tax-maſters;</hi> Yea, are
contented to be invaded by Strangers, to be beaten
by their Enemies, and to adventure whatſoever
they will impoſe upon them, becauſe, they believe
it cannot be worſe with them then it is, or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
will be; though they have had, long time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that, <hi>Seldom comes a better.</hi> This ſad
condition, the <hi>Subjects</hi> of this expected Kingdom
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95657:44"/>
ſhall be delivered from, when it comes. Our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
hath made us free Denizens thereof; Co-heirs
with his <hi>Eternal Son,</hi> and given us Thrones with
Him, by an unqueſtionable, unrepealable <hi>Decree,</hi>
written and ſigned with the precious Blood of our
Eldeſt Brother, whoſe Love did voluntarily purchaſe
it for us at that dear Rate. It cannot be expreſſed
in words, to ſet forth how much he tendred our
Welfare, in preſcribing this <hi>Prayer;</hi> or how ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it obligeth us to make a thankful and right uſe
of it.</p>
               <p>20. Thy Kingdom COME. The laſt word in
this <hi>Petition</hi> is not ſo to be ſo underſtood in the
<hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Tenſe,</hi> as if the <hi>Kingdom</hi> thereby prayed for,
had not a being heretofore, and at this preſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth; For, it is in part already Demonſtrated
to be otherwiſe. All therefore, which will be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neceſſary to be inſisted upon to that purpoſe,
reſulting from this word COME; is to mind us,
that this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> is not yet ſo perfectly manifeſted
as it ſhall be when that <hi>long Day</hi> is begun, in which
the <hi>great Aſſize</hi> will be holden, wherein the <hi>King
of this Kingdom</hi> ſhall come to Judge the quick and
the dead. I do already contemplatively behold it
approaching by the Eie of my Soul; But, that <hi>Eie</hi>
is ſo dim, and my Body ſo frail, that my Heart is
unable to comprehend (much leſs my Tongue or
Pen to expreſs) that little which I conceive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
But, of that unutterable <hi>mystery,</hi> I can truly
ſay this, that, whoſoever endeavours to declare in
what manner <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come and Reign upon
Earth, undertakes a work like his, who ſtrives to
put the whole <hi>Ocean</hi> into a Nut-ſhel, and that, if the
glory of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> were comprehenſible; by us,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95657:45"/>
in this eſtate wherein we now are, it would not be
anſwerable to the expectation I have of it: For the
moſt excellent External things which we can either
enjoy or know in the fleſh, are inſufficient to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
the perfection of it by way of alluſion; For,
the cleareſt Notions of ſuch <hi>ſpiritual Objects,</hi> which
we may attain unto, will be diſſatisfactory to the
Soul until it is in a glorified Body. Nevertheleſs, we
may be made ſo apprehenſive by Grace and Faith of
the <hi>Kingdom to come,</hi> that, we may by Patience,
Meekneſs, Humility and Love, wait contentedly
for what is promiſed; and be preſerved in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
expectation thereof until it comes; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Clouds are evaporated from Humane Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and whatſoever Miſts may be raiſed by the
<hi>Devil,</hi> to make us doubtful thereof: And this we
are to Communicate to each other, ſo far forth as it
is revealed by the Word and Spirit of God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the belief and expectation of this <hi>Kingdom:</hi>
For, though they were reputed Hereticks termed
<hi>Millenaries,</hi> who profeſſed the perſonal Reign of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> upon Earth, and that (according to St. <hi>John</hi>)
<hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. the <hi>Saints</hi> ſhould Reign with <hi>Chriſt</hi> a
1000 Years: Yet, after the Teſtimony of the two
<hi>Witneſſes</hi> was finiſhed; which (as I conceive) was
when the two Teſtaments were compleated, with a
Malediction upon them, who ſhould <hi>take from,</hi> or
<hi>add ought thereunto, Rev.</hi> 21. 18, 19. that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was received for Orthodox by the <hi>Primitive
Chriſtians,</hi> till the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which roſe out of the
<hi>bottomleſs pit,</hi> made war againſt them, and ſlew
them. For, many of the eminent Doctors and
Martyrs in the firſt Ages were of that Judgment
(to wit) <hi>Ireneus, Juſtine Martyr, Tertullian, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95657:45"/>
Cyprian,</hi> and divers other Chriſtians, both
Learned and Unlearned. And, I find by examining it,
that moſt <hi>Hereſies</hi> ſprung from real <hi>Divine Truths,</hi>
miſunderſtood by humane Ignorance and raſhneſs;
Such <hi>Myſteries,</hi> being like the moſt excellent ſtrains
of <hi>Muſick</hi> in this reſpect, that, as when the <hi>Voice</hi>
or a <hi>String,</hi> is under or overmuch ſtrained, though
but a little, it makes a harſh diſcord; So, a little
varying from the <hi>Truth,</hi> makes a damnable errour.
Now, perhaps, that which I have here caſually
inſerted concerning the two <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> being my
private Judgment, wherein I know no Antient or
Modern Interpreter concurring, may ſeem a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.
But, I have given ſuch Reaſons of what
I believe concerning them, in a Tract intitled <hi>Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelogrammaton,</hi>
whereof part was imprinted when
I was cloſe Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the reſt taken
out of my Chamber by the Gentleman Jaylor,
there (amounting to almoſt a 100. pages) that, I
conceive it will make it more probable that thoſe
<hi>Witneſſes</hi> are both ſlain and riſen again, then any
thing yet alledged to the contrary; and therefore
if thoſe papers be not freely reſtored, I will revive
them, God vouchſafing me time and enablement.
And, if what I have thereby, and hereby expreſſed
concerning the ſaid two <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and the Nation
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> with what might be added, were well
conſidered, it would not (as I believe) be ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
believed as it is, that, <hi>Chriſts</hi> coming per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
into his Kingdom upon Earth, is deferred,
either becauſe the <hi>Jews are not yet called,</hi> or the
<hi>Witneſſes not yet ſlain and raiſed up again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21. That, there is ſuch a <hi>Myſterie</hi> to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
as the <hi>Kingdom to come,</hi> there need to be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95657:46"/>
no better evidence thereof, then the Witneſs which
the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God beareth unto it in our hearts, by
concurring with that rational faculty in our Souls,
which diſtinguiſheth us from brutiſh Animals.
<hi>Common Reaſon</hi> dictates, that whatſoever a friend
of whoſe true worth we have had long experience
in all changes, ſhall warrant us to ask in his <hi>Name</hi>
of another perſon, in whom he hath an undoubted
intereſt, we may confidently petition for it; and
it were a great injury done to his Love and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if we ſhould ſuſpect he did adviſe to ask for
that which was not grantable, or unlikely to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
The ſame Reaſon tells us, that if a gratious
earthly Prince, hath been openly Scorned, Diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
Reviled, Betrayed, and every way inhumanely
abuſed; It is juſt he ſhould in the ſame place, be as
openly and as much as is poſſible vindicated, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
to the ſhame of his malitious impenitent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
How much more juſt then is it, that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Son</hi> of God, Lord of lords, and King of kings,
ſhould be glorified in his own <hi>Kingdom upon Earth,</hi>
in the fight and preſence of his <hi>Saints, Angels,</hi> and
all thoſe by whom he was cauſleſly diſhonoured,
betrayed, and moſt cruelly and ingratefully recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
with evil for good; with hatred for Love,
and with all manner of Indignities, for incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
well deſervings? If this be juſt with men,
ſhall the righteous Judge and King of Heaven and
Earth do leſs Juſtice on the behalf of his only Son?
If herein we diſtruſt not our own Reaſon, we
ſhould leſs ſuſpect it, when we have a Warrant
above Reaſon to aſcertain it, which we likewiſe
have out of the Word of God. As for the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which ſome conceive, the Spirit of God,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95657:46"/>
beareth to the <hi>Light</hi> which is within them by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<hi>Revelations,</hi> I muſt leave it to the ſoul
and conſcience of every individual man to try and
examine them, as they are enabled: For, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be known or judged of by any, but by them to
whom they are revealed, and by that <hi>Spirit</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals
them, if they proceed from God. VVhere he
ſpeaks not, it will be in vain for any other to ſpeak;
and until the <hi>Revelation</hi> of that aforementioned,
ſhall in ſome meaſure come into mens hearts; We
do but caſt pearls to Swine, and shall be in danger to
be torn by them, or elſe reputed madmen and <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks,</hi>
babling we know not what. This alſo is to
be conſidered, that, though the perfect manifeſtation
of this Kingdom be not come down Univerſally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth; yet it is come, or ſhall come in a degree
toward perfection, firſt or laſt, explicitely or impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely,
into all to whom that Kingdom belongs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they depart out of this life. He that ſhall come
will come, and not tarry beyond his time (bleſſed be
his Name) and he hath given us ſufficient earneſts thereof.</p>
               <p>22. It is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Ye men of</hi> Galilee,
<hi>Why ſtand ye gazing up into heaven? This ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
who is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo
come in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into heaven.</hi>
There is alſo a cloud of other Teſtimonies bearing
witneſs to this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> particularly in the laſt
Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the three laſt Chapters of the
<hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> in the twentieth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the
<hi>Pſalms,</hi> and in well-nigh all the Prophets, which I
cannot now enumerate or inſiſt upon, left I ſhould
interrupt or diſtract the Meditations of my ſoul, by
Withdrawing my heart from thoſe inflowings which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95657:47"/>
now preſs upon it; and perhaps conſume that little
time which I have to finiſh what I have begun. In
thoſe Scriptures, that which concerns this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and the <hi>King</hi> thereof; the manner of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
the ſigns fore-ſhewing it; the effects of it,
and many particulars and circumſtances pertinent to
thoſe <hi>Myſteries,</hi> aſſiſting us to obtain cognizance of
them ſo far forth as will be needful, both by literal
and allegorical expreſſions, are ſufficient to evidence
their eſſentiality to all thoſe who obſerve and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them with diligence and meekneſs to the right
end. Yea, it will reſolve their ſcruples, whom an
over-curious prying into the manner of <hi>Chriſts fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
perſonality</hi> upon the earth, have made doubtful
what to believe, if they ſhall in humility well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the difference which is between <hi>Spiritual</hi> and
<hi>Natural Bodies,</hi> or of what our future change will
make us capable, when that time cometh. VVe
have a dim glimmering demonſtration thereof, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to diſcern much beyond and above our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
expectations, by the <hi>transfigurations</hi> of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
upon a Mountain in the ſight of <hi>Peter, John</hi> and
<hi>James,</hi> to whom <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appeared to be
talking with their <hi>Maſter,</hi> For, though the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſtate wherein his <hi>Diſciples</hi> then were, was not
fully capable of that <hi>Myſtery,</hi> which they heard and
ſaw, they perceived enough to make them very
well pleaſed with what they apprehended, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their words. And, if we had no other Argument
whereby we may be aſcertained that there will be
ſuch a Kingdom upon earth, then the Petition next
following. <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it in heaven,</hi>
it will ſuſtice, for it is impoſſible Gods will ſhould be
ſo done upon earth, unleſs <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdom ſhould
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95657:47"/>
come hither as we believe; nor would Chriſt have
taught us to pray for that which ſhould never be,
or impoſſible to be performed.</p>
               <p>23. The Adminiſtration of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> upon
earth, was always in part viſible ſomewhere, and
to ſome, ever ſince the time of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Aſcention.
And though it was much obſcured ſoon after, when
the <hi>myſtery of iniquity</hi> began to work; and more
when it was at higheſt; yet, even then it was very
powerful by ſecret operations, through the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>third Perſon in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
and ſhall be, until the <hi>King</hi> of that <hi>Kingdom</hi>
appears again to perſonate his diſtinct Office, with
the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> who have, always
an intrinſecal co-operation with him. What I
further apprehend concerning their joynt-acting in,
and concerning this <hi>Kingdom;</hi> I will offer to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
though ſuch <hi>ſpeculations</hi> may perhaps ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<hi>Novelties:</hi> For, ſometimes great Fires are kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by little obſcured ſparks, and my <hi>Ruſh-candle</hi> may
perhaps occaſion the enlightning of many <hi>Torches</hi>
hereafter, when my ſnuff is burnt out. There is
an Interweaving of many dark expreſſions in the
<hi>Apoculypſe</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi> concerning this and other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime
<hi>Myſteries,</hi> to him delivered; wherein, things
<hi>preceding</hi> have relation to things <hi>following;</hi> and
ſome things following to thoſe which precede, by
way of <hi>ſupplement,</hi> as I conceive; and ſome alſo
having reference, both to what was <hi>precedent</hi> and
<hi>ſubſequent.</hi> Thus, under correction, I apprehend;
and that, among ſuch, the binding of <hi>Sathan</hi> for a
<hi>thouſand years,</hi> is one; having reſpect as well to the
reſtraining of him, from ſetting up his <hi>Myſtery</hi> of
<hi>Iniquity</hi> until the LET <hi>ſhould be taken away</hi> (which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95657:48"/>
was before the <hi>Bottomleſs Pit was opened)</hi> as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
unto the time wherein he ſhould be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a <hi>thouſand years</hi> from deceiving the Nations,
after the BEAST, the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> and the whole
<hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed, by
the coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to perſonate his <hi>Kingſhip</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth: For, it was a thouſand years after our
<hi>Saviours</hi> Aſcention, and after the <hi>Roman Empire</hi>
was at higheſt (and began to decline) before the
<hi>Beaſt</hi> which aroſe out of it could aſcend to his height;
which conſumed all the number of years alotted to
that Empire, until the <hi>Beaſt</hi> laſt mentioned, aroſe.
This time was enigmatically preſignified by <hi>M.</hi> the
firſt and greateſt <hi>Numeral</hi> belonging to that <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>;
the remainder of their Numerals, to wit,
<hi>DCLXVI</hi> preſaged the time alotted to the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Beaſt</hi> (the laſt Relick of that <hi>Monarchy)</hi> myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
repreſented, by that part of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Image,</hi>
which was compoſed of <hi>Iron and Clay.</hi> For, though
I muſt confeſs I have no Precedent for what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
my Judgement to be, nor any other warrant
but what hath been ſpoken to my own heart in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;
I do conceive (which I have heretofore pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
effect upon ſeveral occaſions) that God,
though it ſeems they took no notice of it, gave that
<hi>Empire a Myſterious hint,</hi> in their own <hi>Numerals,</hi>
how long it ſhould laſt after it was at higheſt, both
in the main of its firſt <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and in that which
ſhould ariſe out of it, until the total extirpation
thereof branch and root. All the ſaid <hi>Numerals</hi>
joyned together in order, beginning at the greateſt
and ending at the leaſt, being theſe, <hi>M.D.C.L.X.V.</hi>
and <hi>I,</hi> make one thouſand ſix hundred ſixty ſix. The
<hi>thouſand years</hi> were conſumed before the <hi>ſecond
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95657:48"/>
Beaſt</hi> which is the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,
and then that uſurped the whole power of
his <hi>Predeceſſor;</hi> and the remaining Numerals make
up DCLXVI, which is the number of a <hi>Man:</hi>
to wit, the <hi>Myſtical man</hi> of ſin; and will be the
whole time limited, as I conceive, for his wicked
<hi>Raign,</hi> after he came to his higheſt exaltation; and,
as I take it, we are to begin to reckon this <hi>double
number,</hi> from <hi>Chriſts death and paſſion or Aſcention,</hi>
not from his Birth; becauſe the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> was
not at his higheſt till then; and declined not until
it had Crucified the <hi>Lord of Life,</hi> And if ſo, we
may gueſs within a ſhort time, how long that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
may continue, if we knew certainly how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years <hi>Chriſt</hi> lived upon the earth; and if <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers</hi>
have rightly computed preceding times,
from his <hi>Birth</hi> till this year 1665, and that time as
I have already ſaid, may be about four or five and
thirty years yet to come. I will not ſo abſolutely
determine it, as once heretofore I did (being, a
little-over heated with Zèal) upon occaſion given
to treat of that time: For, <hi>Chriſt</hi> having intimated
that a compleat certainty of it, is not revealed to
any man in the fleſh, I wave that peremptory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
though I ſtill believe it will be about that
time; and perhaps, God ſometimes permitteth ſuch
caſual ſlips (when they are not purpoſed) to keep
his Children quiet, when they deſire things before
they can be had, as we do our Children by ſuffering
them to pleaſe themſelves with uncertain harmleſs
hopes. When the <hi>number</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is finiſhed,
I do believe, there will be a ſpace of time, in which
that which is truely <hi>Good</hi> ſhall be as well made
known, at <hi>Evil</hi> hath now been almoſt ſix thouſand
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95657:49"/>
                  <hi>years,</hi> and that the time thereto allotted is that <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Myſterious</hi> Day, or <hi>Sabbath</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi>
our GOd hallowed when he had finiſhed his <hi>ſix days
works;</hi> and that the <hi>Jewiſh, ſabbathſ</hi> of dayes and
years, were but Types of the great <hi>ſabbath</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the other <hi>ſix parts of time,</hi> and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by GOD for himself and his choſen people to reſt;
in; and is called a <hi>Day</hi> by him, with whom <hi>A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years is but as yeſterday;</hi> it being uſual in <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſcripture,</hi> to ſignifie many years and times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of many ages, by the denomination of a <hi>day,
or days;</hi> as in <hi>Daniel,</hi> a time of many Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
then to come, by 1335 dayes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 12.
and in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> 11, by 1260 days; and in
the ſame Chapter, by <hi>three day and a, half;</hi> and
it ſignifies the whole time of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, in that place where it is ſaid, <hi>Abraham
deſired to ſee his day, and ſaw it;</hi> For, he fore ſaw it by Faith.</p>
               <p>24. <hi>Six days</hi> of a thouſand years apiece (as I
conceive) was alotted for the men of this VVorld,
to proſecute, therein, thoſe works which they
thought they had to do; and were alotted both for
their <hi>Probation,</hi> and to acquite (as aforeſaid) that
experimental knowledge which was deſired by our
<hi>First-parents.</hi> And in that ſpace of time, both <hi>good
and evil men,</hi> who were <hi>Vicegerents</hi> or <hi>Subjects,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Kingdom of <hi>God,</hi> or of the <hi>Prince of
this, world,</hi> were permitted to be active for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Intereſts, according to their, diſtinct inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to purſue them ſo far forth, as that <hi>good</hi> or
<hi>evel</hi> which was in them would extend. But, neither
the <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which was in the beſt, is ſufficient
in it ſelf to perfect their deſired <hi>Kingdom,</hi> nor the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95657:49"/>
wickedneſs which is in the worſt, enongh to eſtabliſh
their <hi>Dominion;</hi> becauſe the reſtraining power of
him, who is the <hi>Supream Governour</hi> of all things,
would not permit the Adverſaries of his Kingdom
to be ſo wicked as they would have been in acting
deſtructively thereunto, though the wickedneſs of
their <hi>Will,</hi> wanted nothing to compleat of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
their perſonal untighteouſneſs, of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of <hi>Evil</hi> which was in them. But, when the
great <hi>Sabbaths of years</hi> is come, in which the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Kings</hi> of both, are to manifeſt and exerciſe
their Powers, in another mode then heretofore, (or
at this preſent) to wit, during the laſt <hi>thouſand

and univerſally appear whether of the two is moſt
powerful; and that neither the <hi>Evil</hi> which is it

men, could thitherto, or ſhall at that day do any
works of their own, which they think they had to

men are deluded with falſe appearances in this caſe,
whereof I have had had experiments a long time in
relation to my ſelf; and, if I ſhall be credited,
may ſay much to prevent thoſe fallacies in others.
Hear then with ſeriouſneſs, what I ſhall now
expreſs to that purpoſe. I will begin with ſome of
thoſe deceivable Marks whereby very many think
they are made Children of God and Inheriters of
his <hi>Heavenly Kingdom,</hi> before they have any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
thereof, but ſuch as theſe enſuing; whoſe
invalidity let them conſider. They had an <hi>Initiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
into the Kingdom, by being Baptized with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Name of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt,</hi> and had God-fathers and God-mothers,
who, for obtaining that Priviledg, promiſed many
things in their Names to be performed on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half:
But, ſo were many thouſands, who being
heedleſs of ſuch promiſes, ſeem by their Lives and
Converſations, to be Children of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and
belonging to this <hi>kingdom.</hi> They have been out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
partakers of the <hi>Lords Table;</hi> ſo was <hi>Judas,</hi>
by what ſeems a probability thereof, as well as
the reſt of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yet, we know he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated.
They have done <hi>Miracles;</hi> ſo did <hi>Simon
Magus, Jannes, Jambres,</hi> and others, yet were <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors.</hi>
They have caft out <hi>Devils</hi> in <hi>Chriſts</hi>
Name; ſo did ſome, to whom he will ſay <hi>I know

<hi>Temples;</hi> ſo did <hi>Herod,</hi> whoſe like was not in
the world, yet he was a Tyrant, and murthered the
innocent Children and <hi>John the Baptiſt.</hi> They
have maintained many ſuch <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> as
they affected; ſo did <hi>Jezabel,</hi> yet was a Strumpet
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95657:51"/>

who, through neglect of endeavouring mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and theſe that follow will alſo be ſuch demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof, as if we be not Traytors to our ſelves,
may make it unqueſtionably known to be within
us.</p>
               <p>26. If <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt be within us,</hi> we ſhall
feel, that we love him who is King thereof with all
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95657:51"/>
our hearts; yea, more then our ſelves; we ſhall be
obedient to all his Commands and Laws to our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
power; Zealous of his Honour, and of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
his Name, and maintaining all the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> even to the loſs of our lives,
if need be, and ſorry when we fail therein, through
infirmity: we ſhall love our <hi>ſelves</hi> no more, then to
make it a true <hi>Rule</hi> whereby to meaſure out the love
we owe unto our <hi>Neighbours</hi> and <hi>Brethren:</hi> VVe
ſhall always have as well a charitable Love for our
<hi>Enemies,</hi> as an affectionate love for our <hi>Relations;</hi>
and ſquare out all Actions by the <hi>Evangelical Law</hi>
of that <hi>Kingdom.</hi> VVe ſhall do <hi>good</hi> for <hi>evil;</hi> blesſ
them that curſe us; pray for them, who perſecute
us; forgive, as we would be forgiven; be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to all Gods creatures, according to their kinds;
uſe them with ſobriety and thankfulneſs; and be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for it in our hearts, when we are knowingly,
or ignorantly defective in theſe of any other duties,
as ſoon as we have cognizance thereof, or ſuſpect
our ſelves to have been any way faulty: VVe ſhall
arrogate nothing to our own endeavours, when we
have done the beſt we can, but aſcribe all the honour
and merit of what is performed, to our <hi>Heavenly
Father</hi> and Creator, his <hi>Son</hi> our Redeemer, and to
the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> our Sanctifier; who are, as it were,
the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> by whom this <hi>Kingdom</hi> is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.
When we finde theſe marks upon us, the
<hi>willingneſs</hi> of our hearts will be accepted as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
performance of the whole <hi>Law;</hi> and we ſhall
have an undoubting aſſurance that this <hi>Kingdom</hi> is
in ſuch a meaſure within us, as will ripen to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in due time. Al this, we may finde im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
contained in thoſe <hi>Benedictions</hi> recorded in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95657:52"/>
the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> with promiſes annexed, by our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
to the qualifications there mentioned, <hi>Matthew</hi> 5.
3. &amp;c. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit: for their's is the
Kingdom of heaven. Bleſſed are they that mourn: for
they ſhall be comforted. Bleſſed are the meek: for they
ſhall inherit the earth. Bleſſed are they who hunger and
thirſt after righteouſneſs: for they ſhall be filled.
Bleſſed are the merciful: for they ſhall obtain mercy.
Bleſſed are the pure in heart: for they ſhall ſee God.
Bleſſed are the Peace-makers: for they ſhall be called
the Children of God. Bleſſed are they who are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for Righteouſneſs ſake: for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven. Bleſſed are ye, when men ſhall revile
you, perſecute you, and ſay all manner of evil againſt
you falſly for my ſake: Rejoyce then and be glad; for
great is your reward in heaven: ſo perſecuted they the
Prophets which were before.</hi> Theſe are not my
words, but his, (even the <hi>King</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom</hi>)
who will make them good; and as I ſaid before,
whoſoever ſhall finde theſe foreſaid marks upon
him, may be confident that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven

               <p>1. WHen with perfect aſſent thereunto in <hi>heart,</hi> as
well as in <hi>words,</hi> we can ſay this <hi>Petition,</hi> our
work will ſoon be at an end; for, we ſhall then be
called home by our <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> and there will
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95657:52"/>
be no more need of ſuch things as are prayed for in
the three following <hi>Petitions.</hi> Let us well conſider
therefore, what we ask for in theſe words. They
amount in effect to a true <hi>ſelf denial,</hi> which is the
moſt difficult thing in the world for fleſh and blood
to ſubmit unto; yet, may poſſibly be made eaſie,
if it were well conſidered, that it brings with it the
greateſt advantages that we can Petition or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
for, by any faculty that we can call our own,
ſeeing God, who can and doth renew the <hi>Will,</hi> and
inclines us thereto, when we pray that his VVill may
be rather fulfilled then our own, hath promiſed
aſſiſtance. It begins to be eaſie to a regenerated
heart, when it knows that GODS <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>
are <hi>one,</hi> and that our <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Wickedneſs</hi>
alſo are <hi>one</hi> (as it is meerly our own will) and brings
us into all the miſchiefs which befal both in this
world and the world to come, if we are ſwayed whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thereby. In this <hi>Petition,</hi> as in the former, we ask
together with what tends to <hi>Gods glory,</hi> that which
will both prevent our deſtruction here, and procure
our eternal happineſs hereafter. He that knows
God as he may do by what he hath <hi>manifeſted,</hi> of
<hi>himself,</hi> and of his <hi>goodneſs</hi> toward all <hi>Mankinde,</hi>
need never to be afraid to ſubmit his own <hi>will</hi> to
his; yea, Body, Soul, and all that is moſt dear and
pretious in his own eſteem, to be diſpoſed of at his

begotten in moſt men of underſtanding, by
<hi>reading and hearing</hi> his <hi>Word preached,</hi> but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
(eſpecially in them whoſe natural Faculties

VVill of God, which is always the ſame, though to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95657:53"/>
us it ſeems to change as we are changed. He hath not,
as ſome ſay, (who delude themſelves and others, by
ſophiſticated diſtinctions) a <hi>ſecret</hi> and a
<hi>revealed
VVill,</hi> contradictory to each other; yea, ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory,
that they may be rather judged <hi>two wills</hi>
then <hi>One.</hi> This falſe opinion cauſes many to
be diſtruſtful of Gods good meaning towards <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde;</hi>
fearful he will reprobate them, when they
have done all they can to pleaſe him; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
(though they profeſs the contrary, and ſpeak
many good words of him) blaſpheam his <hi>goodneſs;</hi>
imputing that unto him, which belongs to the <hi>Devil</hi>
and <hi>themſelves</hi> onely. They, who make unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſuch a GOD, cannot be better then he; and I
ſhall not wonder if they cannot pray heartily, that
<hi>his will may</hi> be done.</p>
               <p>2. To excuſe themſelves, there be ſome of theſe,
who in effect, do irreverently ſay thus unto God in
their hearts: <hi>VVho hath reſiſted thy VVill? Thou
knoweſt that by the ſin of our Fathers, and by thy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Decree of Election and Reprobation, the greateſt
part of mankinde is left in (or rather thrown into) ſo
ſad a depraved condition, that we are neither free to
will, or to do what thou requireſt.</hi> This is impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to belie and blaſpheam GOD: For, when he ſaid
that, <hi>The ſeed of the VVoman ſhould break, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
head,</hi> he ſanctified the whole <hi>humane Nature</hi>
into a capability of performing ſo much as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires

and will for ever, at firſt or at laſt, ſo inlighten e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man who comes into the world, vouchſafing
according to his promiſe, ſuch a renewing of the
<hi>will,</hi> and ſuch a perpetual co-aſſiſtance, for
askng,
to perform what ſhall be accepted for the deed, to all
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95657:53"/>
them who ſhall not wilfully, malitiouſly and finally
reſiſt his Grace, that no deficiency in him can be
juſtly laid to his charge, in relation to our miſdoings,
as it will be manifeſted, when all hidden things are
diſcovered at the laſt judgment. Indeed, as we are
meerly in our <hi>depraved Nature,</hi> we can neither do or
will ought, that is acceptably good; but, as we are
in <hi>grace</hi> we may: For, then to <hi>will,</hi> is freely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with us, and our doings perfected by the Merits
of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yea, our miſdoings are often by him
improved, both to his Glory and our Salvation; not
that we ſhould ſin, that Grace may abound, but
that abounding Grace may keep us from ſin. If we
had not a <hi>Free will</hi> in ſufficient meaſure to do, or
leave undone, to chuſe or refuſe; then were our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
inferiour to thoſe of beaſts, which do chuſe or
leave ſuch means of preſervation as are ſet before
them; nay were this liberty taken away, or quite
loſt, we could not be juſtly reputed righteous or
wicked by our meer perſonal default, in reſpect
of any thing which we <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>leave
undone.</hi> Wiſe men do not endeavour to force a
Beaſt to that whereunto he is not naturally inclined,
much leſs to that whereunto he hath a Natural Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,
and deſtroy him for not doing that which he
cannot. By gentle allurements we may by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
bring it to change <hi>Nature,</hi> and become ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to our Deſires. God, in like manner
<hi>Draweth us by the Cords of a Man;</hi> he forceth not
our Nature, into a change but wooeth our <hi>will,</hi> unto
a conformity, with his, by ſuch means as may ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and naturally thereto incline the heart, uſing no
other force but ſuch Fatherly chaſtiſements onely,
as may remove the perverſeneſs which we have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

which we got by hearkning to his and our
Enemies. It is an unqueſtionable Cruelty, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
and neceſſitate men to that which we know
makes them everlaſtingly miſerable; but doubtleſs
it were no wrong to a Madman to pull him out of
the fire whereinto he had thrown himſelf; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
in a Father to uſe the Rod to fright his
Children, from that which may deſtroy them, when
they will neither do it for love to him or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
God afflicteth none but for their good,
until they become obſtinately Rebellious; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
no more of any man, then he hath given;
Reprobates none finally, unleſs they are finally
unpenitent; and never willed the deſtruction of
any one who ſubmitted to his <hi>will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. No man, I think endeavours to teach <hi>Beasts</hi>
to write and read, though ſome teach <hi>Birds</hi> to
ſpeak, which can talk with as much underſtanding
of humane words, as they have of the Myſteries of
<hi>ſaving Faith,</hi> who diſcourſe and preach the Word
<hi>literally,</hi> without the <hi>Spirit;</hi> therefore God hath
vouchſafed means of inſtruction by offering both;
and, if their concurrence hath not a ſufficiency to
effect for every man that which was intended, and
promiſed to all who deſpise not his offer, but ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
ſeek for it; Why, are we commanded to
make interceſſion for all men? Why doth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
injoyn all to believe in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> if there
had not been a poſſibility that all might have been
ſaved, unleſs by their own default? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
hath God ſworn he deſireth not the death of
a ſinner, and give his <hi>onely Son for a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi>
that all men might be ſaved? Why are
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95657:54"/>
ſo many promiſes and threatnings caſt away upon
them, who are ſaid to be irrecoverably predeſtinated
both to condemnation, and to do all that evil which
may bring it upon them; as certainly as the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
are predeſtinated to their Salvation, and to
the means thereof? Wherefore do men ſo quarrel
about <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>Diſciplines,</hi> putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and others, to ſo much Labour, Coſt, and
Suffering, as we ſee they do, impoſing the ſame
duties upon all without exceptions, if the greateſt
number of men are <hi>Reprobates</hi> without hope? I
know what is, or may be ſaid by ſome to thoſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionings,
and that they are deluſive or diſſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
anſwers; For, if we ſhall teach men to believe
that God hath abſolutely willed and fore-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
as they ſuppoſe very few will be thereby
incouraged to pray that his <hi>Will may be done.</hi> But
God hath neceſſitated none to be miſerable or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
he hath provided means whereby both Sin
and Miſerie may be prevented; or elſe removed,
if it be timely embraced; and if that by neglect
thereof, men ſeeming righteous fall not away from
their Righteouſneſs. For, by the <hi>common outward
means</hi> preſcribed, to them unto whom it is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
together with thoſe extraordinary and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<hi>Mediums</hi> which God vouchſafeth (where
they are not preached as with us) by the <hi>Spirit
which bloweth, when, and where it liſteth,</hi> the
<hi>Will</hi> is by degrees ſet at liberty form its natural
Bondage, and rendred active in the works of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi>
by propoſing Gods promiſes of Supply
and Aſſiſtance; by ſhewing their dangers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
and by intermingling <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
and if theſe prevail not, it is not by any
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95657:55"/>
                  <hi>bar fore-determined</hi> by God, both becauſe their <hi>own
wilfulneſs</hi> and <hi>negligence</hi> hath lulled them aſleep in
ſecurity, until they are hardned into a <hi>final impenitency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Many men who are ſick, have no will to take
ſuch Phyſical ingredients as are wholſome and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for recovery of their healths, but naturally
abhor them with ſuch a deteſtation, that they will
not be perſwaded or inforced to receive them by
thoſe who have moſt power over them (though
they are likely to looſe their lives by that wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)
yet, by the prudence and gentle perſwaſions
of a wiſe and loving Phyſitian, taking away their
nauſeouſneſs by other corrective Ingredients, and
aſſuring them of health, they are won at laſt to
accept thereof, and recover: So it fares with us
who are naturally averſe from the means which the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> preſcribeth to correct our <hi>depraved will,</hi>
when we are not finally obſtinate, and have made
our ſelves worſe, and more miſerable by evil <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms</hi>
ripened into an <hi>Habitual wickeneſs,</hi> then we
were by a <hi>depraved Nature. Chriſt</hi> bewailed <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
with tears, not becauſe ſhe <hi>could not,</hi> but
becauſe ſhe <hi>would not</hi> embrace the means of her
preſervation and proſperity, through that wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which ſhe had contracted by her own default; elſe,
his bewailings had not proceeded from true
<hi>compaſſion,</hi> which it were a Capital ſin to affirm:
And they who deny what God hath done, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to do for them; or affirm, that he hath not
given them ability whereby they may co-operate
with him in doing what he commands, and in
avoiding that which he hath forbidden, are ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Blaſphemers and Lyars: For, the contrary
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95657:55"/>
not only evidenced in his <hi>Word,</hi> but is alſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable
by that whereof we have, or may have an
experiment. If a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> or a <hi>Thief,</hi> or an <hi>Adulterer,</hi> or any other groſs ſinner, who hath moſt
accuſtomed himſelf to prevaricate, were told by
him, whom he knew to have both power and will
to inflict what he threatens, that the next time he
was drunk, or committed any of the ſins aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
he ſhould be immediately tormented to
death; and if this man knew and still ſaw one
watching him night and day in publick and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
at home and abroad, ready to execute him
immediately for that tranſgreſſion, I am confident
that Drunkard, Thief, or Adulterer, who was
moſt tempted to act thoſe ſins, would forbear them
ſo long as he had ſuch an Attendant, unleſs he were
grown ſo diſtracted that he knew not what he did;
And, if this be ſo, (whereof I think no reaſonable
man doubts) then, whoſoever ſayes it is not in his
power to forbear thoſe ſins which he actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
I dare ſay unto him, it is not altogether
through want of ability to perform ſo much as God
requires, but becauſe he neglects the Grace offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or that watchfulneſs over himſelf which is neceſſary
and poſſible; or, because he believes not
Gods promiſes and threatnings; or forgets or heeds
not that he ſees him in all places, at all times, and
will ſeverely puniſh his careleſneſs and preſumption;
and, this is that which renders every <hi>caſt-away</hi>
liable to Reprobation, and no fore-determination
of God neceſſitating him thereunto. More might
be ſaid to this purpoſe, but I hope this ſhall ſuffice
to preſerve a reverent eſteem of Gods Juſtice and
Mercy; as alſo, to make us heedful what may be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95657:56"/>
a help or hinderance to preſerve us willing, and
conſtant in praying Gods will may be done in Earth
as it is in Heaven. I am ſo large in this, and ſome
other ſeeming digreſſions, becauſe I ſometimes
finde, <hi>that, the furtheſt way about, is the neareſt
way home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. It hereby partly appears why we ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
refer our <hi>will</hi> to Gods, and pray for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
thereof in all things, and on all men
without exception; and that we have no other
means to be freed from being inſlaved by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
arbitrary will of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> or from being in a
worſe bondage, to our own <hi>will.</hi> Oh! that we
could conſider as we ought to do, how we are inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
drawn by evil <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> and bad <hi>Examples,</hi> to
fall away by degrees into a Reprobated ſenſe,
yielding firſt to one vain act which we think ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
that it conduceth to no evil; then to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and another after that, till at laſt the groſſeſt
wickedneſs, is ruſhed into without ſtop; Yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that, which a while before we thought to be
both fooliſh and wicked, and condemned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided
in other men: Thus it fares even with ſome
who have been in a good meaſure inlighted, and
purged from many groſs, corruptions: for when
the Will is in ſome degree renewed, and the <hi>ſing he
Talent</hi> which was formerly neglected and abuſed,
ſomwhat improved (which might have been multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
according to what was required, aſwell as his
who had <hi>five</hi>) they ſeeing their Houſes ſwept and
garniſhed, admit inſtead of the Devil which was
caſt out, ſuch a <hi>ſpirit of pride,</hi> with his Aſſociates,
as makes their later ends worſe then their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.
GOD having delivered all men from
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95657:56"/>
the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, by <hi>Chriſts,</hi> giving
every one wherewith to perform his duty, (renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo his Grace to many, more then once or twice,
after they have forfeited it) very hazzardous (if
not damnable) is their condition, who preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
offend ſo Gracious a Maſter. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
watch and pray, that we fall not irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
into temptation and ſurprize, even for our own
ſakes, at leaſt, until <hi>Self-love</hi> ſhall be improved
into a <hi>True love,</hi> of him who loved us firſt; and
ſeeing nothing can be more miſchievous unto us
then our <hi>Self-will,</hi> let us not only pray heartily that
Gods will may be done, but endeavour ſo to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our <hi>wills</hi> to his, that his <hi>will</hi> and ours may be
<hi>one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Before this can be poſſible, thoſe
Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
muſt be removed, which the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Flesh,</hi>
and the <hi>Devil</hi> have raiſed up within us, to keep our
Will from union with Gods; to wit, a believing
the ſuggeſtions of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> as our <hi>firſt Parents</hi>
did, when they were ſeduced and tempted by a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable
Object;</hi> and by his miſrepreſenting unto
them the <hi>Fore-knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Fore-determination</hi>
of God; as alſo, by inſinuating a want of Love
or Good meaning toward <hi>Mankind,</hi> in that which
he <hi>willed</hi> and <hi>prohibited:</hi> when any are thus prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed,
it muſt be one as ſtrong as the <hi>Almighty</hi>
who can caſt out thoſe <hi>Devils</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and caſt out they muſt
be, before they can heartily pray, Gods <hi>will</hi> may be
done: For, who can perſwade thoſe men by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or move them by Threatnings, to commit
themſelves and all other things to his <hi>will,</hi> whoſe
<hi>Juſtice</hi> is made doubtful, or of whoſe Love to him
in particular he is uncertain; or, by ſuch means
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95657:57"/>
only aſſured, as may be queſtionable, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to <hi>Reprobates,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Elect;</hi>
conſidering alſo, what fair appearances there are
of their good effects ſometimes, even upon <hi>Hypocrites,</hi>
when they are but falſe counterfeited <hi>works?</hi>
Theſe <hi>Obſtructions</hi> alone, are enough to hinder
the conforming of our <hi>will</hi> to Gods, if they be not
removed: Therefore, though theſe are not all, I
will aſſay the removing of them, before I proceed
further. And, in regard it is ſaid that the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of our own hearts, are as good as many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers;
(and not altogether uſeleſs, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful,
when their ſingle advice is wholly depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon) I will precaution a little by the way, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that. It is true, that every <hi>Vnregenerated
mans heart</hi> is fraudulent in his Natural eſtate; Yet,
when it is Regenerated, and depends not upon <hi>ſelf-Apprehenſions,</hi>
by the meer <hi>natural Light</hi> which
is therein, but ſeeks after, and receives with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
that <hi>Divine Light</hi> which is offered and
communicated thereto by the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of
GOD, it is eſſentially efficient both to the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
and conforming of our WILL, to and with
that <hi>Object</hi> whereunto we ought to adhere; and
then more to be depended on then the Authority
of all the wiſeſt men in the World, without that
Evidence. For, when God hath prevailed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the heart, by ſuch a concurrence of <hi>Lights,</hi>
it will not then deceive any; but be as infallible
as the <hi>white Sione,</hi> which is known to none but to
him that hath it. I know no means how in theſe
dayes, we may be aſſured ſuch <hi>Revelations</hi> are of
God, as that was, when he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi>
to ſacrifice his ſon <hi>Iſaac;</hi> For, how ſtrongly ſoever
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95657:57"/>
our hearts may be inclined thereunto, we having
now our Communion with God in another mode,
all Inſpirations repugnant to what is revealed in the
<hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> interpreted by his Evangelical
Word and Spirit, are to be rejected as diabolical
ſuggeſtions.</p>
               <p>7. The <hi>Law</hi> is our School-maſter to bring us to
<hi>Chriſt;</hi> but it will never bring us <hi>into him,</hi> until his
<hi>Love</hi> opens the door, which he hath freely opened,
keeps it open, and offers entrance to all who deſire
and ſeek it; yea, and to ſome before they ſought it:
And, when being entred, we there behold his <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and feel the fervour of his <hi>Love,</hi> it ſo inflames
our love to him (if not prepoſſeſſed and bewitched
with other affections) that our <hi>will</hi> doth Zealouſly
and contentedly cleave unto him. VVe may preach
the <hi>Law</hi> and pronounce <hi>Judgements</hi> (as ſome have
done, till they have brought Deſpair and Hell into
the Souls of many) but, that begets more <hi>fear</hi> then
<hi>love,</hi> or at beſt more love to our ſelves then unto
him; or, more cautiouſneſs then willingneſs, until
<hi>Evangelical Lenitives,</hi> be therewith applyed. It is
the making known <hi>Chriſts</hi> meek condeſcentions,
long-ſufferings, and the ſuperexcellent Amiableneſs
of his <hi>Love</hi> and tender <hi>Mercies,</hi> that ſooneſt and moſt
effectually work in us repentance of our ſins, and
that confidence in him, which will incline us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a reſerve, to pray abſolutely to his and our <hi>Fa-Father,</hi>
that his <hi>will may be done.</hi> But, ſome have
taken a courſe direct contrary, and made ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations</hi>
of God, that I conceive their Doctrine
to be the greateſt obſtruction of all other to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abſolutely, that his <hi>VVill may be done in earth,
as it is in heaven.</hi> It will never be a motive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95657:58"/>
to tell men, that before all worlds (when there
was no man to reſiſt his will, or deſirous of a <hi>being,</hi>
whereby he might have had a poſſibility of reſiſting
it, or to offend him in any manner) God, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decreed
Create an <hi>Innocent Creature,</hi> (whom he
himſelf ſaw and acknowledged to be good after he
had created him) that, having accordingly made
him, breathed a portion of his own <hi>Spirit</hi> into
him, Given him Dominion over all his Creatures
upon earth, and commanded him to increaſe and
multiply; at the ſame moment pre-ordained,
according to an <hi>Irrevocable Decree</hi> (before that
Creature, or any of his Generation had done good
or evil) that the greateſt part of his Poſterity
ſhould he everlaſtingly reprobated and damned, for
committing ſins, which his <hi>Decree</hi> alſo, had neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
them to commit. Moreover, that having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated
a means whereby this poor Creatures Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
might be ſaved; promiſed Mercy ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception, be vouchſafed to all who believed
in his Son; commanded that Salvation to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
and preached to all Nations; and that even
then he knew it was Decreed by himſelf, that the
greateſt number of men, were made uncapable of
accepting what was promiſed, or of having any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
thereby, when they had done the utmoſt they
could to obtain it. All this, and much more to
this purpoſe is averred of Gods <hi>Decrees,</hi> by thoſe
who understood them not, and ſuppoſed what
was never by them intended; and who can ſubmit
their wills to ſuch a GOD as theſe have made?</p>
               <p>I will not ſay as ſome have done (publiſhed it alſo
in their writings) <hi>Diabolus eſt quorundam Calviniſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rm Doni,</hi>
for, I believe many ſo called, profeſs
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95657:58"/>
the true God in whom I believe, though by heedleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ignorance, and overmuch confiding in perſons
of whoſe Learning and Piety they have had a high
Opinion, they are blinded with an appearance than
their error tends rather to the honour, then to the
diſhonour of God; and I intend nothing to their
perſonal diſparagement or diſadvantage; for, I
heartily pray and hope they will be aſhamed of it,
and ſorry for it upon future conſideration, as I
my ſelf was, who eſcaped not being infected with
this Hereſie in my yonger dayes, till I had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
knowledge of the falſe grounds and evil ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
thereof: But now knowing what uſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
makes of it in this my Generation to Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour;
I cannot forbear my witneſs againſt it,
when juſt occaſion is offered; though ſome ſay, I
inſiſt on it more then is needful, and to my own
diſadvantage, which I finde true in temporal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
having ſuffered more by them whoſe fierce
Zeal in that <hi>Hereſie</hi> hath made them to perſecute
me in ſecret, then by all my open Enemies: And
I do fore-ſee a poſſibility that their power who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
this Doctrine which I abhor, may hereafter
be ſo prevalent, that if I live to ſee it eſtabliſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their hope, I muſt expect no more favour
in this world until I dye, then heretofore I have
had, unleſs I ſurvive to ſee that <hi>Kingdom</hi> come vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
upon earth, which ſhall utterly deſtroy the
<hi>Myſtical VVhore</hi> and her Daughter the <hi>well-favoured Harlot,</hi> with all thoſe who have been made drunk
by her Cup of Fornications, and worn the <hi>Mark</hi>
of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in their Fore-heads, or in their
hands; yet, I fearing neither <hi>Evils preſent,</hi> or to
<hi>come,</hi> will proceed with what I mean to ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:95657:59"/>
9. It is of evil conſequence to impute that to
God, which common and approved <hi>Reaſon</hi> judgeth
to be unrighteous in men. His works are ſo juſt,
and ſo merciful is he in all his wayes, that there is
no appearance of the contrary. His Juſtice is vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
by the Prophets, againſt that which hath
been objected by that Nation, who had moſt cauſe
to acknowledge both his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi> And
<hi>Davids</hi> confeſſion his ſin, in <hi>Pſal. 51.</hi> as to that
point here treated of, acknowledgeth him to be
<hi>juſtifiable by whomſoever he ſhall be judged.</hi> All
Gods Decrees are perfectly juſt, and whatſoever
he wills is perfectly good. Nevertheleſs, all is not
ſo which men ſhall ſay he hath <hi>Decreed</hi> or <hi>Willed;</hi>
For, many have father'd upon him ſuch <hi>Decrees</hi>
as he never made; ſuch <hi>Ordinances</hi> as he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended; the <hi>Believing, Doing,</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing,</hi>
of ſuch things as were never by Him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
or forbidden; and aſcribed to him ſuch a
<hi>Will</hi> as never did reveal to be His. That, which
they call his <hi>ſecret Will,</hi> who can know, if it be kept
ſecret? and if they know it, how is it then ſecret?
Such imputations as are afore expreſſed, I cannot
believe, becauſe they conſiſt not with his <hi>Honour,
Juſtice,</hi>
and <hi>Mercy,</hi> which are always one with his
<hi>Will,</hi> and his <hi>Will</hi> alwayes the ſame, and not <hi>two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
Wills,</hi> as it is, at leaſt, implied by their Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
who affirm, he hath both a <hi>ſecret</hi> and a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
will,</hi> relating to one and the ſame <hi>Objects,</hi> and
<hi>Qualifications</hi> contradictorily differing from each
other; whereas his <hi>revealed will,</hi> is but a part of
the ſame <hi>will,</hi> kept ſecret till it ſhall be ſeaſonably
made known at full; As when <hi>Jonah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
dayes and Nineveh ſhall be deſtroyed:</hi> for, in theſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95657:59"/>
words there was an implicite condition to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, though not expreſt, as appears by the <hi>event,</hi>
which demonſtrated that, his <hi>Intire will</hi> (whereof
one part preached by <hi>Jonah)</hi> was this, that, <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh
ſhould be deſtroyed within the time limited, if it
repented not;</hi> and the other part concealed, was
this, <hi>That it ſhould not be deſtroyed, if it repented
within forty dayes;</hi> and by what <hi>Jonah</hi> did, by the
Repentance of the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> and their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereupon; it ſeems both he and they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the whole will of God, though but part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was vocally revealed. Therefore, the <hi>School-definition</hi> aforementioned of a <hi>Secret,</hi> and a <hi>Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
will,</hi> relating contradictorily to the ſame things,
and perſons, ſeems fitter to be applied to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures
of <hi>Juglers,</hi> then to the Righteous, Pure,
Single and <hi>Secret will</hi> of Almighty GOD. Yet,
as <hi>Jonah</hi> (though a Prophet) ſeemed more deſirous
that great City ſhould have been deſtroyed, then
his credit loſt by Gods extending Mercy there unto
contrary to the <hi>Verbal Tenor</hi> of his Prophecie;
ſo,
it may be feared, that ſome who teach men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
God foredetermined the greateſt number of
<hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity to everlaſting damnation, would
be as froward as <hi>Jonah,</hi> to have it made evident
they had loſt their credit by preaching falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
in that point; For, aſwel <hi>Goſpel-Preachers,</hi>
as other Good and Pious men, have errors and fits
of diſtemper through humane frailty, from which
it may be hoped they will recover, and repent
heartily what they have miſtaught, as to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
aforeſaid, when it ſhall be made probable, at
leaſt, that many more will be ſaved then condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the <hi>laſt</hi> Judgment, and that they have both
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95657:60"/>
to the diſadvantage of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and to Gods
diſhonour miſrepreſented this <hi>Univerſal act of
Free-grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. It would be a ſuperlative diſhonour, and an
unpardonable indignity, put upon an earthly King,
if his <hi>Officers</hi> ſhould deal with him, as ſome of
Gods pretended <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> have done, in that
which is of higheſt concernment in relation to his
honour, and mans welfare. For, whereas, that
King of kings, hath vouchſafed an univerſal <hi>Act of
Indempnity,</hi> from that guilt whereto all men were
liable by <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion; and m tender
compaſſion and pure love to his <hi>Subjects,</hi> decreed
likewiſe a general pardon, whereby all actual Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
(without excepting either High Treaſon, or other <hi>offences</hi> whatsoever) repenting, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to his Mercy, and ſuing for that pardon, ſhould
freely be forgiven without any other coſts or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of their own; And, whereas this <hi>Indulgence</hi>
hath by his faithful Ambaſſadors and Agents, been
proclaimed throughout the world; ſome other, aſſuming
to themſelves the like Authority, have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through Ignorance, or upon leſs excuſable
inducements, proclaimed that which is almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
deſtructive to that gracious Condeſcention;
telling us, that to teſtifie his abundant love to
<hi>Mankind</hi> in general, and to his eſpecial <hi>Favourites</hi>
in particular, who are known onely to himſelf;
God hath indeed offered <hi>Pardon</hi> to all, that his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in ſparing whomſoever he pleaſed, how wicked
ſoever, might be the more evidenced to them, if
he ſpared not thoſe who were leſs offenders; and,
that though it was his <hi>Revealed will</hi> and pleaſure,
the offer of ſuch a <hi>general Pardon</hi> as aforeſaid
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95657:60"/>
should be divulged, it was nevertheleſs, his <hi>ſecret
will,</hi> that both they to whom he intended benefit
thereby, and they to whom no good was intended,
ſhould be put to the ſame coſt and labour in ſuing
for it, but neither the one or the other be certain
of it, whilſt he lived; Yea, they tell us that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſaid Proclamation was iſſued forth, it was
decreed the greateſt number should be ſo maimed
and diſabled, that it would be impoſſible for them
to perform the conditions required, to make them
capable of the ſaid <hi>Pardon,</hi> which they ſay was
done, to evidence (as they call it) his <hi>juſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
againſt <hi>Vnrighteousness.</hi> And then to beget a
vain hope in their hearers, (or rather to increaſe
the number of thoſe <hi>Clyents,</hi> by whoſe credulity
their Fees and Temporary profit may be augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
theſe Officers further tell them, that the <hi>King</hi>
whom they have thus repreſented, is ſo juſt and
merciful, that notwithſtanding all before expreſſed,
they may make his abſolute <hi>Will and Pleaſure,</hi> their
<hi>Supream law</hi> without danger; and to keep them
in heart (by cheriſhing a belief thereof, until per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
an irrecoverable fit of deſperation ſeizeth on
them) they befool them with a confidence in ſuch
<hi>Marks</hi> of their aſſured <hi>Election,</hi> as may be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
found upon reprobated Hypocrites. This
is the effect of that which many have preached
concerning Gods dealing with Mankind; And,
what can be reaſonably judged of ſuch <hi>Officers,</hi>
and of ſuch dealings? What will all their other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
amount unto, pretended to Gods Honour,
or to the Security and Happineſs of his People,
where they are poyſoned and annihilated by ſuch
Doctrine? Hereby, in my Judgment, it amounts
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95657:61"/>
to that, which is abhominable in the higheſt degree;
and ſo far ſhould I be from confiding in an earthly
Prince, who approved and practiſed ſuch pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy;</hi> or from loving him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then an Enemie; that, if he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
upon me, all that were in his power to beſtow,
yea reſigne his whole Kingdom to me and my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity;
yet, be evidently, unmercifully and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
unjuſt to other innocent men without repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
I ſhould more abhor the memory of him,
notwithſtanding that favour to me, then for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
me to ſuffer cauſleſly at the Gallows, if
he were juſt and merciful to the reſt of his Subjects,
and to all other men. I may perhaps, herein ſeem
over-far tranſported; but, that before expreſſed,
being (as I believe) equivalent to ſuch Doctrine
as is by ſome taught, in relation to God and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
is in my apprehenſion, ſo horrible a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that having ſuch an impulſe as I have upon me,
to bear witneſs againſt it, I deſerved, ſhould I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
it, to be deſerted in my greateſt need, both of
God, and of all good men.</p>
               <p>11. For, whatſoever opinion other-men have
of it, I conceive that all the Idolatries of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
heretofore, in communicating to Men, Beaſts,
or Devils, the Honour and Attributes which are
due to God only, (and the crucifying of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in
the fleſh through Ignorance, added thereunto)
amount not to ſo hainous an offence, as their
crime who are knowingly guilty of this ſin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
it ſeems to me more pardonable, to aſcribe
unto a baſe creature, part of that Honour which
is due to God, then to impute that unto him,
which is proper to none but to the moſt wicked of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95657:61"/>
all his creatures, who being by him created good,
became depraved by his own malitious default:
And, I am hopeful, that ſo many as have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
miſled into this Hereſie by Ignorance only
(or by overmuch truſt in humane Authority) and
not more afraid to take ſhame unto themſelves for
their errors, before men of their own Judgment,
then to continue in them without fear of Gods
diſpleaſure, will better conſider hereafter, what
they ought to believe and teach in relation to Gods
<hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy;</hi> and that all their own <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi>
and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> will not conduce ſo much
to their comfort and reputation, as their unfeigned
Repentance, and Acknowledgment of this Error.
I will ask no pardon of them who ſhall think I need
one for this extravagant zeal, becauſe I know whoſe
honour it concerns; what warrant I have to expreſs
it; and what need there is of ſuch plain dealing in
this matter, and in this manner at this time. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
alſo, that God now furniſhed me with means
of ſubſiſtence when the world had left me leſs then
nothing, of that which I lately had; and ſpared my
life when ſo many thouſands fell round about me,
that once more before I die I might thus bear testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
againſt this <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> which God more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors,
then all thoſe Errors reproved in the ſeven
Churches of <hi>Asia.</hi> For, the <hi>devil</hi> who is Author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
having inſinuated it into the 7 <hi>Reformed Churches</hi>
of <hi>Europe,</hi> hath in ſubtlety permitted the Profeſſors
of his <hi>Antichriſtian Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> to deteſt it,
that by their holding a part of <hi>Truth</hi> in Vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the wickedneſs of that <hi>Mystery</hi> might be the
leſs ſuſpected (as he thought his <hi>designe</hi> would be,
when he acknowledged <hi>Jesus</hi> to be the Son of God)
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95657:62"/>
and his policy hath not been without an ill effect, in
regard it hath given ſome an occaſion to call that
<hi>Truth</hi> Popery, which was not onely profeſſed before
Popery had a Being, but is alſo the foundation of
all <hi>ſaving Truths,</hi> revealed ever ſince the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world.</p>
               <p>12. They who ſhall take notice of ſo much as is
revealed by Gods <hi>VVord</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> to give an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
that he hath no <hi>ſecret will</hi> contradictory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
what he hath <hi>revealed,</hi> (though he keeps hidden
ſo much thereof, as fleſh and blood is not yet capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of), may ſo juſtifie God in his uprightneſs, as to
the <hi>Love</hi> which is by him profeſſed to <hi>mankinde,</hi>
that, he may without ſcruple ſubmit to him, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
concerns his happineſs, both in this world
and that which is to come: For, whoſoever is true
and upright towards him in his truſt and love, ſo far
as he may be capable thereof, ſhould finde <hi>Hell</hi> to
be a <hi>Heaven</hi> if he were there; and that <hi>Heaven</hi>
would be a <hi>Hell</hi> unto him, if he could poſſibly get
thither with <hi>ſelf-confidence,</hi> and with his own <hi>Natural
will;</hi> becauſe, it is not the <hi>place</hi> wherein we are, that
can make us happy or unhappy, but that which we
carry thither within our ſelves. Yet, I would have
no man in theſe concernments, truſt to me, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other farther then he hath aſſurance in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
by the ſame <hi>witneſſes;</hi> for the <hi>Light within us</hi>
may deceive, though atteſted by all <hi>humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities</hi>
without the <hi>VVord;</hi> yea, and the <hi>VVord
written,</hi> hath ſuch variety of ſenſes, and Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
put upon it, that, it muſt be aſcertained by the
<hi>Spirit</hi> alſo; and every <hi>Spirit</hi> tryed by the <hi>VVord,</hi>
with a conſcientious heed, how every part thereof
may agree together in one ſence without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95657:62"/>
for ſome words wherewith we are beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted;
even in our Mother-tongue, have ſuch
various ſignifications, that I am forced to many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
circumlocutions to prevent miſunderſtanding,
and yet am often miſunderſtood. But by the
<hi>Lights</hi> aforementioned united together, I having
examined the <hi>Objections,</hi> and <hi>anſwers</hi> of diſſenting
Parties, am ſo infallibly convinced of the <hi>Oneneſs</hi>
and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Gods <hi>will;</hi> as alſo, that he hath
no reſpect or diſreſpect of <hi>Perſons</hi> without regard
to their <hi>qualifications,</hi> that I know he hath neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
or conſtrained none to be wicked; that, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probateth
no <hi>Righteous man,</hi> who wilfully diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
not to be Righteous; or any <hi>wicked man,</hi> who
abhors and finally forſakes his wickedneſſ; or any
whoſoever, who doth not wittingly, wilfully, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightfully,
and finally ſin againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi>
which ſo ſtrengthens my belief of his perfect <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy;</hi> and ſo inclines me to love
him with all my heart, and with all my ſtrength, that in
all things I can abſolutely, without the leaſt ſcruple,
pray and ſay unto him, <hi>Thy will be done in earth, as it
is in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. To confirm me and others in this free Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
of our <hi>wills</hi> to the <hi>VVill</hi> of God revealed in
his <hi>VVord;</hi> I may add this out of my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(and I hope it is a ſanctified experience) which
perhaps may have as good effects on ſome other, as
it hath had on me. Our <hi>Natural will,</hi> as it ſtands
inclinable, when it hath no better guide then the
<hi>ſingle Light</hi> within us, is uſually carried on ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
to accompliſh the fulfilling thereof, even as
to things which are good in themſelves, that, they
may have an evil conſequence. This appears by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95657:63"/>
theſe particular Inſtances; we may have a <hi>will</hi> to be
endowed with the beſt <hi>Spiritual Gifts;</hi> to be
righteous according to the ſtrictneſs of the <hi>Moral
Law;</hi> To be patient and conſtant in ſufferings; to
be careleſs of the preferments, riches and pleaſures
of this world, to be eminent in the mortifying of
the fleſh by faſting and penances voluntarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone;
to be frequent in hearing, praying and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
performances of pious Duties, with ſuch like,
thereupon perſwading our ſelves we do it to ſerve,
pleaſe and honour God; and that thereby we merit
his Favour: whereas, if we narrowly, examine our
hearts, we ſhall finde, perhaps, that our principal
aim, proceeded from <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> and to acquire thereby
a <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and perfection of our own, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to reſt and glory; and that we deſire not ſo much
to be conformable (according to our proportion)
unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his obedience and ſufferings, (not of
pure Love to him) as that we might be ſharers with
him in the meritoriouſneſs thereof; falſly ſuppoſing
his <hi>obedience, righteouſneſs &amp; ſufferings</hi> would not be
ſufficiently ſatisfactory without our doing and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
ſuch things in our own perſons, to compleat
our <hi>juſtification.</hi> This, if we be not heedful, will
lye hid in our hearts, when we profeſs the contrary
with our mouths; And I have often obſerved, as well
in my ſelf as in others, that this may puff us up with a
<hi>ſpirit of prides,</hi> to ſuch a high conceit of our ſelves,
and beget in us ſuch an uncharitable or low eſteem of
others, that when we ſeem to be purged from groſs
<hi>carnal ſins,</hi> we may be polluted with <hi>ſpiritual wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes,</hi>
more miſchievous unto our ſouls; becauſe,
they not appearing to be ſo ſinful as they are, will
be the more difficultly repented, and we the more
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95657:63"/>
hardly diſinſnared from them: For I have heeded
that many being intangled by theſe, having run
through the profeſſion and practice of the Doctrines
and Diſciplines of moſt <hi>Sects,</hi> to get the repute of a
<hi>ſupereminent Sanctity,</hi> could never ſettle any where
until they fell back again into the pollutions of the
fleſh in a more groſs manner then at firſt; or elſe
ſtumbled into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which admits
them gladly; becauſe, the ambition of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
is the ſame, and their <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>
depends very much on their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>14. Many ſuch <hi>Vertigoes</hi> and <hi>Impoſtures,</hi> I have
in my time heard of, and ſeen acted by <hi>ſelf-will'd perſons</hi>
pretending to extraordinary <hi>Revelations,</hi>
which had no ground, but their own Fancies and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verweening.
One ſuppoſing himſelf called to gather
together the diſperſed <hi>Jews,</hi> and carry them into
<hi>Paleſtine</hi> their ancient Inheritance, hath to that end
made ridiculous preparations. Another of no
mean parts, had fancied a certain day in which <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſhould be ſeen coming again in the Clouds, &amp; got up
into a high place the better to behold his approach;
having forgotten that it was ſaid his <hi>ſecond coming</hi>
ſhould be <hi>like the Lightning out of the Eaſt, ſhining
into the Weſt.</hi> A woman, blaſphemouſly termed her
ſelf the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and found ſome fooliſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
ſo to repute her. Another, would be thought
the <hi>VVoman in the VVilderneſs,</hi> mentioned in the
Revelation of St. <hi>John,</hi> fleeing thither from the
<hi>Dragon;</hi> others, infatuated by the like ſpirit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,
have gone naked through the ſtreets, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
publick Aſſemblies, to be ſignal to the Nation.
Two, lately aſſumed the Title and Office of the <hi>two
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95657:64"/>
VVitneſſes,</hi> propheſied of in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and
had giddy followers, though they brought no teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
thereof, but ſuch vanities as deſerved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Another, was perſwaded to be the <hi>Angel</hi>
flying through the midſt of heaven, to preach
the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel;</hi> and we had one, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
wickedly to perſonate <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Yea,
whilſt I was writing theſe <hi>Meditations,</hi> I was viſited
by a perſon (in other reſpects, ſober and of good
underſtanding) who profeſſing her ſelf to be guided
by no Example or Rule (but what was inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
unto her) told me ſhe was aſſured by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that ſhe ſhould be the greateſt ſufferer that ever
was in the world; and indeed, if all be true which
ſhe declared unto me, of her ſufferings many years
by voluntary watchings, faſtings, cold, hunger,
nakedneſs, and pilgrimages into forraign parts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any proviſion, for her paſſage or ſupport, which
ſo multiplied her ſufferings, that (as ſhe ſaid) the
<hi>Spaniſh Inquiſitors,</hi> in whoſe power ſhe then was,
told her that ſhe ſhould be reputed one of the moſt
glorious <hi>Saints</hi> in her time, if ſhe would caſt her ſelf
into the boſome of their <hi>Church,</hi> as they perſwaded
her to do. And it appeared by her own expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that a ſecret <hi>ſpiritual pride,</hi> made her to glory
in thoſe <hi>voluntary</hi> ſufferings, as more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on then <hi>Chriſts.</hi> But, I hope this ſpirit of
deluſion will be caſt out of her, when ſhe is better
informed; for by truſting to <hi>falſe lights,</hi> and by
admitting a ſelf-merit, of being divinely illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
and called to the higheſt Form of <hi>Sanctity,</hi>
not onely produceth a melancholly madneſs,
and many wicked fooleries, to the ſcandalizing of
<hi>Piety,</hi> with the ſincere profeſſors thereof; and, to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95657:64"/>
the advancement of the <hi>myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> whoſe
abetters do ſecretly ſowe and cheriſh the ſeeds
of Impoſtures, every where, to that end.</p>
               <p>15. Nevertheleſs, we muſt not exclude theſe out
of our charitable hope and care, nor diſaffect their
perſons, though we approve not their follies: For,
even the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> miſapprehended the nature of
<hi>Chriſts Kingdom</hi> until they were perfectly inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and affected <hi>vain ſuperiority,</hi> as it ſeems by the
Sons of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> when they got their good old
Mother to intreat their <hi>Maſter,</hi> that, <hi>one of them
might ſit at his right hand, and the other at his left;</hi>
yea, they were tempted by the <hi>ſpirit of perſecution,</hi>
when they would have had fire called down from
Heaven; and God doth now as heretofore permit
errors, and vouchſafe ſignal cautionary diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(as the ſins and errors of the times require) to
be ſometimes perſonated, by his ſervants, in ſuch
manner, that, they ſeem ridiculous and offenſive to
good men, and are in the Kingdom of this world,
reputed Fools and Phanaticks. Theſe things I have
ſo well conſidered, that I am afraid to indulge my
own <hi>will,</hi> ſo far forth, as to pray abſolutely for thoſe
lawful things which are moſt pleaſing to my fleſh,
and ſeem very pertinent to my natural <hi>well-being,</hi>
becauſe I finde not my ſelf wiſe enough to know
how much either of <hi>ſufferings</hi> or <hi>eaſe</hi> are beſt for me;
or what I might well uſe, or abuſe, if I ſhould be
mine own chuſer. Therefore, I pray abſolutely for
nothing, ſave Gods Grace, but, bound my Petitions
with this Clauſe, <hi>Thy Will be done.</hi> And this is now
made eaſie, becauſe (as I have often profeſſed) I
want nothing, with a repining ſence of want, ſo
long as God is pleaſed to with-hold it from me; in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95657:65"/>
regard, I am ſure he knows what is beſt for me, and
hath love enough to vouchſafe it in that meaſure,
and at that time, wherein it ſhall ſo be. I naturally
feel pains, and deſire eaſe as much as other men;
I perceive as well as they when my Field wants
Rain, or fair weather; am as deſirous of thoſe
good gifts, whereby I might benefit my ſelf or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and cannot root out of my heart a natural
deſire of <hi>deſirable Objects;</hi> yet I permit not my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be further inclinable thereto, then ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
with Gods <hi>Will;</hi> and am aſſured it is then more
acceptable, then when we have no temptation or
deſire to the contrary: For, what <hi>obedience</hi> is there
in him who ſhuns thoſe forbidden things which he
naturally abhors to do? or in him, who is conſtantly
obedient to thoſe commands onely which he is
moſt inclinable to do? There is more ſubmiſſion
due to Gods Will then this; even an abſolute ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
in that whereto our natural will is moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
prone. And God hath ſo far forth freed the
<hi>will</hi> of every Man born of a Woman, ever ſince it
was promiſed, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman ſhould
break the Serpents head,</hi> That, by his promiſed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
Grace (which never ſhall be wanting to them
who ask it in Faith) he may not withſtanding any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
power in the <hi>Devil,</hi> or any irreſiſtible defect
in himſelf, conform to the <hi>Will of God,</hi> when by his
<hi>VVord</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> the choice of <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil, death,</hi>
or <hi>life</hi> is to him offered: For, if it be not ſo, man can
have in him no more <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> then a
ſtone. This I believe, and all they who believe this,
are in a good forwardneſs; toward ſubmitting their
<hi>will</hi> to Gods.</p>
               <p>16. How Gods <hi>will may be done by us on earth, as
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95657:65"/>
it is in heaven,</hi> according to our meaſure, I wil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to demonſtrate as well as I can. We may
collect from his <hi>holy VVord,</hi> being interpreted by
his holy <hi>Spirit</hi> (which makes no part repugnant to
the whole and main ſcope thereof) that, when the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come to a perfect manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon <hi>Earth,</hi> the VVill of God will be there as
perfectly fulfilled as in <hi>heaven;</hi> becauſe all the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
of that Kingdom, being <hi>One</hi> with the <hi>King</hi>
thereof, and the whole extent of it with all therein
(though infinite) being ſeen in him, (and fully
known to all) the <hi>will</hi> of every Creature ſhall be
ſwallowed up in his, and, he be <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all.</hi> This ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible
<hi>Myſtery</hi> cannot be fully demonſtrated
to our apprehenſion, as we now are: So much onely
we are capable of, as that we may know the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
of our own <hi>will,</hi> with the hazzards of adhering
thereto, and become thereby inclinable to reſigne
our ſelves to God, at firſt perhaps through fear, and
at laſt for love. But when that manifeſtation comes,
they who are of his houſhold and Kingdom, will
abhor every thing, how pretious ſoever it hath
been, that may divide or take up any part of that
love, which is due to their heavenly Father; hate
all who love him not, as perfectly as natural men
hate their perſonal Enemies; renounce all things, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
themſelves, if cauſe be, for his ſake, with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
may not conſiſt with the purity and glory of
that Kingdom. They being all of one Minde, there
will be no diſputes as now, about <hi>Doctrines</hi> and
<hi>Diſciplines,</hi> no arrogating an exorbitant judging
power over perſons and Cauſes, whereof they
have neither perfect cognizance, nor lawful juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
no ſuch unneceſſary arguings as are here
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95657:66"/>
concerning <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> or whether <hi>Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
be before <hi>Faith,</hi> with ſuch like trifling Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
as have not a little diſturbed the Peace and
Concord, which ought to be preſerved; For
though <hi>Spiritual Graces</hi> appear to have precedency
in time, one before the other, in regard we cannot
take notice of ſuch Objects one view, or in what
order they are wrought within us; Yet, all that
which is by degrees manifeſted in time, as pertinent
to our <hi>Spiritual well-being,</hi> is in one moment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in us by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as the <hi>Soul</hi> is toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the <hi>Body</hi> in the womb of a Woman.
When the <hi>Kingdom</hi> we look for is come upon
Earth, there will be no ſuch <hi>diſtinct Intereſts</hi> as are
now here. All things will be <hi>common</hi> in a more
excellent manner, then in the times of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi>
and no ſuch Self-ſeekings and Hypocriſie as
was then diſcovered in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
as it is myſtically expreſſed in the <hi>Revelation</hi>
of St. <hi>John,</hi> the very pavement of the City of
our King, will be pure and tranſparent gold;
which preſignified (as I conceive) that all mens
walkings will be then perfectly undefiled, and ſo
viſibly made known to be ſuch, that none ſhall be
diſtruſtful of each others Integrity; An univerſal
Love ſhall cement together inſeparably, every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stone of that building; Yea, a Love exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all the Fear, Jealouſie, and Envie, which
might imbitter their Injoyments and Affections, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom that Kingdom is come: For, though there
will be a differing Glory, (as among the Stars which
excel one another) the leaſt ſhall be as fully and as
highly contented with his meaſure of Joy, and his
degree of exaltation, as he that is greateſt; and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95657:66"/>
every one take as much pleaſure in the Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of others, as in his own. Much more might
be ſaid, to this purpoſe, and to give ſome hints,
whereby it may be known of what Nature this
<hi>Kingdom</hi> is, and when it is come into us; But,
this and that which the Spirit of God will further
dictate as need ſhall require, will be ſufficient to
raiſe an apprehenſion to make us confident, that
when his Kingdom comes upon Earth, <hi>his will ſhall
be here done, as it is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. Nevertheleſs, it ſeems impoſſible to ſome
that the <hi>Will</hi> of God ſhould be fulfilled in <hi>Earth,</hi>
as it is in <hi>Heaven;</hi> and ſo it would be, unleſs it ſhall
he more gloriouſly manifeſted, then either now or
heretofore; and we ſhould not have been taught
ſo to pray, if it were not to be expected in another
mode. <hi>Our Father</hi> had the ſame <hi>Kingdom</hi> upon
Earth, from the firſt Creation thereof; and the
Reign of his <hi>Anoynted</hi> Son was more viſible when
he firſt came in the fleſh, then in preceding Ages.
But it is ſaid to be a <hi>Kingdom yet to come,</hi> in regard of
that more evident manifeſtation which it ſhall ſtill
have from time to time, and eſpecially after the
ſix <hi>Myſtical Dayes,</hi> of a thouſand years a piece are
finiſhed. During that ſpace, the <hi>Devil</hi> called the
<hi>Prince of this world</hi> (and his <hi>Vicegerents</hi>) are to
exerciſe a power by Divine permiſſion, that the
<hi>evil</hi> whereof our <hi>firſt Parents</hi> deſired Knowledg,
might be as far forth made known to their whole
Poſterity, as might be permitted, with preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>humane Nature</hi> from being utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;
And, that, when the <hi>great Sabbath of
Years</hi> came, the Beauty and Perfection of GOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS,
might be thereby the more Illuſtrated, as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95657:67"/>
the <hi>Day</hi> is by the darkneſs of the <hi>Night;</hi> and as
well known to <hi>Mankind</hi> as <hi>evil</hi> hath been, and
ſhall be experimentally manifeſted before the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
week</hi> is compleated: For though the <hi>Devil</hi>
lied when he tempted the Son of God, with an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
of all the Kingdoms of the Earth, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>all thoſe were given unto him;</hi> Yet, ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Truth may ſeem to have been therein,
if we conſider what Arbitrary power his <hi>Vicegerents</hi>
have Arrogated and Exerciſed, by their being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable
to none in this life, for their Miſ-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments:
For many of them, have been the moſt
wicked men in the world; chief Actors in bringing
the knowledg of <hi>evil</hi> to perfection, by making it
as well <hi>felt,</hi> as <hi>intelligibly known;</hi> and <hi>They</hi> and
the <hi>Nations</hi> under their Governments, have mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
ſo corrupted each other, that, the greateſt
benefit we have now hope of by their <hi>Counſels,
Reaſons of State,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Actings,</hi> is this;
their <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> ere long will be ſo fully Ripe, that
it will bring hither that <hi>King and Kingdom,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we ſhall perfectly know and enjoy that GOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS,
which will root all wickedneſs out of the
Earth; and perhaps be an occaſion of cutting that
time of their Tyrannie ſomewhat ſhorter then it
might elſe have been, according to that Scripture
where it is ſaid, that the dayes of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> laſt
cruelty, ſhould be ſhortned for the ſake of his
<hi>Elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. The <hi>Kingdom</hi> we pray for, now is, and hath
been in ſome proportion, both viſibly and inviſibly
upon the Earth in all Ages, and his will there
done according to the ſimilitude expreſſed in this
Prayer, and in the Children thereof, ſo far forth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95657:67"/>
as they were and are capable; And, whereas it is
ſaid, <hi>When Chriſt cometh, ſhall he finde faith upon
Earth?</hi> (as it may alſo be queſtioned, whether
when he cometh, he ſhall find in any man an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Reſignation of his will to GODS) It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
not (in my underſtanding) either an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Nagative or Affirmative; but that he ſhall then
finde both Faith and Self-denial in ſome: For as
there is an Old Will, and an Old Earth, by Nature
in man, which he had from <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo, there is
alſo a <hi>New Earth,</hi> and a <hi>New Heaven</hi> or will in
man, partly come (and more perfectly to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, and into the world, by <hi>Chriſt</hi>) between
whom there is and ſhall be a continual warfare,
until <hi>Chriſts</hi> perſonal coming. They in whom the
firſt natural Earthlyneſs and <hi>will,</hi> are predominant,
ſhall have no ſuch <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>willingneſs</hi> found in them
when <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes; But, he ſhall then find both
ſuch a <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Will</hi> as is expected, in all
thoſe into whom that <hi>new Earth,</hi> and that <hi>new
Heaven</hi> is come, which is predicted in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to St. <hi>John;</hi> for that is a myſtical Expreſſion
of that Kingdom, which ſhall deſcend both into
our <hi>Microcoſme,</hi> or little World, and appear
gloriouſly in this great World. Into this Kingdom
there ſhall enter no imperfect, or unclean thing;
the Glory and Honour of all <hi>Nations,</hi> ſhall be
brought into it. The fearful, whoſe cowardiſe
makes them Apoſtatize in perſecution, Unbelievers,
Murtherers, Whoremongers, Sorcerers, Idolaters
and Liers, ſhall be ſhut out of it; for, this <hi>Kingdom</hi>
ſhall not need, as do the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of this <hi>world,</hi>
to be ſupported, by publiſhing Lies, by depreſſing
Truths, by Diſſemblings, falſe Accuſations, Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95657:68"/>
Perjuries, Oppreſſions, and ſuch like. The
<hi>City</hi> and Royal Palace thereof, ſhall be more
ſtrongly fortified, and more gloriouſly beautified,
then we are able to imagine, or conceive, by all
thoſe excellent Metaphorical Alluſions to the moſt
precious Earthly things, whereby St. <hi>John</hi> (as is
before hinted) hath endeavoured to raiſe us up to
ſome apprehenſion by <hi>Faith,</hi> which cannot be made
known ſo excellent as it is, by any <hi>VVords,</hi> or
natural Demonſtrations. <hi>Our Father,</hi> the King of
Righteouſneſs, even the <hi>Lord GOD Almighty,</hi>
is ſole King thereof, to whom we may with that
perfect <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> which caſteth out <hi>Fear,</hi> ſay,
<hi>Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven;</hi> which
ſhort <hi>Petition</hi> comprehends all that is contained in
this brief <hi>Prayer,</hi> relating either to God or our ſelves,
as this Prayer contains implicitely, all that is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to be prayed for, by the moſt exact Publike
<hi>Liturgies,</hi> and by all the Prayers of every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and Individual perſon upon Earth. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
remember this, that though this is ſo
Univerſal a Prayer as aforeſaid, and though God
knows what we want before we ask it; yet our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
upon particulars is neceſſary, to keep us
mindful of our duties to God, heedful of thoſe
wants which we have in our ſelves, and diligent
upon all occaſions, to ſeek and ask ſupply from
him only, in <hi>VVords</hi> and <hi>Muſings,</hi> regulated by
this Prayer; believing that we have attained to
the higheſt perfection attainable in this life, when
we can ſay unfeignedly, <hi>Thy will be done in Earth,
as it is in Heaven.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Give us this day, our daily bread, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>1. NOw I come to thoſe <hi>Petitions,</hi> that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
concern our ſelves; which we are
never ſo ſure to obtain, as when we have firſt
ſought the <hi>Kingdom of heaven;</hi> for, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
it upon that condition, and I have had a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
experience of his faithful performance, though
I have been a very negligent <hi>Seeker.</hi> Therefore,
that, we looſe not our labours, when we come to
be Petitioners for what is deficient as to our ſolves;
I wiſh we might all turn true <hi>Seekers.</hi> In the firſt
of theſe three following Petitions, we ask that
which is neceſſary to preſerve our ſubſiſtence and
well-being in Soul and Body: In the ſecond Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we pray for the pardon of our <hi>Debts</hi> and
<hi>Treſpaſſes:</hi> In the third and laſt, for <hi>deliverance</hi>
from <hi>temptations,</hi> and from thoſe <hi>Evils</hi> which they
may elſe bring upon us. In the few words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the firſt of theſe <hi>Petitions</hi> conſiſts, many things
are offered to conſideration. Firſt, that God our
heavenly Father is the <hi>general Provider</hi> and Restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of all good and neceſſary things; for, we are not
taught to pray unto one who hath not wherewith
to ſupply our wants, <hi>The earth is the Lords, with all
the fulneſs thereof:</hi> He giveth meat unto all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95657:69"/>
in due ſeaſon, opening his hand, and filling
them with that which is good. None of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
needs to deſpair, or ſeek unto his Enemies for
relief; or, to ſupply their wants, by evil or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means. For, he feedeth Sparrows, which are of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
value; and Lyons, and Ravens, when they are
hungry; yea, <hi>Tyrants</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſors;</hi> how much
more then, will he feed his own <hi>Children,</hi> when
they ask for Bread? We are not to pray for it as
due by merit, but to obtain it in <hi>free Alms:</hi> Nor
are we to ask it (as the Prodigal Son did his) for a
<hi>Childe's portion:</hi> For, that was intruſted with our
<hi>Firſt-Parents,</hi> who ſpent it, and left us more in debt,
then we had ever been able co pay, and liable to
have been everlaſting Slaves and Priſoners, if our
Eldeſt brother had not ſet us free; which obligeth
us to perpetual thankfulneſs, and unfeigned Love;
For, the Prodigals <hi>Elder brother</hi> was not ſo kinde
to him. VVe have alſo obtained (beſides our ſhare
in a <hi>joynt Stock</hi>) perſonal individual Portions,
from our Heavenly Father by his <hi>Mediation,</hi> to
ſupply that which we loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> with an invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Overplus. This we have ſo badly husbanded
by our own defaults, and live alſo among ſo many
Thieves, and Cheaters, that we are every day in
danger to be undone, and ſtarved both in Body and
Soul, if we had not ſo kinde a <hi>Father,</hi> and ſo
loving a <hi>Brother,</hi> perpetually making Interceſſion
for us. It behoves us therefore to be very heedful
that we wilfully diſpleaſe not this gratious <hi>Father,</hi>
and loving <hi>Brother,</hi> by preferring the meat that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth
before that <hi>ſuper-ſubſtantial Bread</hi> of Life
which came from Heaven, and was broken for our
nouriſhment here upon earth; and may be obtained
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95657:69"/>
for asking. We ought to take heed alſo, that we
diſhonour him not as our Firſt-Parents did by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
his Enemies, or by ſeeking to them, or to
ſuch falſe gods as men often make unto themſelves,
or ſeek unto him by <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> (not by him
accepted for <hi>Mediators</hi>) to obtain our needful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
to the undervaluing of his Sons Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
leſt when we ſtand in greateſt need, his, and
our <hi>Father</hi> juſtly turn us away in diſpleaſure, as
he did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to thoſe Idols: in whom they
truſted.</p>
               <p>2. Then, whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Give us this day our daily
bread,</hi> I take notice from theſe words <hi>this day,</hi> that
we are every day obliged to make our Addreſſes to
God, for ſuch things as are <hi>daily</hi> needful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
the Emphaſis of the ſaid words imply; as alſo, that
according to our Saviours counſel, we ſhould not
perplex our ſelves with a vexatious caring for the
<hi>time to come,</hi> in regard every day brings care e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to provide for the neceſſities thereof. Ye the
intended not thereby, that we ſhould be negligent,
in adding our endeavours to Gods providence, he
offering opportunities, honeſtly to inlarge his gifts
beyond the preſent days want; on in laying up that
ſurpluſage to make proviſion for future neceſſities
and contingencies, or for thoſe of our Relations, or
others who are unable to provide for themſelves, or
of getting wherewithall to diſtribute relief to
them, for whoſe ſakes he doth make us his <hi>Stewards,</hi>
in that which he giveth over and above our <hi>daily
bread:</hi> For it is the Will of God, that we ſhould
make uſe of the preſent day, without vexations
care; to husband well our Talents and Callings; to
improve Gods daily Bleſſings, not onely to ſupply
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95657:70"/>
our perſonal neceſſites; but that we might have
ſomewhat alſo of that which God gives us over and
above our <hi>daily Bread,</hi> to be diſpenſed by our hands
to thoſe whom he intendeth to relieve by our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
in imitation of his Univerſal Love, who vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth
Rain both on the juſt and unjuſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
(though we ſhould be merciful in the firſt
place to them of his <hi>houſhold</hi>) that in their extream
wants, we ſhould extend our charity even to the
worſt of men: And we finde by experience that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
and kindneſſes to thoſe who knew they had
deſerved none from us, but the contrary rather, do
work ſometimes more upon them toward the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of their manners, then Reproofs or good
Counſel: For, though we are not to give holy
things, or the Childrens bread to Dogs; yet they
who ſeem worthy of no more regard then Dogs, are
not utterly to be neglected, (becauſe many of them
have a precious Seed in them hidden from others)
as appears by the <hi>Canaanitiſh woman,</hi> who beſought
him for her daughter vexed with a <hi>Devil,</hi> and by his
deportment toward her; for, after his <hi>Diſciples</hi> had
affronted her with diſreſpect, and he provoked her by
making ſhew of neglect alſo; yet he granted her
deſire with a ſingular approbation of her Faith,
<hi>John</hi> 15. 22. We enough likewiſe to be heedful, that
not ſo much as the Crums or Fragments of what
God giveth us, may be caſt away; or ſpoiled by our
negligence or improvidence, when we our ſelves
are full; becauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the leaſt of his Mercies are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that which we deſpiſe may be both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
and acceptable to ſome; therefore, our
<hi>Saviour</hi> commanded the broken meat remaining of
thoſe few Loaves and two Fiſhes, where with he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95657:70"/>
had fed ſo many thouſands ſhould be gathered up,
that nothing might be loſt.</p>
               <p>3. I obſerve from this word <hi>Give,</hi> that we muſt
not onely expect what we ask for of free gift as
aforeſaid, and not as merited, but crave it in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
alſo, as needy beggers ought to do; for, a
proud begger is abominable, and few will given an
Almes to him, that asks with inſolence and pride;
nor will beggers always ask that with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
meekneſs, which they know is abſolutely
due unto them, and unjuſtly detained. This <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit,</hi> implies with
what ſence of our nakedneſs, and with what ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
poverty of minde, we ought to petition our
<hi>Father;</hi> and theſe words annexed, <hi>Theirs is the
Kingdom of heaven, Matth.</hi> 5. 3. demonſtrate that
there is no humane Rhetorick more prevalent
with him. They will moſt humbly pray, moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
ſeek, and moſt earneſtly knock (that iſ, do
all things juſtly pertinent to an obtaining of what
they want) who know the ſupplying of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
muſt proceed meerly from the Bounty or
Charity of the <hi>Giver;</hi> and that he who will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
for his daily bread, ſo far forth as he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when he wants it, is not priviledged to eat by
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Rule and Practice; and what can we
do leſs toward it, then humbly to ask it? The ſame
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi> though he did perform the works of his
Miniſtry freely (for which things neceſſary were
due from them whoſe benefit was thereby intended)
wrought with his own hands to ſupply what was
wanting, rather then he would be over burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome;
or take ought from them, who deſpiſing his
Miniſtry, made themſelves unworthy to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95657:71"/>
among his Benefactors. He to whom we are
hereby taught to pray, never neglects to give his
Children what they have need of, unleſs it be to
prevent or cure ſome other Defects, which would
have worſe conſequences, then the lack of ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
for a while: And though he then lets us to
bite on the Bridle, yet when be findes us to be ſo
ſenſible of our defects, that we reſlove to ſeek unto
him, he meets us as did the Prodigal Sons Father,
and is ready to give before we ask. I was young,
and am now older then <hi>David</hi> was, yet can ſay as
truely as he, <hi>I never ſaw the Righteous forſaken, or
their ſeed begging bread:</hi> That is, I never ſaw them
ſo forſaken, as to be left ſo comfortleſs in their
greateſt wants, to make begging their refuge as
common beggers do, reſolving to live Idlely by
begging or Healing onely. Such, for the moſt
part are extreamly wicked in their lives and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations;
Curſers, Swearers, Malitious, Envious,
Rayling and Snarling at each other, where they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for Alms, like Dogs quarrelling for bones, yea,
grumbling and returning curriſh language, even to
thoſe who relieve them, if they anſwer not their
unreaſonable expectations. Yet, theſe muſt not be
ſo neglected as they are, but (as <hi>David</hi> counſelleth)
wiſely to be conſidered, not onely to preſerve them
from periſhing, who are unable to provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but to provide means whereby they who are
unable to work, may not live in fluttiſh idleneſs and
careleſneſs; for, our <hi>heavenly Father,</hi> denieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to any of his Children, but when he knows
they ask it, to be continued in idleneſs, or to ſatisfie
their luſts rather then to imploy it to his honour
and the comfort of their brethren, according as they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95657:71"/>
shall be able. He feeds the Fowls of the Air, though
they neither Plow nor Sow; but, they ſeek their
meat according to the means which he hath given
them ſo to do; he likewiſe Clothes the Lilies and
Flowers of the Fields with glorious colours; but
they, without reſiſtance of his Will, are paſſive
(though not active) in permitting providence to
act upon them what he pleaſeth toward their vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
<hi>being</hi> and <hi>adorning;</hi> in which reſpects, they
are inſtanced (as I conceive) for a ſymbolical repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of that abſolute obedience, which is in the
<hi>Saints,</hi> and in thoſe <hi>Seeds of Grace,</hi> which are in
them to fructifie for Gods Glory, and toward their
own perfection.</p>
               <p>4. Moreover, the Emphaſis which I apprehend
to be in theſe words, <hi>this day,</hi> hints unto us, not
onely this <hi>Caution,</hi> that we take all lawful opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to improve Gods daily Bleſſings, and to
diſpence our Charity as occaſions are offered; but
alſo, not to defer it until another day; becauſe we
know not what ſhall be to morrow; or whether
we have one other day to live. Many fair advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
are loſt by procraſtination, never to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
and yet through want of conſideration,
many often defer the doing of their duties, when
they have neither leſs nor more benefit thereby;
which demonſtrates their ſottiſhneſs, who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
inclinable. By thoſe words in the <hi>Original,</hi> which
are interpreted <hi>Daily bread,</hi> I underſtand all things
whatſoever to be thereby intended, and included,
which are pertinent to the preſervation of our
Souls and Bodies; for <hi>Bread</hi> is called the <hi>Staff of
Life;</hi> and if I thought it needful to be evidenced by
particular Texts, I could make it appear that not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95657:72"/>
onely all external neceſſaries are by holy Scripture
intended by <hi>Bread,</hi> but that the ſpiritual nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our Souls are called the <hi>Bread of Life.</hi>
Yea, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>I am the Bread of
Life, which came down from Heaven; whereof if
any man eateth, he shall live for ever;</hi> and, <hi>the Bread
which I will give it my Fleſh, which I will give for
the Life of the world,</hi> &amp;c. I cannot therefore think,
when he preſcribed this <hi>From of Prayer,</hi> but that
he intended we ſhould ask this Bread, rather then
the <hi>Common-bread,</hi> or ſuch outward things as are
thereby ſignified; for doubtleſs, he who knew what
moſt concerned us, did principally intend this Bread
ſhould be prayed for, as that, which will bring
with it all other things neceſſary, both for our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
and everlaſting <hi>well-being. But O God!
how many of us do minde ſo much eartbly material
Bread, and thoſe other things which fleſh and blood
are moſt affected withall, (when we offer up this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
that we have no thought of that Bread, which
muſt preſerve our ſouls and bodies to eternal Life!
How few care to know or heed what is contained in this
pretious Catholicon! And how is it neglected and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derprized,
as a Form of Prayer fitting none but Ideots
and Children, even by ſome pretending to Piety!</hi> I
take in, and put forth, that which is offered by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
upon this <hi>Prayer,</hi> as it comes into my heart,
and not remembring all that I have written, may
perhaps inſiſt other while more then once upon the
ſame <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Cautions;</hi> but, that I hope ſhall
not be excepted againſt, for ſuch Iterations are very
frequent in the writings of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> yet not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
in regard as well our heedleſneſs of what
is ſpoken, as the various occaſions thereof makes them useful.</p>

the Conjunction Copulative AND, as this
is alſo, to the laſt Petition by the ſame Copulative;
from whence I collect, that it would be he little to Our
long-laſting comfort, to ask and obtain our <hi>Daily

ſhould quickly forfeit again our pardons, and be in

wicked luſts; or by turning his <hi>ſpiritual Graces</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and Protections muſt go together in compleating
our happineſs; for, fleſh and blood is ſo frail, that,
without Gods preventing Grace, and perpetual co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſiſtance,
we are ſometimes prone to make even the
forgiveneſs of our ſins, an introduction to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95657:73"/>
with <hi>the Dog to his vomit,</hi> and with <hi>the
Swine to wallowing in the mire;</hi> as appears by the
impudence of that Harlot mentioned by <hi>Solomon,</hi>
who made the payment of her vowes, a motive to
allure her laſcivious companions to be partners in
her uncleanneſs: And it hath been too often ſeen,
that many (young perſons especially) who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
they are ſanctified by a formal communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
at the Lords Table about the time of <hi>Eaſter,</hi>
do take more liberty that day to fulfill their vain

ſome of theſe are none of thoſe who make leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Moral or Divine Duties.</p>
               <p>2. That Word in the Original, which is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
DEBTS, ſignifies <hi>Treſpaſſes</hi> or ſins alſo; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
and Commiſſions, leaving that undone,
which we ought to do; and doing that which we
ought not to do. There is alſo in this <hi>Petition</hi> a
<hi>Condition</hi> implyed, beſide that which is expreſſed
touching our forgiving them, who are indebted or
offenſive to us; which condition includeth Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Confeſſion, Repentance, and Amendment,
making up one fourfold Duty, without perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
whereof (in will at leaſt) we cannot juſtly
ask that pardon here prayed for. Forgiveneſs of
our <hi>Debts</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſſes</hi> is not precarious, but on
condition we forgive them, who Treſpaſs againſt us;
And if it be ſo, they ought ſeriouſly to conſider
how far they are from performing it as they ought
to do, who perſecute their brethren or others to
the ruining of their eſtates, and the deſtruction of
their lives; who ſeek their weal, and never did or
intended them evil; eſpecially they who perſecute
others for differing from them in judgement and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95657:73"/>
practice onely, in things relating to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious
ſerving of God, whereof none but he himſelf
is a competent Judge. Theſe are far from imitating
God in his free <hi>Acts of Grace,</hi> as are they alſo who
make ſhewes of Reconciliation and forgiveneſs, to
get the more power and opportunity, to execute
their Vengeance upon thoſe whom they hate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
juſt cauſe. But, I return to the forementioned
conditional Duty. <hi>He that ſays he hath no ſin, is a
lyar, and hath no truth in him. He that hides his ſin
ſhall not proſper;</hi> He that is not <hi>ſorry</hi> for it, cannot
truly <hi>Repent;</hi> He that <hi>Repents</hi> not, is uncapable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
and if he might obtain it without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
no <hi>Amendment</hi> would follow; but, he would
every day wax ſo much worſe rather then better,
that at laſt he would fall into a final obduracy, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
him impenitent for ever. This fourfold
Duty I make to be but one, becauſe if one be ſincere,
all the reſt are ſo truly performed together in one
moment effectually (though it be in the laſt hour
of life) that they will be accepted of, as if actually
done from the VVomb to the Grave; as appears by
our <hi>Saviours</hi> gracious words to the <hi>Thief upon the
Croſs;</hi> and by him who received the whole dayes
wages for one hours work: for, though our ſins are
ſo many and unknown, that, we cannot confeſs, be
ſorry for them, or repent them all in particular, yet
their being ſo many, may and ought to make us to
repent them in general, with the more hearty ſorrow
and confeſſion, and then our <hi>willingneſs</hi> to amend
ſhall be accepted for the <hi>deed;</hi> through that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which was made for all our tranſgreſſions,
by him who hath ſatisfied to the plenary Remiſſion
of all our Debts and Treſpaſſes, who ſhall ask it in
his Name with Faith and Love.</p>

3. That, this <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> may be attained
unto, we muſt with <hi>David</hi> earneſtly deſire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to have our hearts and Reins ſearched, that
out ſecret ſins may be diſcovered unto us, as much
is as poſſible, and conſider from what <hi>

we are delivered by the ſacrificing of that
<hi>Lamb,</hi> which taketh away the ſins of the World;
for, in the heart lies the root of all Tranſgreſſions;
which (though mortified by <hi>Chriſts</hi> taking upon
him our Nature) is in every unregenerate man,
ſoon quickned again, by the ſpirit of the Devil;
and the <hi>evil ſeed</hi> by him injected is conceived, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,
and delighted in, by filthy contemplations,
until it comes forth into <hi>deeds:</hi> and, though never
perhaps, brought forth into Act, defiles as much (if
not more) then actual Adulteries and Murthers;
becauſe <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſſes,</hi> occaſioning no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhame or puniſhment, bringing us to heed
and repent them (as open groſs ſins do) are by ſo
much the more dangerous and mortal To kindle
and inflame our Love to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that our Faith
may take the faſter hold on him; we might to take
notice that he hath Redeemed us, and all mankinde
from every ſin whatſoever; leſt by denying him the
honour of that <hi>Mercy,</hi> (which is the greateſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of his Love) we commit a greater ſin then
all thoſe that we deſire ſhould be forgiven: and let
us be wary that we charge not the <hi>humane Nature</hi>
with a ſin wherewith God charges it not, in ſuch a
manner as ſome do, under a pretence of doing him
honour thereby. Thus, ignorantly, they do at
leaſt, if not Hypocritically, who impute the guilt
of <hi>Original ſin,</hi> to all <hi>Mankind; For, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand</hi>
to what end they ſhould impute the guilt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95657:74"/>
of our <hi>firſt Parents</hi> tranſgreſſion to all, except it be
to lay un to Gods charge the chief cauſe and greateſt
blame of all our <hi>Prevarications,</hi> according to their

by their Fathers eating of ſowre grapes, whereof they
taſted not;</hi> and were made liable to everlaſting
death, by their tranſgreſſions, before they had any
ſin of their own. This is the effect of those words,
and this miſimputation to God, is continued, though
he hath ſaid, (yea ſworn) the contrary, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
the <hi>Jews</hi> (whoſe imitators and parallels we
have been in all their ſins): for many have the very
ſame evil opinion of Gods <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi>
This makes me think, when I hear what ſome ſay to
this purpoſe, in their confeſſions, that, they do but
complement with God in their Prayers, as they do,
who being ſuiters to a great perſon, ſay to this effect:
<hi>Sir, we are your poor humble ſervants, who have often
offended your honour; and are ſo unworthy that we can
juſtly expect nothing, but of your meer favour,</hi> &amp;c. yet
when they come to ſpeak of this perſon to others;
ſay, <hi>He is a hard man, reaping where he ſowed not;
gathering where he ſtrowed not; making him pay for
that which others bad eaten; promiſing that for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
which he had diſabled them to believe, and
puniſhing them for that fault, which he knew others had
committed;</hi> with ſuch like ſcandalous and injurious
imputations. This, God knows, ſome ſay of him;
and who that conſiders it, can hope without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of this blaſphemy, to offer any Petition to him
for himſelf or others, that ſhall not be rejected with
a <hi>malediction?</hi> Or, who can expect, that Peſtilences,
Wars, Famines, Perſecutions, Seditions, Rebellions
and uncharitable cenſures of each other can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95657:75"/>
or abated, where many men have ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of God? and are ſo wicked as to require his
upſpeakable Love and long-ſufferings, with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities,
to whom, he vouchſafed more mercy, then
to the elapſed <hi>Angels,</hi> though his <hi>Juſtice</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in perfection, even to them alſo.</p>
               <p>4. They were not created of any <hi>mutable matter;</hi>
and having no Tempter without themſelves as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
had, they might all as well as part of them
did, have continued in uprightneſs, had not <hi>ſelf-love</hi>
declined them from their <hi>Maker,</hi> which it may be
was the cauſe, they had no <hi>Redeemer</hi> decreed or
promiſed. But <hi>Adams</hi> body being formed of
<hi>changeable Elements,</hi> (having alſo a ſubtle malitious
<hi>Tempter</hi> to corrupt his innocencie) God in Mercy
provided him a <hi>Saviour;</hi> who took away the guilt of
that Tranſgreſſion, both from him, and from all his
Poſterity; making a gratious Covenant whereby all
might poſſibly have been preſerved to eternal life.
For, though the <hi>firſt ſin,</hi> had ſo tainted thoſe <hi>Veſſels,</hi>
through which all <hi>Mankinde</hi> was to deſcend, that it
was thereby ſubject to many infirmities, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to all manner of Prevarications, those diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
were fully recompenced with a grant of more
by the Mediatorſhip of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> then was loſt
by <hi>Adams;</hi> if the Grace vouchſafed be improved as
it may be, and not wilfully neglected by degrees,
till increaſed to a malicious contempt thereof, ſo
hardning the heart, that neither <hi>Judgements</hi> or <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
can ſoften it. According to <hi>Davids</hi> confeſſion
in the 91. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> we were by our <hi>Firſt-parents</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
and conceived in ſin, and thereby contracted
a natural diſableneſs to do any good of our ſelves,
through that proneneſs to evil, which is inherent
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95657:75"/>
Nevertheleſs, we have no ſuch cauſe to complain as
is pretended: For there, is in the moment of our
natural conception a <hi>ſpiritual ſeed,</hi> conceived in
our hidden parts (as to me ſeems expreſſed in that
<hi>Pſalm</hi>) by the Spirit of God; applying the Virtue
of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Incarnation to our <hi>Nature,</hi> and to the
ſanctifying of it at the reception of our humane Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
that the ſeed then caſt into us might fructifie,
and that ſuch a clean heart and right ſpirit might be
formed in us, as <hi>David</hi> prayed for: which, elſe he could
not have prayed for in Faith, or ſincerely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Gods having wrought in him ſuch a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
work, that he might have had hope of a Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
thereby, notwithſtanding his perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities;
but would rather have extenuated his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
by charging God with leaving him in an
incapacity to avoid that diſablement which he had
from our <hi>Firſt parents,</hi> rather then have juſtified
(as in that <hi>Pſalm</hi> he doth) the Truth of God in all
things by him ſpoken, by whomſoever he ſhould be
cenſured with a Righteous Judgement: For, it is
no derogating from God (as ſome think) and an
aſcribing to our ſelves more then belongs unto us,
but an honour to him rather (by ſaying the fault of
all our miſdoing upon our ſelves) to acknowledge
his free gift, and to ſay we have our <hi>natural will,</hi>
by him ſo renewed and freed, that we have a will
by him free to chuſe Good or Evil, when he ſets
them before us: in regard, it is but a mocking of
men, when we offer them a mercy, or any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
upon ſuch a condition, as we know they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perform; and a palpable injuſtice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
men for that offence, which they never did in
their own perſons, (eſpecially when ſatisfied for by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95657:76"/>
their ſurety) ſo far forth, as it related to them; and
I know none, who in heaven or earth will juſtifie
ſuch an action when it comes to be judged. Or, if
we may not acknowledge, that God hath given us
ſome faculties, which are properly called our own
when freely given, whereby we may do what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth;
or if we ſhall be condemned for what we
never had a poſſibility perſonally to perform; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
underſtand how we can ſo juſtifie God to our
<hi>humane Capacity,</hi> that he will not be rather fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a Tyrant, then honoured as ſo gratious a King
ought to be: for this is not an adhering to <hi>Reaſon</hi>
in ought repugnant to true <hi>Faith,</hi> as hath been ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
objected; but agreeable to that which is
warranted both by <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace:</hi> And whilſt
a contrary belief is cheriſhed by Profeſſors of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as pertinent to the honour of God, and to the
abaſement of our ſelves, I ſhall not wonder if the
words and promiſes of <hi>Earthly Kings,</hi> be reputed
ſacred, though they perform nothing accordingly;
for it is juſt that they ſhould ſuffer by ſuch Retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
who have ſo ill an opinion of God, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expreſſed; ſeeing he hath not onely made us
many gratious promiſes, and faithfully performed
them from Generation to Generation; but made
way alſo to reconcile us unto himſelf, when we
were his Enemies, by ſatisfying that which Juſtice
required, by the pretious Blood of bis beloved Son,
in whom he is beſt pleaſed.</p>
               <p>5. But, are none guilty now, of <hi>Original ſin?</hi>
Yes many; yea all men who continue in their ſins
without repentance, and fight not againſt their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
corruptions, which (as it is ſaid of <hi>Hydras</hi>
heads) ſpring again as faſt as cut off; and they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95657:76"/>
are guilty thereof, who ſin wilfully and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſly,
as appeareth by what is imprecated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch offences in the 109 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which is a
Prophecy againſt <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſuch-like Tranſgreſſors:
For, it is uſual with the Prophets to expreſs in the
imperative Mood, and by way of Prayer, thoſe <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions</hi>
which God hath decreed and promiſed to
the Righteous, arid to predict by way of Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thoſe <hi>maledictions</hi> which are to be the portion
of Reprobates; as in the forementioned <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
where it is ſaid in relation to ſuch an Offender, and
to the Children, of that wicked ſeed, whereby he
and they are propagated, <hi>Let the Iniquity of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
be remembred with the Lord, and let not the ſin
of his Mother be blotted out. Let his Children be
continual Vagabonds,</hi> &amp;c. that is, Let ſuch as are
ſprung from that ſeed of Malignity and Infidelity,
which was in that malitious one, be ſo, or ſo accurſed.
If it ſhall be asked, how any man may juſtly be
charged with <hi>Original ſin,</hi> if all men were acquitted
form it, as I have affirmed by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> An unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Anſwer thereto, I collect from the Parable
in the <hi>18th.</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where the
<hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is likened to a King, who
calling his Servants to accompt, one was brought,
that owed him a thouſand Talents, w<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ot having
where with to make payment, was adjudged to be
ſold with all that he had for payment of the Debt.
The Servant thereupon fell down at his feet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
his patience and forbearance; which ſo
moved the King to compaſſion, that he forgave the
whole Debt. The ſame Servant going out of the
Kings preſence, finding one of his Fellows, who
owed him but a hundred pence, took him by the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95657:77"/>
throat, ſaying, Pay me that thou oweſt me; and
though his Fellow-ſervant fell at his feet, promiſing
payment, if he would with patience forbear him; he
nevertheleſs caſt him into Priſon, which ſo offended
the King his Maſter, being informed thereof, that
he delivered him to the Tormenters, to be by them
detained until he had pay'd all the Debt, which was
formerly forgiven; it being a Fundamental <hi>Maxime</hi>
in the Law of that Kingdom reſembled by this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
That <hi>ſuch meaſure as men mete, ſhall be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
unto them; and that, they ſhall not be forgiven,
who will not forgive their Brethren &amp; Fellow ſervants
who treſpaſs againſt them.</hi> In this Caſe, that <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
debt,</hi> which is remitted to every man by <hi>Chriſts
Incarnation</hi> and <hi>Paſſion,</hi> is charged again upon every
man who comes into this world, if he ſhall be then
unmerciful to his Fellow-ſervants, and ſin wilfully
and malitiouſly againſt the Grace of God without
repentance.</p>
               <p>6. This I believe, as in relation to Original ſin,
and that afore expreſſed to be an Implicite Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in all Gods Acts of Grace intended, though not
expreſt, and more unalterable then the Laws of the
<hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> heretofore. But in the cloſe
of this <hi>Petition,</hi> it is explicitely mentioned, and
therefore <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> be doubted of any, the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
plainly theſe, <hi>As we forgive them, that treſpaſs
againſt us;</hi> And in the two Verſes next following
this Prayer, it is declared both Affirmitively and
Negatively by Chriſt himſelf, to make us the more
heedful thereof. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you forgive men their
treſpaſſes, then will your heavenly Father alſo ford
give you: But if you forgive not men their treſpaſſes,
neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95657:77"/>
treſpaſſes.</hi> It is ſaid alſo, That <hi>we ſhould be merciful
as our heavenly Father is Merciful, and perfect as
he is perfect;</hi> which are ſuch hard Leſſons to fleſh
and blood, that few love to hear of them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
that conditional asking forgiveneſs aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
had made ſo many neglect the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi>
becauſe they cannot ſo perfectly forgive, as they
would be forgiven. But, they miſtake the meaning
of the holy Ghoſt. God requireth no impoſſible
things at our hands. He expecteth not ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in us as in him our <hi>Pattern,</hi> but ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Imitation onely, as we are capable
of; and I hope thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who (I know not
to what good purpoſe) profeſs themſelves to be
perfect, do not mean it in any other ſence, then as to
their being in the way to perfection, and imitation
of their pattern. No man who deſire the Picture
or Image of his Friend, is ſo abſurd as to look to
have it more perfect then a Repreſentation can be.
Some true reſemblances may be expreſt of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the Viſage, Looks, Poſtures, of a Frown, a Smile,
with ſuch-like, but little or nothing of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the perfection of the whole man conſiſteth.
Therefore the ſcrupling at this conditional Petition
is cauſleſs. And I think it not ſo difficult as ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, for a man whoſe heart is regenerated to
forgive either his Brethren or Enemies, as he would
be forgiven, or as <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Pa<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>orn did, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our proportion of Charity; for, <hi>Stephen</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his perſecutors who ſtoned him to death; and
perhaps, many ſuppoſed to be our perſecutors in
meer malice, are either ignorant of what they do,
as our Saviour ſaid his Crucifiers were, or as <hi>Paul</hi>
(who conſented unto <hi>Stephens</hi> death) ſaid that he
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95657:78"/>
did all things with a good conſcience toward Gods,
even when he was a perſecutor, becauſe, he thought
thoſe whom he perſecuted to be blaſphemers of
God. Yea, it ſeems ſo eaſie to forgive, as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
God ſhould forgive us, that I, (who am one of
the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven) do believe
(praiſed be God for it, who knows I truely expreſs
my heart) can forgive my moſt malitious Enemies,
when I conſider that the worſt of them, for ought
I know to the contrary, may perſecute me, either
becauſe he is an ignorant fool, or, believes me to
be an Enemy to the <hi>Truth of God,</hi> or to the <hi>publick
Peace:</hi> yea, though I knew their perſecutions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from meer malitiouſneſs, if I perceived them
affected with ſorrow for it, and penitent for their
treſpaſſes againſt other men; I could forgive them
perfectly, though they had purſued me to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
ignominious death; and weep for Joy of
it, though ſince I was of underſtanding, I could
never weep for loſſes, reproaches, pains or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
occaſioned by any open Enemy, but
have often ſhed tears when thereto moved, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
kindneſſes or unkindneſſes of Friends and
Brethren.</p>
               <p>7. Indeed, if all things were well conſidered,
(and we had but so much prudence or patience as
we ſhould have) it would not be difficult for any
rational man to forgive both Brethren and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
Friends and Foes; for, in whatſoever they
treſpaſs againſt us, they are ſeldome more miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
unto us then to themſelves, when they intend
beſt unto themſelves, and worſt to us. Their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
reproaches, and deſpights to us, for the moſt
part in ſome reſpects or other, do us as much good as
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95657:78"/>
harm; and the benefits of the one, as much diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
other while, as the miſchiefs and ſcandals of
the other; for, they proceed but from fit, of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency</hi>
or <hi>anger,</hi> as occaſions happen: Sometime
by <hi>Levity,</hi> ſometimes by <hi>miſtakes,</hi> ignorance or
heedleſsneſs, as well as from malice; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
an <hi>accidental toy,</hi> makes thoſe who for many
years together lived in ſuch hatred, that they watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all opportunities to deſtroy each other, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
very kinde Neighbours; and they who
ſeemed as long a time ſo mutually endeared, that
they could not be abſent a whole day, have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived
all that friendſhip, and for a trifle been the
greateſt enemies in the world to each other till their
lives ended, the friendſhip or enmity of moſt,
men in theſe times, is neither worth our eſteem or
anger; for they who profeſs moſt kindneſs when
they are together, Jeer each other aſſoon as depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and tattle as contumeliouſly to their mutual
diſparagement in ſecret, as enemies do openly; and
no wiſe man will much more be troubled at what
theſe either ſay or do, then at the bawlings and
ſnarlings of Dogs, if he can keep them from his
Shins; for within a ſhort time, they with all their
evil words and actions will be buried in the earth,
and quite forgotten, as we ſhall all be ere
long alſo; Therefore, let us all forgive one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>8. I have yet more to ſay touching <hi>forgiveneſs.</hi>
It appears not to me, that any man can rationally
expect forgiveneſs, either from God or men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Repentance;</hi> or, that we are by precept obliged
to forgive thoſe, who continue in a malitious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency,
or that God hath manifeſted any ground
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95657:79"/>
of hope, for ſuch as wilfully perſevcre in treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:
or who are inexorable to others offending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them. By our Saviours anſwer to <hi>Peter</hi>
(when he asked him, how often he ſhould forgive his
Brother?) <hi>Repentance</hi> appears to be a conditional
Motive to <hi>Forgiveneſs,</hi> For, ſaid he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 22.
<hi>I ſay not until ſeven times, but until ſeventy times
ſeven times,</hi> a certain number for an uncertain. And
<hi>Lake</hi> 17. 3. he ſsid, <hi>If thy Bother treſpaſs againſt
thee rebuke him, and if he repent forgive him; and if
he treſpaſs againſt thee ſeven times in a day, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
times in a day turn again, ſaying, I repent, thou
ſhalt forgive him;</hi> from whence collect (beſides
this, that we muſt both forgive others, and repent
our own ſins, if we expect forgiveneſs) that, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
is always premiſed before <hi>Forgiveneſs,</hi> both
in relation to God and men. Now, it is to be
conſidered, that if as is aforſaid, God requires us to
forgive our brethren upon Repentance, though
he offends us 490 times, <hi>numerus certus pro incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
that is, how often ſoever, we may undoubtingly
believe, that God whoſe Mercy is infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
over all his works (and is not ſo ſevere as to
mark all that is amiſs) will not heed humane failings
with leſs compaſſion, then he expects in men; or,
that he looks for a more abſolute Repentance then
frail men are able to perform; or, that he hath not
provided an extraordinary means by Grace to ſupply
all the defects in Nature, where the ordinary means
is not vouchſafed. Were it not ſo, we who have
enjoyed the largeſt means in ordinary (knowing
what we are privy to in our ſelves) could not ſo
abſolutely depend upon that imputative Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
which we have by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as we do, or may
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95657:79"/>
do; nor ſincerely believe what we profeſs. Verily,
God is ſo merciful, that he acceppts of very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Repentances and Humiliations, as appears by
what he vouchſafed to <hi>Ahab</hi> for a little outside-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
and how gratious he hath been from time
to time, to thoſe Nations who formally profeſſed
his Name, though they have turned his Grace into
wantonneſs, and more provoked him, by their
Hypocriſies and impudent abhominations every day
increaſing, then all thoſe heathenish <hi>Nations</hi> which
are by moſt of them reputed <hi>Reprobates,</hi> and without
hope or ſence of their miſerable condition. But, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
many millions who are thought totally exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
ſhall, according to our <hi>Saviours</hi> saying, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.
11. <hi>Come from the Eaſt, and Weſt and ſit down with</hi>
Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, <hi>in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
when the Children of the Kingdom, ſhall be ſhut
out,</hi> who think themſelves to be the ſole Inheritors
thereof.</p>
               <p>9. This hath ſtarted thoſe conſiderations which
incline me at preſent, to expreſs what I further
apprehend and believe concerning Gods eternal
Love to <hi>Mankinde,</hi> to vindicate his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and
<hi>Mercy</hi> from the diſhonour done thereunto by thoſe
who think he decreed-the greateſt number to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
before the Creation of the world; and I
will not omit what I have to ſay in oppoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
though probably I ſhall be judged an Heretick
for my reward; and perhaps be forſaken of many
ſeeming Friends, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was by ſome of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
when he ſpake that, which they were notable
to bear. The utterance of ſuch Myſteries he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
until the time came wherein to be ſilent, would
have occaſioned greater inconveniences and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95657:80"/>
miſchiefs then to ſpeak them; and then he declared
what was ſeaſonable. This is alſo a time for me to
expreſs what I have hitherto concealed more with
reſpect to others then to my ſelf; and I will now
declare it, leſt if I let ſlip this opportunity, now
GODS <hi>correcting Angel,</hi> is under my Roof, I
may not perhaps live to expreſs it, if now neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
               <p>10. There are many places in holy Scripture ſo
generally obſerved, that I need not particularize
them, from whence it is inferred, and vulgarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that a very ſmall number ſhall be ſaved;
which I conceive to be a falſe Inference inſinuated
by the Devil to the diſhonour of Gods <hi>Juſtice, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power:</hi> For, what can more blemiſh
GODS Juſtice and Mercy, or magnifie the wiſdom
and power of the <hi>Devil</hi> more, then to have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that he ſhall carry away with him at the
<hi>laſt Judgement,</hi> a greater number with him into
<hi>Hell,</hi> then <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall with him into <hi>Heaven?</hi> For,
who is reputed a Conquerour, but he that leads moſt
out of the Field (of thoſe who fought under his
Banner) when the Battle is ended? I need alledge
no more to reaſonable men, if this be well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
but Reaſon is cryed down as an Impoſtreſs, and
therefore I muſt proceed further to convince an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
ſo generally received. It is true, that during
this <hi>great Week of the World,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>ſix My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
days</hi>) now having almoſt compleated a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years apiece, according to the vulgar compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation)
the <hi>Devil</hi> hath ſo prevailed by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
that the extent of <hi>Evil</hi> may be thereby
fully known during the time aforeſaid: God
was likewiſe pleaſed during the ſame time, to leave
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95657:80"/>
his <hi>Elect Subjects</hi> (except in extream ſtreights and
hazzards) furniſhed with no more Power and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
then might ſufficiently maintain ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
and offenſive <hi>War,</hi> as they were to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, to make proof how much, or how little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
could be gotten by their <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and
<hi>Power,</hi> to bring them to the knowledge of that
<hi>Good,</hi> which hath no <hi>Evil</hi> mixed therewith; and
wherein, the perfection of their happineſs conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
as alſo, to give them an experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that <hi>Evil,</hi> which our <hi>Firſt parents</hi> deſired
to know. But, when the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of a thouſand
years is come, wherein the <hi>Spiritual City of God</hi>
ſhall deſcend from Heaven, to reſtore Mankinde to
that <hi>Paradiſical life,</hi> from which they have been
hitherto kept by an <hi>Angel</hi> brandiſhing a Sword every
way; <hi>Sathan,</hi> ſhall be ſo bound, and his Policy and
Power ſo reſtrained, that he ſhall add fewer to his
<hi>kingdom</hi> then now, or heretofore, when his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
was permitted to be prevalent; yea, perhaps
he ſhall then get none to adhere finally unto him,
though his power not being totally reſtrained, he
ſhall have liberty to deceive the Nations for a while
to evidence his own weakneſs, and the Power of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> when he perſonally aſſumes his Throne. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſix thouſand years aforegoing, wherein <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
had liberty permitted to exerciſe his Tyranny,
ſo far forth as might ſufficiently demonſtrate the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of <hi>Evil</hi> as aforeſaid, God was not onely able
to raiſe up <hi>Stones</hi> to be Spiritual Children to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid; but alſo did ſo, and doth ſtill
raiſe up many, (that is, men who are as unactive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
their own Salvation, as Creatures without
life) being inſenſible in our mode, of his operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95657:81"/>
upon them (and paſſive onely as Stones under
the Work-mans Tools, without reſiſting the <hi>Spirits</hi>
working upon; and theſe are in the capacity of thoſe
little innocent Children, to whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid <hi>the
Kingdom of Heaven appertains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. And, whereas we hear many ſuch ſayings as
theſe, or to the like effect: <hi>The way is broad that
leadeth to deſtruction; and the Gate ſo ſtreight which
gives admittance to Salvation, that few enter in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at:
That, many are called, but few choſen: That,
though the People were as the ſands, of the Sea, a
ſmall number ſhould be ſaved: That, the Righteous
in reſpect of the Wicked, were but as here and there
an Olive-berry upon the boughs after gathering-time;
or as a few Grapes after the Vintage,</hi> with ſuch-like aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverations;
Theſe, I acknowledge to be true; yet
my belief is, notwithſtanding all this, that, a far
greater number ſhall be ſaved then condemned
at the laſt Judgement. For, I cannot; believe
theſe expreſſions have reſpect to all <hi>Mankinde</hi>
diſperſed throughout the world, from the beginning
to the end thereof, but as relating comparatively
to thoſe onely, who are and were Members of thoſe
viſible <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Chriſts viſible
Kingdom upon earth,</hi> to whom the ordinary means
of Salvation were and are diſpenſed, whether <hi>Jews</hi>
or <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> the greateſt number of whom (for
their wilful neglect of that means, for their turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Grace of God into wantonneſs, for their
ſeeking <hi>gain</hi> by pretended <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and for their
meer formality and hypocriſie) ſhall be ſhut out of
that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> whereof they judged themſelves to
be ſole Inheritors, and all the reſt of the world to
be <hi>caſt-aways.</hi> So did many <hi>Jews</hi> believe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95657:81"/>
heretofore; and ſo do many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now,
who will at laſt finde it to be a <hi>ſpirit of ſelf-love,</hi>
which poſſeſſed them, producing no better fruit
then the Apples of <hi>Sodom</hi> are ſaid to be. Theſe, as
I conceive, are thoſe of whom the ſayings in <hi>holy
Scripture</hi> aforementioned ſhall be verified, and of
whom onely they were intended. Theſe reputing
themſelves the onely Children of the Kingdom,
boaſt of their Priviledges; ſuch, as the having <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
to their Father: The <hi>Temple of the Lord;</hi>
or the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> among
them, how much ſoever abuſed or neglected; and
theſe alone are concerned, in thoſe places of
holy Scripture which declare the paucity of that
number who ſhall be <hi>choſen</hi> in compariſon of them
who are <hi>called;</hi> and the paucity of thoſe among
them who ſhall be ſaved, in reſpect of their nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs,
who ſhall periſh by their neglecting or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing
thoſe advantages which were put into their
hands, I conceive to be thereby meant: For, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think that ſuch ſayings had a purpoſed relation
to them unto whoſe knowledge that means neither
came, nor was likely to come whilſt they lived af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were born into the World: Such in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
as are many millions of Heathens in the
remoteſt parts of the world: As alſo, little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
dying before they are capable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they hear; and who muſt inavoydably, and
everlaſtingly periſh, if God hath provided no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means of their Salvation by <hi>Chriſt</hi> then
ſuch a way of preaching it as is vouchſafed to
us.</p>
               <p>12. Therefore, in my judgement, they ſhould
have little hope of pardon for their many actual
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95657:82"/>
tranſgreſſions, who knowing God hath provided
means of life and nouriſhment for Children in the
Mothers Womb, when they can neither breath nor
eat, as when they are born; if they ſhall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that God who is infinite in Mercy, hath not
provided as ſufficient a means to nouriſh their Souls
and Bodies to eternal Life, who by Death in their
infancy or otherways, are (without their perſonal
default) incapable of the ordinary means. It is in
my underſtanding, ſo great an injury to the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Mercy of God, to affirm he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to everlaſting deſtruction all thoſe Innocents
by leaving them totally without remedy, that they
ſeem to me incapable of <hi>Forgiveneſs,</hi> through Gods
Mercy to them, until they repent of their blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
miſ-belief of his Fatherly compaſſion, who
hath given them no juſt cauſe to imagine he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
to make provision for the wellfare of all his
impotent Children. Therefore, that we may not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the Forgiveneſs of our Debts and Treſpaſſes,
which we pray for, or charge God with ſo much cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
as to expoſe his own Children, by <hi>Creation</hi> at
leaſt, to be a prey to the <hi>Devil;</hi> and which is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable,
to teach other men to believe be hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
decreed the Reprobation of all <hi>Mankinde,</hi>
except a very few in compariſon of the reſt: I will
endeavour to make it more evident, though I
have alledged much to this purpoſe already, that a
very few ſhall be everlaſtingly damned, in reſpect of
them who ſhall be ſaved by the Mercy of God in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt;</hi> and that this is ſufficiently provided for,
by GODS eternal <hi>Decree of Election and Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
which hath by many been miſunderſtood to the
diſhonour of his <hi>Divine Juſtice:</hi> contrary to the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95657:82"/>
light of <hi>Reaſon</hi> renewed and ſantified by <hi>Grace,</hi> and
to that illumination, which is added thereunto, by
Gods <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> And, though to make odious
that Doctrine which I aſſert, it is called <hi>Hereſie, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſm,
Popery,</hi> and what elſe they pleaſe who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it; I hope it ſhall be ſo generally received, that
all good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> will ere long, be aſhamed of it,
and make it appear ſo wicked, that it will hardly be
believed by many in future times, if there were not
ſo many great Volumes written to uphold their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
For, who in Reaſon can believe, that he who
created all things in Love, by Love, and to be beloved
of his Creatures, for whoſe good he created them,
did fore-intend to make the greateſt number of them
everlaſtingly miſerable; and deſign them to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs,
before they had <hi>being,</hi> or <hi>poſſibility to do
good or evil;</hi> yea, that he neceſſitated them to do
that evil for which they ſhould be condemned? what
love was there in this? or what love could be expect
from thoſe who ſhould be taught thus to believe?
or, what Truth is in ſuch Teachers who incourage
their Diſciples, to think ſo of him who hath <hi>ſaid</hi> and
<hi>ſworn,</hi> he deſired not the Death of ſinners, but
that they ſhould repent and live? Verily, if there be
any madneſs in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> more extravagant then this,
I am greatly deceived.</p>
               <p>13. It is true, that God hath abſolutely predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
ſome to <hi>Salvation,</hi> and ordained ſome to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of old,</hi> with reſpect to their <hi>Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
in time, and to a <hi>Covenant</hi> between him and
them; but none abſolutely to condemnation, nor
either with reſpect or diſreſpect to their perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
time, or before they had a temporary being;
though he fore-knew what the one and the other
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95657:83"/>
would be. <hi>David</hi> tell us in his fourth <hi>Pſalm</hi> who
they are whom God Elected; even the <hi>GODLY;</hi>
that is, ſuch as he fore-ſaw would hear, heed and
be conformable to the dictates of his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
and who when he had inlightned their <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi>
and renewed their <hi>wills,</hi> would endeavour
perſeverance to the end according to the power he
gave them, not truſting to that obedience, or to any
Righteouſneſs of their own thereby acquired; or
ſeeming to be formerly inherent, but to Gods <hi>Free-grace</hi>
onely; who, when men have once given
him their hearts, thereto allured by loving compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
never afterward fails to keep them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
maugre all the frailties of the fleſh, or
the temptations of the World and the Devil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<hi>Whoomſoever he once loveth, he loveth to the
end;</hi> Theſe are they who were from eternity E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and given out of the world to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his
<hi>Father,</hi> and for whom he prayed that none of them
might be loſt: when theſe have choſen God for their
onely refuge; taken up his <hi>ſecret place</hi> for their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
and can ſay unto him in their hearts with
<hi>David, Pſal. 91. Thou art my Shield, my Fortreſs, and
him in whom I truſt,</hi> &amp;c. he will give his Angels
charge to keep them in all their wayes, that neither
open or ſecret fears or perils ſhall affright or indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
them, though thouſands and ten thouſands fall
round about them: Though theſe may be expoſed
to temptations by proſperity or adverſity, they ſhall
be carried through them with ſafety and honour;
though they walk among Adders and Lyons (that
is, live among ſubtle Seducers and tyrannous Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors)
neither of them ſhall have power to hurt
them; but, they ſhall tread upon them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95657:83"/>
and proceed on through all difficulties to the
fruition of Eternal Glory. Theſe God hath elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from before all worlds, without any meer
perſonal reſpect, until their <hi>Faith</hi> hath qualified
them for a perſonal reſpect in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and he
hath neither eternally reprobated, nor <hi>of old,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
any man to condemnation, but thoſe onely,
who after they came into the world, ſhould incline
wholly to the ſuggeſtions of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>World,</hi> and the luſts of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and finally neglecting and deſpiſing that means
of their <hi>Salvation</hi> which God ſhould offer unto them
in the Ordinary way of preaching it by his <hi>Word,</hi> by
his <hi>Judgements</hi> and <hi>Mercies;</hi> or by the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
operations of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> in them who have not
the ordinary means to help them improve their
ſingle <hi>Talent of Reaſon,</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> ſet up in
their own Conſciences. By theſe <hi>Cords</hi> of love,
the <hi>Father</hi> ſeeketh to draw all men to <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
and though many of his <hi>Elected ones,</hi> are at firſt
moved to come unto him through <hi>ſelf-love</hi> or
<hi>fear,</hi> for their own ſakes, they are ſo ſtrong,
that, at laſt they draw all men unto him for his
<hi>Love-ſake,</hi> who loved them firſt; except ſuch
onely, as frowardly, and wilfully ſtop their ears,
ſhut their eyes, and harden their hearts, till he juſtly
deprives them of their hearing, ſight and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and gives them up to a Reprobate-ſence,
becauſe, they would not hear, ſee and underſtand
when they might. Theſe are they, and they alone
whom God may be ſaid to Reprobate <hi>Eternally</hi> or
<hi>of old;</hi> and if he recals any who are thus far elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
it is more then he hath promiſed to do, for
ought I know; and if he doth ſo, his <hi>Mercy</hi> is his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95657:84"/>
own, to confer when and where he pleaſeth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wrong to any in ſo doing. And it is a <hi>Mercy</hi>
that he hath not revealed ought whereupon to
ground an abſolute confidence of being often called:
For, it would be abuſed by moſt men, to the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
them the more preſumptious and the more
careleſs.</p>
               <p>14. There are many falſe <hi>Inferences</hi> and abſurd <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals</hi>
drawn from Gods <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> &amp; <hi>pre-electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
whereby Learned men have deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others; becauſe, they miſconceive Gods
Preſcience and Election, as if he as we do, conſider'd
things as being precedent, and ſubſequent to each
other in time, whereas, he being <hi>Eternal,</hi> all things
paſt, preſent and to come, are preſent with him as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting
in one and the ſame moment: the ignorance or
heedleſneſs whereof; as alſo, of other ſuch-like ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
are the occaſions of other errors. Alas!
what remedy, when Foundations are overthrown?
A great number of thoſe who ſeem to be true
Preachers of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by a conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
undertaking of that Duty, being ſuch as have
brid'd themſelves into that ſacred Calling, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
to thoſe Dignities, wherewithal the world
hath corrupted and prophaned it; or elſe, to make a
<hi>Trade</hi> of it whereby to get a livelyhood; have
taken up Truth or Hereſies, as they accidentally
ſtumbled upon them where they had their Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
endeavouring, to ſupply their want of <hi>Spiritual
Gifts,</hi> by ſuch helps as meer humane Induſtry could
afford; adding thereto <hi>formal Auſterity, Gravity,</hi> and
ſhews of <hi>Piety,</hi> which draw ignorant well-meaning
heaters, to be Zealous in what they teach them, be it
right or wrong: And as their Diſciples follow them,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95657:84"/>
ſo they followed their choſen Ring-leaders in thoſe
Opinions which they happened upon, as Wilde-geeſe
follow their Leaders, whitherſoever they fly. If the
Gooſe that heads them is wary, and having been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the profits and dangers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
carries them thither where they may feed and
reſt in ſafety, it is well; bur, if he be ſuch a Gooſe as
mindes only the filling of his Belly, neither heeding
the Nets, nor the Stalking-horſe of the Fowler;
both he, and the Goſlings that follow him, are in
a Net, or the ſhot in their bowels before they are
aware. Thus it fares with many poor ſouls led by
blind Guides and falſe Teachers, of whoſe encreaſe
there is more likelyhood, then of reducing Chriſtian
Doctrines and Diſciplines to their priſtine purity, till
the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> ſhall come into the earth: yet
every conſcientious man ought to contribute what
he is able thereunto in the mean time, and ſo
will I.</p>
               <p>15. Gods <hi>Freſcience</hi> that ſuch or ſuch a thing
will he done, doth not therefore neceſſitate, or cauſe
the doing it, more then my knowledge that mortal
men ſhall dye, is the cauſe of their death; neither
is it rightly inferred, or juſtly to be concluded from
Gods <hi>predeſtinating</hi> ſome abſolutely to <hi>eternal Life,</hi>
that therefore all the reſt were decreed abſolutely
to <hi>condemnation</hi> more then it may be truely ſaid,
that when a <hi>King</hi> without any considerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
premiſed, pardoneth ſome of thoſe who were
guilty of the ſame offence with others, that, he
thereby implyed all the reſt ſhould be executed
without mercy, when he, offers them pardon once,
(and perhaps oftner) upon ſuch conditions as they
were then able to perform; and ſtill might have
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95657:85"/>
done, until they had wilfully diſabled themſelves by
long neglect or contempt of his Grace offered.
God, may do with his own what he pleaſeth; and
if he will give to one <hi>gratis,</hi> for doing nothing, as
much as he will to me for working according to my
<hi>Covenant;</hi> what wrong Bath he done to me whereof
I may juſtly complain? or, if he puniſhed me, who
both left that work undone, which I could and
ought to have done, and ſlandered alſo his <hi>Mercy</hi> and
<hi>Juſtice,</hi> yet pardons another who is no leſs culpable,
why ſhould I repine that he obtains Mercy, becauſe
I am juſtly puniſhed? In this, and ſuch-like Caſes,
it is that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>God hath Mercy on
whom he will have Mercy,</hi> and hardneth whom he
pleaſeth; and, GOD is no ſuch <hi>accepter of
perſons</hi> as they miſconceive him to be, who miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply
that Text wherein it is ſaid, that GOD
hated <hi>Eſau</hi> and loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> before either of
them had done good or evil, and think it implies
<hi>Eſua</hi>'s Reprobation; for though <hi>Jacob</hi> being the
third <hi>Patriark</hi> who was ſeparated, or ſanctified, to
be the Fore-father of <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to the fleſh;
and <hi>Eſau</hi> in that reſpect, but a common or prophane
perſon (and worthily loſt his Birth-right for ſelling
it at ſo baſe a price) yet that rejection as to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of being the perſon from whom the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>
ſhould deſcend, warrants not me to aver that he was
reprobated in reſpect to the Salvation of his Soul;
for thoſe words <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> mentioned were ſpoken per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
with regard to Gods fore-knowledge of what
he would do; or rather (as I believe) with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the works of the <hi>fleſh</hi> and of the <hi>Spirit</hi>
onely; <hi>Eſau</hi> being a Type of the one, and <hi>Jacob</hi>
of the other, (as <hi>Sarah</hi> is ſaid to be of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:95657:85"/>
and <hi>Hagar</hi> of the Law) they being Progenitors of
differing Nations: For, the works of the <hi>Spirit</hi> are
pleaſing to God, and always loved of him; and the
works of, the <hi>fleſh</hi> abominable, and by him hated both
before, and after they are done.</p>
               <p>16. That Text is miſunderſtood alſo, to the
diſhonour of God, which mentioneth a <hi>Potters</hi>
power over his Clay, to make thereof a Veſſel of
honour or diſhonour as he pleaſeth; For, though
God hath more power over his <hi>work</hi> then a <hi>Potter</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his Clay; yet, to infer poſitively from thence,
that God had purpoſely made ſome to be <hi>Veſſels of
wrath</hi> is an unjuſtifiable inference from that alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And that obſcure place of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to
the <hi>Romans</hi> where the Potters freedome to make
what Veſſels he pleaſeth out of one and the ſame
Lump is miſunderſtood to imply what is aforeſaid;
for, if it be ſo expounded by the <hi>context,</hi> and other
places of holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> that the whole and every
part of Gods <hi>Word</hi> may agree in one <hi>Truth,</hi> we
ſhall never underſtand <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning as ſome do,
The <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> alludes not our moſt <hi>wiſe Creator</hi> to
a <hi>fooliſh Potter,</hi> who, becauſe he might make what
he would of his <hi>Clay,</hi> did therefore make the greateſt
number of his Pots to be broken again, to ſhew he
had as well a power to break them as to make them;
or, that onely to evidence his diſpleaſure, without
cauſe, he made them ugly and unſerviceable. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
God ſo made all things, that not one of his
<hi>Creatures</hi> hath ſo much cauſe of diſlike as to ſay,
<hi>Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> He is reſembled to
a <hi>wiſe Potter,</hi> who makes both Veſſels of <hi>honour</hi>
and <hi>diſhonour,</hi> out of the ſame Lump of Clay: no
<hi>Veſſels of wrath</hi> came ſo made out of his hand; but
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95657:86"/>
every one a veſſel uſeful for his ſervice, without, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
or grievance done thereunto. A <hi>Chamber-pot</hi>
made for that uſe, or a <hi>Pipkin</hi> to ſerve always in the
Fire, are as well pleaſed to be ſerviceable in their
kinds, as drinking-cups and other Veſſels employed at
the Table, though reputed more honourable then
the former. The Literal words of <hi>Scripture,</hi> may be
(and in ſome places are) vitiated by the heedleſneſs
of <hi>Tranſcribers,</hi> as we perceive by differing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies;
yet the true Genuine ſence will be always
found intire, and every part conſonant to each other
in the truth, if read with ſubmission to the dictates
of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> which always accompanies the
ſame; and so are the Texts aforementioned.</p>
               <p>17. I will add a few line more to declare, why
I believe, as is aforeſaid, that God hath predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a far greater number to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> then he
hath left liable to final <hi>Reprobation</hi> by their own
default; and I beſeech all my Readers to peruſe it
with patience and without Prejudice; for no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
to ſingularity, but a conſcientious Zeal to
vindicate Gods honour, by illustrating the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Mercy and Love to all <hi>Mankinde,</hi> hath
inclined me there unto. In my underſtanding, that
which may be conſidered by contemplating Gods
<hi>Word</hi> in the ſpirituality thereof; he hath, as it were
diſtributed all mankinde into <hi>three Regiments,</hi> which
have been governed by the inviſible and viſible ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the <hi>holy Trinity</hi> ever ſince the Creation,
and during moſt part of that time hitherto by the
<hi>third Perſon,</hi> who ſtill governs it, and ſhall until
<hi>Chriſt</hi> comes personally again upon earth. The firſt
<hi>Regiment</hi> conſiſts or all thoſe, who lived to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Visible Church</hi> made up both of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95657:86"/>
and ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law of <hi>works</hi> as of <hi>Faith; Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;
Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>true Profeſſors.</hi> Theſe in
many preceding Generations, were very few (and
ſo they yet are in reſpect of the reſt, of <hi>Mankinde;</hi>
and were obliged to work out their a Salvation, by
a reſpective conformity to thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Diſpenſations,</hi>
which in their diſtinct times and ſeaſons, were
vouchſafed in <hi>various modes;</hi> they who lived before
<hi>Chriſt</hi> came in the Fleſh, in one manner, and they
in another, who were to come after that time; but,
both one in <hi>Subſtance,</hi> though differing in <hi>Types,
Ceremonies,</hi> and other circumſtances: For, we of
the later time, cannot be ſaved, but by believing in
<hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> the Son of God, conceived by the <hi>holy
Ghoſt,</hi> born of the <hi>Vigin Mary,</hi> &amp;c. as, it hath
been revealed by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> with those Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
and circumſtances contained in the <hi>Old</hi> and
<hi>New Teſtament</hi> relating to <hi>Chriſts, Evangelical
Kingdom;</hi> whereby both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>(now
called <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) are equally priviledged and obliged.
The Jewiſh outward Duties, before <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
conſiſted in obſerving and conforming to thoſe
Types and Ceremonies, under which that was
vailed, which we profeſs. They had the ſame
<hi>Chriſt</hi> for the Object of their <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi>
though ſo little known to them according to the
<hi>manifeſtations</hi> we have had, that very few, except
their <hi>eminent Prophets</hi> underſtood the Myſteries of his
Kingdom; yet were ſaved by being obedient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
according to the meaſure of their underſtanding.
Theſe together make up the Brigade of thoſe Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in the <hi>Church-Militant,</hi> who fight the Battles
of the Lord, againſt the enemies of his Kingdom;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95657:87"/>
ſome, in pure Love to him and his Cauſe; ſome,
as <hi>Hirelings</hi> onely for their Wages: And they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, who become faithful, continuing ſo to
the end, ſhall be Crowned with Victory and Glory
above all other <hi>Saints;</hi> becauſe, expoſed to the
greateſt ſufferings and dangers in this Life. Now,
though theſe will be a very ſmall number, in reſpect
of that great number which conſiſts of them who
have been either falſe Pretenders, Traytors, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
or unprofitable ſervants to their <hi>General;</hi> yet,
they are ſaid to be as numberleſs as the <hi>Stars</hi> in the
Firmament: theſe are <hi>Davids worthies,</hi> and as it
were the <hi>Life-guard</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and a ſmall
<hi>Regiment</hi> compared unto the other two, whereof I
am next to ſpeak. Yea, theſe are that part of
GODS <hi>Elect</hi> to whom this ſaying hath reſpect <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are called, but, few are choſen:</hi> For, they are
moſt properly ſaid to be <hi>called,</hi> who had either an
outward <hi>Legal, Prophetical,</hi> or <hi>Evangelical Calling,</hi>
by the exemplary life of the <hi>Patriarchs;</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi>
written in Stone; by the teachings of the <hi>Prophets,</hi>
or, by the Preaching of the Goſpel, ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi>
came in the Fleſh; by whom, very great numbers,
have been called in every Age, yet very few of
them ſaved, in reſpect of ſo great a multitude of
them, as have neglected that <hi>Call,</hi> and turned the
Grace of GOD into wantonneſs. And the word
MANY, makes it probable to me, that theſe are
they, of whom but a few will be ſaved of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which are called in this manner: for I believe,
that (beſide this external mode of calling many)
there is an Univerſal <hi>internal calling</hi> alſo, wherein are
concerned with this, the other two <hi>Regiments</hi> alſo, of
thoſe who ſhall be ſaved; and whereof, I am next to
ſpeak as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:95657:87"/>
18. The <hi>ſecond Regiment of Saints,</hi> conſiſts of
thoſe without the <hi>Viſible Kingdom,</hi> who are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that <hi>Inviſible Catholick Church,</hi> which is
diſperſed throughout the World, and were from time
to time brought into it, by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
preaching, as it it ſaid, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 19. <hi>to thoſe who
are in priſon;</hi> that is (as I underſtand it) to them
who ſurviving until the years of diſcretion, have
lived out their whole time in the ſhadows of Death,
without means of ſaving Light, by the <hi>Goſpel</hi>
preached as unto us. For, knowing what I juſtly
apprehend of Gods infinite Goodneſs and Mercy,
I cannot believe he hath leſs effectually provided
for their Salvation then for our; but, that he had
regard to them, even when the <hi>Viſible Church</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to extend no further, then to the Families of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> to whom he ſpake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
immediately, otherwhile by <hi>Angels</hi> or by
<hi>Dreams,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 33. in which Chapter
Gods ſecret way of Inſtruction, and communicating
his will to men in the night of their natural Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is expreſſed, as alſo in relation to them, where
the ordinary means is wanting at this day, in <hi>Aſia,
Africa, &amp; America.</hi> For, though <hi>Faith</hi> was not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
nor is now begotten in them by <hi>preaching</hi> and
<hi>hearing</hi> as with us, the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Book of the
Creatures,</hi> which was open to the <hi>Magi</hi> at the time
of <hi>Chriſts</hi> birth, and directed them to him by a <hi>Star</hi>
(they not having Prophets to reveal him, as the
<hi>Jews</hi> had) he might poſſibly be diſcovered to others
in ſome ſuch extraordinary manner, as will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable.
For <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (without whom there
is no Salvation, and who is by St. <hi>Paul</hi> called the
<hi>Mercy of God</hi>) may be laid hold upon by that

                  <hi>Notion,</hi> through the Sanctification which the whole
<hi>humane Nature,</hi> received by his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and the
ſupply contributed by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> who then took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their Original guilt, and inlightens every man

what is wanting of the <hi>Ordinary means,</hi> that many

<hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
Thoſe <hi>paſſive Stones</hi> will be more eaſily

then the moſt part of thoſe, who were, and are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
ſquared, and poliſhed by <hi>hired Work men.</hi>
The effects which Gods <hi>Spirit</hi> alone, had upon <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi>
in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time; upon the firſt <hi>Pharaohs;</hi>
upon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Darius, the wiſe men</hi>
in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and ſome others without the Pale of
the <hi>Viſible Church;</hi> as alſo, by the little good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
which the ordinary means of <hi>Grace</hi> hath had
upon the Kings, Prieſts, Prophets and People in the
Viſible <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
throughout all Generations, makes it ſeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
to me, that, the ſecret teachings and inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> improving and ſanctifying
the <hi>Talent of Reaſon,</hi> will bring more thouſands
into Chriſts Kingdom, then all the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>
throughout <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> by the meer external
<hi>Forms, Diſciplines</hi> and <hi>Diſpeoſations</hi> among <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> ever ſince they had being; by reaſon of
their abusing or neglecting the <hi>Grace</hi> therewith of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
And, if this be ſo, as I believe it is; then
theſe Regenerated by the Miniſtry of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi>
being added to them, who through the Ordinary
means, are made <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children by Faith
(whom God promiſed to make as numberleſs as the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95657:88"/>
ſands upon the Sea-ſhore) will infinitely augment
the number that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>19. The third <hi>Regiment</hi> increaſing this number,
is that of <hi>Infants,</hi> two years old and under, when
taken out of this life. Theſe, during that time
are not capable of doing either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> not
ſome of them in many years more; and I think it
were a barbarous faith to believe all theſe were born
to make up the Kingdom of the <hi>Devil.</hi> Our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
ſaid, That of <hi>such the Kingdom of Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,</hi>
and reproved thoſe who denied their acceſs
to him, ſaying, <hi>Suffer such to come unto me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God;</hi>
and perhaps, thereby implicitely implyed, that it was
a very offtenſive error in thoſe who ſhould believe
little children were not abſolutely Redeemed by
him, from the guilt and puniſhment dur for <hi>Original
ſin:</hi> And yet it ſeems, by his <hi>Diſciples</hi> rebuking thoſe
who brought them, that <hi>good men</hi> may be tainted
with this Hereſie, which ſo much diſpleaſed <hi>Christ;</hi>
that he afterward added theſe words; <hi>Verify, I ſay
unto you, Whosoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom
of God as a little Childe, ſhall not enter thereinto,
Mark</hi> 10. 13, 14, 15. So far are they from being
Excluded, that they are the <hi>Pattern</hi> of that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<hi>reſignation,</hi> which is required in all who may
expect admiſſion into <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdom. Some will
ſay perchance, they muſt be the Children of the
<hi>Faithful</hi> to Whom this priviledge belongs. I ſay the
ſame; for I believe that every Childe born into the
World, or conceived in the Womb, is the Seed of
the <hi>Faithful,</hi> when or whereſoever, it is or ſhall be
born; for, in the 87 <hi>pſalm,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>God loveth
the Gates of Sion more then all the Habitations of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95657:89"/>
Jacob;</hi> and by what follows, that many who had
their natural birth, in <hi>Rahab, Philiſtia,</hi> Tyre, <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia,</hi>
yea in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhall be reputed as born in the
ſpiritual <hi>sion.</hi> And it is not to be ſuppoſed, that a
remoteneſs by <hi>Place</hi> or <hi>Time</hi> (though it were lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then one thouſand years, or farther off then the
ends of the earth) are any bar to the Influences of
<hi>Divine Grace.</hi> All Children are the Seed of the
Faithful in <hi>Noah,</hi> though their immediate Fathers
have been Infidels eyer ſince <hi>Cham</hi> was born; and
God promiſed to ſhew Mercy to the thouſandth
<hi>Generation</hi> of thoſe who fear him and keep his
Commandments. This alſo that follows, is very
conſiderable in relation to the Condition of <hi>Infants,</hi>
that, they were the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſuffered for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> even
when he being an <hi>Infant, Herod</hi> murthered all the
Children in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and the coaſts round about,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 16. Theſe, being dipped, as it were into
<hi>Chriſts sufferings,</hi> and Baptized <hi>with the holy Ghoſt
and with Fire,</hi> may ſignifie unto us, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<hi>Redemption</hi> and ſanctification of all ſuch from
<hi>Original ſin.</hi> Theſe, and their infinite multitudes,
I do conceive to be intimated by the myſtical num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>A hundred and forty four thouſand,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
twelve times twelve thouſand in a ſquare
Root; for none can be more properly; termed <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
not defiled with Women;</hi> that is, polluted with
<hi>Original guilt,</hi> whereof, every man born of a <hi>Woman</hi>
had been ſtill culpable, if it had not been taken away
by <hi>Christ;</hi> and wherewith all men are again defiled
and charged, who, when they come to underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſin actualy without Repentance. Theſe are the
firſt Fruits to God and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> preſerved from
Actual ſins in word and deed, by being tranſlated,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95657:89"/>
ſoon after they are born, to follow the <hi>Lamb</hi> into a
better Life. Now, for God to <hi>Elect</hi> and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
theſe, from <hi>Eternity,</hi> to be removed out of
this world to everlaſting happineſs, as ſoon as
born, without expoſing them to thoſe hazzards,
which others are to undergo, (though upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made poſſible to be performed by his aſſiſting
Grace) is a great Mercy, without infringement of
his own <hi>Juſtice,</hi> or wrong to any other, (though
they ſhall not have ſo much honour as they who are
to ſerve in the <hi>ſpiritual warfare,</hi> againſt the World,
the Fleſh, and the Devil.) This Mercy is ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the pure Nature of the Deity, that I wonder
any man who knows any thing of God, ſhould be ſo
ſottiſh (yea ſo wicked) as to believe he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined
the Reprobation of any Infant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of doing good or evil in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>20. The Preaching of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his Spirit to
thoſe who are in the Priſons of their Fleſhlineſs,
ſupplies many defects, both where the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
means</hi> is wanting, and where it is abuſed or
neglected; elſe, the <hi>Foundations of Piety,</hi> being ſo
overthrown or nigh ruined as they are, by the
Obſtinacy and Prevarications both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
there would be little, or no hope of preſerving
<hi>ſaving Faith,</hi> or ſo much as the ſeed thereof upon
earth, until <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould come again. Thereby, the
Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh, muſt (if
ever) be brought into Chriſts Fold, and that <hi>fulneſs
of the Gentiles come in,</hi> which will accompliſh the
Salvation of the whole <hi>Iſrael of</hi> GOD, who are the
ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And I think it not
ſo ſtrange as it ſeems to many, that more ſhould be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95657:90"/>
this way, made partakers of the <hi>kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
then by the ordinary means of Salvation in the
<hi>Viſible Church,</hi> when I confider what I experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
know to be ſpiritually done, in perfecting <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
works</hi> and <hi>faculties. Art</hi> and <hi>Induſtry</hi> joyned
together, make few men of ripe Age and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
ſo perfect in the knowledge and uſe of
any Language in many years, as ſome Children are
in one year, after they have but ſtrength enough to
ſpeak; though they are not capable of any Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Rules or demonſtrations: for, ſome of them I
have known to speak both properly, and otherwhile
facetionſly, before they either well knew what
they did, or could define what <hi>ſpeaking</hi> is, or what
they any word means by it ſelf: And, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the nature of the words, which can of it ſelf
interpret what is meant by them, it is no leſs won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
that a little Childe, ſhould both underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
and affectionately apprehend his Fathers
meaning; and expreſs his own by them (as we oft
hear them do) then that a <hi>heatheniſh Infidel</hi> ſhould
be made capable of Faith by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hearing the vocal Preaching of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in our
mode; for it is the ſame Spirit which teaches the
one and the other. Likewiſe, were it not ſo, it
would puzzle the wiſeſt man living, to demonſtrate
how a man born <hi>deaf</hi> and <hi>dumb,</hi> ſhould be capable
of underſtanding what is written, and of writing
his own conceptions in ſuch words as we ſpeak and
write; (which it is known hath been attained unto.)
But doubtleſs, by the ſame Spirit which firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
Man to know the Courſe and Order of the
<hi>Stars,</hi> and how to read the knowledge of God in
The Great <hi>Volume</hi> of his <hi>Creatures,</hi> with the many
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95657:90"/>
ſecrets therein written; and the diſcovery of other
Myſteries not elſe attainable, was communicated by
the ſame Divine Spirit. Now, if we know God
hath often wrought ſupernaturally by his <hi>Spirit</hi> to
teach us things pertinent to our well-being in this
tranſitory life; we may reaſonably believe, that he
much rather operateth ſupernaturally where need
is, toward our <hi>everlaſting well-being,</hi> without which
the Bleſſings of this life will be Curſes: Therefore,
I believe God hath provided extraordinary means of
Salvation, for every Soul ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi>
which hath not wilfully neglected and deſpiſed the
ordinary means of Grace when offered, or who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had it perſonally vouchſafed; of which number
are ſuch Infants as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>21. Theſe Inlargements, not intended, dropt
in by the ways, and it may be I may ſeem Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
in my judgement, eſpecially touching what I
have declared in relation to a probability of having
Faith wrought in thoſe barbarous Heathens, who
never heard of the <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> conceived by the <hi>holy
Ghost,</hi> born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and crucified
under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> &amp;c. as we are taught, though I
make it not a neceſſary Article of <hi>Saving faith</hi> to
be known and believed by all men. I profeſs; I
do believe as is before expreſſed; and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
every particular, eſpecially that of <hi>Infants,</hi>
do ſay (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid in his Tract of the <hi>Immortality
of</hi> the <hi>Soul,</hi> intituled <hi>Scipio's Dream</hi>) it ſeemeth ſo
pleaſing an error, if it be one, and ſo comfortable
a Doctrine, as well in reſpect of many millions
more, of our <hi>Progenitors,</hi> as of mine and their
<hi>little Children</hi> dying before years of Diſcretion,
that, I think I ſhall never be of a contrary Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95657:91"/>
and chiefly, in regard of the honour which
thereby redounds to Gods <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy;</hi> For
when I have meditated how many millions of
millions will be added unto the innumerable ſums
comparehended in the <hi>firſt two Regiments</hi> of the
three aforementioned, by the laſt of them, conſiſting
of <hi>little Children,</hi> I do believe that the number of
them who ſhall be <hi>ſaved,</hi> will be as much greater,
at leaſt, then of thoſe who ſhall be <hi>damned;</hi> as the
number of the wicked who lived in this world, ſhall
be greater then that of thoſe who are conformable to the
Will of GOD, preached in the <hi>Viſible Church.</hi>
And I am aſſured this Belief is neither contrary
to any <hi>Maxime in holy Scripture,</hi> not likely to beget
preſumption in any, who was not hardned in ſinning,
before; but, will rather make men the more awful of
ſinning againſt ſo great <hi>Mercy,</hi> and the more minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
there is Mercy with GOD that he may be both
feared and loved. More might be ſaid; but this
being well needed, may be ſufficient to make reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
men ſo merciful to each other, by Gods <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
Mercy,</hi> that they may forgive as they would
be forgiven, unleſs they are prepoſſeſſed with a
wilful and malitious <hi>Vengeance.</hi> Therefore I will
for the preſent, here conclude my <hi>Meditations</hi>
upon this <hi>Petition,</hi> humbly beſeeching our gratious
<hi>Further which is in heaven,</hi> ſo to incline our hearts to
forgive all, who treſpaſs <hi>againſt us,</hi> that he may
forgive all our treſpaſſes <hi>againſt him,</hi> Amen.</p>

               <head type="sub">And lead us not into Temptation; But deliver us from evil.</head>
               <p>1. THis, and the laſt preceding <hi>Petition,</hi> being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the fourth by the Copulative AND,
as a foreſaid, compleat all things neceſſary to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
our <hi>well-being</hi> in this Life. We ſtand in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
need, as to our external happineſs, of what
is pray'd for in theſe three laſt Petitions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorteth us, to pray continually;
which Duty every Pious man conſcientiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth:
For, it is not intended we ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
exerciſed in <hi>vocal prayer,</hi> minding nothing
elſe; in regard that is neither neceſſary, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
nor poſſible. It will be ſufficient and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to perform that duty daily as oft as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are offered; (as theſe words in the fourth Petition
imply, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread</hi>)
keeping our ſelves always in a readineſs to lift up
our hands, voices and hearts in Prayer and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings
to God, for our Selves, Relations and
Friends, as we are ingaged by duty or promiſe;
yea, and for our Enemies, as neceſſities require:
For, this is always implicitely done, whenſoever
we offer up this Prayer, intentionally including all
that is thereby prayed for; and having our heart
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95657:92"/>
put into ſuch a Frame, that it is willing and ſtriving,
ſo far as it can extend, to take in all things to be
deſired, on the behalf of God, of our ſelves or
others; for, then, it is as truely, (though not ſo
ſenſibly) prayed for, as if particularly named; and
they who are kept in this poſture, can never long
forget to pray explicitely, for them in words, whom
they are obliged to remember, by promiſe, by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
affection, or Chriſtian Charity; eſpecially, in
immergent Temptations, Calamities, times of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
want and troubles, which being the ſeaſons
wherein God hath incouraged us to call upon him
with a promiſe of hearing and deliverance. <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
are the moſt hazzardous of all the reſt, and
thoſe moſt perilſome whereinto we caſt our ſelves.
St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith 1. 13. <hi>Let no man ſay when he is
tempted, that he it tempted of God; for, God cannot
be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man;
but every one is tempted, inticed, and drawn away by
his own luſts. When luſt hath conceived, it bringeth
forth ſin, and when ſin is finiſhed, it bringeth forth
death:</hi> yet, by many places in <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> and
by the words of this <hi>Prayer,</hi> it ſeemeth implyed,
that God tempteth ſome; for, <hi>Chriſt</hi> would
not have taught us to pray for deliverance from the
evil conſequence, of that which never was or ſhall be
done. It is therefore true, that we are not
tempted of God, as by the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and
the <hi>Devil,</hi> to commit that which is abſolutely ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
or, to do ought which may bring miſchiefs or
Inconveniences upon us without remedy, or any
future diſadvantage, as by theſe Tempters. But, he
ſometimes expoſeth us unto <hi>temptations,</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while;
doth lead us into them, either for our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:95657:92"/>
to give us experimental knowledge of our
<hi>frailties,</hi> and of his <hi>Mercies;</hi> or, to make our
prudence and patience exemplary to others; and
that we may be honoured, ſecured, or ſome other
way advantaged thereby: as when <hi>Job</hi> was expoſed
to the <hi>Devils</hi> malice for a Tryal of his Patience;
and when our Saviour was led by the <hi>ſpirit</hi> into the
Wilderneſs to be tempted of the <hi>Devil.</hi> God,
likewiſe leaves always an Iſſue open out of thoſe
Temptations whereinto he leadeth, and provideth,
means whereby we may eſcape thoſe evils, which
then are, or may be brought upon us; and is ſo far
from intending ought to our diſadvantage thereby,
that he preſerves us from the evil of thoſe temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereinto we wilfully run; and which the
<hi>world</hi> and the <hi>malice</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> deſign for out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
thus doing, not onely, when we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and pray for it, but many times alſo, when we
neither minde him or our own peril or ſafeties.</p>
               <p>2. Our <hi>Firſt-parents</hi> when they were in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
ſeem to have been led into a <hi>twofold Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</hi>
It was a <hi>Temptation</hi> to have ſuch a <hi>Tree</hi>
planted in the moſt perſpicuous place of the Garden,
that was <hi>deſirable by Nature;</hi> and the forbidding to
taſte a Fruit ſo deſirable as that was, doubled the
<hi>Temptation;</hi> yea and ſomewhat more, if the <hi>humane
Nature</hi> had been then as prone to do what is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
as it hath been ever ſince: for as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<hi>Poet</hi> ſaid,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Nitimur in vetitum ſemper, cupimuſ<expan>

                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>

                     </expan>, negata.</l>
                  <l>Things which we are forbid to do,</l>
                  <l>We ſtill have a deſire unto.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But GOD expoſed them, thereunto, for <hi>Probation</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:95657:93"/>
onely, not to bring <hi>evil</hi> on them; yea, that they
might be confirmed in their Integrity by their <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:</hi>
For, he had planted the Tree of <hi>Life</hi> in the
ſame Garden, and had given them will and power to
forbear what he had forbidden, if (by giving more
credit to his <hi>enemy</hi> then to him) they had not been
inclined to that <hi>ſelfneſs</hi> which made the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
prevalent. And, though God <hi>fore-knew</hi> what they
would do, it is evident he intended them no <hi>evil</hi> but
<hi>good,</hi> in regard he had eternally decreed a <hi>Remedy</hi>
whereby the <hi>Devils</hi> malice ſhould be turned both to
the advantage of them, and of ſo many of their <hi>Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
as did not wilfully neglect, what he enabled
them to perfom. God, tempted <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice
his <hi>Son,</hi> (which according to his own humane Laws,
was an apparent ſin) but, when he had made trial
of his obedience, to make his Faith exemplary to all
his Poſterity in the fleſh, (as alſo to them, who
ſhould be his ſpiritual ſeed in the ſame Faith;) God,
who knew before what he would do, ſorbad the
execution of his own command; and rewarded <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
with the greateſt temporary Bleſſing, alſo,
that ever was conferred upon a meer mortal man;
becauſe, he ſaw him proſecute what he had injoyn'd,
even to the very ſtroke of death, out of pure obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
love and confidence in him, though the <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>might</hi>
not onely for ever deprive him of his beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<hi>Son,</hi> but probably render him infamous alſo
throughout all Generations, for ſo unnatural and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
a murther, as that would have been vulgarly
reputed. When God leadeth, expoſeth, or (if it may be
ſo called) tempteth any man, to the open <hi>profeſſing,
acting,</hi> or <hi>ſuffering</hi> of ought for his glory, which
may bring ſuch great fears or terrible ſufferings, as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95657:93"/>
uſually tempt men to diſtruſt his aſſiſtance, and
cauſes them to Apoſtatize from their duties and
profeſſions, he there leaves them not as the <hi>Devil</hi>
and the <hi>World</hi> doth; but, alwayes ſtrengthens to
the end, and delivers them from their fears and
torments (yea, makes their torments a pleaſure and
an honour to them) as when the <hi>three Children</hi>
were caſt into the Firy Fornace; or elſe he carries
them through it into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, as he
did <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. God is ſo far from tempting any to that,
which may bring on them more <hi>evil</hi> then <hi>good,</hi> that
whoſoever, by <hi>ignorance,</hi> deluſion, or by both, ſhall
without unjuſt ſelf-ends or malice to others, proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
an unjuſtifiable deſign to the loſs of his life,
by the Laws of men; if he then did it conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
in Zeal to Gods honour, believing unfaigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was approveable, and he thereto in duty obliged
(truely repenting his other miſactings, and that
ſo far forth alſo, as he ſhall be convinced if was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil)
I am perſwaded, God will not charge that
upon him to his everlaſting condemnation, though
it be a ſin in its own Nature: For, God otherwhile
permitteth ſome of his well-affected <hi>Servants,</hi> to
commit ſins whereunto they are tempted by their
own ignorance or failings; and to ſuffer openly and
ignominiouſly for them, that, their Brethren may
be thereby made the more heedful; and that his
wilful Enemies may be thereby hardned to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
For, he often hardens the hearts of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Offenders, to perſevere in thoſe tranſgreſſion,
whereunto the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> or their own
<hi>Fleſh</hi> hath tempted them; becauſe, they would not
<hi>hear, know,</hi> and execute <hi>Juſtice,</hi> when they might ſo
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95657:94"/>
have done, by his counſel, and proffered aſſiſtance,
This was exemplified in <hi>Pharaoh, Saul, Jeroboam,
Jehu</hi> and others. But, it cannot be properly called
a <hi>tempting</hi> by God, or a <hi>leading them into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
when he leaves or gives men opportunities
after <hi>precautions?</hi> to do thoſe Evils, which they had
a premeditated reſolution and deſire to execute of
their own accord, to fulfil their own Luſts; for they
need no <hi>Temptations</hi> from without themſelves: God,
tempteth none, but for their <hi>probation</hi> onely, to
their advantage; and then, accompanies it with
Gratious means to preſerve them both from all
wicked Actions, and thoſe evil conſequences which
may enſue.</p>
               <p>4. This is implyed, by reading theſe words, <hi>Lead
us not,</hi> in this ſence, as ſome do, (which the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
will bear) thus; <hi>Let us n<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t be ſo led into
temptation, but that we may be delivered from the evil
conſequences thereof.</hi> I can pray abſolutely for this
mercy, and for all ſuch, as are abſolutely promiſed,
and warranted to thoſe who ask them in Fait: But,
I dare not to pray abſolutely for obtaining, or for
Deliverance from any outward thing, which I natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
moſt deſire or fear (no not from all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
proſperities or adverſities, joy or ſorrow, life or
death,) ſave with reference to Gods will; for, of
all theſe, (the laſt excepted) I have had experience,
whereby I finde that, through Gods Mercy, the
worſt (according to our opinion of them) have
been as profitable unto me as the beſt. I, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leave the giving, or taking them away, to Gods
good pleaſure; and all I abſolutely pray for, is,
that they may be directed, employed, ſuffered or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
to his glory, and my eternal Salvation; and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95657:94"/>
to this end we ought always to pray for deliverance
from thoſe <hi>Temptations</hi> which we are led into as well
by our <hi>ordinary callings</hi> as otherwiſe; and to be
watchful alſo, left by degrees, we are inſenſibly
ſurpriſed, by adventuring a little and a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
until by <hi>preſumption,</hi> we are loſt irrecoverably
before we are aware. I cannot deny, but that it
was a good prayer of <hi>Agur</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jaketh</hi> which
he prayed, <hi>Prov. 30. Give me neither poverty nor
riches, and feed we with food convenient for we, left
I be full and deny the Lord, or be poor and ſteal, to the
blaſpheming of his Name;</hi> yet, I cannot abſolutely
pray for any more then my <hi>Daily bread,</hi> but leave
the reſt to Gods Will, becauſe, I know that by
his Grace, we may glorifie him, both in <hi>poverty</hi>
and <hi>wealth,</hi> in <hi>proſperity</hi> and <hi>adverſity;</hi> and that
there are as well advantages as diſadvantages in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I am reſolved, God ſhall chuſe for me, as he
hath hitherto done; and that, though he ſhould not
provide for me hereafter as heretofore, or if I ſhall
increaſe both my wants, and my Enemies by proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutting
what I think to be my Duty, I will never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
put it unto adventure; for, though the
world more and more forſakes me, and my <hi>Friends</hi>
are grown leſs able and fewer then they were; and
fewer yet may be, (conſidering in what poſture we
are) I will whilſt God gives: me time and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
expreſs all that I think neceſſary to be ſaid to
this Generation, pertinent to the glory of God, or
the welfare of his people, when I finde it ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
whomſoever I may thereby diſpleaſe, if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
me, as faithful as I deſire to be, and as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he will.</p>
               <p>5. In the mean time I will proſecute what I know
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95657:95"/>
to be ſeaſonable; and ſince there are <hi>Temptations</hi>
which may have evil <hi>Conſequences</hi> in the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
actions and affairs of this life, into which God
leads us both for his glory, and for our good, and
in thoſe alſo which he permits for our probation (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we pray and endeavour for his aſſiſting Grace)
I deſire it may be better conſidered, how dangerous
thoſe <hi>Temptations</hi> are, which we wilfully run into
of our ſelves, contrary to Gods revealed Will, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
many precautions, counſels, exhortations, and
judgements both threatned and inflicted. What
will become of them who are nothing bettered, but
ſtill worſe and worſe, after a frequent intermixture
of <hi>Judgements</hi> and <hi>Mercies,</hi> playing with them, like
Fies about Candles, till their Wings are burnt;
and continue, even then, buzzing about them? or
like Children ſporting, at the mouth of a Waſps or
Hornets-neaſt, with theſe <hi>temptations,</hi> which will
ſting them to death? Some, who began with fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and being well contented with an honeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
gain, had ſufficient for their increaſing
charge; being tempted by opportunities whereby
they might grow rich by unlawful and diſhoneſt
dealings; and yeilding to the temptations, either
<hi>Covetouſueſs</hi> (being infatiable) inclines them to
all oppreſſions whereby it may be fed; or elſe,
<hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> allures them by one longing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and by living at the height of their <hi>Incomes</hi> to
ſatisfie every days luſt, according to the cuſtom of
<hi>Prodigals,</hi> until their longings being endleſs, and
<hi>Trading</hi> or <hi>Revenues</hi> failing by loſſes or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies,
they bring themſelves and their Children
either to debauchery or beggary; or to ſeek ſupply
by wicked courſes. Others are ſurpriſed by <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:95657:95"/>
of ſeveral kindes, whereinto they plunge
themſelves. Firſt, they go to <hi>Brothel houſes</hi> with
their Companions to ſee faſhions; then, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to improve their experience; and then alone,
to try their ſingle ſtrength, till they are overcome
by the temptation, enſnared and deſtroyed by
loathſome diſeaſes in their bodies, or, by that which
is more miſchievous to their Souls. Some do <hi>game</hi> at
at firſt, but for recreation, or to paſs away the time,
until they are ſo delighted with it, that they neglect
meat, ſleep, buſineſs, friends, and all other things,
as if there were no other time well ſpent: That,
brings on a covetous deſire to cheat other men of
their Eſtates by falſe play; and that Vice continues,
until meeting with more cunning <hi>Cheaters,</hi> then they
themſelves are, all their own is quite loſt, and no
means of ſubſiſtence left, except to turn <hi>Paraſite,
Pander, Marry a rich Whore,</hi> or ſteal and be hanged,
if they have no Friend at Court. The <hi>Drunkard</hi>
at firſt perhaps goes to the Tavern or Ale-houſe, but
to drink his mornings draught; a while after goes
early in the morning, and continues drinking till
midnight, or till the next day at noon. Or, at firſt
to entertain Friends, with whom he caſually meets;
then for neighbourhood-ſake; then under pretence
of the more conveniency to diſpatch buſineſſes;
then oftner to, play the good-fellow as he calls it;
and then every day to be drunk. When <hi>Dinah</hi>
went upon a needleſs idle viſit out of curioſity, to
ſee and complement with the daughters of the Land
where her Father ſojourned, ſhe was raviſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe returned, and horrible murthers and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie
enſued alſo thereupon. So, perchance it fares
otherwhile with our <hi>Ladies</hi> and <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95657:96"/>
frequent viſits, proceed not ſo much from civil or
friendly reſpects, as to ſee, and be ſeen, or to a
worſe intent: For though there be ſeeming paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of kinde endearments among them, while they
are together; as ſoon as they are parted, they oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
bitterly cenſute, ſcoff and jeer at each other;
or proſecute ſuch <hi>Feminine</hi> deſigns, as occaſion many
future temptations and evil conſequences, which
might be prevented by a modeſt and temperate uſe
of their Civil and Chriſtian Liberty in things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
and by hearkning with heed to wholeſome
cautions and counſels given; yea, though by
deſpiſed perſons; for it ſeems <hi>Job</hi> thought himſelf
obliged not to contemn it in his Servants; nor King
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> to neglect it in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> though a poor Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and a Slave. When this <hi>Joſeph</hi> went into the
houſe wherein his <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> was, to proſecute his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Affairs and his own; God, then led him into a
temptation, and preſerved him from the evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
which would elſe probably have enſued;
whereas, had he gone thither to ſpend the time
with her in vain complements, it is likely the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
would have prevailed according to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
But, there are ſome who preſume further then
any of thoſe aforementioned, For, when they have
ſo weakned their bodies, by long complying with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
temptation, that their fleſh is not able to
tempt them, as it hath done; and the <hi>Devil,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
alſo, thinks himſelf ſo ſure of them, that he
holds them not worth tempting; theſe do then
create temptations and unnatural provocations to
luſts, by luxurious meats, coſtly drinks, and unclean
repreſentations, till they become thereby miſerable
in body and ſoul; loathſome to God and man; and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95657:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make their own <hi>fleſh</hi> (which is a <hi>Dalilah</hi> prone e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of her ſelf) to betray them to all deſtructive
<hi>temptations;</hi> and ſhe (without whom, neither the
<hi>World,</hi> nor the <hi>Devil</hi> hath power to work upon
them) is made to be more prevalent by <hi>evil Cuſtom,</hi>
then ſhe was by <hi>corrupted nature,</hi> to bring upon
them irrecoverable miſchiefs. All premiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
the laſt Clauſe of this Petition, is daily, yea
always (as much as poſſible) to be minded, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
up with Faith in ſincerity; eſpecially for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from the <hi>Evil of Sin,</hi> by whoſe removal
all other evils are ſuperſeded.</p>
               <p>6. There are other <hi>temptations</hi> wherewith our
Grand Enemy, with his two Confederates the
<hi>Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> endeavoureth to enſnare us; and
are ſuch as may be numbred among <hi>ſpiritual wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes.</hi>
Theſe get entrance into thoſe out of
whom groſs ſins are expelled. The Root of theſe
<hi>wickedneſſes</hi> is double, PRIDE and DESIRE,
which corrupted the <hi>Devil</hi> and our <hi>Firſt-parents</hi> in
<hi>Heavenly places.</hi> It is written, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 6. 4. to
this effect; <hi>If men are once inlightned, have teſted of
the heavenly gift, were made partakers of the holy
Ghoſt, reliſhed the word of God, and the power of the
world to come, and then fall away; It is impoſſible for
them to be renewed by repentance: For they have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
unto themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put
him to open ſhame.</hi> The <hi>Roprobation</hi> of no ſmall
number in the <hi>Viſible Church,</hi> ſprings from hence; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of ſome, who have been eminent for their
knowledge in <hi>Divine Myſteries,</hi> and in thoſe gifts
which tend to the inſtruction and ſanctification of
others. Theſe are they who may be termed <hi>Stars
fallen from Heaven,</hi> or Angels, who having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95657:97"/>
their firſt Love, become Vaſſals to <hi>Antichriſt</hi>
in his Kingdom upon Earth, or Slaves to the <hi>Fleſh.</hi>
Many <hi>Saints</hi> have been in hazzard of this Apoſtacy,
by neglect of the preceding <hi>Caution,</hi> through car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſecurity; yet nave happily recovered (before
a total falling off) by their timely penitence, (God
caſting ſuch a look upon them, as Chriſt did on <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>)
and by their Faith endeavouring and praying
unto him acccording to the Contents of this Prayer.
Many are now in danger alſo, of having that <hi>Earth,</hi>
which by good husbanding may bring forth accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Fruit to all, ſo curſed, that it ſhall bring forth
nothing but Thiſtles, Thorns and Briers; which
<hi>curſe</hi> they might have avoyded by heedfuſneſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore;
and be yet delivered from it, by perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is poſſible as aforeſaid, and by taking more
heed hereafter how they fall into ſuch perilous
<hi>Temptations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. But, very many are in other modes deſtructively
inſnared into ſpiritual wickedneſſes by unheeded
<hi>temptations;</hi> and in what I next treat of, I ſhall
inſiſt upon what will concern ſome, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
will be very considerable at this time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
obſerve it. When they were in their pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
blood, without ability to help themſelves, and
without other helpers; God, caſting a pitiful eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and ſpeaking unto them by his <hi>Word,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
and made effectual by the co-operation of
the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> they became ſo far inlightned as to
ſee how vile they were by <hi>Nature,</hi> and to what
miſery that would have brought them, both in this
life and in that to come, if GOD, who loved
us firſt, even when we were his Enemies, had not of
his own accord provided a Remedy. This, ſo
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95657:97"/>
wrought upon them, that (partly out of love to
themſelves, and partly, in thankfulneſs for that
mercy) they gave him a portion of their Love, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom all was due, and who never leaves them
totally to themſelves, who have once given up unto
him their whole heart. Notwithſtanding this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi>
(ſomewhat reſembling that of <hi>Ananias</hi> and
<hi>Saphira)</hi> God, not ſeeming to heed it, as he did
their hypocriſie; theſe felt ſuch a ſweetneſs in thoſe
beginnings of a gratious influence, that they not
onely endeavoured to increaſe the Knowledge of
God and of his <hi>Truth;</hi> but, ſo alſo, to mortifie
the luſts of their <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that they attained to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
outward <hi>holineſs,</hi> beyond many other
profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> yea, to hazzard alſo their
Liberties and Eſtates in ſuffering for their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and for reproving <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Impiety.</hi> This,
got them ſo much love, among all thoſe good men
to whom they were known, that they heaped on
them many benefits and kindneſſes, to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing
of their ſufferings; with a ſurpluſage to the
augmenting alſo of their former poor Eſtates and
Reputations, until by degrees they grew rich in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities;
and from being contemptible, to be of
general eſteem; which revived in them a guſt
of <hi>carnal delights</hi> and <hi>accommodations,</hi> that, they
began to be weary of thoſe proſecutions, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they were ingaged, by what they had begun to
profeſs and practiſe in relation to the honour and
ſervice of God: And, though this ſecret Apoſtacy
they diſcovered not openly, the Devil diſcerning it by
many Symptoms, he and his Confederate the <hi>World</hi>
(knowing how uſeful ſuch <hi>perſons</hi> may be to their
ends, and to the upholding of their <hi>Kingdom</hi>)
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95657:98"/>
tempted them at the firſt, with an addition to their
livelyhood in certain, whereby they might be freed
from depending upon <hi>uncertain contributions,</hi> at
the will and pleaſure of their Benefactors: after
that, they doubled their favours upon them, as they
perceived them to operate for their purpoſe; and,
finding them ſo to fall away more and more, from
their Integrity, by thoſe temptations, that they
were, likely to be ſerviceable, to whatſoever they
ſhould employ them; the world then conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, the higheſt <hi>Dignities,</hi> which ſhe had
power to beſtow, and whereof their qualifications
made them ſeem capable. Then, theſe became
their <hi>ſervants</hi> in body and ſoul, ſo perfectly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
that both the <hi>light of Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi>
which formerly ſhined in them, were extinguiſhed;
GOD was quite forgot, with what concerned their
own eternal happineſs; and they bewitched with the
<hi>Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>Preferments</hi> of this life, repolluted
themſelves with all groſs ſins, as at the beginning,
Notwithſtanding all this <hi>back-ſtiding,</hi> ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboundant
is GODS long-ſuffering and patience,
that to reclaim ſome of theſe, before they arrived
at the hight of their wickedneſs and <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> he
gratiouſly intermingled <hi>Judgements</hi> and <hi>Mercies;</hi>
firſt humbling them again, by ſuch oppreſſions and
perſecutions, as they had inflicted upon others;
pouring ſuch contempt upon them, that it forced
them to <hi>wander where was no way,</hi> or <hi>abiding place,</hi>
and raiſing ſtorms which cauſed them to ſtagger to
and fro like drunken men, from one reſolution to
another; and brought them to ſome conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what they were likely to ſtumble into; and into
a fear, left the gods whom they laſt truſted in, had
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95657:98"/>
either for ſaken them, or were not able to help them;
This, a while, reduced them again to a little <hi>formal
Humiliation:</hi> but, before they had improved it into
a true <hi>Repentance,</hi> the <hi>World</hi> prevented it, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
what might keep them conſtant to her <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;</hi>
and, GOD permitting her to prevail (for
purpoſes by theſe unheeded) they recovered again
their loſt temporary hopes, Eſtates and Dignities,
with an advantage; and that makes them ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
our God Almighty ſo favours them, and is ſo
well pleaſed in all their compliances with <hi>Anti-chriſt</hi>
in his <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> that they more
malitiouſly, and more furiouſly perſecute them,
who proteſt againſt it, then heretofore; and are
fallen off a degree further form <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Penitence.</hi>
This is the condition of many, yet, even they who
have prevaricated in this mode, and ſlipt ſo deep,
and ſo far down into the Whirl-pool of <hi>Reprobation,</hi>
may be capable of recovery by Gods Mercy, if
whilſt life continues, the, can look up again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, by Faith, when the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhall
vouchſafe them another <hi>Call,</hi> as ſometimes he doth
at the brink of Hell; yea, delivers ſome of thoſe from
the evil of theſe Temptations, if they can heartily
joyn with the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> in this <hi>Prayer;</hi> to
which end (and to no worſe) I have offered this to
their conſideration, whom it may concern.</p>
               <p>9. Some other in a differing manner from theſe,
(and are as dangerouſly tempted unto wickedneſs)
having a beginning and progreſs in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> end
at laſt in the <hi>Fleſh</hi> alſo, through defect of due watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
and by being unmindful of praying for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from ſuch <hi>Temptations.</hi> Theſe, are ſuch
as being puffed up with a ſuperficial <hi>Knowledge</hi> of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95657:99"/>
ſome <hi>Divine Myſteries;</hi> (by <hi>External Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
by ſtrict obſervance of the <hi>Moral Law;</hi> by
ſuppoſed <hi>Revelations,</hi> by frequent <hi>Hearing, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and outward performances of Holy and <hi>Pious
Duties,</hi> by their gifts of <hi>Preaching, Propheſying,</hi>
or <hi>doing Miracles;</hi> or by a conſtancy in long and
<hi>extream ſufferings,</hi> or with ſuch-like) are ſo filled
with a Spiritual Pride, and overweening of their
own <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>perſonal Meritoriouſneſs,</hi> that they
ſeparate themſelves from all other <hi>Chriſtian Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
with ſuch an affected ſingularity, as may ſeem
to call out like <hi>Jehu, Come ſee our Zeal:</hi> For theſe
preſuming themſelves only (and thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to their <hi>Judgements</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi>) to be
<hi>the Elect of GOD,</hi> judge all other men to be in a
<hi>Reprobated condition;</hi> their <hi>Morality,</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> to be
but Fruits of the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> their <hi>Illuminations,</hi> to be
but <hi>Ignes fatuis,</hi> Phanatick Fires, and falſe lights,
how true ſoever: And (forgetting <hi>to do to others,</hi> as
they heretofore <hi>deſired other men ſhould do to them</hi>)
perſecute both with hand and tongue, as far as their
power will extend, all thoſe who are not in every
punctilio of their <hi>Judgment.</hi> And, not a few of
theſe, either fall at laſt into groſs fleſhly ſins, which
do ſhamefully bedurt them, before they are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
into an <hi>exemplary Repentance;</hi> or, elſe are
hardned into a final Obduracy. The <hi>pretended Piety</hi>
of ſuch as theſe, and the <hi>evident Prophaneneſs</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
have like two Mil-ſtones, ſo ground thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, who ſincerely profeſs and practice <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty</hi>
and <hi>Piety</hi> according to their Conſcience and
Underſtanding, that it hath almoſt rooted Peace out
of the world, and begotten, ſo inextricable a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that all reaſonable men ſtand at gaze to obſerve
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95657:99"/>
what it will amount unto at the laſt; For, ſince I
firſt knew the world, moſt things are ſo metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed
from what they then were, in my judgement,
that I ſee little eſſential difference between the
greateſt numbers, of thoſe who are <hi>Phanaticks</hi> repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and thoſe who ſo repute them; yea, there is ſuch
a change in their <hi>Countenances,</hi> in their <hi>Years,</hi> in
their <hi>Education,</hi> in their <hi>Habits,</hi> and in their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments,</hi>
both among <hi>ſubordinate Magiſtrates,</hi> and
thoſe under their <hi>Authority;</hi> In <hi>Governours</hi> of
<hi>Counties, Cities</hi> and <hi>Burroughs,</hi> and thoſe who are
to be <hi>governed;</hi> and in <hi>Reformers,</hi> with ſuch as
ſhould be <hi>Reformed,</hi> as if the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Tail</hi> had
changed places, and would hazzard the reducing all
into an <hi>Anarchy</hi> ere long.</p>
               <p>10. I have obſerved other mixt <hi>Temptations</hi> (partly
ſpiritual, and partly carnal) which it will concern us
both to ſtrive and pray againſt, leſt they draw us into
fleſhly pollutions before we are aware. One is, that
ſtrong natural affection which is frequently begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
between men and women, by a true eſteem of
the Piety and Moral Virtues which they mutually
apprehend in each other, and which had beginning
at firſt without any reſpect to their bodily Beauties &amp;
perfections: For, by long converſing together, finding
themſelves to be reciprocally much edified and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
by thoſe qualifications, it ſo inflames the
natural affection of the beſt diſpoſed perſons toward
each other; ſo inclines them to pitty their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
(if they have any) and ſometime ſo indears
their perſons, that otherwhile, their ſouls draw their
bodies to a nearer conjunction (though it be but
with a touch of the hand onely) then conſiſts with
the preſervation of a pure chaſtity, and by inflaming
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95657:100"/>
the blood before they are aware of it, brings them
by degrees into dalliances, indangering the coldeſt
temper, through overmuch confidence in their own
ſtrength, till modeſty perhaps is quite loſt. This
hath often happened, and brought ſome, who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
far from it, to a ſcandalous impudency at laſt,
and paſt ſhame and repentance in all other Vices:
From this hazzard, no man can be ſecured but by
earneſt praying for Gods aſſiſting Grace, and by
continual watching and endeavouring to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
from ſuch temptations: For even in perſons
virtuously and piouſly affected, there will often
revive an inclination to meet in private, to give and
take ſuch aids and conſolations, as they will think
needful; yea, at ſuch times, and in ſuch places alſo,
that unleſs God in Mercy prevents it, ſuch diſtempers
as aforeſaid, will not poſſibly be totally avoided,
cured or abated; nor their innocency eſcape
blaſting, though their converſations have been eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way blameleſs in all other reſpects: For, ſome
have had perſonal Experience of ſuch defamations,
betwixt whom there never paſſed a wanton word, or
ſo much as a familiar touch of each others hand;
and had alſo many ſufferings both in fleſh and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
by ſuch endearments, though they were provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially
led into them, without their own ſeeking,
which by Gods Mercy, produced comfortable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in the concluſion, as all thoſe temptations do,
whereinto God leads us for our probation; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them all, there is none more difficultly reſiſted,
in regard the moſt inticing allurements, of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
wantons, are not half ſo dangerouſly provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
as when the Devil takes advantage to unite
his endeavours with the frailty of the fleſh, to work
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95657:100"/>
upon virtuous &amp; pious Perſons; nor is the defaming
or polluting of any other ſo ſatisfactory to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
There is another <hi>temptation,</hi> whereby many
are inſnared, (and often as much, through wilfulneſs
as heedleſneſs) to the occaſioning both of carnal
and ſpiritual wickedneſes; and thereof St. <hi>Paul</hi>
counſels us to be wary, in theſe words, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14.
<hi>Be not unequally yoaked.</hi> For, when <hi>Believers</hi> joyn
themſelves in Marriage with <hi>Infidels,</hi> or with ſuch as
are nurſed up in <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
them to many perilous temptations, no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to <hi>Christians</hi> now, then it was to the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
heretofore; and the greateſt and wiſeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
are not more able to reſiſt them then <hi>Solomon</hi>
was: When the <hi>Sons of GOD took of the Daughters
of men to be their wives, Gen.</hi> 6. 2. they begot a <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
generation;</hi> and the like intermixture in
<hi>blood</hi> and <hi>repugnant Principles,</hi> hath made ſuch
<hi>Medlies</hi> and Mungrel broods of <hi>Profeſors</hi> in the
world, to the increaſing of <hi>Atheiſm, Hereſies</hi> and
<hi>Prophaneſs,</hi> that true <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>humanity</hi> will be in
hazzard of being rooted up, unleſs we heartily
pray and endeavour to be delivered from the evil of
this <hi>Temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. It is conſiderable alſo, whether we caſt not our
ſelves into many <hi>temptations</hi> whereinto God <hi>leads
us not,</hi> through overweening at leaſt; and thereby,
into <hi>ſufferings,</hi> which God requi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es not at our
hands: For, though God leadeth us into ſome <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,</hi>
either to be exemplary, or to prove us both
for his honour and our own; as when our <hi>Saviour</hi>
was <hi>led into the wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil,</hi>
with ſuch-like; (to which <hi>probations</hi> he always
gives an iſue for their advantage who are ſo led)
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95657:101"/>
yet, he ſometimes permits even his <hi>Elect,</hi> to weary
out themſelves in ſuch Attempts as they adventure
upon, by their own <hi>ſingle light,</hi> that, both they and
others may have experimental proofs, how unſafe
it is to depend upon ought unwarranted by his <hi>Word</hi>
and <hi>Spirit:</hi> Many have been deprived of their
hopes, and incurred alſo, temporary hazzards and
miſchiefs through defect of this heed. I think it
hot fitting more ſhould be impoſed upon men, by
men, then they are capable of; or, that we ſhould
judge between GOD and men in matters which he
hath reſerved to his own Judgement. Therefore,
without judging, or impoſing my Judgement upon
any, I do but onely offer mine (as I have often
ſaid) to be entertained or rejected, as it ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;
and to precaution thoſe who are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peremptory
in adhering to the Literal ſence of
<hi>ſingle Texts</hi> of <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> to examine well
whether it be conſonant to the <hi>Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi>
intended by the general ſcope of <hi>Gods Word.</hi>
For, either the <hi>Letter</hi> is vitiated, or the <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
in one of thoſe places, where contradiction is
evident. As for Example: St. <hi>James</hi> Chapt. 2. 9.
ſaith, <hi>If ye have reſpect to perſons ye commit ſin, and
are convinced of the Law as tranſgreſſors.</hi> From
this ſingle Text, ſome have taken occaſion to deny
<hi>Civil reſpects,</hi> not onely from one <hi>private perſon</hi> to
another, but to thoſe in <hi>Authority</hi> alſo; and pious
and honeſt men are deluded with this error. Denying
<hi>respect to perſons,</hi> appears to be reproveable by
St. <hi>Paul;</hi> for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. he not onely injoyns <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi>
(which is the greateſt perſonal reſpect) to
our <hi>Superiours,</hi> and to all in <hi>Authority;</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
a <hi>perſonal reſpect</hi> to all in general, according
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95657:101"/>
to their <hi>Civil Rights. Give,</hi> faith he, <hi>Tribute to whom
Tribute, Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom, fear to whom fear, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to whom Honour, and Love to whom love belongeth.</hi>
And the neglect of theſe Duties hath occaſioned
evil conſequents: For, this <hi>Precept</hi> is according to
the Will of GOD; and Sr. <hi>James</hi> intended nothing
thereunto repugnant, in the words aforementioned,
if rightly underſtood;as appears, by their contexture,
with what precedes: for he ſpeaketh not againſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
reſpects, but (as the plain words demonſtrate)
againſt reſpect of perſons, in relation to the Faith
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and in having leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
unto the poor, then unto the rich, in
diſpencing the benefits communicable indifferently
to all: as alſo againſt thoſe who are more inclined
to diſtribute Juſtice with partiality to them who
are in power, then righteouſly, unto them who are
weak and poor; and in thus miſunderſtanding other
Scriptures (to the heed whereof, this <hi>Hint</hi> may
perhaps lead ſome) many fall into dangerous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
which might be avoided, by not truſting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch
to their <hi>ſingle Talent;</hi> and by adding <hi>Divine
Light</hi> thereunto, with diligent endeavour, and
hearty prayer, to be delivered from the <hi>Evil of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, let us take heed that we are not more
tranſported by a natural ſtoutneſs and wilfulneſs of
heart, of by a proud ſcorn of our malitious Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
even in our moſt innocent ſufferings, then
carried on and ſupported by a true poverty of ſpirit
and Chriſtian meekneſs, for righteouſneſs ſake. For,
unleſs we be ſanctified with an humble ſubmiſſion to
Gods probations, our own ſtrength and innocency
will not preſerve us conſtant to the end, though it
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95657:102"/>
may carry us far. This <hi>Caution,</hi> few men may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
give then I; for, I have had experience of this
temptation, and that God will prove us, until we
are quite beaten out of all our vain hopes and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confidences, if there were ever any truth and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
in our hearts.</p>
               <p>12. <hi>Evil,</hi> is the laſt word in this <hi>Petition;</hi> and
for deliverance from it, is that whereto, all the
three laſt <hi>Petitions</hi> tend; for the abuſe even of the
means of our <hi>natural ſubſiſtence,</hi> and of the <hi>forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our Debts</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſſes,</hi> will oftentimes
have need of that deliverance. This EVIL is
twofold; the <hi>Evil of Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Evil of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Of the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Devil</hi> and we <hi>our ſelves</hi> only,
are both Authors, and Actors: And the <hi>Evil of
Puniſhment</hi>
proceds onely from Gods <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to give
the wicked their reward; and from his <hi>Mercy,</hi> to
correct and bring thoſe who are corrigible, to that
contrition which will produce Repentance,
rendring them capable alſo, of Love and Glory. <hi>Is
there any evil in the City,</hi> (ſaith a Prophet, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
God ſpeaking it) <hi>which I have not done?</hi>
Meaning the <hi>Evil of Puniſhment.</hi> This <hi>Evil,</hi> GOD
is pleaſed ſometimes to inflict immediately with
his own hand; ſometimes, the <hi>Devil</hi> is his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner;
ſometimes, <hi>wicked men;</hi> ſometimes, he
makes the <hi>Saints</hi> inſtrumental therein, by rubbing
them againſt each other, (to the grievance both
of their <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi>) till like <hi>Diamonds</hi> they
poliſh each other; and ſometimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he makes men to
be Executioners of his Judgements upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
This being part of my <hi>Meditations</hi> upon
the Body of this <hi>Prayer,</hi> I now come to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="epilogue">

               <head>The Epilogue.</head>
               <head type="sub">For, thine is the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory for ever.</head>
               <p>1. THis <hi>Epilogue,</hi> or Concluſion of the preceding
Prayer, is a <hi>Doxology,</hi> implying that <hi>Praiſe,</hi>
or <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> ought to be inſeparable from <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi>
the acknowledging of one Mercy, being the
readieſt way to obtain another. It is annexed to
the Prayer by this cauſal FOR, which gives us a
ſufficient Reaſon to incourage our praying unto
our Father with Faith unwavering, in regard he is
not onely our <hi>Father;</hi> but a <hi>King</hi> alſo, and not
without a Kingdom, as many have been, meerly
<hi>titulary;</hi> or a King of a Kingdom, not able to
ſecure it ſelf from forraign Invaſions, or Domeſtick
Rebellions, but of <hi>The Kingdom,</hi> which extends
throughout <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> yea, into <hi>Hell;</hi> and
whereto all other <hi>Kings, Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> are
Vaſſals and tributaries, expellable at his pleaſure.
A Kingdom it is, both Powerful and Glorious; The
<hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>King</hi> thereof are <hi>Eternal:</hi> It hath
no pretenders laying claim thereto, occaſioning
ſuch quarrels as happen in <hi>Elective Kingdoms,</hi> or
ſuch miſchiefs as are frequent, where it being <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary,</hi>
the next Heir, is a Fool or a Tyrant, or
both (neither regardful of his Duty to God or man)
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95657:103"/>
yet, muſt be preferred before his Brethren, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the wiſeſt and uprighteſt men in the Land,
though it will be to the deſtruction of <hi>himſelf</hi> and
his <hi>people.</hi> All the <hi>Laws</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom;</hi> All the
<hi>Prerogatives,</hi> this King claimeth, are ſo Universally
righteous, that, not one of his <hi>Subjects</hi> murmures
at them; Therein, are no <hi>Cuſtoms, Preſcriptions</hi> or
<hi>Preſidents</hi> pleadable to infringe their Freedoms, or
occaſioning the renewing of <hi>Charters:</hi> For, this
<hi>Kings</hi> Juſtice, Favour and Love are ſo generally, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually,
and impartially extended, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
that they are all <hi>Comites Palatini,</hi> Count
Palatines of his <hi>Royal Palace,</hi> admitted unto a
<hi>Kingſhip</hi> with his beſt beloved Son, in the ſame
Kingdom; and inveſted with his Power and Glory.
Oh! the inexpreſſible Love and Mercy of GOD,
to <hi>Mankinde!</hi> On which of the <hi>Angels</hi> hath he
conferred this Dignity? what deſpicable things are
the greateſt Kings of the earth, in reſpect of his
meaneſt ſubject! Who that conſiders this, would
dread their Frowns, or dote upon their Favours, ſo
much, as to obey their commands in oppoſition to
his whatſoever ſufferings expoſed unto, by their
fury in this ſhort life ? or, who that is not grown
more brutiſh then a Beaſt, can be doubtful or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that be who provided ſuch unſpeakable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
for his <hi>Elect</hi> at ſo dear a rate, as the life-blood
of his beſt beloved Son, will leave them
deſtitute of any thing they pray for in his Name, that
is neceſſary to carry them through this World, in
proſecution of thoſe ſervices which he ſent them
hither to perform; if they remember he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
all neceſſaries for them, who firſt ſeek the
Kingdom of Heaven, and the righteouſs thereof?
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95657:103"/>
And who can be ſo ſtupid, into whom this <hi>Kingdom</hi>
is entred in any meaſure, as not to pray heartily it
may come quickly?</p>
               <p>2. I had here concluded my <hi>Meditations</hi> at this
preſent, both concerning this <hi>Kingdom</hi> and this
<hi>Prayer;</hi> but I perceive that as well ſome Subjects of
this Kingdom, as the Soveraigns and Subjects
of Kingdoms upon earth, do much miſtake their
Priviledges, and by their Intrenchments on both
ſides, as alſo, by their mutual jealouſneſs (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
without juſt cauſe) acting againſt each other
to the deſtroying of their own peace. I have ſaid
a little for prevention thereof in my Meditation
upon the <hi>ſecond Petition,</hi> but it will be neceſſary to
iterate ſomewhat to that purpoſe. For, the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Magiſtrate</hi> ſuppoſing all things whatſoever,
to be diſpoſable at his will and pleaſure, whether it
concerns God, or the People, (in their Eſtates or
Conſidences) are jealous none can be truely Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to their Perſons or Governments, who chuſe
rather to ſuffer then obey their Commands, though
ſuch believe theſe Commands are repugnant to
Gods; and though they intend nothing deſtructive
to humane Authorities, in ought unqueſtionably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
thereto; nor ſeek to avenge themſelves for
any real or ſuppoſed wrong ſuſtained, but, leave
that to God. Their <hi>Subjects</hi> in like manner, yea ſome
of them, belonging to <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdom (mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking
the true nature thereof) ſuppoſe their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
even in ſpiritual concernments, are to be vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
and eſtabliſhed by the <hi>temporal Sword</hi> in their
own hands, give occaſion otherwhile alſo, of the
aforeſaid Jealouſies, and of bringing evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
thereby on themſelves and others. It is
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95657:104"/>
true, that the <hi>temporal Sword</hi> belongs to the <hi>civil
Magiſtrate,</hi> whether <hi>Monarchical, Ariſtocratical</hi> or
<hi>Democratical,</hi> for defence of their Countries and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Intereſts and to execute Juſtice upon Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
for preſerving Righteouſneſs and Peace
within their proper Juriſdictions, and between
them and their Neighbours: It is permitted alſo to
private men, for defence of their juſt Rights and
Poſſeſſions from unlawful violence; but not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable
to avenge their perſonal wrongs at their
own pleaſure; becauſe, it will occaſion evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
both in <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Civil reſpects.</hi> Nor is
the <hi>Sword</hi> intended to be in the <hi>Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi>
hand to deſpoil other men of their juſt
Rights, or to get a vain honour by Conqueſts; or to
exerciſe it upon the perſons of men, to inforce their
Conſciences contrary to their belief in matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to God, and the Salvation of the Soul: For,
that is meer <hi>Turciſm</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian Tyranny,</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
practiſed by the worſt of <hi>Heathens,</hi> until the
<hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> began to work; in regard, the
propagation and ſetling of <hi>Truth,</hi> in the Profeſſion
and practice of <hi>Religion,</hi> muſt be endeavoured by
the <hi>Spiritual Sword,</hi> and thoſe Inſtruments which
are not carnal. Therefore, they who profeſs
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> (whatſoever Piety or Zeal they pretend to
his honour and <hi>Kingdom</hi>) and yet ſeek to force
other men to believe and practice as they do, by
perſecuting them in Body or Eſtate, are therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
with <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> and do not that to other
men, which they would that other men ſhould do
unto them. It will concern them very ſeriouſly to
conſider this, who are lately made ſenſible of that
in their own perſons, whereof they were inſenſible
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95657:104"/>
in the perſons of their, Brethren; For, uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
cenſurings, revilings, or an <hi>Offenſive Sword,</hi>
appertains not to the <hi>Saints</hi> in any private avenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though at ſometimes a <hi>Defenſive Sword</hi> may
be more needful then their <hi>Garments,</hi> as appears by
the words of <hi>Chriſt, Luke</hi> 22. 36. and then it may
be uſed for their ſafeguard; not to avenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
no, not to avenge the blood of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in ſuch manner as many conceive it may:
For, it is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 5, 6. that it is <hi>He</hi> who IS,
and WAS and SHALL BE, <hi>that Judgeth them,
who ſhed the blood of the Saints, and who ſhall give
them blood to drinks, as they have deſerved.</hi> And,
they whom he ſhall employ to make uſe of that
Sword, to do execution upon the BEAST, and the
<hi>Mother of Harlots,</hi> (ſo far forth as it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite)
ſhall be her own <hi>Vaſſals</hi> and <hi>Confederates.</hi>
St. <hi>John</hi> alſo ſaith. <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. the <hi>ten Horns</hi> or <hi>Kings,</hi>
which received power with the BEAST, and being
of one minde with him, in joyning their powers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Lamb,</hi> ſhall hate the <hi>Whore,</hi> make her
deſolate, naked, eat her fleſh, and burn her with
Fire. God, will put it into their hearts to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his will upon her, though, until his time
cometh they ſhall outwardly ſubmit unto the <hi>Beaſt;</hi>
and both they, and the <hi>Whore</hi> which rides her,
diſſemble with each other, till the day of her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deſolation; and then, as it is propheſied,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 15. 3. the Song of the Saints ſhall be to this
effect.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Great, and wondrous are thy Deeds,</l>
                  <l>LORD the, <hi>Saints</hi> Almighty King:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> from thee proceeds,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>True</hi> thou art in every thing.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:95657:105"/>
Fear'd, and glorified, O Lord!</l>
                  <l>Thou ſhalt be of every one;</l>
                  <l>And, of Nations all ador'd;</l>
                  <l>For, thou holy art, alone:</l>
                  <l>And, thy <hi>Judgements</hi> every where,</l>
                  <l>Fully manifeſted are.</l>
               </q>
               <p>3. This I conceive to be the meaning of that
Prophecy, and that the power of <hi>Chriſts Word,</hi>
which is called a <hi>Sword proceeding out of his month,</hi>
better beſeems the Dignity of the <hi>Saints,</hi> then that
which is committed to the Hangman, and to every
Ruffian-like-Souldier; though the uſe of that
<hi>Sword</hi> is honourable, when employed as it ought
to be. The <hi>Saints</hi> (who are often ſubject to the
ignorances and infirmities common to men) ſhould
well conſider (as I believe they will) what diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
it hath been, and may be unto themſelves
and their Brethren, to pretend unto the <hi>Civil ſword,</hi>
until God puts it unqueſtionably into their hands;
and mean while betake themſelves to that onely,
which is proper to their <hi>Warfare;</hi> not ſuppoſing
all the Actions of the <hi>Saints</hi> recorded in the <hi>Old
Teſtament,</hi> are to be exemplary Rules to us, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, wherein they did well: For, though to
<hi>Joſuah, David</hi> and others the <hi>temporal ſword</hi> was
proper to the work they had to do, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
that temporal Inheritance, which God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to his people, and to avenge him upon his and
their Enemies; and is ſo now in their hands, to
whom it is given to the like purpoſes: yea, though
under the <hi>Law,</hi> to take an eye for an eye, a tooth
for a tooth, and to give rewards to their Enemies
according to their Cruelty; yet, by the Doctrine
of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Goſpel; it is not ſo lawful in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95657:105"/>
and private quarrels; for we are thereby
taught <hi>to do good for evil;</hi> To ſeek their welfare
who perſecute us, and not ſo much as to pray againſt
their perſons, but onely; againſt their wickedneſs;
much leſs then are we to plot, or combine againſt
the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> whereunto God hath ſubjected us,
notwithſtanding we are oppreſſed thereby, but muſt
wait patiently for deliverance by him in his own
way, and in his own time. This is my private
Judgement; which, having, not without Cauſe
declared, I leave thoſe who are contrarily minded,
unto their own opinions, until Gods <hi>Judgements</hi>
or <hi>Mercies</hi> have wrought it out of them: For,
though ſome perhaps may think it would ſtrengthen
the hands of Perſecutors and Oppreſſors, if this
were generally profeſſed and practiſed; I know this
is agreeable to the <hi>patience of the Saints;</hi> and that
they who <hi>kill with the Sword,</hi> in avengement of
their own Cauſe, to the ſcandalizing of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Profeſſion, (and to the expoſing others to a
deſtructive ſuſpition) ſhall at laſt <hi>periſh by the ſword,</hi>
or, by ſomewhat equivalent thereto, either in their
own hands, or in the hands of thoſe Avengers,
whom God will animate or permit to execute
Juſtice, both againſt <hi>private</hi> and <hi>publick Vſurpers</hi> of
the <hi>temporal ſword,</hi> how politick, powerful, holy or
ſecure ſoever they think themſelves to be, <hi>Revel.</hi>
13. 10. Therefore, as it is written in the laſt words

               <p>4. <hi>For Ever,</hi> This word EVER, is of a larger
extent, in this place, then it uſually hath; and ſignifies
as much as <hi>Eternally.</hi> For, the <hi>Perſon</hi> to whom this
<hi>Kingdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> appertaineth, being E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xternal
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95657:106"/>
ſo are alſo his <hi>Kingdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Glory;</hi>
whereas, when other Kingdoms, or any thing elſe,
is ſaid to be <hi>For Ever,</hi> we are not to underſtand
them to be <hi>Everlaſting without end;</hi> but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſo long onely, as the <hi>perſons</hi> or their <hi>Poſterity,</hi>
on whom they are conferred, ſhall continue in being,
and in performing the Conditions whereupon they
are granted; or, during the Term limited and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained
by the <hi>Granter,</hi> to the things granted; and
this <hi>King, Kingdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> being as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
without <hi>Beginning, Limitation,</hi> or <hi>Condition</hi>
premiſed, are <hi>Co-eternal.</hi> The meaning of this
word <hi>Ever,</hi> is here to be thus largely taken; and the
true Nature of it, is rightly underſtood and made
uſe of in that ſence, by the Profeſſors of our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law</hi>
here in <hi>England,</hi> as the meaning of our
Law: For when Lands or Tenements are given
and granted by Deed to any man <hi>For Ever,</hi> he hath
an Eſtate therein, but during the term of his life
onely; that being his <hi>perſonal Ever:</hi> but, when it
is given and granted <hi>unto him and his Heirs for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
they have all a perpetual Intereſt of Right
thereunto, whilſt the world laſteth, and any Heir
of his therein ſurviveth.</p>
               <p>VVith reſpect to the particulars expreſſed in
theſe <hi>Meditation,</hi> I do offer up this Prayer to
God implicitely by intention, (though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
in words) at all times; and having often
ſpoken it in the <hi>Original,</hi> and in the words of our
Engliſh Tranſlations in Proſe, I will now ſpeak it
Paraphras'd in the Metrical words and Language of
my Engliſh <hi>Muse.</hi>
