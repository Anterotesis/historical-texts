            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
CONSIDERATION
VPON THE LATE
CANONS.</head>
            <p>THat the late Canons are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validous,
it will easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
and that they are so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
in the foundation,
or rather in the founders of
them, I will assume upon my selfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
having first intimated my sence
by way of preparative.</p>
            <p>The Pope (as they say) hath a triple
Crowne, answerable thereunto, and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that, hee pretends to have a threefold
Law. The first is, <hi>jus divinum, Episcopacie
by divine right;</hi> and this hee would have
you thinke to be the Coronet next his head,
that which doth circle and secure his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Our Bishops have (in an unlucky time)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93918:3"/>
entred their plea and pretended title to this
Crowne, <hi>Episcopacy by divine right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is <hi>Ius humanum, Constantin's</hi>
donation, the gift of indulgent Princes;
Temporal power. This Law belongs to his
second, or his middle Crowne; already
also pleaded for by our Prelates in print.</p>
            <p>These two Crownes being obtained, he
(the Pope) doth frame and make his third
Crowne himselfe, and setts that upmost,
upon the toppe—This Crowne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
hath its Law, and that is <hi>Ius Canonicum,</hi>
the Canon law, of more use unto his Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
then both the other—Iust so
our Prelates from the pretended divinity of
their Episcopacy, and from the temporall
power granted by our Princes they would
now obtrude a new <hi>Canon-Law</hi> upon us.</p>
            <p>They have charged their <hi>Canons</hi> at us to
the full, and never fearing that ever they
would recoyle backe into a Parliament
they have rammed a prodigious ungodly
oath into them.</p>
            <p>The illegality and invalidity of these
Canons (as I conceive) is easily discovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by one short question, <hi>viz.</hi> what doe
you call the meeting wherein they were
made? give it a name to know it by: who
can frame his argument aright unlesse hee
can first tell against what hee is to argue?
would you confute the <hi>Convocation?</hi> they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93918:3"/>
were a <hi>holy Synod?</hi> would you argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Synod?</hi> why they were <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,</hi>
would you dispute the <hi>Commission?</hi>
they will mingle all powers together, and
answer that they were some fourth thing,
that we neither know nor imagine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quo teneam nodo mutantem Protea?</hi> unlesse
they will unriddle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves, &amp; owne what
they were, we may prosecute, but hardly
with concludent arguments. Yet I venture.</p>
            <p>I have conferred with some of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of these new Canons, but I professe
clearely, that I could never yet meete with
any one of that assembly, who could (in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of their meeting) well answer me the
first question in the Catechisme, what is
your name? Alas, they are parted before
they know what they were when they were
together.</p>
            <p>The summe of the severall answers, that
I have received, doth amount to this.
They were a <hi>Convocationall—Synodicall—assembly
of Commissioners,</hi> indeede a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<hi>Chimaera,</hi> a monster to our Lawes, a
<hi>Cerberus</hi> to our Religion.</p>
            <p>A strange <hi>Commission</hi> wherein no one
Commissioners name is to bee found. A
strange Convocation that lived when the
Parliament was dead: A strange <hi>holy Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi>
where one part never saw, never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firred
with the other.—But indeede
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93918:4"/>
what use or need of conference, if that bee
true of these Canons, which I reade of the
former ones, <hi>Notum est Canones formari
Lambethae, priusquàm in Synodo ventilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus farre preparatory. I proceede to
my argument, whereby to manifest the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity
of these Canons, not borrowing
but avoiding what have formerly beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced
by others.</p>
            <p>I will neither inveigh upon them as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Commissioners,</hi> nor infirme them as
the worke of a dead <hi>Convocation;</hi> But will
take them in the capacity of their owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
title of a <hi>Synod.</hi> Such they bragged
themselves to bee whilest they sate: Such
they stile themselves in the Title-page of
these (never to be Canonized) Canons—The
words are—<hi>Canons treated upon in
Convocation—agreed upon in Synod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus treating in one capacity and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in another: is a new mould to cast Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
in never used before. Canons bredde,
in a Convocation, borne in a Synod. Thus
although wee finde not one good father,
here are yet two mothers to one illfavored
child; never knowne before, nor imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
but of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> whom the Poet calls
among other attributes—<hi>Solúmque bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matrem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceede, if their meeting be a Synod,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93918:4"/>
eyther it is so by <hi>Donation,</hi> by <hi>Election,</hi> or
onely by <hi>Vsurpation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Donation</hi> from the King, is this title and
authority, indulged to them by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie:
Looke through all his highnesse Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Patents, and they are not once saluted
with the ambitious title of a <hi>Synod.</hi> Yet
in the Canons they have assumed it seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
times, it is their owne pride, their
owne presumption.</p>
            <p>The King hath not done it, (pardon me)
no Prince ever did it or can doe it; no power
Regall, Imperiall, or Papall did ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it, to ordaine that <hi>William,</hi> &amp; <hi>Richard,
Mathew</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp;c. and I know not who
more, being met and assembled upon other
summons shall by a <hi>Commission</hi> be on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
translated from what they were, into an
unthought-of <hi>nationall Synod,</hi> without
voyce or choyse of any man to bee concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
this never was done, this never can be
well done.</p>
            <p>As for due election for such meetings,
this indeede is or ought to bee of the true
<hi>esse</hi> to a Legitimate <hi>Synod.</hi> But due election
made up by voyces is so much a stranger
to this <hi>Synod,</hi> that their fatherhoods
will confesse that they were never trusted to
this <hi>Synod,</hi> as a <hi>Synod</hi> by any, either of the
Clergy or of the Laity.</p>
            <p>Concerning the choise of a few of them,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93918:5"/>
and but a few (about 50. as I guesse) cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
to the Convocation house, that will
never render them a lawfull Synod, untill
they can prove <hi>metamorphosis</hi> and <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation.</hi>—For
the votes of all their
chusers upon expiration of the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
house returned backe home to every
mans bosome from whence they breathed.
So that if you will en-live the same men to
bee now <hi>Synodall,</hi> who were before but
Convocationall, you must renew the old
<hi>Pythagorean Transmigration,</hi> for they want
the breath and life of an <hi>election.</hi> A new
one you have not, and the old one is not to
be had but by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Besides I do affirme &amp; shall approve, that
the electors to a <hi>Convocation</hi> and to a <hi>Synod</hi>
are not all one. The Clergie only doe, and
of right onely ought to chuse unto the
Convocation house. The reason; we of the
Laity (so they will call us) have our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Commons where our Trustees by
vertue of our voyces doe sit at the same
time. But in the choice unto a <hi>Synod,</hi> wee
who must be bound by the determinations
of the <hi>Synod,</hi> ought also to be interessed in
the parties determining. This is cleare
enough in reason, and will bee better clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
presently.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Synods</hi> I finde five severall sorts, first
a generall or universall Synod; secondly,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93918:5"/>
Patriarchichall, Thirdly National, fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Provinciall; fiftly a Diocesan Synod. I
passe by the two first and last, as not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to this time and affaire. Concerning
Provinciall and Nationall Synods a word
or two; If I knew which to call their late
meeting. They runne on in riddles: and I
want <hi>Oedipus</hi> at every turne.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Canons,</hi> were they forged in one
Synod <hi>Nationall,</hi> or in two <hi>Proncialls?</hi>—were
they two Provinciall Synods? how
then come their Actes and Canons to bee
imbodyed together? how comes it to passe
that all the Canons speake in the singular
number? The <hi>Synod; The holy Synod;
The Sacred Synod.</hi> Sacred will now be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
granted, unlesse as the Poet doth,—<hi>Auri
sacra fames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was it then but one? was it a <hi>Nationall
Synod?</hi> why the Provinces (wee all know)
never did convene, they never met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Looke on the representative body of
the Commons of this whole Land: every
one within the same walles hearing every
ones argument, and thereupon mending,
altering, and (as occasion is) correcting his
own judgement, &amp; afterwards (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,) joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in unanimous consent. And if the able
members of the North beyond <hi>Trent</hi> were
divided fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest, there would be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found a want of their worth and weight,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93918:6"/>
nor could their sitting at the same time at
<hi>Yorke,</hi> make the rest a house of Commons
here, for the whole Kingdome must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
entire.</p>
            <p>But as we have done the Title <hi>Synod,</hi> so
let us give them the attribute Nationall,
a <hi>Nationall Synod,</hi> and yet see how inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and invalidous they are!</p>
            <p>The very <hi>esse</hi> of every Synod doth sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in a double foundation. <hi>Fundamentum
materiale</hi> and <hi>fundamentum formale.</hi>—The
due materialls of a <hi>Synod</hi> are the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
qualities and indowments of the
persons where of the <hi>Synod</hi> consisteth, not
their externall dignityes and promotions.
And therefore every man thus qualified is
as capable to bee of the <hi>Synod,</hi> as any
<hi>Deane</hi> or <hi>Archdeacon</hi> of them all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fundamentum formale,</hi> is <hi>Delegatio
ab ecclesia &amp; debita electio.</hi> A due choyce
to be made by all that are or shall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the determinations of the <hi>Synod:</hi>
and this trust of choyce may fall upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, as well and as soone as upon
<hi>Deane</hi> or <hi>Archdeacon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not quarell the want of able parts
in any the members of that late doubtfull
dangerous meeting: I grant them the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls
of a true <hi>Synod,</hi> but will insist one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the second, want of forme, want
of due election: which if they want the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93918:6"/>
most virtuall and most obliging tye, and the
most binding part is wanting.</p>
            <p>That they had no such election, we need
not goe forth to prove; No one man in
the Kingdome can say that he gave a voice
to the election of any one <hi>Deane</hi> or <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon</hi>
to sit for him in that <hi>Synod,</hi> nor
were the Clarkes chosen by all who were
to be bound. So then there remaineth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bee proved this. That such election
of persons, by all persons to be concerned
in the Decrees, and Canons, is necessary to
the constituting of a lawful Synod; which
is all one as to say, that the elections to a
<hi>Synod</hi> ought to by, both be the Clergy and
the Laity.</p>
            <p>I will trouble you but with one reason,
and a very few instances, all br<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifely.</p>
            <p>The Acts and Canons of every Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Nationall Councell or Synod, ought
to binde the whole Nation both Laity
and Clergie: But this cannot bee reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and just, if the Laity bee excluded
both from consultation and from choyce
of consulters. The reason is plaine. It is
ground in nature, and so confessed upon
this very case by Dr. <hi>Feild,</hi> who hath it
out of <hi>Occom—quod omnes
tangit ab omnibus tractari debet.</hi> And this
is so cleare a maxime, that in this very sence
also; for the Laity to be present at Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93918:7"/>
this very <hi>Aphorisme</hi> is used by the
Pope in his own glosse upon the Canonist
<hi>Gratian. Quod omnes tangit ab omnibus
tractari debet.</hi> Surely our Clergie are much
too high, if herein they would outgoe the
very Canons of the Papall Synods, and
conclude that which shall binde all, where
all are not admitted to treate; neither by
themselves nor by proxy.</p>
            <p>Now the benefit of this Law of nature
and of Reason (as Dr. <hi>Field</hi> calleth it) we
clayme. The present <hi>Canons</hi> doe concerne
us. I may be a Church-warden, my sonne
may bee a Master of Art; then must I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
upon their yet unborne articles, and
he must sweare their oath of Covenant—well,
they were never trusted by us unto a
<hi>Synod,</hi> and therefore ought not to tye us
up un-heard, it is against <hi>nature</hi> and
<hi>reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To second this Argument by instance
in proofe of practice, I shall produce a few,
and but a few of many examples and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities:
the originalls I cannot now
Command, but must bee content to name
a few extracts, which by way of transcript
doe walke along with my <hi>vademecum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The point that I would establish is this,
that in <hi>Synods</hi> and Councells where Lay
men are concerned in the Decrees, there
the Laity ought to be present to consult
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93918:7"/>
if not also to decide the conclusions. I will
but point, I will not enlarge to the vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every place <hi>verbatim;</hi> Dr. <hi>Feild,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Fulke, Goulartius,</hi> are cleare and positive in
this point.</p>
            <p>Our Statutes for correcting &amp; gathering
together the former <hi>Canons</hi> into a new
body, doe clearely evidence this unto us;
in all which there is an equall proportion
mixed, sixteene of the Clergie and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Laity.</p>
            <p>The Author of the history of <hi>Trent</hi> is
frequent in this point, adding this for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that in a <hi>generall Councell,</hi> the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
Church cannot bee represented if the
Laity be excluded. So by the rule <hi>a pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus:</hi>
The reason holdeth the same, a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Councell</hi> cannot represent a Nation
if but one degree of men, men of one qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and capacity be onely present, and the
rest altogether excluded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gratian,</hi> the Canonist doth allow the
Laity to bee present, especially in such
Councells as doe treate of faith, and for
proofe doth vouch Pope <hi>Nicolas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will omit many proof<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of many Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
being personally present and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
in many Councells, by themselves
and sometimes by their vicegerents, as
<hi>Marcellinus, Candidianus, Martianus,</hi> &amp;c.
yet even this is argumentative for us, and a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93918:8"/>
preservative of our right, for the Laity to
be present.</p>

            <p>Thus much for humane testimonie, I
have done with my hasty notes, onely I
adde this, and I beseech you to intend it.</p>
            <p>Whilest we of the Laity had our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93918:8"/>
and voices to chuse our owne Ministers,
and our owne Bishops, (which was our
ancient right, constantly allowed &amp; practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the best Primitive times, whereof
the proofes are yet evident enough) so
long (I say) we might trust them in a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi>
whom wee first had trusted to direct
and guide our soules in all the ministeriall
function.—But to conclude us up now
and shut us out contrary to the Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>Reason,</hi> contrary to ancient usages:
not to admit us to determination, nay to
exclude us from consultation, and after all
to take from us all assent both in choyse
and in refusall of Pastors to be set over us,
and yet to binde us by decres so made, may
prove (I feare) no lesse then soule-tyranny.
I doe not presse the deserved right of our
choyse of Pastors: but one thing more,
lend me patience to adde as supreme <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronis</hi>

not one in all the world, the Apostles were
but eleven, perhaps not numbred in this

This may perhaps be objected and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought to bee prevented, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
clearing whereof, observe (I pray)
the next verse, <hi>v.</hi> 13. where in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
it is said of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>And after they held their peace, ergo</hi>
they had spoken. And therefore the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
who collected together a body of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
<hi>(Peter Crabbe the German)</hi> doth even
from this place inferre a consent of the
people saying, <hi>Tacuit omnis multitudo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiens

            </p>
            <p>But if you would have this more cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evidenced beyond all exceptions, I
pray take notice of the resolution of this
Synod, <hi>verse 22. Then pleased it the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Elders with the whole Church.</hi> With
the whole Church, what is that? The bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Apostles and their fellow labourers
did not engrosse, and (as our Church-men
affect to doe) usurpe and monopolize the
word Church, as proper onely to Church-men.—No
you shall finde it even in the
<hi>Epigraphe</hi> of the Canons and Decrees of
this true, holy, and sacred <hi>Synod,</hi> that the

with the blessed Apostles although
Pope and Patriarch, Primate and Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan,
Archbishop and Bishops, yea even
downe to Deane and Archdeacon: (I have
heard it) doe dispise the thought of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the Laity. I do not say to decision,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93918:10"/>
but even to Consultation, nay to the very
choyce of consulters in Religion: nay
lower even so much as to have a negative
power, when a man of inabilitie, and of ill
life is obtruded upon them; I proceed, for
I would not <hi>orare</hi> but <hi>probare,</hi> looke <hi>verse
23.</hi> They that were present had voyce,
They who voiced the <hi>Canons,</hi> joyned in
the decree, and sending the decree unto
<hi>Antioch.</hi> The words are thus, <hi>The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles

to the Brethren which are in Antioch, &amp;c.</hi>
Here the <hi>Brethren</hi> at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> are (with
the <hi>Apostles</hi> and the <hi>Elders</hi>) actors in and

There is no evasion, no clusion, to
be had, unlesse you can prove that all the

            <p>Thus much in way of pursuit for this

            <p>The state of this inquirie may bee this,
<hi>viz.</hi> whether the Ministers of Christs
Kingdome may receive worldly titles, and
execute worldly offices and powers? or
more generally thus: Whether a Clergy
man may <hi>semel &amp; simul,</hi> be both a Clergy
man and a Layman, in power, office and
authotity over other men in both kinds?</p>
            <p>Goe we to the fountaine head (<hi>Luke 22.
24) There was a strife among them</hi> (the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles)
<hi>which of them should bee accompted the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93918:13"/>
greatest;</hi> which of the twelve soever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
this emulation of power. Certaine
it is that the two soones of <hi>Zebedee, Iames</hi>
and <hi>Iohn</hi> with their mother first presumed
(<hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 20.) to come and aske the highest
places of honour (next to the very throne)
in the Kingdome of <hi>Christ;</hi> which King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was conceited by them shortly after
to be raised in the splendour of this world:
This is genuinely gathered from this very
story, generally confessed, &amp; clearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in the historie of the Acts, &amp;c.
where the Apostles doe aske our Saviour,
even after his resurrection saying (<hi>Acts
1. 6.) Lord wilt thou at this time restore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the Kingdome to Israel.</hi> Therefore to
these two brethren and their mother, so
much mistaken in the nature of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
he maketh answer (<hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 22.) yee
<hi>know not what you aske.</hi> He presently shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the entertainement of his Kingdome, A
<hi>cup to drinke of,</hi> that many were like to pray
<hi>might passe from them;</hi> but they answer
they <hi>are able to drinke thereof.</hi> This their
answer as it proved true in all the twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
so by the providence of God, one
of these two brothers (<hi>Acts 12. <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>) Iames,</hi>
was the first of all the rest, who dranke the
cup of Martyrdome, and as some thinke
<hi>Iohn</hi> was the last of the Apostles.</p>
            <p>Equalls looke awry on the ambition of
their fellowes. These two were vaine in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93918:14"/>
their high request, and the other ten mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured
at their presumption (<hi>Math. 20. 24.)
They were moved with indignation</hi> saith Saint
<hi>Matthew: (Mar. 10. 41.) They began to be
much displeased,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Marke.</hi> But by
this happie error of these two Apostles,
our Saviour takes occasion to instruct
them, and the other ten, and in them all
other Ministers belonging unto him, how
farre different the pastorall care of his
Church, is from the power which gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in commonwealthes.</p>
            <p>Here upon the sonne of God calleth unto
him all the twelve Apostles, saying, (<hi>Mat.
20. 25.) ye know that the Princes of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
exercise dominion, &amp;c. (Mar. 10. 24.)
ye know that they which are accompted to rule
over the Gentiles, exercise Lordships, &amp;c.

it shall not be so among you.</hi> This is a statute
not to be repealed. This is spoken <hi>authora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
&amp; definitivè,</hi> it is the determinate Law
of a just authority. A Canon ordained and
irrevocably fixed by the <hi>wisedome of God.</hi>
Confirmed by an example above all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(<hi>Mat. 20. 28. Mar.</hi> 10. 45.) For the
<hi>sonne of man came not to be ministred unto, but
to Minister. (Luke 22. 22.) I am among you
as he that serveth.</hi> And before this hee had
taught them, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 24.) That the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple

I have given you an example, that you shall

            </p>
            <p>This ministry being thus performed in
humility, and without worldly titles. The
Ministers shall be then exalted. Our blessed
Saviour in the expresse words following
saith unto them (<hi>Luke 22. 29.) I appoint

hath appointed me.</hi> Now his owne
Kingdome is spirituall, or as himselfe said
unto <hi>Pilate, not of this world.</hi> Let them then
renounce temporall, and they shall have
spirituall honour. But some of the Clergy
would (it seemes) confound both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
being ambitious to inherit <hi>Glory</hi> in
the Kingdom of <hi>Grace.</hi> I feare our Bishops

These antitheses our Saviour hath placed
in the text upon the former occasion.</p>
            <p>From hence, may well bee argued as a
Corollary, to these undoubted premisses,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93918:15"/>
that no Minister of the Gospel can lawfully
assume, hold, or exercise that power which
by the Lord of the Gospel is inhibited to
his Ministers. But our Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
(Lord and only head of his Church) hath
inhibited all temporall Lordship, Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
&amp; Dominion unto his servants. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no Minister of this Gospel may hold or
exercise temporall Lordships or dominion.</p>
            <p>These words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>&amp;c. It shall not bee
so among you,</hi> doe so straighten the Bishops
miters, that they sit uneasie on their heads:
to soften &amp; as it were to line them for their
ease: the Bishops that are and would bee
both Papall and Protestant do quilt a gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
sence into these words then can beare
analogy with the Text. They search the
originall and pretend to finde another
sence in our Saviours sentence.</p>
            <p>This Text (say they) forbids not unto
Clergy men, the use and exercise of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
titles, power, offices, dignities, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
dominion, Lordships, &amp;c. but the
abuse of them: domineering and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
with them. This they pretend to
make firme out of the greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
which they would have so taken in the
worst sence of exorbitant power, even for
Tyrannizing. So then, they would teach us,
that, Lord it they may, &amp; Lord it they may
not: Lord it they may with all Pompe,
state, power; Lord it they may not, with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93918:15"/>
pride, vanity, &amp; oppression. But I shall easily
prove this interpretation to be inconsistent
with the scope &amp; analogy of the Context.</p>
            <p>Will they frame their argument from the

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be a Lord, or to rule? or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

neither will serve. And if the pompe

            <p>This preposition in words compounded

not pretend tyrannizing to be meant in the

that he forbiddeth tyranny in one place, &amp;
worldly power in the other, which if you

            <p>This is enough alone, yet for a further

poore and weake is that evasion for our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,

forge a new meaning, as if our Saviour
did not here forbid <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>That the former speeches of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93918:17"/>
of God,</hi> must be thought to fit and suite his
answer to the question and request made
unto him by the two Apostles. But what
Bishop in defence of his usurped power,
dares affirme that two such admirable (<hi>Gal.

aske of such a Master <hi>iniquam dominatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>

man hath such a heart of leade to think, yet
there have not wanted foreheads of brasse
to affirme so: Certainely, in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ, by them as then supposed to
bee Temporall, they desired the honour to
shine in civill dignity, &amp; eminency of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

be subject one to another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore my resolution stands cleare
upon this vote; That it may bee declared
that true and right Episcopacy is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
and inconsistant with secular pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
They who give in their names to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
in <hi>Gods vineyard</hi> must not goe out
of the doore, and thinke to returne at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
their whole time they have vowed
to the great Master of the Vineyard, and
I find no wages promised but to them who
enter and continue there to the last houre.
<hi>No man putting his hand to the plough and
looking backe, is fit for the kingdome of God.</hi>

            <p>Let therefore this inhibitory statute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
