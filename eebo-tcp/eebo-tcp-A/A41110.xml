            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For the truth is, that the ſtrength and value of my teſtimony concerning them, is like to extend no further, then thine doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me: So that if I adde any thing to their credit and eſtimation in the world, by my recommendation, it is by the mediation of thine ingenuity and fairneſſe towards me. But if thou ſhalt pleaſe to be at any reaſonable coſt in the reading of them, and lay thy judgement and conſcience as cloſe to the Spirit, as thou muſt thine eyes to the letter of what thou readeſt, I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but I ſhall be the gainer, and not they, by this engagement of my ſelf for them.
<pb facs="tcp:61460:4"/>
True worth, eſpecially when it overcomes, and breaks out of the cloud of obſcurity, alwayes returns more then what it receives from any mans teſtimony: neither is there any method or trade ſo proper and certain, whereby to raiſe an eſtate of honour and reputation to a mans ſelf, as the beſtowing or caſting honour and reputation upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo he be carefull and dexterous in the choice of his ſubject. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> by giving teſtimony only to one, Jeſus Chriſt, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grew the common ſtature of thoſe that are born of women, in true greatneſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.11. And yet there was little or nothing (in effect) added to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf by his teſtimony, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.34. It is an ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inoffenſive way to ſerve our ſelves out of other mens excellencies, by advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them: neither do the generality of men in their practice, more generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon any principle of reaſon &amp; equity, then this, To recompence ſuch men with terms of honour, who are unpartial and free in ſubſcribing and acknowledging the worth and eminencie of others. And as many that are but of mean condition in the world otherwiſe, yet maintain themſelves comfortably, by trimming and dreſſing the
<pb facs="tcp:61460:4"/>
gardens and orchards, and vineyards of rich and wealthy men: ſo may men that want other perſonal abilities and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their own, ſubſiſt upon terms of a convenient reputation, only by vindicating, adorning, and ſetting forth the endowments and gracefull parts of other men.</p>
            <p>The ſubject or argument of theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, is partly that noble and high-import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrain of Chriſtian devotion; Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for that ſolemn enterview of Jeſus Chriſt in his death, at his Table; The great ſeverity of Gods proceedings againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers of admonitions and reproof. Both theames of ſavoury conſideration for all thoſe that love not death; and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for thoſe, who deſire not only to be ſaved, but to be ſaved upon ſweeter and more comfortable terms then as by <hi>fire,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. Thoſe that were chaſtened with weakneſſe, and ſickneſſe, and death, amongſt the Corinthians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. were yet ſaved, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. but this was as by or through fire: though they did not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, were not conſumed by the flames of Gods diſpleaſure againſt them, yet they were ſorely ſcorched with them, the ſmell of this fire was ſtrong upon the garments of
<pb facs="tcp:61460:5"/>
their fleſh: They diſcerned not the body of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, in his ordinances; but in ſtead of that holy, reverend, and deep-ſtudied behaviour which was due unto it, both from their inner and outward man, as being a creature of the higheſt and deepeſt ſanctification that ever God ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; Sanctified not only to a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and glorious condition, but alſo to many ends and purpoſes of far higher and deerer concernment, both for the glory of God, and benefit of Men themſelves, then all other creatures whatſoever, whether in heaven or in earth: They handled and dealt by it in both kinds, as if it had been but a common or unſanctified thing; thus they diſcerned not the Lords body. And as they diſcerned not his body, ſo neither did God (in ſome ſenſe) diſcern theirs; but in thoſe ſore ſtrokes and heavy judgements which he inflicted on them, had them in no other regard or conſideration, then as if they had been the bodies of his enemies, the bodies of wicked and ſinful men; thus drawing the model and platform of their puniſhment (as uſually he doth) from the ſtructure and proportion of their ſin. And if the moral or ſpiritual ſeeds and originals
<pb facs="tcp:61460:5"/>
of our outward and bodily afflictions, as ſickneſſes, weakneſſes, either upon our ſelves or ours, declining eſtates, loſſes, &amp;c. (which ſtill lie deeper than the natural) were but carefully and narrowly ſought out, it is much to be feared we ſhould finde a great part of them (at leaſt) in the bowels of the ſame Sin ſo frequent amongſt us, I mean, of <hi>Not diſcerning the LORDS Body.</hi> The juſt and righteous God builds up the breaches that we make upon the honour belonging to the body of his Sonne, with the ruines of that honour which he had given unto ours in health, ſtrength, life, and many other outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and ſupports. But thou wilt heare more of theſe things in the Sermons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: the wholeſome Admonitions and Reproofs wherein contained, with the reſt of that heavenly proviſion for thy Soule, which thou ſhalt find here gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and laid into thy hand, I heartily wiſh may be ſanctified unto thee by the higheſt hand of the Sanctifier; that ſo thy ſins and corruptions may flie ſeven wayes before that Spirit of power which here purſueth them, and thou never preſume to return back again unto them more.

            <p>Meditation is a <hi>ſetled</hi> exerciſe of the mind for a further inquiry of the truth, and ſo affecting the heart therewith; and therefore there bee <hi>foure</hi> things in meditation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is an <hi>exerciſe of the mind,</hi> not barely cloſing with the truth, and aſſenting unto it, and ſeeing it, and there reſts; but it looketh on <hi>every</hi> ſide of the truth: <hi>I thought upon my wayes, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my feet unto thy Teſtimonies, Pſal.</hi> 119.59. ſaith <hi>David</hi>; that is, I looked on my wayes on both ſides, above and beneath; it's taken from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61460:17"/>
curious works, which are the ſame on both ſides, ſo that they which work them, muſt often turne them on every ſide; uſed <hi>Exod.</hi> 38.23. as being workes with <hi>two faces,</hi> as one well obſerves: ſo it was with <hi>David,</hi> I turned my wayes up-ſide downe, and looked every way upon them: thou never meditateſt, unleſſe thou look on thy wayes on both ſides with all circumſtances. An ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant phraſe we have, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall abound, and be increaſed. [Run to and fro]</hi> what is that? It is not the <hi>bodily</hi> removing of man from one place to another ſo much, as buſie ſtirring of the <hi>mind</hi> from one truth to another, ſo that it ſeeth the whole ſelvedge and compaſſe of the truth: thou wilt never get the truth to be meditated of, till thou runne to and fro in it, meditate it on this ſide, and meditate it on that ſide, looke on it in every nook of it. Meditation is like perambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when men go the bounds of the Pariſh, they goe in every part of it, and in every skirt of it: ſo meditation is the perambulation of the ſoule, when the ſoule lookes how far ſinne goes, how far the fleſh goes, how far the wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it goes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, as it is an exerciſe, ſo it is a <hi>ſetled</hi> exerciſe, it is not a ſudden flaſh of a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, but it, <hi>dwels</hi> upon a truth. When a man is in a deep meditation upon a thing he neither ſees nor hears, nor attends any thing elſe; the ſtream of the heart is ſetled upon the truth received; <hi>The word of God abides in you, and you have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.14. How came theſe <hi>young men</hi> to overcome Satan? Not by looking into the word, or onely thinking of the word; but by letting the Word <hi>abide</hi> in them. When a man hath been offered an injury, his heart is alwayes ſetled upon it; when he eates, his mind runnes on the injury; when he walkes, and talkes, ſtill his mind runnes on the injury: ſo thy heart muſt goe on the truth 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Continue in the things thou haſt learned</hi>: that is, take up thy manſion houſe in them.

the wicked ſtand looking upon the truth without the doores, but it is the ingreſſe, or <hi>going into the truth,</hi> that gives underſtanding. Indeede the truth is like a neat palace, (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) the Spirit of God is like the light of the Sunne that ſhineth into it; the wicked they ſtand without, like fooles peeping in at the windowes, and there bee many thouſands of pearles that are not manifeſt unto them: The houſe ſeems dark to them that ſtand without. Thou muſt enter into the word, and into every particular truth in it, and goe up ſtaires, and downſtaires, and have an eye into every roome.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third ground is, <hi>Meditate on the wrath of God</hi>; Oh! what wrath is it? Can I ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it? <hi>It burnes like an Oven, and all the proud, and all that doe wickedly, ſhall be as ſtubble, and the day of wrath ſhall burne them up. Behold this,</hi> ſaith the Text. <hi>Malac.</hi> 4.1. Behold it, and meditate on it. Can I goe naked in a hot fiery oven? Can I lift up my hands againſt it? My hands will be ſcorched. Can I kick againſt it? My legs will be baked. Can I blow upon it with my mouth? my mouth is fired. Did I ever ſee lime burned? were I in the limes roome, could I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that boyling? and yet if I live in my ſinnes, I ſhall be <hi>as the burning of lime, Iſay</hi> 33.12. Let thy heart meditate terror: <hi>Who among us ſhall</hi> be

able to <hi>dwell</hi> (that is the meaning of it, as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> ſheweth) who among us ſhall dwell <hi>with devouring fire? who among us ſhall burne with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings</hi>? verſ. 14. Gods <hi>mercie</hi> ſhall ſay, Take him <hi>wrath</hi>: I would have converted him, but he would not. Gods <hi>goodneſſe</hi> ſhall ſay, Take him <hi>wrath</hi>: I would have been kinde unto him, but he hath abuſed me. Gods <hi>patience</hi> ſhall ſay, Take him <hi>wrath</hi>: I have ſuffered him a great while, that he might have time of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but he repented not in that time. <hi>God ſmote Egypt in their firſt-borne.</hi> Why? <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever. God overthrew Pharaoh and his hoaſt</hi>: Why? <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Pſal. 136.15. <hi>He ſmote great Kings, Sihon a King, and Og a King: for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> So will God damne thee that art a <hi>drunkard</hi>: Why? for his mercie endureth for ever. God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thee that art a <hi>worldling</hi>: Why? for his mercy endureth for ever. God will be revenged on thee that art a <hi>Luke-warmling</hi>: Why? for his mercy endureth for ever. This may well make thee tear the haire of thy head, rather then let thee go on in thy ſinnes. See <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7.29. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on this.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth ground: <hi>meditate on the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God.</hi> As the Lord was an enemy to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, ſo he continues the ſame God ſtill, a conſtant enemy to them ſtill. As the Lord would not endure ſinne heretofore, ſo hee is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, hee ſtill will not endure it. Did the Lord once ſay, <hi>Weep and howle yee drunkards? Joel</hi> 1.5.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>weigh and ponder all theſe things in thy heart.</hi> It's ſaid of <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhee <hi>pondered,</hi> Luke 2, 19. <hi>and kept
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61460:32"/>
all theſe ſayings in her heart:</hi> verſe 51. The words ſignifie two things: Firſt, ſhee <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> theſe things together. Secondly, ſhe <hi>caſt them all in the ſcales</hi> together. Doſt thou know God is mercifull? ponder it with his juſtice. Doſt thou know that Jeſus Chriſt died for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? ponder it with the true drift of it, how that it is not to let men go on <hi>in</hi> their ſins, but to ſave them <hi>from</hi> their ſins. Doſt thou obey God in this or that Commandement? O ponder thy life with the reſt, <hi>Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy wayes be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Prov. 4.26. A man that eates his meat well, forty morſels well, yet one crum going awry throttles him. Thou walkeſt in theſe and <hi>theſe</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yea, but there be <hi>other</hi> Commandments beſides theſe: doſt thou walk in them too? thou muſt, if thou meaneſt to have thy wayes to be eſtabliſhed. The Jewes had their <hi>continers, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, mind's ſicles,</hi> which were greater weights; ſo they had alſo their <hi>gerahs,</hi> and <hi>agorahs,</hi> ſmaller meaſures, and ſmalleſt of all: ſo have thou greater and leſſe weights; great ones to ponder the great Commandments, and leſſe to weigh even the leaſt of Gods Commandments: and ſee thou make true <hi>Evangelicall</hi> weight, or elſe all will not be well. Suppoſe a man were to pay a 100 pound of good and lawfull money, and in weight, upon forfeiture of all that he hath, if he weigh it not; but the Creditor doth, and finds it light; he is undone. If thou pondereſt not thy wayes, <hi>God</hi> will <hi>ponder</hi> them: <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.21.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61460:32"/>
the word ſignifies, he weighs, and ponders them in a ballance, or ſcales; he puts the Word of his Goſpel in the one, and thy goings and obedience in the other. <hi>Thou art weighed, and art found light, thy kingdom is departed from thee:</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Belſhazzar, Dan.</hi> 5.27. So if thou be light, thou ſhalt be weighed, and ſo found, thou ſhalt loſe the kingdom of heaven for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſtrip ſin, and look upon it ſtark naked: ſin covers and diſguiſeth it ſelf, with pleaſure, profit, eaſe, and many a whoriſh gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo inticeth the heart. Even a toad, if ſhe were covered over with gold, thoſe that ſaw onely the gold, would pocket it up; if it were naked, they would ſling it in the kennell. Why do men love covetouſneſſe? Why, its hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with profit. Why carding, dicing, hunting, hawking, tabring, piping, and more then the word alloweth? Why? they are cloathed with pleaſure, and delight. Its the duty of Miniſters to unmask and uncaſe ſin, and pluck off the vail that covers it from appearing unto men. The not doing of this is the cauſe, that men do not meditate on the vileneſſe of their ſins, never are humbled, never eſcape Gods wrath; even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not <hi>diſcover mens iniquities. Lam.</hi> 2.14. Alas, the profit of thy ſins ſhall ceaſe, the pleaſure ceaſe, the eaſe ceaſe, and all theſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuits ſhall vaniſh away, when the ſoul comes to die, or to ſtand before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt: ſin will remain, but thy ſilver, and thy gold, where will that be then? thy laughter, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61460:33"/>
thy merriment, what will become of that then? thy delight will be <hi>gone.</hi> Meditate therefore with thy ſelfe, my ſin is now gainfull, and eaſie, and pleaſant; but what will my ſin become, when I come to lie on my death-bed? what good will it doe me, when I have moſt need of ſuccour? I will never acknowledge <hi>him</hi> my freind that will turn againſt me, when I have moſt need of him. Alas, I muſt die, I muſt come to judgement, I muſt goe either to heaven, or to hell: the profit that I get now by my ſins, will it beſtead me <hi>then</hi>? the pleaſure, the eaſe that I now find in ſin, will it help me <hi>there</hi>? Alas no, it will then be my break-neck, it will be a Devill unto me: the more I have been delighted with it, the more it will gall me: the more I have gotten by it, the more it will damne me: the ſin which I moſt of all loved, will moſt of all torment me. <hi>Eccleſiaſt.</hi> 11.9. look thus upon ſin.</p>
            <p>The third means: <hi>dive into thine owne ſoul and heart</hi>? there is a tough <hi>brawn</hi> over thy heart that it feels not its ſins. Now Meditation muſt look through, and come to the heart at the <hi>quick</hi> and cauſe the truth to dive into the deep places of the ſoule. When the timber is hard, the workman cannot thruſt in the nail with the weight of his hand: no, he muſt <hi>hammer</hi> it in. Meditation is the hammering of the heart. It's a pertinent phraſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Is not my word like a fire,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and like a hammer that breaketh the rocks in peices</hi>? There be two ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, firſt, of a <hi>hammer</hi>: the Word of God is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61460:33"/>
the hammer; meditation is the hand that taketh this hammer, and knocks the nail into the rocky heart, and makes it enter: Wilt thou not feele? Ile make thee feele: (ſaith meditation) wilt thou not take notice of thy wretched eſtate? Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation comes with blow after blow, and makes it take notice. Seeondly, of <hi>fire</hi>; the word is like fire; Meditation kindles it about the heart. A man benummed with cold is ſenſeleſſe; the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter frozen with cold, though the leaſt peble would have ſunk in it before, now a great mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone is able to lie upon it, and not ſink; the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is able to beare it: ſo is the heart, be it ſins ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo heavie, as the hill of Baſan, yet it bears it and feels no weight: but Meditation thawes the heart, and then every ſinne pincheth and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth. <hi>Is not my word like fire</hi>? as if he ſhould ſay, think of it, and muſe of it, and meditate of it, and thou ſhall feele it as a fire. Meditation is the often ſmiting of the heart with this hammer: ſo did <hi>Ephraim, ſmite upon his thigh</hi>: Jer. 31.19. like a man in a miſerable agony, he thumps his own breaſt, and in a vexation ſtrikes his hand on his thigh. Oh miſerable wretch that I am! So did <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Oh what an unruly Ox am I! how unwilling am I to bear the <hi>yoke</hi> of the Lord? Oh and oh the hardneſſe of my heart! oh that I could tell how to beat thee black and blue! Many men ſmite their hearts, but they ſmite them not often enough.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61460:34"/>
ſhouldeſt have ſmitten five or ſix times, for then thou hadſt ſmitten Syria till thou hadſt conſumed them, where as now thou ſhalt ſmite Syria but thrice.</hi> 2. Kin. 13.19. So men ſmite their hearts twice or thrice or ſo, but they will not ſmite their ſins dead: it may be they break the head of their ſins, but they recover again, and grow ſtrong upon them, as at firſt. Thou muſt ſmite five or ſix times, yea fifty times five times, till thou haſt quite broken the impoſtume of thy heart. Meditate on the <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of God, and with them ſmite it often and often: Meditate on the <hi>juſtice</hi> of God, and with it ſmite it again, and again: Meditate on the <hi>wrath</hi> of God, which is as a conſuming fire, and with it ſmite it ſoundly. Meditate on the <hi>truth</hi> of the Lord, this threatning and that threatning; this commandement, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; this promiſe and that promiſe; and with all theſe ſmite it to powder.</p>
            <p>The forth manner; <hi>Anticipate and prevent thine owne heart</hi>: meditate what thy heart will one day wiſh, if it be not humbled, and tell thy ſoule as much; thou wilt one day wiſh, Oh that I had been humbled under the reproofes of the Lord! Oh that I had been wiſe to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood mine owne mercie! Curſed bee the day that ever I neglected the means of grace; ſo the Lord brings in a fooliſh obſtinate ſinner, curſing and banning his owne ſoule, ſobbing and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the laſt, <hi>Oh how have I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or if I did, I cared not for their doctrine: I had friends that adviſed me wel, but woe is me damned wretch! I heeded them not. Thus thou wilt caſt the foole into thine owne teeth and fling a thouſand curſes into thine own face, becauſe of thy madneſſe. I might have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. but I would not; I might have been hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, but I would not: <hi>I was almoſt in all evill in the midſt of the aſſembly of the congregation, verſ.</hi> 14. I lived where the Saints of God were in whole aſſemblies, but I mockt them, I hated them, I miſliked them for being too preciſe. I was not aſhamed of my ſecurity, no not in thy ſight. Thus thou wilt cry out one day, if now thou wilt not yeeld unto meditation, which muſt make this as preſent with thee. Know thou, O my ſoul, the time of thy <hi>viſitation</hi> is at hand, thou wilt curſe thy ſelfe hereafter, if thou doeſt not now be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Gods mercies, thou ſhalt never ſee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie more: Now be awaked by Gods judgements, or elſe thou ſhalt feel them for evermore, now or for ever thou ſhalt roare for them. Then thou ſhalt curſe thy gains and thy profits that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched thee, thou ſhalt curſe thy pleaſures and delights that beſotted thee, curſe thine own heart, and thine own ſoul, and thine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that have damned thee.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Let Meditation haunt thy heart, let medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation dogge thee with the helliſh looks of thy ſins, and follow it with the dreadfull vengeance of God, haunt it with promiſes, haunt it with threatnings, haunt it with mercies, and haunt it with judgements, and haunt it with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. The heart is like the Beaver, when it perceiveth it cannot poſſibly eſcape from the Huntſman, it cuts the member for which it is hunted, and ſlings it down, and ſo eſcapes (ſaith <hi>Aeſops:</hi>) So purſue thy heart with its ſins, with the hue and cry of Gods mercies; purſue it with the hubbub of Gods judgements; let meditation haunt it, and let thy ſoul ſee it ſhall never be rid of the haunt; at laſt it will be content to part
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61460:35"/>
with its luſts. Let meditation ſay, Wilt thou forſake thine own mercies? If thou liveſt thus and thus, if thou prayeſt thus and thus, dead-heartedly, thou kickeſt againſt thine own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, wilt thou ruſh upon the pricks? This mercie thou maiſt have, if thou wouldſt amend; that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance thou ſhalt have, if thou do not amend: Either cut off thy ſins, or elſe God will cut off thy ſoul. <hi>Return, O Shulamite, return, return,</hi> its the voice of Chriſt to thee: Let meditation ſay, Return, O my ſoul, return, return, and thou mayſt be ſaved; return, or elſe thou ſhalt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Now what was the effect of this haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meditation? <hi>Or ere I was aware, my ſoul made me like the Chariots of Aminadab, verſ.</hi> 12. That is, my ſoul muſing and meditating on theſe and theſe commandments, it ſo humbled my ſoul, that it made me yeeld; yea, and made me run as faſt as the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab, freely</hi> and <hi>willingly</hi> to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Deal with thy heart as <hi>Junius</hi> his father dealt with him: he ſeeing his ſon was Atheiſticall, he laid a Bible in every room, that his ſon could look in no room, but behold a Bible haunted him, upbraiding him, Wilt thou not read me, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt? Wilt thou not read me? And ſo at laſt he read it, and was converted from his Atheiſme: So let meditation haunt thy heart, hold forth the commandments, promiſes, threatnings of the Lord, that thy heart may ſee them; let medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion haunt thee in thy luke-warmneſſe: prayeſt thou thus luke-warm? This prayer will break
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61460:36"/>
thy neck one day. Repenteſt thou? This luke-warm repentance will cauſe God to ſpue thee out of his mouth. Heareſt thou, ſpeakeſt thou, thinkeſt thou? Theſe luke-warm duties will confound thee ere long, if thou lookeſt not to it.</p>
            <p>Let Meditation haunt thee, as they haunted <hi>Nehemiah</hi> with warnings, <hi>ten times</hi> (ſaith the Text) they ſent to <hi>Nehemiah, they will be upon thee, Nehem.</hi> 4.12. Beware of the danger, the enemy will be upon thee: ten times they warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, never giving over till <hi>Nehemiah</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. So do thou haunt thine own heart: they will be upon thee, this curſe, this wrath, that hardneſſe of heart, this ſecurity will be upon thee. Ten times, yea, a thouſand times ten times, never give over thine own ſoul, untill thou haſt made it to ſubmit. Indeed there be ſome, let God ſend Meditations to haunt them, and follow them, ſaying, Repent, leave this or that ſin, why wilt thou be damn'd with this ſin? Oh forſake it, preſently they will gagge the mouth of Meditation, and of conſcience, and ſtrike them ſtark dead: as <hi>Abner</hi> when <hi>Azahel</hi> would haunt him, and follow him, and turn nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the right hand, nor to the left, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him at the heels. <hi>Turn aſide</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abner</hi>) but he would not turn aſide from following him. Turn aſide from me (ſayes <hi>Abner</hi> again) or I will kill thee, but he would not turn aſide, he would follow him cloſe: Then he up with his Spear and ſlew him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.19, 20, 21, 22, 23
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61460:36"/>
So many deal with the meditation of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when conſcience would dogge them, and weary them out of their ſins, they will not: when conſcience would haunt them, they will not be haunted therewith; when conſcience would follow them up with their deſperate wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, they gall and wound, and murder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be quiet. But <hi>David</hi> haunted his heart, and would have it haunted.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond duty: <hi>Let Meditation trace thy heart,</hi> as it ſhould haunt thee, ſo alſo let it trace thee in the ſameſteps. So would the Church, <hi>Let us ſearch and trie our wayes, and turn again unto the Lord:</hi> Lam. 3.40. The word (in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſayes <hi>Buxtorf</hi>) ſignifies, <hi>track or ſteps, ſtep by ſtep:</hi> this ſtep was in the ditch, that in the mire, that ſtep awry: track them all, that we may ungo them all again, and turn unto the Lord. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pray but let Meditation track thy prayer: this paſſage was right, that paſſage was amiſſe. Never keep a Sabbath but let Meditation track thy keeping of it; this duty was ſincere, that was rotten: Never do any thing but let Meditation track it. This thought, this word, this action was warrantable; that was out of the way: track thy heart, as the Lord tracted <hi>Eliah,</hi> he tract him in the wilderneſſe, he tracted him under the juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tree, he tract him in the cave; <hi>What doſt thou here Eliah? go forth:</hi> 1 King. 19. <hi>What doſt thou here Eliah, go, return.</hi> He tract him in the mount, <hi>Go, return, what doſt thou here Eliah?</hi> this is not a place for thee. So let Meditation wait thee: what

            <p>Meditation is like the courſing of a hare in the ſnow; the hare fearing to be taken by the dogs, here ſhe ſtops, there ſhe leaps, here ſhe interleaps, there ſhe goes backward, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upward and downward, and all to deceive the dogs, that they may not find her; but they go ſmelling and maundring, winding and turning, and track her ſtep by ſtep, till they find her: ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation in the courſing of the ſoul, the heart hath a thouſand fetches, a thouſand meanders and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths, a thouſand croſſe windings, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſings, and deceits, and all to puzle Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But Meditation muſt track the heart, as God dealt with <hi>Job, he counted his ſteps,</hi> ſtep by ſtep: <hi>Job</hi> 14.16. Meditation is the ſouls blood-hound, it will never leave howling, the wrath of God,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61460:37"/>
till it hath taken the hearts ſin for a prey; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation haunts it out of one ſin, and it runs into another; Meditation haunts it out of that, and it runs into a third: Meditation is a good purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, it proſecutes the ſinner, and attaches him.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe the heart is moſt cunning, and hardeſt to be trackt by its ſent, when the heart hath taken up abundance of good duties, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto ſundry graces, theſe good duties and common graces drown the ſent of the hearts wickedneſſe. As Huntſmen obſerve, that the hounds cannot well hunt in the Spring, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus,</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> and others obſerve: the ſweet odors of the flowers and herbs (ſayes <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi>) hinder the hounds from ſmelling the hare: ſo it is with Meditation; it is hard for it to <hi>track</hi> the heart in the green Spring time of <hi>civill</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie and formalitie. And therefore let Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation make diligent ſearch, ſaith he.<note place="margin">Pſal. 77.16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The third duty: <hi>hale thy heart before God,</hi> and let Meditation bring it before his throne, and there powre out thy complaint againſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, there out with all thy villany, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle againſt thy ſelf, and bring as many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt thy ſelf before heaven, as there be drops in a bucket full of water. So do the godly: <hi>I powred out all my complaints before him,</hi> (Pſal. 102. in the preface) I powred out my complaints, as a man powreth out water out of a veſſell; generally men are willing to call for mercie, but they are not ſo willing to <hi>bring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints</hi> unto God againſt themſelves: ye ſhall

have them <hi>whiſper</hi> after the Miniſter, as he is begging for pardon and mercie, but they will not do ſo, whiles he is complaining of their ſins; the helliſh and devilliſh abominations of their heart. Theſe are men of corrupt minds, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate concerning the faith, and ſhall never have mercie, till they be as forward to complain of their ſins, as to be plaintives for mercie.</p>
            <p>When a man in Meditation meets with a hard matter, that he cannot ſufficiently dive into, he breaks it to another: ſo do thou to God; break all thy heart to God, tell him of thy hardneſſe of heart, of the pride of thy heart, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate prophaneneſſe of thy heart: but take theſe rules with thee.</p>
            <p>Firſt, thy complaint muſt be <hi>full of ſorrow:</hi> Pſal. 55.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it muſt be a <hi>full complaint,</hi> of <hi>all</hi> thy ſins, and of <hi>all</hi> thy luſts; <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.18, 19. <hi>Poure ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, thy complaint muſt be with <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> thou muſt aggravate thy ſins by all the <hi>circumſtances,</hi> that may ſhew it to be odious, as <hi>Peter</hi> did: <hi>when he thought thereon, he wept</hi>

Mark 14.72. the originall hath it, <hi>he caſt all theſe things one upon another.</hi> Wretch that I was, Chriſt was my maſter, and yet I denyed him; ſuch a good maſter, that he called me before any of my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Apoſtles, and yet I denyed him; I was ready to ſink once, he denyed not me: I was to be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed once, he denyed not my ſoul, and yet I deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; he told me of this ſin beforehand, that I might take heed of it, and yet I denyed him. I ſaid I will not commit it, nor forſake him, and yet I denyed him: yea, this very night, no longer ago, did I ſay and ſay again, I would not deny him, and yet I denyed him, yea, I ſaid, though all others denyed him, yet would not I; and yet worſe then all others, I denyed him with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, before a maid, before a damoſel; nay, more filthy beaſt that I am, I ſaid I did not know the man; nay more, I ſware I did not know him; nay, more then all this, I did even curſe my ſelf with an oath, that I did not know him: nay more, all this evill did I, not above five or ſix ſtrides from my Lord and Saviour: nay more, even then, when if ever I ſhould have ſtood for him, I ſhould have done it then, when all the world did forſake him. Oh wretch that I was, I denyed him! he caſt up all theſe circumſtances together, and meditating on them, <hi>he went out, and wept bitterly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, thy complaint muſt be <hi>a ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning complaint:</hi> thou muſt condemn thy ſelf, and lay thy ſelf at hell gates, and ſet the naked point of Gods vengeance at thy throat.

Thus and thus have I lived, damned, caſt-away, as I have deſerved to be! So did <hi>Ezra</hi> in the behalfe of the Jewes, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Meditation ſhould deale with the heart, as the Father did with his poſſeſſed child,</hi> who carried him to Chriſt; ſaying, <hi>Maſter, my child is poſſeſſed with a Devil,</hi> even <hi>a dumb</hi> ſpirit, <hi>and I ſpake to thy Diſciples that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then Chriſt helpt him. So let meditation <hi>drive</hi> thy heart to God, ſaying, Lord here is my heart (I beleeve) poſſeſt with a Devill; for it is a moſt abominable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart: I brought my heart to thy <hi>Miniſters</hi> to cure it, to <hi>Sermons</hi> to <hi>Prayer,</hi> to all other good duties, but <hi>they</hi> could not help me: my heart is a Devilliſh heart, ſtill my heart is wicked, and rebellious ſtill, the Devill, oh! the Devill is in it ſtill! Oh, how he tempts me! he holds me, hee caſts me into the fire of <hi>this</hi> luſt, and into the water of ever-flowing iniquity. Have thou compaſſion, come and help me; for my heart is miſerably vexed with Satan; when I pray, the Devill ſtuffes me with dead thoughts, and drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie deſires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Devill fills me with wandring I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, and I know not what; when I hear the Word the Devil makes me to riſe up againſt it, or forget it, or not obey it; when the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is come, the Devill ſets me on thinking my <hi>own</hi> thoughts, and ſpeaking mine own words; when a <hi>Sacrament</hi> is come, the Devill hinders me in <hi>ſelfe-examination,</hi> the Devill diſappoints me of my <hi>preparation</hi>: Oh have thou compaſſion on me.</p>
            <p>The fourth duty; <hi>let meditation, when it hath
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61460:40"/>
held thy heart before God, there caſt thee downe before him:</hi> when Meditation hath ſearched out thy caſe, and made it appeare how wofull it is, then let it lay thee along before God, with <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> So it did with them in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27. as if they ſhould ſay (ſaith <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>) we have not one jot of hope to finde mercy, ſo long as we live as we do. What ſhall we do? Say what thou wilt, our ears are ready to hear it; command what thou wilt, our ſouls, what ever it be, are willing to do it: bid us ſuffer what ever thou pleaſeſt, tell us what it is, and we will endure it. They did not ſay, (notes <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) <hi>How ſhall we be ſaved,</hi> as wicked men do: they deſire to be ſaved, but their maine care is not to ſee <hi>what</hi> they muſt do, they are told what they muſt do, and yet refuſe to do it; but thy <hi>chiefe ſtudy</hi> muſt be, to caſt thy ſelfe down before God, with the good Jaylor, <hi>Sirs, what ſhall I doe to be ſaved? Acts</hi> 16.30. Firſt, <hi>what muſt I do?</hi> and then <hi>to be ſaved.</hi> Firſt, thy care muſt be what to do to get out of thy ſins, how to be rid of thy luſts, and then to be ſaved; as if he ſhould ſay, I ſee I am at a damned paſſe, and therefore I was a making away my ſelfe, the fire of hell did ſlay my ſoule: but now is there hope of ſalvation? is there indeed? Oh tell me, I am willing to do any thing, what muſt I do? Keep nothing back of all the will the Lord; be it puniſhments to ſuffer, tell me of it, I am ready to beare it; be it precepts for to do, though never ſo irkſome, O let me know
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61460:41"/>
it, and I will not refuſe it. <hi>What muſt I doe to be ſaved</hi>? When the heart is thus humbled upon ſound meditation, it's willing to do or ſuffer any thing. <hi>Jonah</hi> is willing to be caſt into the ſea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humbled. <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.2. <hi>Here I am, Lord, deal with me as thou wilt.</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61460:43"/>
kicking of a duty, as moſt men do when they are come to the end of their prayers, <hi>to whom with the Father and holy Spirit, be aſcribed all praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Amen</hi>; Come, is dinner ready? or, what news do you hear?

            <p>What is the reaſon thou haſt ſo many by-thoughts in prayer? Becauſe thou doſt not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate before-hand and after.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a good Engliſh Proverb amongſt us, that <hi>he that neglects the occaſion, the occaſion will neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect him. Solomon</hi> wiſely begins his Proverbs with it: for he bringeth in the Wiſdom of his Father in theſe five particulars: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, <hi>making a generall Proclamation</hi> in the 20 verſe, <hi>Wiſdome crieth without, ſhee uttereth her vice in the ſtreets.</hi> He compareth God unto a Crier that goeth up and down the City from ſtreet to ſtreet, and from doore to doore, crying his commodity, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the richeſt that ever was, which is a Chriſt,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61460:46"/>
a Chriſt for <hi>redemption,</hi> a Chriſt for <hi>ſanctification,</hi> a Chriſt to <hi>enlighten</hi> thoſe that walk in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death. <hi>Ho, every one that thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth,</hi> here is a <hi>Chriſt</hi> for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, here is <hi>a mercifull reprehenſion,</hi> in the 22. verſe, <hi>O yee fooliſh, how long will yee love fooliſhneſſe, and yee ſcorners take pleaſure in ſcorning</hi>? Fooliſh indeed to be without Chriſt: fooliſh to be without grace, fooliſh to chafer away our ſouls for ſin. <hi>How long yee ſcorners will yee take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſcorning?</hi> will you <hi>ſtill</hi> perſiſt in your wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and never have done with your ſins? will you never turn back again, but damne your ſouls for ever? <hi>O yee fooliſh, how long will you love fooliſhneſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, here is <hi>a gracious exhortation</hi> in the 23. verſe: <hi>turn you at my correction: lo, I will poure out my mind unto you, and make you to underſtand my words.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Do you not ſee how you are going apace to confuſion; and that the way you take, leadeth unto deſtruction? turn ye therefore, turn ye back again, for there is a Chriſt behind you: O turn ye; for if ye go on in your ſins, you periſh for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, here is <hi>a yearning promiſe</hi> made unto the world, in the end of the 23. verſe; <hi>Lo, I will poure out my ſpirit upon you, and cauſe you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand my words.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, return back again with me, and you ſhall have better welcome then you can poſſibly have, if you go on in your ſins: the Devill will never let you gain ſo much by your living in your luſts, as you ſhall do by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61460:46"/>
repentance for them, and forſaking of them. For <hi>behold, I will poure out my ſpirit upon you,</hi> whereby you ſhall be far greater gainers, then you ſhall be by your ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, here is <hi>a grievous threatning</hi> againſt the world, even all thoſe that have loytered out the day of grace. As time and tyde ſtayes for no man, no more doth the day of grace: <hi>Becauſe</hi> I <hi>have called, and you refuſed</hi>; I <hi>have exhorted, but you have not regarded</hi>; I have denounced judgements againſt you for your ſins, but you have harned your hearts; now a day of woe and miſery ſhall come upon you, a time of vengeance and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhall over-take you; there will a day come wherein there will be weeping, and crying Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie (Lord) mercy; but I tell you beforehand what you ſhall truſt to: let this be your leſſon, now I call, and you will not hear; now I ſtretch out my hands, but you will not regard: <hi>you ſhall ſeek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The words are a thunderclap againſt all thoſe that procraſtinate their repentance, and returning home unto God, wherein <hi>note,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, <hi>the parties</hi> themſelves that do prolong this time of grace, <hi>they:</hi> that is, they who when God cals on them, will not hear; when God invites them by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, patience, and forbearance, by his Miniſters and ſervants, by his corrections and judgements, by all fair means and foul means, yet withſtand the means of grace: <hi>they</hi> are the men, <hi>they</hi> ſhall call, but God will not anſwer.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, here is <hi>their ſeeking after God</hi>; they ſhall <hi>call upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, here is <hi>their earneſt and diligent ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unto God</hi>; they ſhall not onely <hi>call,</hi> but <hi>ſeek</hi> to, and not onely ſeek, but ſeek as to <hi>labour</hi> to find: nay they ſhall ſeek me <hi>early<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> even ſtrive to goe about it with all haſte, and flie to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>but they ſhall not find me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, here is <hi>the unſeaſonableneſſe of the time</hi> of their ſeeking, <hi>then:</hi> that is a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>then</hi>; even a time which the Lord points at: as if he ſhould ſay, you ſhall ſee <hi>then</hi> theſe men will be of another mind, <hi>then</hi> they will be glad to be converted <hi>then</hi> they will be glad to come out of their ſins, <hi>then</hi> they will be glad to get grace, and ſeek reconciliation with God: but alas! they ſaw not this <hi>then,</hi> but God foreſaw it well enough; <hi>then ſhall they call, but I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not finde me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Laſtly, here is the <hi>fruſtration of their hope,</hi> which hath <hi>two</hi> things in it. Firſt, <hi>in regard of their ſelves,</hi> in regard of the ſlaw of their ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it being not aright. Secondly, <hi>in regard of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſtice of God,</hi> who rewards every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works. <hi>But I will not hear them.</hi> Whence obſerve this point of Doctrine.</p>

                  <hi>Thoſe that will not hear God when he calleth them; God will not hear them, when they call upon him.</hi> Thoſe that will not hear the Lord when he calleth upon them by the miniſtery of his Word, and voice of his Spirit, the Lord will
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61460:47"/>
not hear them, when in their miſery they call upon him.</p>
               <p>Thus the Lord dealt with the people in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi> dayes; the Lord called them to repentance and obedience: but when they ſtood out, and neglected the opportunity of grace, and ſeaſons of converſion, ſee how God deals with them: <hi>though they cry in mine eares with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them</hi> (ſaith the Lord.) When men have gone beyond <hi>the time</hi> of Gods mercie, and out-rowed the tide of Gods forbearance, and will not return, the Lord ſets it down with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that his wrath ſhall return upon them, he will no longer forbear: they had <hi>a time</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord did pitie them, and offered grace and mercie unto them, but they <hi>neglecting</hi> this ſeaſon, and withſtanding this proffer of grace, God reſolves with himſelf they ſhall never have it again. There was a time wherein God did pitie them, but now he will not pitie them any more; <hi>twenty five</hi> yeers he called unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſought to bring them home; but becauſe they ſtood out and refuſed, the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will love Ephraim no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beloved, there is a <hi>double</hi> day, a <hi>white</hi> day, and a <hi>black</hi> day; there is <hi>a day of ſalvation; Iſa.</hi> 49.9 this is the day in the which the Lord ſaid to the priſoners, <hi>Come forth</hi>: and to thoſe that lie in their ſins, <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>beleeve.</hi> Now if any man will come forth and humble his ſoul before the Lord, let him come and welcome, for it is a day of <hi>ſalvation.</hi> But there is another day of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61460:48"/>
                  <hi>damnation,</hi> which is a dark day, a black and a duskie day, wherein the Lord will viſit the ſins of the world, and revenge the quarrell of his Covenant. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.7, <hi>The day of viſitation is come, yea the day of recompence; the people ſhall know it; the Prophet is a foole, and the ſpirituall man is mad.</hi> Beloved, we are fools, and all the ſpirituall men under heaven are mad, that lay not this day to heart. For the day of the Lord is a day of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and all the world ſhall rue it, though now men ſleepe in ſecurity. If once mercy be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and God turn away his eare from a man, then grace ſhall be no more, the doore of life ſhall for ever be ſhut up againſt him: and when once this day comes, he hath loſt his own peace, and deprived himſelf of eternall happineſſe.</p>

Thus God promiſed to give Iſrael the Land of Canaan, <hi>Num.</hi> 12.22. but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61460:50"/>
the text ſaith, <hi>They tempted God ten times,</hi> that is, (as ſome Expoſitors expound it) many times; or (as others) <hi>ten</hi> ſeverall times. But what ever the meaning of the text be, certainly it was very <hi>many</hi> times; ſo long, til at laſt <hi>he ſware in his wrath that they ſhould never enter into his reſt.</hi> Beloved, though there be many a hot ſwearer that regards not an oath; yet certainly if the Lord ſweare, we may beleeve him: the <hi>Word</hi> of God is as ſtrong as <hi>oaths</hi>: if he ſay it upon his word, wee are bound to beleeve it: how much more then, when he confirmes it with an oath? Therefore if the Lord ſweare thou ſhalt not, how dareſt thou, how canſt thou hope or think ever to enter into his reſt? This was almoſt fourty yeares before he died, that the Lord made this oath againſt them: and God knowes how many thouſands of them fel ſhort, not only of the land of Canaan, but alſo of the Kingdome of heaven.</p>
               <p>So God took <hi>Iſmael</hi> an hundred and ſeventeen yeares before he died: <hi>twenty</hi> yeares God offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him grace and repentance, but he would not take warning; a mocker he was, and a mocker he would be: for he mocked <hi>Iſaac</hi> when he was a child of <hi>ſix</hi> yeares old; and no meanes would reclaim him, before he heard the voice, <hi>Caſt out the bond-woman and her ſonne</hi>: Out with him, (ſaith God) for he ſhall never be heire with my ſonne: this was an hundred and ſeventeen years before <hi>Iſmaels</hi> death.</p>
               <p>And ſo God took <hi>Saul,</hi> five and thirty, or ſix and thirty yeares before he died, according to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61460:51"/>
                  <hi>Joſephus</hi> Chronology, (if it bee true); how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, hee took him divers yeares before his death: for ſo the Scripture makes it plain, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.20. <hi>The ſtrength of Iſrael will not lie, nor repent: for he is not a man that hee ſhould repent. Therefore becauſe thou haſt rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord alſo hath rejected thee from being a King.</hi> And do not think that thou by thy prayers, and crying God mercie, canſt ever alter him: for his councell is <hi>immutable,</hi> and hee is ſtrong in his decree, and cannot change. <hi>Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Grace and Mercie have been offered thee, which if thou hadſt embraced, thou mightſt have found mercy from the Lord, and the Kingdome ſhould have been eſtabliſhed and confirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee: but <hi>now</hi> it is too late: <hi>for the ſtrength of Iſrael cannot lie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God took <hi>Eſau fiftie</hi> yeares before his death: for ſo long he lived, after he ſought the bleſſing with teares: but he was a hunting when God was a calling: he was following his prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe when God was wooing him to repentance. At laſt when he called for repentance, and ſought it earneſtly, yea his ſoule was carefull for to get it; yet he could never obtaine it, though hee ſought it earneſtly with teares fiftie yeares before he died.</p>
               <p>Now if the Lord ſo ſeverely puniſh contempt of <hi>temporall</hi> bleſſings, O how will he puniſh the contempt of proffers of <hi>grace</hi> and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! I tell you God will be more ſtrict in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging of this ſinne, then of any other ſinne:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61460:51"/>
he will come with Martiall law againſt all thoſe that contemne his Goſpell, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not, is condemned already.</hi> Doth Chriſt preach repentance and ſalvation, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; and wilt thou not repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve? Martiall Law (beloved) martiall Law, hang him up; for he is condemned already. Even like a ſouldier that rebels againſt his General, &amp; forſakes his <hi>Colours,</hi> they doe not caſt him into priſon, and ſtay for the Aſſizes, or Seſſions, but give him <hi>Martiall Law,</hi> even hang him up: So if the Lord ſound his Goſpell in thine eares, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers thee conditions of peace, knocking at the doore of thy heart by his Spirit, and thou refuſe to open to him, thou art condemned already: for <hi>the Strength of Iſrael cannot lie, nor repent.</hi> Oh therefore take heed now whiles his word ſounds in thine eares, while his Spirit ſecretly whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in thy heart to thee, open to him, for elſe thou art condemned for ever.</p>
               <p>Take notice then, that God doth commonly give men a day, and no man or Angel doth know <hi>how long</hi> this day laſteth. To ſome it laſteth to their laſt gaſp; to ſome, to their old age; and to ſome, it is cut off in their childhood. God gave the Angels a day, the which becauſe they negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they are reſerved in chains of darkneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the great judgement day. God gave <hi>Cain</hi> a day, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 4. During all the time of this day, though <hi>Cain</hi> ſinned again and again, and went on in his ſinnes a great while, yet he heard nothing but a ſtill voice, <hi>If thou do well Cain, ſhalt thou not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61460:52"/>
be accepted? but if thou doſt ill, ſinne lieth at the doore.</hi> But when no meanes will prevaile, but <hi>Cain</hi> will go on adding ſinne to ſinne, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto all the reſt of his ſinnes, and ſo let go the ſeaſon of mercy, the Lords tells him from heaven, that the day of grace is paſt, the gate of mercy is ſhut againſt thee: for <hi>thou art now accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the earth.</hi> As if the Lord ſhould ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I gave thee a day of ſalvation, and offered thee mercy, but thou wouldſt not accept of it; but now I have clapt a curſe upon thy ſoul, that thou ſhalt never claw off. So God gave <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh</hi> a day to repent, <hi>Jona.</hi> 3. <hi>Yet forty dayes and</hi> Nineveh <hi>ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> God gave the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree a day, even three yeares, before he would have it cut down. God gave the old World a day of an hundred and twenty yeares; during this time God ſent unto them <hi>Noah,</hi> a Preacher of righteouſnes, to call upon them to repent, and ſo ſet it down alſo, that <hi>his Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man, but his time ſhall be an hundred and twenty yeares</hi>: yet one writes, that the Lord cut off twenty of the hundred and twenty yeares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their iniquities, which were ſo grievous, and provoked him ſo much, that they haſted him to come before he would have done. In all this ſpace if they had repented, they ſhould have found mercy from the Lord: but when this time was gone, and the <hi>day</hi> of grace was out, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge came in upon them, and God by his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments overthrew the whole World.</p>

But when the Lord taketh away the day of grace from a man, though the ſpirituall man may take ſome notice of it, yet there is no ſenſible appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of it, but after the day of grace is ſet upon a man, he may be as ſtrong and luſtie as before, he may come to Church as well after as before, performe religious duties, and do many good

things, as well after as before; as <hi>Saul</hi> went on in duties of Religion, as well after <hi>Samuel</hi> had pronounced the Lords doome upon him; how many times was he offering ſacrifice unto the Lord after the Prophet told him, that he was a man <hi>rejected?</hi> how many good ſpeeches came from him? as when <hi>Samuel</hi> met him, he ſalutes him with theſe words; <hi>Bleſſed be thou of the Lord, I pray thee turn again with me, that I may worſhip the Lord.</hi> A man would have thought that <hi>Saul</hi> had been a good convert. No, no, before all this his judgement and doome was ſet upon him; God ſteals upon him and ſaies nothing; he claps his plague upon their ſouls, and holds his peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.14. <hi>I have a long time held my peace, I have been ſtill, and refrained my ſelfe; now will I cry like a travelling woman, I will deſtroy, and devoure at once.</hi> The Lord ſhews here how he deals with men, they go on in their ſins, but the Lord holds his peace; they provoke him every day, but the Lord refraines his anger: but now all at once his wrath breaketh forth upon them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.7. <hi>God will ſhoot an arrow at them ſuddenly,</hi> their ſtroke ſhall be at once. The Lord ſuddenly ſhoots a ſwift arrow at thee; no ſooner it is ſhot, but it enters into thy bowels. When the Lord comes upon a man; he comes ſuddenly; when he ends the day of grace upon him, he doth it ſuddenly. He ended the day of grace on the Scribes and Phariſees even in the very Sermon time, while Chriſt was preaching unto them, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61460:60"/>
up to hardneſſe of heart: ſo many were delivered up to hardneſſe of heart in the time of <hi>Hoſea's</hi> prophecie, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to idols; let him alone</hi> (ſaith God,) as if he ſhould ſay, Sermon, let him alone; Preacher, let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; Sirrit, let him alone; Chriſt, let him alone; Beloved, if we ſtand out againſt God, and reject the <hi>day</hi> of grace, the Lord may ſay.

of the thoughts of the heart, Heb.</hi> 4.12. Now then if the word of God ſtrike at the <hi>thoughts</hi> of the heart, then repentance muſt goe and teach ſo farre to reforme and amend the things of the heart, or elſe he never repents. Let a man ſweep his houſe never ſo much, yet it is not clean ſo long as there remains one Cob-web in it: ſo if thy heart be ſwept from drunkenneſſe, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſwearing, and yet if the old Cob-web of vain thoughts remain in any corner of thy heart, not waſhed out, nor ſwept down, thou haſt not as yet repented: <hi>Oh Jeruſalem</hi> (ſaith God by his Prophet) <hi>waſh thy heart from wickedneſſe, that thou maiſt be ſaved: how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?

Beloved, when the Lord comes to reckon with the world, he will not only reckon with them for their pounds and ſhillings, for their hundreds and thouſands of ſinnes; for their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whoredomes, blaſphemies, &amp;c. but he will call them to account for their leaſt ſinnes, the pence and farthing ſinnes, even their very thoughts: <hi>agree with thine adverſary quickly, while thou art in the way, leſt he deliver thee up to the Jaylor, and thou be caſt into priſon: thou ſhalt not come out untill thou haſt paid the utmoſt farthing</hi>; thou muſt deliver up thy farthing as well as thy pound ſinnes, or elſe thou never <hi>agreeſt</hi> with thine adverſary. When the Lord by his prophet calls upon his people, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to repentance, he willeth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them to <hi>change their thoughts,</hi> Eſay 55.7. <hi>Repentance</hi> is the <hi>change of the thoughts,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Engliſh Proverb, <hi>(I have changed my thoughts:) Look unto thy feet when thou goeſt into the houſe of God, Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. Thou canſt never go to the Houſe of God without thy <hi>feet</hi>: the thoughts and <hi>affections</hi> of the heart, are the feet of the ſoul; and thou canſt never go to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; and therefore if thy heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons run <hi>habitually</hi> on earthly things, thou didſt never <hi>repent,</hi> and ſo thine end is damnation.</p>

for a man to hang on Chriſt, for many a man doth ſo, and yet is cut off from Chriſt, and periſheth for ever: thou muſt not onely hang upon Chriſt, but thou muſt alſo <hi>get into</hi> Chriſt. As in the old world, when the deluge came, and the waters increaſed ſo greatly, that the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and high hils were covered with them, and the people could not ſave themſelves by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto the tops of the mountains, no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but many ſeeing the <hi>Ark</hi> ſwim above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did climb up and hang upon the ſides of the Ark, thinking to ſave themſelves, yet <hi>none</hi> of them were ſaved, but thoſe that were gotten <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> the Ark: ſo many a man will catch hold of Chriſt, but his hold will be gone, and he periſh for ever, unleſſe he get <hi>into</hi> Chriſt. Now a man can never get <hi>into</hi> Chriſt, unleſſe his heart bee purged from vaine thoughts: For Chriſt when he entreth into a man, cleanſeth his heart from vain thoughts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. If Chriſt once come into the heart, he will ſet up his throne there: he will hold up his Scepter of Righteouſneſſe in it: when Chriſt cometh, ſee what a work hee will make in the heart, he will not ſuffer a proud thought to remain there to upbraid him: he will not ſuffer ever a ſinfull luſt to ſtand up to beard him; but he will <hi>caſt down every imagination, and all high things that exalt themſelves, and he will bring every thought into ſubjection unto himſelf.</hi> Therefore if thy thoughts run after the luſts of thy owne heart, thou haſt no Chriſt in thee: for Chriſt (beloved) will never dwell in a foule houſe: I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61460:68"/>
know there is no wheat without ſome darnell, no gold without ſome droſſe, no wine without ſome lees; ſo there is no man but hath <hi>ſome</hi> ſin; no man ſo clean, but hath ſome defilements of ſin upon him; therefore if a man have not his cleanſing <hi>grace</hi> of Chriſt in him, cleanſing the heart from vain things, there is no Chriſt in him: for Chriſt will never dwell in a foule heart. Now beloved, the very vain thoughts of a man <hi>defile</hi> him: as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. <hi>Out of the heart proceedeth evill thoughts, and they are they that defile a man</hi> All theſe, not onely <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and adulteries, and uncleanneſſes,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abominable ſins, which mens conſeiences ſtartle at, bul <hi>evill thoughts</hi> defile a man: Aſſure thy ſelf that ſo long as the league of theſe evill thoughts is not broken, thou haſt no Chriſt <hi>as yet</hi> within thee. Hence is that exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.12. <hi>If you be riſen with Chriſt, then ſeek thoſe things which are above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brethren, you muſt remember that there be <hi>two kinds of exhortations</hi> in Scripture: the one, <hi>if a man do them, bleſſed and happie is he</hi>: the other, <hi>if he doe them not, yet he may find mercie</hi>; it will be a greif and a ſorrow to him, but it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not that he ſhall miſcarrie.

For thus runs the Commandment of love, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul and with all thy might. Matth.</hi> 22.37. It is as if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, thou ſhalt love God <hi>with all thy heart, and with all thy heart, and with all thy heart</hi>: for the <hi>ſoul, mind,</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> are all one, that no man might dare to keep any part of their heart from God. Every one will ſay, I love God with all my heart, I go to Church and ſerve God with all my heart: I hear the Word, and pray with all my heart: I receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with all my heart: Doſt thou ſo? and yet let thy thoughts <hi>run</hi> upon the world? doſt thou pray, and yet let vain thoughts lodge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee? doſt thou hear the Word, receive the Sacraments, and yet letſt vain thoughts <hi>diſtract</hi> thee? Doſt thou walk in thy calling, and yet let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt vain thoughts ſteal away thy heart, and yet ſayeſt thou, I love God with all my heart, when thou takeſt away thy heart from God? How doſt thou think thy thoughts? with thy heels, or with thy heart? Surely thou ſayeſt, with my heart: Why then if thou loveſt God with all thy heart, thou muſt give thy thoughts unto God; God that cals for thy heart, cals for all the heart: now
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61460:69"/>
the heart is nothing but all a mans heart; all the affections and deſires, all turnings and windings, all things that are in the heart do but make up the heart: and therefore when God calls for thy heart, he calls for all the powers and faculties of the ſoule. And therefore the Prophet <hi>David</hi> would bleſſe God <hi>with his ſoule, and all that was within him.</hi> Pſal. 103. So thou muſt give thy thoughts, and all that is within thee to God, or elſ: thou giveſt God nothing; therefore that mans end muſt needs be deſtruction that loves not God.</p>

Wicked and carnall men may have the eyes of their conſciences opened, and their hearts awakened, whereby they may ſee their ſinnes, and the helliſh evill and danger of them: whereupon they may reſolve and purpoſe to forſake them, and then they will make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God that they will not do thus and thus; I have been touchie and cholerick, but I will be ſo no more; I have beene a prophane ſwearer and blaſphemer of the name of God, but I will be ſo no more; I have been a drunkard, and an unclean perſon, but Lord thou ſhalt ſee a reformation in me. Nay it may be he will tell his Miniſter of it, and his father and his mother,

his wife, his children, and all his friends too of it: but when he comes to his cold bloud again, and theſe cold graces which ſluttered ſo, come to be cold in him, ſo that his heart comes to it ſelf again, then vain thoughts reſt in his heart, and he returns to his old ſins again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the dog to his vomit, and the ſow being waſhed, to the wallowing in the mire.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle excellently deſcribes a man that can never depart from his ſins: <hi>They have eyes full of adultery, which cannot ceaſe to ſin</hi>: 2. <hi>Pet,</hi> 2.14. where the Apoſtle ſpeaks not onely of that adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie which is a breach of the ſeventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; but of ſuch an adulterie which is a perfect breach of <hi>every</hi> Commandment, when the heart runneth awhoring after every ſin and vanitie: when the eye of the ſoul is full of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, the heart cannot ceaſe to ſin; when the eye cannot ſee an object of gain or profit, but the mind is preſently engaged and runs after it, when it cannot ſee an object of delight and pleaſure, but it is ſtraightway caught by it: when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee any wrong or injurie done unto him, but preſently he is inflamed with revenge, and his heart runs after it: I ſay that if thy eye be thus full of adultery that thou canſt not ſee the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and hints of ſin, but preſently thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared, and thy ſoul is taken by it; thou art the man that canſt not ceaſe to ſin: therefore untill thou turne the eye of thy ſoule, which is the thoughts and affections of thy heart, another way, thou wilt never ceaſe to ſin. For whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61460:70"/>
thou lookeſt, thou wilt be inſnared, ſo long as thy thoughts are evill and vicious; either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pride, or covetouſneſſe, or ambition, or envie, or delights; thy ſoul will look aſquint on God: and untill theſe vaine thoughts of thine be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, thou wilt only look upon the ſatisfying of theſe vain luſts of thine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.6. <hi>In all thy wayes acknowledge God, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</hi> In all thy wayes think on God, or elſe thou mayeſt go to many duties in Religion, but never be direct in thy going; thou maieſt pray a thouſand times, but never be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in thy prayer: thou maieſt go from Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to Lecture, and yet never be eſtabliſhed in thy ſervice: thou maieſt go about many things and never be eſtabliſhed in any thing, unleſſe God be in all thy thoughts: a man may go on in a courſe of Religion, but it is at haphazard, he is inconſtant, and unſteady in his courſe, unleſſe in his heart he think upon God; and therefore his end muſt needs be deſtruction.</p>

               <p>It is the brand of a wicked man, <hi>not to have God in all his thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 4.10. when goods and cattell, plough and cart, pleaſures and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward contentments are in his mind and thoughts; when ruffs and cuffs, houſes and diſhes, tables and faire hangings, or any thing but God can take up their thoughts; they can have thoughts of every thing, but of God they can think none; this is the brand of a wicked man, that he hath no bloud of a Chriſtian in him.</p>
               <p>It is a true deſcription of a Pagan and Infidel, that hath no knowledge of Chriſt, <hi>to be vain in his imaginations,</hi> Rom. 1.21. <hi>When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, but became vain in their imaginations:</hi> vaine in their diſputes, vain in their reaſonings, vain in their thoughts; in their carriages and diſputations; ſo then though thou knoweſt God, and haſt things enough in thy mind, that convinceth thee that

this God is to be worſhipped; and underſtandeſt the worſhip of God, and the commandments of Chriſt: yet if thou glorifieſt him not as God, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thy heart and affections to him but art vain in thy imaginations, thou diſhonoureſt God. Hear what God ſaith unto ſuch, <hi>All the day long have I ſtretched out my hand unto a rebellious and gain-ſaying people, which walk in a way that is not good, but after their own thoughts, a people that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke me continually to my face.</hi> Iſa. 65.2, 3. As if God had ſaid, I ſent Prophet after Prophet, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter after Miniſter, to inſtruct them in the knowledge of my wayes, I laboured to convert them, and to bring them home unto my ſelf, and to work better thoughts in them; but ſtill they are a people that <hi>walk after their own thoughts,</hi> that <hi>provoke me continually unto my face.</hi> There is never a thought of thine, but it is in the verſe face of God, both thought and imagined.</p>
               <p>But ſome man may ſay, I think of God and of Chriſt, of faith and repentance, and of calling on God, of mending of this and that courſe; I think of death, and of my laſt account and every foot I have holy thoughts in my mind.</p>
               <p>But beloved, give me leave, I pray you, for to ſpeak ſomething unto you, which, it may be, may ſtick by you while you live: I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound theſe <hi>foure</hi> things and diſtinctions unto you, which I will uſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>what doeſt thou think of God and of heaven? then tell me whether thy thoughts be injective thoughts into thy heart, or thoughts

raiſed by thy heart</hi>; for there is a great deale of difference betweene thoughts <hi>injected</hi> and thoughts <hi>raiſed</hi>: God caſts good thoughts into a godly mans heart, which being fit ſoyl, it fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and brings forth fruit. Again, God caſts good thoughts into a wicked mans heart, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his heart is not ſanctified, and therefore no fit ſoyl to harbour in, they die and vaniſh: God caſts in, and they caſt out: God caſts in again, and they caſt out again: therefore if thou haſt good thoughts, examine and try whether they be thoughts raiſed from thy heart or no; ſee whether thy heart be a <hi>renewed</hi> heart, a ſanctified, an holy heart, fit to bring forth good thoughts every day. Beloved, a wicked man may have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand good thoughts, and yet go to hell in the midſt of them all. God caſt a good thought into the heart of the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> to go againſt <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for to puniſh his people for their ſins, and to avenge himſelf on them for the breach of his Covenant: but what ſaith the text? <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Howbeit he thought not ſo.</hi> Iſa. 10. No, his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ayme was how to get honour, how to inrich, to enlarge his territories, and to bring down the Nations under him, and to make his name and fame to be ſpread, and declared through all the world. So God caſts many good thoughts into many a wicked mans heart to repent, and to leave his drunkenneſſe, his pride, his ſwearing and whoring, to be holy and religious: howbeit he thinks not ſo, but he thinks how to eate and drink, how to be proud and haughty; how to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61460:73"/>
be rich and great in the world; how to be vain and licentious: yea thy thoughts are vile and vain all the day long.</p>
               <p>Oh that men were wiſe <hi>truly</hi> to underſtand this! the want whereof is the cauſe why many thouſands go to hell and are damned for ever. I will make it plain to you: A wicked man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thus with himſelf; I confeſſe, and it is true, I ſinne every day againſt God, and ſometimes drink a pot with my friend, though ſometimes I let fall an oath, and am overtaken in my infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet I thank God, he hath ſanctified my heart; for I think of God and of Chriſt, and I oft call upon his name, and let my thoughts run on good things; God and heaven are many times in my mind, and I am ſorry when I do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, and the Lord hath bleſt me with a large portion of outward things. Beſides I ſee theſe and theſe ſignes of grace in me, and therefore I think my caſe to be happy. And thus ſecurely they live, and ſo they go on, and ſo they die, and ſo go to hell and periſh for ever and ever. Here is the miſery of it, many think of God, and of Chriſt, of death, and of their laſt account, of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of hell, of faith, and repentance, of leaving ſinne, of crucifying their luſts, and practiſing of holineſſe. Now men think that their thinking of theſe things, is a part of their diſcharge, when indeed they are Additions to, and peeces of their talents, which increaſe their judgements. God caſts in a thought of repentance, of holineſſe, of the remembrance of death, and laſt account:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61460:74"/>
Doſt thou find thy heart never the better and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier by them? Then know it is only Gods haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of thy heart, and Gods calling upon thee, and Gods inviting thee unto repentance, to leave thy ſinnes, to come out of thy deadneſſe and formality, to prepare for thy death and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore I ſay, if thy heart now think not ſo, if thy heart do not repent, beleeve, and grow more zealous, and thou art not drawn the neerer to God; I ſay then, that the more of theſe good thoughts that thou haſt had, the greater thy doome will be: if thou haſt had ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them, if they have beene onely Gods haunting of thy heart, think thou then now of grace, of God, of thy poor ſoul, which is not bettered by them, nor made holy, then know they are peeces of thy talent, and it doth make thy torments in hell the greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>thou haſt good thoughts, but the queſtion is, whether they be fleeting or abiding thoughts:</hi> Many think of God, of grace, of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of the word of God; and when they heare a Sermon, they will think of God; but theſe thoughts, though they come into their minds, yet they go away preſently, they are in and out at an inſtant, in a trice, they paſſe away and are gone. Beloved, there are two kinds of vaine thoughts; 1. vaine, becauſe the <hi>ſubſtance and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of them is vain, and ſo all worldly thoughts are vain: 2. or elſe for their <hi>want of durance and laſting</hi>: and ſo are all thoughts of heaven, of God, and grace, and of Chriſt, it they vaniſh away, they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61460:74"/>
are all vain thoughts, though they ſeeme other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Haer what God ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>God ſaw that the wickedneſſe of man was great upon the earth, and all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart were only evill continually</hi>: [all the imaginations] great is the emphaſis of this word <hi>[all]</hi> all the thoughts: yea all univerſally, are only evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay unto me, Doth not a wicked man think that there is a God: why, that is a good thought; doth he not think that this God is to be obſerved and worſhipped? why, this is a good thought; doth he not think that ſin is to be forſaken? that is a good thought; doth he not think of heaven, and of Chriſt? how then are their thoughts <hi>only evill</hi> and that <hi>continually</hi>?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, becauſe all the thoughts of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mans heart are vaine: that is, vaniſhing thoughts, not vaine for the <hi>matter,</hi> which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may be good and holy, but vaine becauſe <hi>they ſoone vaniſh away</hi>; thoughts that come and tarry not, that leave no impreſſion in their hearts behind them, theſe are all vaine thoughts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wiſe that they are vaine</hi>: 1 Cor. 3.20. Beloved, in a godly mans heart, when a good thought comes, it abides and dwels a good while in him; and when it goes away it leaves a good impreſſion behind it; it leaves a ſweet ſmell and ſavour in the heart after it is gone, It's made more holy, and ſanctified by it. When a good thought comes into a godly mans heart,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61460:75"/>
it leaves the print of it behind: when a wicked man hath a good thought, he toſſeth it up and down, and ſuffers it not to ſtay, but preſently puts it away: let a thought of the world come in, and he can give it entertainment for ſeven dayes, yea for ſeven yeers, yea all his life he ſets his heart as a wide gate open to receive them, and to entertain them: but if a thought of God, or of repentance, of holineſſe and ſalvation come into his mind, he is tyred out with it, and it ſoon vaniſheth away; therefore ſo long as thy thoughts are thus vain, though for the <hi>matter</hi> good, if thou haſt never ſo many of them, yet if they <hi>abide not,</hi> but thou thinkeſt and unthinkeſt them again; if they come and give thy ſoule a jog, and ſo away; the more I ſay thou haſt of them, though thou haſt many millions, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will be thy doom at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>thou thinkeſt of God, but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, whether thy good thoughts be ſtudied, or accidentall thoughts</hi>; a wicked man that runs gadding in his thoughts here and there, over the whole world upon this and that, and I know not what, in the midſt of a lottery of thoughts he cannot chuſe but ſtumble upon ſome good: he thinks on God, he thinks on Chriſt, he thinks on heaven; but it is by the by, theſe thoughts of his are not <hi>naturall</hi>; but if he think of the world, of his pleaſures, of his outward delights and contentments, theſe thoughts ariſe naturally out of his heart, they are his owne. Now it may be a thought of God comes by the way; But
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61460:75"/>
a godly man not onely thinks of God, but he <hi>ſtudies</hi> how to think of God: It is his continuall endeavour to bring his mind to be <hi>fixed</hi> upon God; it is his whole care for to have good thoughts to <hi>dwell habitually</hi> in him. There is an excellent phraſe uſed to ſet it forth, <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.16. <hi>They that feared the Lord ſpake one unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him of all them that feared the Lord, and thought upon his Name.</hi> Where I pray you for to mark, that <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Gods name,</hi> and <hi>the fear of God</hi> are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together: for thinking on God, comes from the fear of God; a godly man thinks upon God and fears him; he thinks that God is alwayes with him in every place, and he trembles before him: he thinks God beholds all his thoughts and affections, and he trembles at him: he thinks as he walks up and down in his way, as he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in his calling, as he is performing of any duty of Religion, that Gods eye is upon him and beholds him: and therefore he fears to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and diſpleaſe him. A wicked man will ſweare and blaſpheme the name of God, and by and by it may be he will cry God mercy, and ſo he thinks of God. The man breaks out it may be into wrath and malice, fury and paſſion; and then it may be a thought will come into his mind for to cry God mercy for it, and thus he thinks of God: The man is careleſſe, earthly, dead, and luke-warme in the performance of good duties; and becauſe his conſcience tels him
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61460:76"/>
it is not good, he will ask God forgiveneſſe: he will be proud, vain and rotten in his ſpeeches, and then it may be a thought will come into his mind to ask God forgiveneſſe, and ſo he thinks of God; he will think of the world, of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, profits, and of his luſts and ſinnes, and then it may be a good thought wil come into his mind, and then it may be he will think a little of God too. Beloved, this is carnall and devilliſh think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God; thy thoughts then of God muſt bee joyned with the fear of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>thou thinkeſt of God, but the queſtion is, whether thy thoughts of him be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable or unprofitable thoughts</hi>: a godly man thinks of repentance, and repents upon it: hee thinks of calling upon God more faithfully and fervently then he did before: and he <hi>accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> his thoughts: for he goes about it, and his heart is the better for it: Thus it was with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>I thought on my wayes, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my feet unto thy teſtimonies,</hi> Pſalm 119.59. <hi>I thought on my wayes</hi> (there was his good thoughts) <hi>and turned my feet into thy teſtimonies,</hi> (there was the profit of his good thoughts.) But on the contrary thou thinkeſt on God, but God hath never the more ſervice of thee: thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of leaving of thy good fellowſhip, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry companions; but for all thy thoughts, thou retaineſt them ſtill: thou thinkeſt to give over all thy deadneſſe and luke-warmneſſe, and to get more zeale and fervencie: yet day after day, and yeare after yeare, thy heart is as dead, vain
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61460:76"/>
and ſecure as before, as ever before. Examine thy ſelfe and ſee, thou haſt good thoughts (thou ſaiſt) but where is the profit of them? thou thinkeſt of leaving thy wrath, and of bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlling thy filthy paſſions: but art thou enabled by thy thoughts to put up an injury the better? It may be thou thinkeſt on death; but is thy life the more <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>ſanctified</hi> by it? Thou thinkeſt of Chriſt and his bloud; but is thy heart purged by it? Oh the wretched miſery of the moſt men in the world, becauſe of the unprofitableneſſe of their thoughts! they have many good thoughts, but they want the profitable uſe of them, they get no good by them.</p>
               <p>There is an excellent deſcription of the thoughts of wicked men (though it be Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,) <hi>The heart of the fooliſh is like a Cart wheel, and his thoughts like the rowling Axletree.</hi> As the Cart wheele goes round all the day, and yet remaines on the Axletree; ſo is it with wicked men, their thoughts wheele and wheele them up and downe a thouſand thouſand times, their thoughts run upon this thing, and then upon another thing, and ſo they rowle up and down continually, yet their heart is at the ſame paſſe it was ſtill; an <hi>earthly</hi> heart it was, and ſo it is ſtill, a <hi>profane</hi> heart it was, and ſo it is ſtill; a <hi>carnall</hi> proud heart it was, and ſo it remains ſtill; But let theſe know, that the time haſtens wherein God will judge them even for their very thoughts.</p>

               <p>Beloved, what a fearfull day will that hee, when God ſhall take his Scales and weigh (no mans bodies and eſtates, for then it may bee that rich men and fat and groſſe men will out-weigh them that are better:) but he will take mens thoughts and weigh them, hee will weigh their ſoules: he will take mens good thoughts, and put them into one ſcale, and their bad, earthly, carnall, and unprofitable thoughts, into another ſcale, and to try which weighes heavieſt: Now if thy earthly and ſinfull thoughts weigh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt, then down thou goeſt into eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly and laſtly, <hi>they are not free from the condemnation of hell and damnation.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if ever thou wouldſt rid thy heart of vain thoughts, eſpecially when thou art in holy action, <hi>thou muſt goe unto God by prayer</hi>; there is no greater bridle to reſtrain a man from vain thoughts, then this conſideration, that hee is to <hi>goe to God.</hi> I ſpeak not this to the men of this world: <hi>Carnall</hi> men, who can ruſh into Gods preſence hand over head, without any fear or reverence, they can ſet upon any duty without any preparation: but I ſpeak it to the godly man, whoſe heart dreads and ſtands in awe of God: Wilt thou let thy mind rove and run all the day on worldly things? how then wilt thou call upon God? Doſt thou not know that this is the cauſe of thy dulneſſe, thy deadnes and wandrings of thy heart, when thou art about any good duty, namely, becauſe thou ſuffereſt thy heart to be laſhing out, and roving abroad on the world all day, no marvell if it keep his haunt at night: and therefore thy heart being vain God will never hear thy prayer, <hi>Job</hi> 35.13. <hi>God will never bear vanity.</hi> Comeſt thou to God with a vain prayer? God will never hear it. Comeſt thou with a vain eare to the hearing of the Word? God will never hear it; or with a vain heart to the Sacrament? God will not regard it. Lay this ſeriouſly to thy heart, if ever thou
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61460:78"/>
wouldſt have thy heart to the duty thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, buſie thy mind upon good things; for if thy heart be accuſtomed to vain and worldly things all the day, it is no marvell if it returne to its haunt again at night.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider that you have not <hi>ſo learned Chriſt</hi>: It is the Apoſtles argument, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then what you have learned of Chriſt; hath Chriſt taught you ſo? hath Chriſt taught you ſuch a love, and given you ſuch a liberty, that you ſhould love the world more then him, and imploy and beſtow all your thoughts wholly in ſeeking after vain things? Hath Chriſt taught you ſuch a faith as this? Hath Chriſt taught you ſuch a repentance as this, to have your thoughts more upon the world then upon Chriſt? to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of ſin, and yet never <hi>forſake</hi> ſinne? Have ye ſo learned Chriſt? Hath he not taught you ſuch a faith as purifieth the heart, ſuch a ſanctification as cleanſeth the ſoul and the minde, ſuch an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as bringeth every thought into ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto himſelf? Therefore if now thou ſhouldſt ſtill retain thy vain, dead, earthly and carnall thoughts, it is not to learn Chriſt: Chriſt teacheth thee no ſuch doctrine, nor giveth thee any ſuch licentious libertie; but thou learneſt of the Devill, and of thine owne heart: for <hi>all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and vain thoughts</hi> ariſe from theſe <hi>three</hi> heads.</p>

There is no work that comes to the <hi>outward</hi> act, that a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man doth, but a wicked man may do the ſame: here onely is the difference, in the <hi>manner</hi> of working. I will ſet it out to you by a place of Scripture; <hi>In a great houſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>there are not onely veſſels of gold, and of ſilver, but alſo of wood and of ſtone, ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.20. Mark how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here ſets out the reprobate and the elect, comparing them to veſſels of honour, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour: the veſſels of diſhonour are of the ſame

matter that the veſſels of honour are of: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it be pewter or ſilver, caſt it into an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable forme, and it will be a veſſell of honour; but caſt it into a diſhonourable forme, and it will be a veſſell of diſhonour, for baſe and mean ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; even ſo it is between a true Chriſtian and a meer formall profeſſor, the <hi>matter</hi> of their ſervice is one and the ſame; ſuppoſe it be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Word, or receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, prayer, or the like, the ſubſtance and action is the ſame; but take the ſame prayer, and let a godly man caſt it in his forme, and it is holy and prevailes with God: let a wicked man take the ſame prayer, and caſt it into his diſhonorable forme, and it becomes ſinfull, not regarded, and abominable in Gods eyes. For hearing of the Word of God, the godly man heares, and the wicked man heares; the <hi>matter</hi> in both is the ſame; the godly man he caſteth the Word into a godly mould, he heares the Word, and he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at it; he heares the Word and beleeves it, he heares the Word, and his heart bowes to it, and reſolves to practiſe it: a wicked man he heares the Word too, but he caſteth it into a diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mould, he heares it with deadneſſe and dulneſſe, without trembling, without faith and obedience. So a godly man may think thoughts of God, and ſo may a wicked man think thoughts of God, the <hi>matter</hi> of both is good; yet the thoughts of the wicked are vaine, though hee thinks of God, becauſe he caſteth it into his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable frame: he feares not God, his heart
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61460:83"/>
trembles not at God, but his heart is as full of dead earthly affections as before; he thinks of hearing the Word, but it is after his own faſhion, he thinks of praying, but he prayes with his owne ſpirit, and not with the ſpirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Pſalmiſt tels us, that the whoremaſter, the drunkard, and the thief, thinks of God, but it is after his own faſhion: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and I held my tongue, and thou thoughteſt that I was even ſuch a one as thy ſelf</hi>: A wicked man goes on in his ſins, and thinks that they are not ſo devilliſh and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, as ſome ſay that they are: and he thinks that God thinks ſo too; he is earthly, carnall, luke-warme, and dead-hearted, and if he repent at the laſt, he thinks all will be well, and hee thinks God is of the ſame mind too: he goes on in his drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, pride, and hypocriſie; and he thinks if he do but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ask God mercy, and to cry, Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my ſoul, when he is going out of the world, he thinks he ſhall not go to hell, but be carried to the joyes of heaven, and he thinks God is of his mind, that God thinks ſo too: But mark what the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will reprove thee, and ſet thy ſins in order before thee.

                  <hi>men will be thinking and plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from morning till night of their worldly buſineſſe: Now becauſe they know they muſt think on God, to make God amends, perhaps they will think on him at night, when they have diſhonoured him all the day.</hi> So men will ſwear and ſwagger drink and be drunk, and when they have done, ſay, Lord have mercy upon me, and ſo they think to make God amends. What (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) will yee ſweare, ſwagger, drink, be drunk, and lie, be ſecure and worldly, and then ask God forgiveneſſe to make him amends? This is to break <hi>Priſcians</hi> head, that you may give him a plaiſter. Will you treſpaſſe your neighbour, that you may ask him forgiveneſſe? This is a damned and deviliſh religion; yet this is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of many men in the world, you ſhall have them keep daies and weeks and yeares in the obſervation of the times of Gods worſhip; they will keep the Sabbath in comming to Church, they will hear Sermons, pray and think of God:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61460:85"/>
but all this is to make God amends for the wrong that they have done him: they know they have offended God, and therefore they will do ſomething to make him amends: like thoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men in <hi>Jeremies</hi> time, who did <hi>ſteale, murder, commit adultery, ſwear falſly, and burn incenſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Baal; and walk after the gods whom they knew not,</hi> and then come and ſtand before God in his houſe, which was called by his name, and ſaid, <hi>We are delivered, though we have done all theſe abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> As if God ſhould ſay unto wicked men, What, will yee ſwear, ſteal, lie, and be earthly, giving up your ſelves unto all manner of lewdneſſe in the breach and contempt of my commandements, and then think by making a prayer unto me, and by lifting up your eyes unto me, and by giving your eares to hear my word, thereby to make me recompence? No, no, <hi>I have ſhowed thee, O man, what is good,</hi> Micah. 8.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>the end of mens thoughts is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to collogue with God.</hi> Let a man be under the croſſe, in calamity, pain, and miſery, <hi>then</hi> God ſhall heare of him often, then he will think of God, and of his ſinnes: nay, the beaſtlieſt wretch in a whole Pariſh, upon his ſick-bed, then, Oh how will he call upon God, then ſend for the Miniſter, let him pray for me, read a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſome good book; then God ſhall have ſervice upon ſervice, then he ſhall have the firſt, ſecond, and third courſe. But all this is but to be raiſed up again; and then when he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a little ſtrength, he fall off again: like

the Jewes, who when <hi>God ſlew them, they ſought him: and they returned and enquired early after God; nevertheleſſe they did but d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is many a man that ſeeks to God, yea, that ſeeks to him with tears, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes many a good duty, and yet he doth but flatter with God, he doth it but to curry favour with him: hee is afraid of ſickneſſe, croſſes, plagues, and death, and curſes upon him, if hee ſhould not doe ſo: and therefore to prevent this, he will diſſemble ſome ſervice to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>to ſmother and choake their owne conſciences</hi>; their hearts think and tell them, they muſt think of God, their conſciences tell them, that they muſt have ſome holineſſe, ſome religion; that they muſt keep the Sabbath in ſome ſort, that they muſt pray, and goe to Church: and hence it is, that the drunkard, ſwearer, whoremaſter, will ſometimes have thoughts of God, and will be performing ſome outward acts of Religion, Why? his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence otherwiſe would not let him be at reſt, but it is as the Devils bandog to drive him to it.</p>
               <p>Thus when the Prophet commanded the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to worſhip the Lord, to reverence his name, to hallow his Sabbaths; their conſciences told them that they muſt doe ſo, or elſe all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of wrath and vengeance denounced by the Prophets would come upon them, Hence it is that the Lord by his Prophet exhorts, ſaying, <hi>Ariſe yee, and depart, for this is not your reſt</hi>: your
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61460:86"/>
mind hath another haunt, you have this and that black luſt, this is not your reſt. Doth thy heart reſt on God and good things? If thy heart be good and holy, ſo that it takes up its reſt in God, and in Chriſt, then it is well; but if thou only turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aſide to good duties, and falleſt as it were by chance upon holy things; away, away (ſaith God) this is not your reſt. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the being of a thing conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thou goeſt up and down; what is it that thou lookeſt after? Is it that thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have grace, or that thou maiſt follow thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and get thy living? is it this that thou wouldſt have, for which thou keepeſt ſuch a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and ſcraping, and ſuch a laying up?

How?
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61460:92"/>
why, they ſhould ſay: Sirs, what is the matter that you doe ſo run after Sermons? that you keep ſuch a ſtirre about getting faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance more then other men? that you pray, weep, faſt, and mourne, and are ſo ſtrict in your works? If thus men would but come unto Gods Saints, and ask them the reaſon of all theſe things, the Saints of God would tell them, that the wrath of God would come upon them if they did not do thus: they would never be ſaved, if they did not thus beleeve, and thus repent, and thus pray, and walk thus holily and preciſely, they ſhould be all damned. But the world it falls a mocking and a ſcoffing at them, and never ſeeks to prevent the wrath of God; but it ſuddenly ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth on them to their deſtruction.</p>

Then know that unleſſe thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt out of thy ſinnes, unleſſe thou doeſt repent, and walk holily, there is a new Judge added to the reſt, that ſhall judge thee. As our Saviour told the Phariſees, <hi>If I through Beelzebub caſt out Devils, by whom do your children caſt them out? Therefore they ſhall be your judges,</hi> Matth. 12.27. where Chriſt tells them, that their children

who were his Diſciples (for ſome of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees children did beleeve in Chriſt and follow him, and had power from Chriſt to doe the ſame workes that Chriſt did;) Now they liked it well enough in their owne children, but they could not endure it in Chriſt: and therefore hee tells them, that their children, whom God had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and to whom he had given power to doe the ſame workes that he did, even they ſhall bee their Judges to condemne them: And even ſo may it be with thee, thou that art a father or a mother, God having converted any of thine own children, that child ſhall be thy Judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee, if thou repent not.

The wayes of the Lord are all judgements, becauſe they judge them that will not walk in them.

humble? His humility ſhall judge thy pride. Is the child of God meek and patient in ſuffering of wrong and injuries? His meekneſſe and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall judge thy choler and revenge. Hath the child of God ſaith given him to beleeve in the Lord Jeſus? His faith ſhall judge thy infidelity.

               <p>Would they in the firſt place ſay, Alas!

book-learned as thou, he eſchewed thoſe ſinnes that thou liveſt in, got the anointing of Gods Spirit to anoint his eyes, to ſee and know the things of God which thou haſt neglected to get; he ſhall condemne thee.</p>
               <p>A ſecond excuſe is <hi>poverty.</hi> I have no means to live on; if I ſhould run after Sermons, I ſhould beg my bread: I have a great charge to keep, and nothing but my labour to maintaine them: and therefore I cannot ſpare time for <hi>meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; I have no while to ſtudy the Scriptures, to pray and to mourn for my ſins, and to get grace. Well, the poore Cobler that liveth next doore to Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> ſhall riſe up and condemn thee; hee was as poore as thou, and had as great a charge to keep as thou: yet hee mourned and wept, he got grace, and hee ſet time apart for prayer, reading, meditation, holy conference; he ſhall judge and condemn thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they ſhall have no excuſe by <hi>imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; I am a ſervant, I am commanded to doe this or that I find ſo much buſineſſe to follow, that I cannot find any time for ſuch things. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſaith, I have great imployments, I have many Irons in the fire, and therefore God, I hope, will be mercifull unto me.

So may I ſay to all ſuch, Will you give way to ſinne? will you ſuffer your luſts and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſway you, and not endeavour to root out or kill them rather? How wilt thou then judge the world? How wilt thou then be able to riſe up in judgement againſt the wicked, to judge them for ſuch ſinnes wherein thou alloweſt and liveſt thy ſelfe? Surely God will never account thee for a <hi>Saint,</hi> if he cannot <hi>judge the world</hi> by thee. Oh this ſhould rent the heart and bowels of thoſe that go for Chriſtians, that go for Saints, yet <hi>live</hi> not as the Saints ſhould live. If God cannot take thee, and judge the world by thee; if he cannot take thy life, and judge the life of all Pagans, Infidels, all luke-warm earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſecure ſinners, he will not account thee for a <hi>Saint.</hi> This then firſt condemnes all unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in the lives of them that be Saints. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if we did but live like the Saints of God in holineſſe and purity in the wayes of God, the Lord would put ſuch ſplendor and glory upon us, that would even daunt the very face of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and make them ſtand amazed at Saints. But it is the contrary with us, the glory of God
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61460:100"/>
is departed from us, <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and other Nations fear us not: Why? The righteouſneſſe and purity of <hi>Religion</hi> is departed from us. For you ſhall have a Saint come into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of a wicked man, and yet the ſwearer will not be afraid to ſwear before him: the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard will not be afraid to bee drunk before him: the filthy ſpeaker will not be afraid to utter rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſpeeches before him: the lier will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to lie before him: the worldly man will not be afraid to diſcover his vanities before him by his carnall and filthy conference. Beloved, all this is, becauſe the Saints have loſt their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; if they did live as Saints ought to live, the wicked would tremble to work wickedneſſe before them. Though a wicked man be a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, and abuſe the good creatures of God when no Saint is in his company, yet if a Saint were preſent, he would tremble, and not dare to do it. Though he were a ſwearer, a filthy tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, a vain worldling amongſt his <hi>companions</hi>; yet if he come in the <hi>Saints</hi> company, and the Saints ſtand in Gods counſell, then would the wicked tremble and quake to do ſuch things: then would they lick in their tongues, and not dare to ſpeak ſuch blaſphemous oathes, ſuch vain and unprofitable words, filthie lies and flanders. It is ſaid of thoſe that gladly received the Apoſtles words, and were added to the Church, that <hi>the fear of them came upon the world,</hi> Acts 2.41. What, did the Diſciples go with ſwords and guns, &amp;c. to keep men in awe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by?
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61460:101"/>
No, <hi>they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip,</hi> and did live according thereto, and this made all the world afraid of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>this condemnes the little difference that is betwixt the wicked of the world, and ſome Sainis in their lives and manners</hi>: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, is there ſo little difference between the Judge and the priſoners, that any one need to come and ſay, I pray you Sir, ſhew me which is the Judge, and which is the malefactor? Is there not a plaine difference both in the apparell and carriage? The one is in rich apparell, and the other in ſtinking and filthy cloathes, having his hands manicled, or his legges chained. But it is to be feared, that many of the Saints have negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted holineſſe and purity in their carriage and actions which they performe, that one can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell which is a Saint, and which is a reprobate. If a man deale with a Saint, and deale with a wicked man, he ſeeth no difference between them. Let a Saint do any action, either pray, hear, or conferre, let a wicked man do the like, there is ſuch deadnes, ſuch carnality, ſuch world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſſe, ſuch luke-warmneſſe of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that one can hardly tell which is the Saint and which is the hypocrite. Beloved, if the Saints did live like Saints, there would be as plaine a difference between a Saint and a wicked man, in their lives and behaviour, as is hetwixt the Judge and the Rogue that is to be judged by him. <hi>Haſt thou not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

earth?</hi> Iob 1.4.8. If a man come to be a Saint indeed, there is never a wicked man in the Town and Countrey, that lives and doth as he doth, and walks as he walks, nor prayes as he prayes, nor hears the word as he hears it, nor that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres or meditates as he doth, that beleeves and repents as he doth, that ſtrives againſt his luſts as he doth: there is none like him in all the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>it condemnes the ſcandalouſneſſe of many Profeſſors in their behaviours and actions.</hi> Oh how do wicked men inſult and exclaim here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, to ſee a Profeſſor led away and overcome by ſome luſt! What (ſay they) are theſe they that are led by the Spirit of God? Are theſe your devout men? why, they can covet and ſcrape as well as others; they can couſen and lie as well as others. I, thoſe that are your great Profeſſors, and hot ſpurres, they are as covetous, as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as cruell as others, though they will not be drunk, nor ſwear, yet they will couſen and lie, as well as others. The conſideration whereof made the Prophets heart to bleed in him, and to pray, Oh purge me from my murder and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and all other my ſecret ſinnes, leſt I caſt mire and dirt in the faces of thy children, cauſing them to beare the reproaches of my ſinnes. <hi>Oh let not thoſe that ſeeke thee, be aſhamed for my ſake,</hi> Pſal. 69. For thy ſake that liveſt ſcandalouſly and offenſively, for thy ſake that liveſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly and ſcraping after the world, that art ſo unjuſt in thy dealings and promiſes, mire and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61460:102"/>
dirt, ſcandals and reproaches are caſt upon the children. For thy looſeneſſe, yea for thy carnall liberty it is that the true profeſſors of Religion are reproached, ſuſpected, and hardly cenſured in the world. What did <hi>Jacob</hi> when he was to walk with the people of the Land? <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.5.6. he purged his houſe, and (ſaith the text) <hi>the terror of God was upon all the Cities,</hi> hee made them all to tremble at him. I tell you, all the wicked in <hi>Aſhford</hi> would tremble at the Profeſſors that live therein, if they did live and carry themſelves like <hi>Saints indeed.</hi> Oh if all thoſe that did profeſſe themſelves to be Chriſtians, were Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and that profeſſe themſelves to be Saints, were Saints indeed, living in the power and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of holineſſe; then men would ſay of themſelves, of a truth God is in theſe men, Chriſt dwels in them, and the Spirit of God leads and governs them indeed. If thou wouldſt judge the world, take heed ſo as the world judgeth thee, and ſo thou with the world be condemned eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.

So ſaith Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> why doe you wonder to ſee ſuch warres, and rumours of warres, that there is ſo many bloodſheds, ſo many Townes and Cities ruinated, and ſo many Countries ſacked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated, ſo many calamities come upon the Churches abroad, &amp; ſo many plagues and ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to over-run Chriſtendome at this day, is not the cauſe plain enough? men come unto the Table of the Lord careleſly and unworthily. And, beloved, we ſhall never ſee the Lord take away his judgements here from the earth, untill we betake our ſelvs to a more diligent and holy receiving of the Sacrament. For this very cauſe there are ſo many ſtrange diſeaſes amongſt us,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61460:113"/>
never formerly known or heard of untill theſe dayes, as the French Pox, the Engliſh Sweat, (as they call it) that even the Phyſitians, themſelves are blunted at them; and (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> well obſerves) hence are all diſeaſes, as plagues, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilences, (which were late amongſt us) drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, bloody Flux, Agues, Apoplexies, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, burning Feavers, and impoſtumes, &amp;c. and all for this cauſe. One man hath fallen into a Feaver, and we wonder at the cauſe whence he took it; but in truth the communion hath caſt him into his Feaver, and the Lord will avenge himſelf on him for the ſame. Another is ſick, and he thinkes that a cold hath brought it upon him; but it is the unworthy receiving of the Sacrament that is truely the cauſe of it. A third man dieth before his time, even in his full ſtrength, before in the courſe of nature he hath ended halfe his dayes; but the cauſe is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy comming to the Communion, which hath taken hold of him, and cut off the thread of his life.</p>
               <p>Many there be that expound theſe words in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> ſenſe, <hi>Many are ſick and weak, and many are fallen aſleep,</hi> that is to ſay, many have their conſciences ſeared, and their hearts hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp;c. and this is true alſo, that becauſe men come unpreparedly, they have their hearts har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and their conſciences ſeared, and their ſoules plagued with many ſpirituall plagues. But it is as true alſo in <hi>temporall</hi> judgements, thou haſt had many afflictions, and much ſickneſs
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61460:113"/>
laid upon thee; but thank thy ſelf for it; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe thou haſt come unworthily unto the communion, thou haſt had much weakneſſe in thy body, which hath coſt thee much mony, and weakned thy eſtate; but thy unholy comming unto the Sacrament, is that which thou mayeſt thank for it. Thou haſt been reproached and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, and endured much ſhame; but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, that it proceeds from the fore-going cauſe, and that is a ſpeciall reaſon why the Lord hath brought theſe and many other evils upon thee. Thou canſt ſay the commandements (for the moſt part) by rote; but thou didſt never know the myſtery of this one commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain:</hi> Beloved: the Communion is one of Gods own names, and how many thouſands are there in the world that take this name of God in vain? Is there never a drunkard here in this congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that hath been at the Sacrament? Is there never a whoremonger, never a covetous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Where is the man, whoſoever hee bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you all, that is ſuch a one? He is in the ſtate of damnation. Is there never a luke-warm and carnall Chriſtian, that contents himſelf with a formall worſhip, and a dead performance of holy duties, that hath no zeal for God, nor cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for his truth, but is careleſſe of all Gods commandements? whoſoever amongſt you are guilty of theſe ſins, or any other, and hath come unto this holy Communion in them, they are the perſons, that how oft ſoever they have received,

Art thou troubled with a hard heart, and an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſoule, and art even wearied and tired out with thy many ſinnes and infirmities? Come thou with comfort unto this holy Communion: for thou ſhalt be ſure to finde ſaying good by it; to thee it ſhall be a ſpirituall medicine to heale all thy diſeaſes, and to cure all thy ſtrong and prevailing corruptions; and if thou come unto this holy Table of the Lord, it ſhall make thee as it is recorded of Saint <hi>Laurence,</hi> able to ſuffer Martyrdome, and to get victory over all thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly affections; yea at laſt thou ſhalt tread Satan thy arch-enemy under thy feet. Therefore be not diſmaied: for the Lord Jeſus invites thee to come. What if thy infirmities be many, yet
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61460:115"/>
the mercies of God, which he tenders to thee in this Communion, are many more. <hi>Samſon</hi> who was the ſtrongeſt Souldier and Champion in his time that was in <hi>Iſrael</hi> to overcome the Philiſtims, he yet began his ſtrength in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being at the firſt overcome by a woman: So though the Lord intend to make thee a ſtrong Chriſtian, he will make thee to begin in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to perfect thy power; to begin in ſinne and miſery, that he may make thee to end in glory. I know Gods children here may receive temporall puniſhments, and bring temporall ſcourges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, as we may ſee amongſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians here, but it ſhall be for their good and amendment, namely, for their correction, and not for their ruine and deſtruction; that ſo being chaſtened by the Lord, they might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world. Therefore if thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt careleſly and unprofitably, God will chaſtiſe thee with the rods of men, as he did <hi>Peter,</hi> who receiving the Sacrament with his Maſter over night, yet the next day thrice denied him; but God whipt his ſoule, and ſcourged his conſcience for it, and beat him black and blew, ſo that he <hi>went out and wept bitterly:</hi> Nay, he could ſcarce wipe off that ſinne, and recover himſelfe again whilſt he lived.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let us take heed of unprepared coming to the Sacrament; for God will not hold ſuch guiltleſſe: Yea, if his own ſonnes or daughters tranſgreſſe thereby; hee will make them to feele the ſmart of it. But now to come
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61460:116"/>
to all ſuch as come month by month, hand over head, without any examination and repentance, in their uncleanneſſe and abomination, making no <hi>conſcience</hi> of their reformation, let me tell them that it ſhall be one of Chriſts demands of them in the day of judgement. How oft haſt thou been at my Table? How oft haſt thou been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that holy Communion which I gave unto thee? Haſt thou come preparedly, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived worthily, or no? Haſt thou eate bread at my Table with me, and lift up thy heele a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me? Did I command, and thou woudſt not obey? Did I ſend my Miniſters to thee to reform, but thou wouldſt not be <hi>reformed</hi>? Did I check and reprove thee for thy pride, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, drunkenneſſe, covetouſneſſe, anger, wrath, malice, fornication, hyporcriſie and hrophaneſſe in the matter of my worſhip? and yet wouldſt thou <hi>ſtill</hi> live in theſe ſinnes? Where are all the Sacraments that thou haſt received? How haſt thou behaved thy ſelfe? Where are the ſinnes that thou haſt forſaken, and pleaſing corruptions that thou haſt abhorred? What grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe haſt thou received by the <hi>meanes</hi> thou haſt enjoyed? and how haſt thou manifeſted the ſame through thy whole converſation? Oh! woe, woe unto thee, yea and a world of woes unto thee, and unto all ſuch as ſhall bee ſilent and ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to thoſe or the like demands of Chriſt: for they cannot ſay they have come out of their ſins, and have been reformed by the means of grace, and have received ſpirituall nouriſhment and

refreſhing from the heavenly banquet of the Communion of the body and bloud of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A man will eſpecially regard the laſt words of a deare friend, who is as a mans ſoul, when he is to ſpeak upon his death-bed, and will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to remember them: and doſt thou not more regard the laſt Will and Teſtament of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? We count it a horrible ſinne to alter the laſt Will of a man that is dead. Beloved, the Lord Jeſus, before he left this world, inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this bleſſed Sacrament at his laſt Will and Teſtament, and hath given us a charge, that as we would not eate and drink our owne damnation by bringing the guilt of his body and bloud up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſoules, ſo that we ſhould diſcerne the Lords body, and not come unpreparedly in our ſinnes and abominations, without reverence and reſpect of ſuch holy and high myſteries, as if there were nothing to be received and looked for after, then the bare &amp; naked element of bread and wine, or as if we did come to communicate with unclean Devils. O my brethren, if you had but faith, you would be able to diſcerne Chriſt in the Sacrament; and therefore when thou commeſt unto it, thou muſt prepare and ſanctifie thy ſelfe for to communicate with him in thoſe, holy Ordinances and heavenly myſteries of his moſt pretious body and bloud: For if ſo be that thou retaineſt thy ſins, and ſo come unworthily unto this holy Table of the Lord, thou art a great covenant-breaker with God: For thou never
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61460:117"/>
comeſt unto the Communion, but thou makeſt and reneweſt thy covenant with God, wherein thou promiſeſt thus much or the like in effect. Lord, I have been formerly a drunkard, but now I promiſe to give it over, and never to be a drunkard more; I have been a ſcoffer at Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a mocker and derider of thy children; but now I faithfully promiſe (Lord) that I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do ſo any more. I have been wicked and ſinfull, diſobeying and rebelling againſt all thy holy commandements, and reſpected not thy judgements and thy promiſes, and have beene careleſſe of thy glory: But now (Lord) as I eate this bread, and drink this wine; ſo I covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and promiſe to thee, that I will amend all my ſinfull wayes, and become a reformed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. And as I ever look that the body and bloud of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt repreſented in the elements, ſhould nouriſh my ſoule unto eternall life: ſo I promiſe to be diſobedient to the Devil, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and obedient unto thee. I will ſtop my ears againſt the alluring inchantments of the world, and wicked ſuggeſtions of the Devill; but I will open them wide to hearken to thy voyce, that I may obey thy commands. But now as thou haſt made ir, ſo if thou haſt broken this thy cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, returning to thy former courſes of ſin and diſobedience againſt him, know thou, that this covenant of thine which thou haſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſhall ſtand in full force againſt thee: for God will aſſuredly <hi>require</hi> it at thy hands: and all the Sacraments which thou haſt received,

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No; but a man may eate and drink his own damnation <hi>three</hi> wayes: Firſt, <hi>in regard of guilt and liableneſſe unto Gods wrath</hi>: and ſo he that eateth and drinketh his naturall food, his dinner, ſupper, or breakfaſt in his ſinnes, eateth and drinketh his own damnation: yea, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, that commeſt unto this holy ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet in thy ſinnes, in thy pride, choler, malice, wrath or revenge, covetouſneſſe, hypocriſie, and deadneſſe in Gods ſervice, thou never eateſt a bit of bread, but thou eateſt and drinkeſt thine own damnation; that is, thou eateſt and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that which will <hi>witneſſe</hi> againſt thee another day, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.16, 17, 18, 19 verſes, &amp;c. <hi>If thou wilt not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to obſerve and doe all his commandements, then all theſe curſes ſhall come upon thee &amp; overtake thee: Curſed ſhalt thou be in the City, and curſed in the field, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhal be thy basket and thy ſtore.</hi> Now if thy bread be curſed, then thou alſo art curſed that eateſt it</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>in regard of the ſeale and obligation in the conſcience</hi>; ſo he that eateth and drinketh the Sacrament in his ſins, eateth and drinketh his own damnation; that is, he eates and drinks
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61460:118"/>
that which ſeals up his damnation againſt the great day of account. And thus many amongſt us, and I feare the moſt part of this Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have eate and drunk their own damnation. But this ſeale may be broken off, and God grant it may.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in regard of ſigillation in heaven; and ſo he that eats and drinks unworthily, and will not be reformed; he that receives the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment time after time, but ſtill retains his ſins, and will not be humbled for them, not forſake them, he ſetteth a ſeale in heaven upon his own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all the whole world can never break off, but ſuch a one moſt certainly is a damned creature.</p>
               <p>And now (my brethren) God forbid there ſhould be any ſuch here, but that this ſeale may bee broken off: And O that God would put ſome ſtrength into this word, that it may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by your godly ſorrow for your ſin, and forſaking of them all: for if this ſeale be ſet on your damnation, why do I yet ſpeak unto you, and intreat and beſeech you in the name of Chriſt to come home and be reconciled to him? and I deſire to ſtand here, as <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> ſet Porters at the gates of the City, and of the houſe of the Lord, to keep off all thoſe that come in their uncleanneſſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.19. So I ſtand this day as the Porter of the Lord, to keep the Lords watch, that no prophane wretch, no proud hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſinner, that means not to enter into a new courſe of life, that no ſuch one come unto this
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61460:118"/>
holy communion. I charge that as you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the guilt of Chriſts bloud before Gods Throne, that thou meddle not with it. But now if there ſhould be any that would abſent himſelfe becauſe he will the more freely go on in his ſins, let him know that ſuch a one excludes himſelfe from the benefits and merits of Chriſts death, and ſhall never have the benefit of a Redeemer at the day of judgement; but ſhall periſh in his ſins for his careleſſe neglect and fearfull contempt of ſo effectuall and powerfull means of ſalvation and purging, as is the bloud of Chriſt truly and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered in the Sacrament. Wherefore if thou comeſt or comeſt not, woe is thee, if ſo be thou liveſt and continueſt in thy ſins, and goeſt on in thy unholy courſes.</p>
               <p>And now to conclude; as the Cherubim ſtood before Paradiſe with a naked ſword to keep <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> out, that he might not enter and ſo eate of the tree of life: ſo I bring with me the ſword of God, to run it up to the hilts in the heart and bowels of every ungodly man, every rebellious and impenitent ſinner this day, that dares pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ruſh upon this holy Ordinance of God, with a polluted and uncleane heart. Therefore let me exhort thee, that as thou tendreſt the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall good of thy ſoul, ſo thou be carefull not to eate the body of Chriſt, nor drink his bloud in thy ſins, leſt thou eate thine owne bane, and drink thine owne curſe: Nay, ſo doing, thy miſery will bee ſo great, as a good man well weighing and conſidering of it, ſaid, I profeſſe I had rather
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61460:119"/>
have all my veins cut open, and my bloud ſpilt on the ground, then deliver the body and bloud of Chriſt unto a prophane ſinner: for why ſhould I deliver his own bane and deſtruction unto him? But now (my brethren and beloved) come out of your ſins, come and welcome, if you part with your luſts, and ſo you ſhall be ſure to have his bloud to waſh your heart, and cleanſe you, his righteouſneſſe to cleare you, and cloath you, his graces to ſtrengthen you, his ſpirit to heal and to ſanctifie your hearts and natures; and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to ſupply all good that is wanting in you. But if yet notwithſtanding all this that hath been ſaid, you will go on in your ſins, and live as you did in your ſwearing, whoring, lying, and drinking, and all manner of filthineſſe; and as you came unto it unclean, ſo you depart away from it more unclean, and never make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of any reformation, I pronounce this day before God and his elect Angels, that thou ſhalt ſurely periſh, and thy ſoule and body be damned and tormented in the ſcorching flames of hell for evermore. Therefore hearken unto inſtruction, and give eare unto councell, now whiles that the Lord offers it to you, that ſo you may not harden your hearts any more, but may heare and obey, that your ſouls may live, and ſo coming together to this holy and bleſſed Communion for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and not for the worſe, you may return home with the bleſſing of children.</p>

It is not to come and ſit in your Pewes, and wait till the Bread come, and take it; and till the Cup come, and drink it; ſo many a reprobate may doe, and the Corinthians did, that did eate and drink their own damnation: But there muſt be a ſolemne preparation to it, to be <hi>ſealed with the Spirit of Promiſe,</hi> to be righteous by faith in the body and blood of Chriſt; For a man to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and empty of his ſinne, to bee thirſty after the pretious blood of Chriſt, to be fed and built up in the promiſes; It is a weighty thing to come to the Communion: a man muſt bee a <hi>worthy man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>I might here take notice too of the <hi>frequencie</hi> of the duty:<note place="margin">The Lords Supper to be received often.</note> for ſo it hath dependance on thoſe words formerly, <hi>As oft as yee eat this bread, and drink this cup, yee ſhew the Lords death,</hi> and ſo that is, as oft as ye eate, do it in this manner.

               <p>Again, I might obſerve here from this myſtery received, in that he cals it <hi>Bread,</hi> I might obſerve againſt the Papiſts Tranſubſtantiation, that the bread received, is <hi>not tranſubſtantiated,</hi> it is bread.

               <p>Now the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this are:</p>

                  <note place="margin">

The Lord commands the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as well as matter.</note> The Lord he will have his ſervice well done, as well as done, he will have the work well performed, as well as performed. It is not only the thing that the Lord ſtands upon, but the right manner and kind of doing it.</p>
               <p>When <hi>David</hi> perſwaded his ſonne <hi>Solomon</hi> to worſhip the God of his Fathers, he bids him not only do the thing, but do it in a right manner, <hi>And thou my ſonne</hi> Solomon,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 28.9.</note>

He commands him to do it, not only for the matter of it, but in the right manner of it. A man may ſerve God, but if it be not with a perfect heart, and a willing minde, and with a chearfull ſpirit; if he be not ready to <hi>every</hi> command, if he do not open his eares to every rebuke, a man doth not ſerve God at all. The <hi>manner</hi> either makes all, or marres all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another Reaſon is,<note place="margin">

God: the Lord commands us to <hi>pray,</hi> that we call upon his name <hi>duly, every day, in all our needs and neceſſities,</hi> upon all occaſions <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</hi> But now if we pray not <hi>aright,</hi> not in that <hi>manner</hi> that the Lord hath perſcribed; if we pray either with a guilty defiled conſcience, with cold affections, with a dead ſpirit, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out departing from iniquity, or without a pure heart: if a man pray without the right manner of prayer, he marres all his prayer, it is a <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and not a prayer. <hi>They did not cry to mee</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>when they howled on their beds,</hi> that is, when they prayed: but becauſe they did not pray in a right manner, the Lord calls it a <hi>howling,</hi> and not a <hi>prayer.</hi>

                  <hi>We roare as Beares,</hi> in <hi>Iſay</hi> 59.12. the Prophet nicknames it, ſpeaking in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the people, he calls it the <hi>roaring of Beares</hi>: The Lord had as lief heare the barking of a Dog, or the grunting of a Swine, as a man that doth not pray <hi>aright,</hi> with a bleeding heart, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of ſoule and ſpirit, with a <hi>ſpirit of grace and ſupplication.</hi> When a man prayes, and prayes dot aright, his prayer leaves that name, it is no more a prayer in Gods account.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2 Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>And ſo <hi>preaching,</hi> it is an admirable action; but if a man doe not preach <hi>aright,</hi> if it be <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering with the enticing words of mans wiſdome, or beating the aire,</hi> and to ſhew his owne <hi>learning,</hi> this overthrowes the action of preaching, hee preacheth not <hi>Chriſt</hi> but <hi>himſelfe; himſelfe,</hi> not the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> though the Goſpel bee in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all over, yet himſelfe hee preacheth,

the action is marred, the circumſtance mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it.</p>
               <p>So in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 Receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> if a man come not prepared, that he have not the <hi>Wedding Garment,</hi> that he be not aright qualified according to the requiſites of the Goſpel, this is not to eate the Lords Supper.

               </p>
               <p>So if a man come to <hi>reprove his brother,</hi>

               <p>So for men to tell one another of their faults, and to tell them with a ſpirit of bitterneſſe; this is not Chriſtian dehortation, but <hi>biting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Gal.</hi> 5.15.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.15.</note>

Eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.</note> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is lawfull, and drinking is lawfull, and <hi>marrying and giving in marriage,</hi> all theſe are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet if a man eate not <hi>aright,</hi> and drink not <hi>aright,</hi> and <hi>marry in the Lord,</hi> and eate and drink <hi>with title to the Lords creatures,</hi> that he have intereſt in the covenant of God, if Chriſt be not in it, how ſhall he have comfort? Nay, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature of his eating is alrered, his eating and

drinking, and marrying is a ſinne. As our Lord Chriſt ſhews of the old world, <hi>They did eat and drinke, and were marrying and giving in marriage, till</hi> Noah <hi>entred into the Arke, and the flood came and ſwept them away,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 24.37.</note> Matth. 24.37. He reckons their <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> among their <hi>ſins,</hi> among the reaſons and cauſes why the flood came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they did eate and drink, and marry and give in marriage.</p>

                  </label> You will ſay, <hi>Was that the reaſon the flood came? And was that an argument of their ſecurity? Did not</hi> Noah <hi>eate and drink and marry? And were not his ſons married that were in the Arke, and he a grand-father.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There be Rules in eating and drinking, in tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and diſcourſing, in doing the duties of our callings: There be Rules how you ought to buy and ſell, and to do every good word and worke. If theſe Rules be not obſerved, the Rules of Gods bleſſed word, the <hi>actions</hi> themſelves are altered; though the <hi>things</hi> be <hi>commanded</hi> of God, yet they are curſed and <hi>abominable</hi> things, when the true form and faſhion of them is not regarded, though they be never ſo godly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note>A garment, though it be never ſo good, if the Taylor handle it not well, it is marred in the making, if hee bring it not to a right forme,

and make it in a right manner, the man that is to have the garment, is diſappointed. So Timber, though it be never ſo excellent, though it be all Oke, or Elm, or whatſoever tree, though it be never ſo fit for building, if the Artificer deale not well in handling it, the inhabitant that comes there, may curſe the day that ever he came there: If it be not well built, it may fall on his head and kill him, and all that belongs to him. So it is in all the Ordinances of God, and the matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we muſt not only do them for matter, but for <hi>manner</hi> too: for that either makes or marres them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another Reaſon is,<note place="margin">

I ſay, all the bleſſings of God are promiſed to the right <hi>manner of doing.</hi> Now, what is it, when we doe duties, what doe we look for? Is it not for a <hi>bleſſing</hi>?

And as Chriſt hath done thus, ſo all that are Chriſts: all the ſervants of God in all ages, they have been very carefull, eſpecially of the <hi>right manner</hi> of obeying God.

made all the roomes: <hi>ſo</hi> hee made it in the ſame forme and figure, and in the ſame ſimilitude, juſt as the Lord ſet him downe the patterne, <hi>even ſo did he.</hi> So the Lord ſets down the patterne of every good word and work, of all our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Sermons, and hearing, and conference, and keeping the Sabbath, and ſpeaking holily: all our <hi>actions</hi> have their <hi>patterne</hi> ſet downe in the word of God.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. To reprove thoſe that barely doe duties, without looking to the manner.</note> that we muſt not onely come to the Sacrament; but come aright; or doe any dutie, but we muſt do it in a <hi>right</hi> manner? <hi>This ſervs to condemne that naturall popery that is in mens hearts, that is of opus operatum, of the deed done</hi>; this is the religion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſo a man doe the duty (indeed it is better if it bee done in a right manner, but) if it be done, there is ſomewhat a man may look for by that. If a man come to the Sacrament, the very eating of the Hoſt, the very partaking of the body of Chriſt, they make it <hi>meritorious</hi>: ſo the very hearing of <hi>ſo many</hi> Sermons, the very ſaying of <hi>ſo many</hi> prayers, the very performanec of <hi>ſo many</hi> duties, the very <hi>thing it ſelf,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly conſidered, it is of ſome validity. This is rooted in the hearts of men, we ſee it up and downe, people doe the duty, and think all is well enough, when they conſider not how it is done. People pray, but not with <hi>zeale</hi>; they heare, but not with reverence: People come to the Sacrament, not <hi>for the better, but for the worſe,</hi> they come not in a <hi>right manner</hi>; and yet every one hopes to ſpeed, and builds himſelfe on this, that God accepts of him. But this is the folly of mens hearts; it is an evident argument
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61460:132"/>
that men goe fooliſhly to work in the wayes of God. It is the brand of a foole not to be able to <hi>obſerve circumſtances. Ariſtotle</hi> the heathen, hee ſaith, <hi>it is the part of a wiſe man to think of, and underſtand the manner of actions</hi>; as a wiſe man ſaith, he obſerves circumſtances. It is a part of wiſdome to obſerve the right circumſtances of every action, as it is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Walke circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly,</hi> that is, <hi>accurately,</hi> as it is in the originall, <hi>not as fooles, but as wiſe.</hi> Marke, hee perſwades them to a right manner of walking; not only to walk in a good courſe, in praying, and hearing, in obedience and ſobrietie, in temperance, faith, and diligence in our callings; but doe it <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,</hi> in a right manner; doe it as wiſe men, and not as fooles, they doe it in a wrong manner. It is the part of a foole, I ſay, to doe a thing, and to leave the right manner of doing it. Now this is nothing with God, the Lord doth not eſteeme any action, though it bee never ſo frequently done, except it bee done with his owne ſtamp, except it have his owne character upon it.</p>
               <p>I remember a ſtory in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.26. The Aſſyrians there obſerved, that God ſent Lions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, becauſe they did not obſerve the right manner of the God of Iſrael: they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the God of Iſrael; but becauſe they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not the right <hi>Manner</hi> of his word, hee ſent Lyons among them, to teare and devoure them in pieces. So though wee pray, and heare, and read, and profeſſe, and have a <hi>name</hi> that wee live; and though we be taken for good people, &amp;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61460:132"/>
heap up duties from day to day, and vie perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; and though we doe them as many times as the children of God; nay, though we could do them ten thouſands times oftner then they, yet if we doe them not in <hi>a rightmanner,</hi> if wee know not the manner of the God of heaven, and earth, with humble hearts, and ſelfe-denying ſpirits, with holineſſe of affection, and with puritie of heart: if a man doe them not in a right manner, the Lord will teare him in peices, and hee ſhall have no deliverance for all that.</p>

                  <hi>to doe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the matter, and care not to doe them in a right manner.</hi> It will not be amiſſe a little to ſhew the myſtery of this thing: for we ſee every man is willing to doe duties, every man will be praying, and comming to Church, many repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and God knows how many carnall hearts are in this congregation, ſome drunkards it may be, ſome adulterers, ſome it may be, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted whoredome the laſt night, ſome that have been ſwearing even now, and deceiving in their ſhops, there are many carnall hearts: yet every man is willing to do duties, to hear, and to pray.

               <p>The firſt is this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties eaſie.</note>

And ſo <hi>it is eaſie to come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to take the Bread and the Cup, and to pray for a bleſſing, this is eaſie; but, when a man comes to a duty in a <hi>right manner,</hi> here is <hi>difficulty,</hi> when a man doth it with a <hi>How; Take heed How you beare.</hi> He doth not call upon people to hear, that is not the matter; there needs no great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence for that: but if you will conſider <hi>How</hi> you hear, take heed to that. Here muſt be a great deal of circumſpection; the ſoul muſt be marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous painfull, a man muſt offer violence to his own ſoul; a man muſt fight againſt his own wil, a man muſt beat down his own ſpirit, he muſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his own thoughts, muſt mortify his own mind &amp; beat down his own ſoul. It is a hard thing to do it in a <hi>right manner,</hi> as the Lord commands, if we conſider now how to doe it. This is certaine, fleſh and blood cannot abide to take pains; if it can ſerve God with eaſe, and pray with eaſe, that it will doe; but for a man to <hi>weep</hi> before God, for a man to <hi>indict his heart</hi> to the throne of grace, to <hi>rend his bowels</hi> before his Maker, to <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And ſo for the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> for a man to come in a <hi>right manner,</hi> Oh it is <hi>difficult</hi> to fleſh and blood; for a man to goe and <hi>examine all his life,</hi> to <hi>reckon up all his converſation,</hi> to <hi>anotomize himſelf from his cradle to this moment</hi>; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how he hath <hi>ſinned</hi> in his <hi>calling,</hi> in his <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> in his <hi>ſhop,</hi> in his <hi>company,</hi> in his <hi>ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, another reaſon is this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The matter of duties may bee done with a proud heart.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe the matter of duties may be done with a proud heart</hi>; there is no duty but a man may do it with a proud heart, and never bee humble. A man may <hi>pray,</hi> and uſe good words, and make good petitions, and have marvellous good language, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſes, and termes, and paſſages, and an admirable ſweet tone, and yet have a <hi>proud</hi> heart. A man may come and <hi>preach</hi> a Sermon, he may preach ſo as that he may ſtrangely affect the hearts of the people, and may make all
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61460:134"/>
the people wonder and <hi>admire at the gracious words that come from his mouth,</hi> and yet have a <hi>proud</hi> heart.</p>
               <p>A man may <hi>heare,</hi> and heare oft, and hear the beſt Preachers in the Citie, and delight in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet have a proud heart. A man may <hi>come to the Sacrament,</hi> and ſit to ones thinking, as devoutly as any in the Church, and pray when the people pray, and give thanks when others give thanks, and have a kind of <hi>morall</hi> faith in the Covenant, and a morrall application of the promiſes, and yet have a <hi>proud</hi> heart. It is the <hi>manner</hi> of doing duties that humbles the ſoule, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Acts 20</note> 
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>You know in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have beene with you.</hi> Why, what was the manner? <hi>In all humility of mind,</hi> ſaith he, being among the Epheſians, preaching to them in a right manner, leaving them the example of his owne patterne, doing all this in a right manner, he did it in <hi>all humility</hi> of heart. It is the right <hi>manner</hi> of prayer that <hi>pulls downe the heart</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. It is the right manner of hearing the word, that makes a man melt at it. It is the right manner of comming to the Sacrament, that makes a man <hi>feele the comfort of God,</hi> and the promiſes of the Goſpel, and to ſeek and find the admirable things contained in it.<note place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, another Reeſon is; <hi>Becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may ſtand with an unholy life.</hi> A man may do a duty for the matter of it, and yet be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61460:134"/>
This is plain; how many thouſands are there that pray, and yet are vain, and covetous, and carnall? How many thouſands heare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and yet are unprofitable? <hi>Ever hearing, and never come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> If they were injurious <hi>before,</hi> they are injurious <hi>ſtill</hi>; if they were couſners before, they are ſo ſtill, if they were drunkards before, they are ſo ſtill. A man may receive the Sacrament every month, and yet may have his luſts, and roll them as a ſweet morſell under his tongue; he may delight in his ſecret luſts, and go on in the deadneſſe of his heart. It is the right manner of worſhipping of God, that purgeth the conſcience, and purifieth the ſoule, and makes a man that there is no room for his corruptions, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>You your ſelves know</hi> (ſaith the Apſtle) <hi>how holily and unblamably we walked among you.</hi> He ſpeaks there of his manner of walking, and hee ſaith to them, becauſe it was in a right manner, it was an <hi>holy</hi> manner; ſuch walking as excluded all unholineſſe and prophaneſſe. Fleſh and bloud cannot abide this. Men they love to pray and be proud; they love to hear ſermons, and to have their profit; they love to profeſſe religion, and ſtill to carry their ſecret luſts in their boſomes. People love this alife, to <hi>go up to Gilgall and tranſgreſſe, to offer ſacrifice every new Moon, and every morning, and to find the labour of their hands,</hi> this is right; but for a man to <hi>part</hi> with his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that is the thing that goes againſt the haire.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. The matter of duties brings not the croſſe.</note>The laſt reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the matter of duties bring not the croſſe upon a man.</hi> A man may do all the duties of Religion, and never be perſecuted for it: a man may be as devout as the devouteſt man under heaven, and yet no body hate him for it, except he be devout in a right manner, and worſhip God in a right manner. One man may reprove another that is wicked. A drunkard may ſuffer a drunkards reproof, and be never the worſe: A whore maſter may ſerve his quean ſo, he may call her ſo, and yet not be ſpighted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not right. It is the right doing of it that brings the croſſe;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.10</note> as in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Thou knoweſt my manner of life.</hi> It was that that brought afflictions and perſecutions.</p>
               <p>We may ſee to this very day many thouſands that ſeem devout men in the Church, they will pray, and will hardly miſſe any time of prayer morning or evening; and yet they are farre from being perſecuted: nay, many of them are maine perſecuters of the Goſpel of God, enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt, adverſaries to the Saints of God.<note place="margin">Act. 15.5.</note> We ſee it plain in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.5. we read there of <hi>devout women</hi> that <hi>raiſed perſecution</hi> againſt <hi>Paul.</hi> Marke, they were <hi>devout,</hi> and becauſe it was <hi>not in a right mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though wicked men do not love to pray aright, yet many of them are much for praying, they care not how much praying they have, and when they are at prayers, they will pray over from the beginning of the book
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61460:135"/>
to the end, they love it alife. But if they come to a <hi>prayer</hi> that <hi>moves the heart,</hi> that <hi>rifles the conſcience,</hi> that <hi>dogges a man into his boſome, that laies a man flat on his face before God,</hi> they gnaſh their teeth at ſuch a prayer. So they love <hi>preaching</hi> too; I, it is true, if it be preaching that is flaunting, and gloſing, <hi>with the enticing words of mans wiſdome:</hi> but if a man preach <hi>to the conſience,</hi> if he preach the <hi>pure naked word of God:</hi> and carry it <hi>home to mens ſoules,</hi> this makes them gnaſh their very teeth, and they could eate the Miniſter of God for his labour. It is the right manner of duty that is accompanied with the croſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. To labour to do du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties aright.</note> if we ought to be carefull to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme duties in a right manner, <hi>Let us be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted in the feare of God, to go and quicken all our duties, to bring a ſoule into ſo many bodies</hi>; we have bodies of praying, and bodies of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bodies of receiving the Sacrament, and of good duties, let us get a <hi>ſoule</hi> into them, labour to do them in a right manner. The <hi>bare duty</hi> is like a carcaſſe. It is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb of the Jewes, <hi>Prayer without preparation, it is as a carcaſſe without the ſoule,</hi> that is, a loathſome thing; ſo is prayer without life, and without a right manner of pouring it forth. Let us labour therefore in the feare of God, to pray, and pray <hi>aright,</hi> to heare, and to heare <hi>aright</hi>; to ſeek God, and to ſeek him with all our hearts, aright, and to do every thing in the right way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:61460:136"/>
                  <note place="margin">Motives to perform duties in the right manner. 1. Motive. Numb. 11.14.</note>Let us <hi>conſider,</hi> firſt, <hi>we doe not pertake of any ordinance at all, except we doe it in a right manner.</hi> I remember a fit place for this in <hi>Num.</hi> 11.14. It is ſaid there, <hi>The ſtranger ſhall eat the paſſover, and pertake of it according to the ordinance, and the manner of it.</hi> Where the Text puts in the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the Paſſover, and the <hi>Manner</hi> of it. For it is all one, they are <hi>Synonyma's.</hi> So the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi> in every duty, Gods <hi>ordinance</hi> in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in hearing the Word, in the Sacrament, in reproof, in every good dutie, it is all one as the ſelfe-ſame thing. So that if we pray, and doe not pray in a <hi>right manner,</hi> we have not <hi>praied,</hi> we doe not partake of the ordinance. So when we come to the Sacrament, the ordinance of the manner of it is all one; it is one compleat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete action, we doe not partake of it, except we partake of both.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Motive.</note>Secondly conſider, <hi>it as nothing but hypocriſie, when a man prayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and doth not pray in a right m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nner</hi>; when a man doth any dutie to God, and not in the right wiſe, it is nothing but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, Mark how our Saviour Chriſt ſets forth the hypocriſie of the Phariſee, <hi>Luke.</hi> 18.11. <hi>The Phariſee ſtood and prayed thus with himſelfe,</hi> he marks his manner of prayer;<note place="margin">Luk. 18.11</note> he doth not ſay, <hi>He ſtood and prayed This,</hi> theſe words, but <hi>Thus</hi> he prayed, he did not pray in a right manner: there was his hypocriſie, and that was the reaſon he went home not juſtified.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. Motive. Mat. 15 6.</note>Thirdly conſider: <hi>it makes the Ordinance of God of no effect. Thus they make the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61460:136"/>
of God of none effect, Matth.</hi> 15.6. Hee ſpeakes there of their duties that they did in a wrong manner, and their expounding the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they did in a wrong wiſe; and their ſacrifice, their offerings, and tithings, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and many things that were all done after another faſhion then God had commanded; therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Thus, they make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God of none effect.</hi> So we make all the duties of Gods worſhip of <hi>none effect.</hi> Wee know there is never an ordinance of God, but it hath great effect if it be rightly performed. Prayer is of great effect, it is able to rend hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it is able to pull down God to the ſoule, it is able to wraſtle out a bleſſing, to quicken the heart, to obtain of God every thing we want: but if a man pray not aright, a man may pray, and go away never a whit the more holy, nor more quickned, nor neerer to heaven, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. So <hi>preaching and hearing,</hi> they are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ordinances, what powerfull effects have they wrought when they have beene done in a right kind? People have cried out and beene converted at them; and many a man hath been pulled out of the power of Satan to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Jeſus Chriſt. They had royall glorious effects upon many thouſand ſoules. But what is the reaſon that our hearing is ſo in effectuall? Becauſe wee heare not in a right manner, this makes the Ordinance of God of none effect, it makes Prayer of no effect, the word of no effect, the Sacraments and Sabbaths of no effect;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61460:137"/>
you ſee people partake of theſe things, and are never the wiſer.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>it cannot pleaſe God, it is onely the right manner of doing duties that pleaſeth God,</hi> as in 1 Theſſ. 4.1. <hi>As yee have received of us, How yee ought to walke, and to pleaſe God,</hi> Mark, there is the manner, <hi>That yee may know HOW to walke,</hi> and by that to pleaſe God. It is not enough for a man to walke in good duties; that a man may doe, and not pleaſe God: but (ſaith he) <hi>yee have received the manner HOW to walke and to pleaſe God.</hi> It is the <hi>manner How</hi> that pleaſeth God. A man may walke to hell upon heavens ground,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he may go to hell in the wayes of God, it is poſſible. Suppoſe a man ſhould go and take (if it were poſſible) all the ſurface of ground between this place and <hi>York,</hi> and lay it between this place and <hi>Dover,</hi> a man might go to <hi>Dover</hi> upon <hi>York</hi> ground. So many a man laies the Ordinances of God in hell way: he walkes in the way to hell, and there he layes his prayers, and there his hearing, and his good duties: hee prayes every day, and hears eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and doth good duties every day, and yet <hi>walkes to hell</hi>; he goes to hell on <hi>heavens</hi> ground. The reaſon is, becauſe hee doth the duty, and doth not obſerve the manner how he doth it.</p>
               <p>The third thing is, the rule of direction, how wee may come to the right manner of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament, that is, by preparing of a mans ſelfe: and the preparation is here ſet

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. Every man muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, before he come to the Lords Table.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot ſtand on this, I will only name it.</p>
               <p>As in the ſacrament of the Paſſeover, there was preparation to the Paſſeover. In <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.14. it is ſaid of the Diſciples of Chriſt, that <hi>they made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the Paſſeover.</hi> In <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. they made the <hi>Lamb</hi> ready, and the <hi>room</hi> ready, and <hi>themſelves</hi> ready, and the <hi>Table</hi> ready, and every thing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. So in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, wherein Chriſt is the true Paſcall Lamb, when we come to eate of him, wee muſt make every thing ready, <hi>faith</hi> ready, and <hi>repentance</hi> ready, and <hi>intereſt in the promiſes</hi> ready, <hi>and hunger and thirſt after theſe ſpirituall dainties</hi> ready, every thing muſt be ready: or elſe, like a man that comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field to battle, that hath not gotten his ſword, or his weapons ready, that is the way for himſelfe to be killed: ſo it is when we come to the Communion, and have not all things ready, it is the way to be damned.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this are,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> It is God ordinance</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe the Sacrament is an Ordinance of God:</hi> Now all the Ordinances of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire reparation, they are all ſpirituall, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally a man is carnall, and therefore cannot be
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61460:138"/>
prepared.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As it is with wood, there is never a tree in the <hi>wood,</hi> but it is unprepared for <hi>buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi> Is there any tree in the wood of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of a Chimney, or of a Lintell, or a Doore? It muſt firſt be prepared, as it is <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.27. <hi>Firſt prepare thy work without, and then build thine houſe.</hi> So every ordinance is to build a man up in the feare of God, in the grace of God: and in Religion: Now man is <hi>naturally</hi> unprepared for it; Firſt, a man muſt fell his wood, and then cut it, and hew it even, and carve it, and plane it fit, and prepare it before he build: So a man muſt hew downe his owne heart, he muſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his owne ſoule, and qualifie all within him, and ſo be ſanctified before hee be fit.</p>
               <p>As for example: In <hi>prayer,</hi> a man muſt bee <hi>prepared</hi> to prayer before he pray; he muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his heart, and then Gods eares will hearken to it. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. The Lord will have the heart prepared before he heare the prayer. So it is with the <hi>word of God,</hi> a man muſt bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared before he heare it: As a man that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth muſt be prepared before he preach, as <hi>Ezra</hi> is ſaid to <hi>prepare his heart, Ezra</hi> 7.10. <hi>Hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his heart to doe the Law, and to teach it.</hi> So a Miniſter cannot <hi>preach,</hi> except he be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared beforehand, with a <hi>commiſſion from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> with preſerving knowledge, with a coale from Gods Altar, with a ſpirit of wiſedome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, with a law of kindneſſe in his lips, with meditation, and with a Theam fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his mouth for the people, hee muſt be
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61460:138"/>
prepared with a <hi>burning and a ſhining light</hi>; or elſe hee ſhall not <hi>edifie</hi> the congregation: So it is with all other ordinances. For <hi>humbling of a mans ſoule,</hi> a man cannot humble his heart, except he be prepared to it, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12. <hi>Prepare to meet thy God,</hi> he ſpeaks of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If a man would humble himſelfe before God, if he be not <hi>prepared,</hi> if his heart be not prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to let go the world, his worldly profits, and vain pleaſures, and carnall acquaintance, his wonted luſts, and former delights. If hee bee not prepared to let theſe goe, when he comes to keep a <hi>Faſt,</hi> or to afflict his ſoule, and goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to do the dutie, to lay himſelfe down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Almighty God, ſome luſt or other will ſtick in his teeth, and intercept his heart, hee ſhall never be able to doe it: as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to the people; <hi>If you will turn to the Lord, prepare your hearts to doe it,</hi> 1 Sam. 7. So it muſt bee in all the ordinances of God, and much more in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, another Reaſon is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 2 Chriſt hath made preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us in the L. Supper.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe the Lord Chriſt hath made great preparations to provide the Lords Supper</hi>; therefore wee muſt be prepared to eate it. You know what a great deale of adoe there was before this Supper was made. Chriſt muſt be incarnate, and fulfill all righteouſneſſe, he muſt conclude it upon his ſuffering; he muſt <hi>tread the wine-preſſe alone,</hi> and ſuffer himſelfe to be beaten and rejected of God, and men, and ſuffer death, <hi>the curſed death of the Croſſe,</hi> all theſe things were concluded upon,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61460:139"/>
before this holy and bleſſed Supper was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Come</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>I have prepared my dinner, Matth.</hi> 22. Mark, Chriſt is fain to <hi>prepare</hi> his dinner, he makes a great Feaſt: there was great preparation for it; ſo there muſt be great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our ſoules before we can come to this <hi>holy</hi> banquet. It is true among men, there may be great preparation for a feaſt, and little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the eating of it. Sometimes there are two or three dayes preparation for a Feaſt, and it is eaten preſently. The reaſon is, becauſe man naturally hungers after meat and drink, and he alwayes provides twice or thrice in twenty foure houres, for eating and drinking: But the Lords Supper is a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> banquet, a man is every day, and houre, and moment, naturally <hi>unfit</hi> for it; and there is much adoe to put an edge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens appetites, and a keenneſſe upon mens deſires, that they may bee fitted and prepared for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 3 Chriſt lookes for good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>Thirdly, another reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the Lord Chriſt, when he adminiſters himſelfe in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly myſtery, he offers to come into the ſoule, and he looks for good entertainment</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſity there muſt bee preparation for it. You ſee when a mortall man, an earthly <hi>Prince,</hi> or a <hi>Noble man</hi> comes to another mans houſe, what a deale of preparation there is to provide for him: there is meat made ready, and purging the houſe, and ſweeping the yard, and trimming up the very pales, and every thing, and making clean all the Chambers, and riding
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61460:139"/>
out whatſoever fills it, and every thing that is out of order is ſet in tune, And, what will my <hi>Lord</hi> think? and what will his <hi>Majeſty</hi> think? he will think he is ſlighted and contemned: And when he comes in, it may be, his owne children ſhall ſerve, and his owne wife wait at the Table; and there is running up and down of errands, and a great deale of adoe to give ſuch a one entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is preparation to entertain a man, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Philemon, I will that thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare me a lodging</hi>: how much more when <hi>the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God</hi> ſhall come under a mans roof, and dine with him?</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4. It is part of Chriſts laſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, it is a part of Chriſts laſt Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</hi> Now it is a terrible thing when we <hi>know</hi> our Lords will, and <hi>prepare</hi> not for the doing of it. Look in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.48. he that knew it not, did things worthy of ſtripes; but in verſe 47. <hi>That ſervant that knew his Lords will, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not himſelfe, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> that man ſhall be damned with <hi>much</hi> damnation: he ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned deeper then any body. Doſt thou know that the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> that this bleſſed Sacrament, it is part of <hi>Chriſts laſt Teſtament?</hi> and wilt thou not prepare thy ſelfe for it, to get an humble heart, and labour for a holy life, and ſeek for a thirſty ſoule, and vow upon new obedience, and enter into Covenant with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for a better kind of converſation for the time to come? Wilt thou not go and examine thine
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61460:140"/>
own ſoul, and go and reforme whatſoever is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in thy family, in thy place and calling? Wilt thou not do theſe things to prepare for this holy will of Jeſus Chriſt? thou ſhalt be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned deeper then any body elſe, becauſe this is a part of Gods laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thou knoweſt it, and therefore woe unto thee if thou prepare not for it.</p>

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61460:142"/>
remedy.</hi> The othet is as we have it here tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>He that being often reproved, hardeneth his necke, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deſire to ſpeak of <hi>both</hi> theſe expoſitions, fot feare I ſhould miſſe the true ſenſe of this Text.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, it is a truth of God every where confirmed in the Scriptures, <hi>that hee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves another, and yet hardeneth his owne heare, hee doth but make a rod for his owne back, hee puls ſudden deſtruction upon his owne ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is no hinderance from the context, but that this may bee the meaning of the text: you know the <hi>Proverbs</hi> have little or no coherence, except two or three chapters. Indeed there is a coherence in them, but <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> through the Proverbs there is none; ſo that if the text it ſelfe will beare one expoſition as well as another indifferently, the meaning none can tell, onely as it is hit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, the <hi>Text</hi> it ſelfe ſavours <hi>this</hi> expoſition: for ſo the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, <hi>A man of reproofes, that hardens his owne neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Queſtion is. Whether the wiſe mans meaning here be of the actuall reproof, the reproving of another; or of <hi>paſſive</hi> reproof, this is undetermined which of theſe is meant.</p>
               <p>A man can have no light from the coherence,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61460:142"/>
none in the world; and from the text it ſelfe, there is as much reaſon why we ſhould expound it one way (even almoſt) as the other. So that I ſay, for feare I ſhould let goe the true meaning of the wiſe man. I deſire to ſpeak a little of the <hi>active</hi> ſenſe. <hi>He that often reproveth another, and yet hardeneth his own neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy.</hi> From hence I may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A reprover</hi> (whether a Maſter or a Miniſter,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. A guilty hardned reprover, ſhall be deſtroyed.</note> or a Magiſtrate, or a Father, or a private Chriſtian, be he what he will be) <hi>that reproveth another, and yet is guilty himſelfe</hi> either in the ſame kind, or elſe in another, or in any kind) <hi>and hardeneth his own heart in it, that man ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed without remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take a <hi>Preacher</hi> that preacheth ſtrict doctrine to the people, that is very zealous againſt their ſinnes, he is up with hell and damnation againſt their filthy courſes: he preacheth for quickning, but <hi>himſelfe</hi> is not quickned; hee threatneth judgments againſt hardneſſe of heart, and yet he hath a hard heart <hi>himſelfe</hi>; this man puls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon his owne pate. Hee is like the Phariſees, that impoſed <hi>upon others grievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and heavie to be born, but would not touch them with one of their fingers themſelves,</hi> Matth. 23.4.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reaſon</hi> of this is, becauſe</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>ſuch a reprover of ſinne,</hi>

ſhould be blameleſſe; how much more <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that beare the office of <hi>reprovers</hi>? they ſhould be <hi>blameleſſe.</hi> Nay, if a man, though hee take not the office of a reprover, yet if he beare the <hi>perſon</hi> of a reprover (as every private Chriſtian muſt when God calls him to it: for <hi>every</hi> man may be called to <hi>reprove</hi>) though he have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over another, though hee bee a <hi>private</hi> man, he may beare the <hi>perſon</hi> though not the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a reprover.

for then thou wouldeſt deteſt thy owne ſinne.

Chriſt puts it to a mans conſcience, why hee reproves his brother, when hee is faulty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another Reaſon is,<note place="margin">

For when a man reproves ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he takes a form upon himſelfe of one that is <hi>zealous</hi> againſt ſin, and an enemy to all ſinfull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes: Now what is this but hypocriſie, when a man hath not this in him that he <hi>pretends</hi>? when a man finds fault with anothers pride, as if he were humble forſooth, with anothers worldlineſſe as if he were liberall; when a man doth ſo, he incurres the <hi>guilt of hypocriſie</hi> in <hi>repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> another.</p>

               <p>I anſwer, that ſuch a man is in a dilemma; for the man is bound to reprove; in regard of his office, and yet he is bound in conſcience to go and amend himſelfe firſt. I ſay, he is bound to reprove all thoſe that God calls him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, in regard of his <hi>office</hi>: but in regard of <hi>conſcience</hi> hee is bound to go and amend his owne fault firſt.

Now) let us marke and obſerve this rule, let every one of us labour with all care and conſcience, to be unblameable, unoffenſive, to goe humble our owne ſoules, to cleanſe our own
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61460:147"/>
conſciences, that we may be able to perform this duty. Beloved, we wrong our own ſoules, if we find fault with <hi>others,</hi> and ſuffer <hi>our ſelves</hi> to bee faulty.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> was to preach to the people, knowing that his office of preaching required <hi>reproving,</hi> you ſee leſt he ſhould wrong his own ſoul, how he laboured to be unblameable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaith he, <hi>I beat my body down, when I preach to others, leſt I become a caſt-away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again as a man <hi>wrongs</hi> his <hi>owne ſoule,</hi> ſo he <hi>diſhonours</hi> God. It cannot be unknown what an unthankfull office, the office of a reprover is; the world cannot abide reproof, <hi>The wicked hate the reprover in the gate</hi> Iſa. 29.21. The world is full of ſcorners, that hate reproofe. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.12. Though ſome men be not ſo wicked as to hate reproofe, yet at leaſt they think hardly of them that reprove; they think they uſurp authority over them, and crow over them, or they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to bee their betters; as a reprover under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in that thing to bee a mans better. Now when a man is reproved, he is apt to think that his neighbour crowes over him, and excerciſeth authority upon him, as if he would grow on him, and be his Iudge. You ſee <hi>Lot</hi> when he reproved the Sodomites, though as gently as ever he could. <hi>My brethren, doe not ſo wickdly,</hi> preſently for all that they thought hardly of him. <hi>What, will this fellow be a judg that came but the other day to ſojurn?

A man cannot reprove his brother for his ſinne, but it is a thouſand to one, if his brother bee not ready preſently to pry into him and to look nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into his wayes, to eſpy a hole in his coat if he can, or to make one if he cannot: all mens eyes are upon him, and they look ſtrictly and ſtraitly; and if any thing in the world bee amiſſe they will be ſure to mark it, and to make more of it, to make mountaines of mole-hills. When the blind man did but find fault with the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees and reprove them a little for perſecuting of Chriſt, what ſay they? <hi>Art thou altogether concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and born in ſinne, and wilt thou teach us</hi>? Joh. 9.34. Preſently they looked on his blindneſſe, and birth, Certainly he is a viler ſinner then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, and ſhall he goe find fault with them? If we mean to reprove <hi>another,</hi> let us labour to be unblameable, to be godly and holy, to reform our <hi>own</hi> wayes, let us be ſure to purge our own famlies, to cleanſe our <hi>own</hi> ſoules, to rid our owne hands of all the wayes of ſinne and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leſt God be diſhonoured. The word of God will be flung in his owne face back againe, and the reproof if it be never ſo ſweet, and never ſo wiſe it will be retorted in a mans own teeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if hee be not unblameable himſelfe. And a man had need to be humble, and low<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>All ſinnes are not to be reproved <hi>alike,</hi> ſome with <hi>ſharpneſſe,</hi> ſome with <hi>lenity.</hi> Hee that is a Mountebank that will open a veine for every wheal and pimple.<note place="margin">Simile</note> The reprover is like them in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> when they deale with the Cummin and Fetches, a little rod will beat them out, but when they come to the Corne, Wheat and Rie, they beat them out with the Cart-wheele: So when we meet with a hard-hearted ſpirit, wee muſt uſe <hi>ſtronger</hi> corroſives to them, and gentler admonitions and rebukes towards others that ſinne with a leſſer and a weaker hand. But this is a thing that a man muſt be marvellous carefull that reproves. Nay, let a man be unblameable for the preſent, if he have been faulty before, if it were ſeven, or ten, or twenty yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if it be knowne, it is a thouſand to one, but he ſhall be hit in the teeth with it when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves: you committed adultery, and you did ſteale at ſuch a time, if it were never ſo long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not conſent to take <hi>Mark</hi> with him in the miniſtery. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. becauſe he had been offenſive to the Church before.

It may bee proved by <hi>many</hi> places of Scripture, onely I find in Scripture it is brought as an <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation</hi> of ſinne when they ſinned againſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, Hoſea</hi> 5.2. ſaith hee, <hi>they are profound to commit ſinne, though I have been a rebuker of them all.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, though I have been ſo mercifull as to ſhew them the danger of ſinne, to tell them what would come of their wretched courſes: though I have called them to <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and have given them warning what would be the iſſue of theſe things; yet for all this, for all my mercy, they have gone on in their ſinnes though I have <hi>reproved</hi> them.

                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1.

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61460:150"/>

Nay, it is an argument of <hi>hatred</hi> when a man doth <hi>not reprove</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſinne. If God let a man goe on in ſinne, and never tell him of his drunkenneſſe, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find fault with his pride and ſecurity, never convince him, or wound, or touch him, nor deal with him about his unſetled eſtate, and his rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten condition, it is a ſigne God hates the man: but when God reproves a man from day to day, Man, thou art a proud creature, thou ſhalt to hell for thy pride, and hypocriſie, and ſecuritie, and harpneſſe of heart: When the Lord reproves a man from day to day, this is an argument of <hi>love</hi>; the other is an effect of <hi>hatred,</hi> not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, but ſhalt in any wiſe reprove him, and not ſuffer ſinne to be upon him,</hi> Levit. 19.17.

If a man deny food for the body, and let a man rather die of hunger, then hee will give

As <hi>Solomon</hi> brings in the wiſdome of the Father, Jeſus Chriſt, calling upon people, <hi>O yee fooles, how long will yee love folly? turn at my reproof.</hi> Mark what followes, to what end; <hi>I will poure my ſpirit on you.</hi> There is the end he tells them <hi>O yee fooles,</hi> wretched people without underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that go on in ſinne, and harden your owne hearts, that repent not, nor turne not to God, that will not ſubmit to his wiſdome, nor imbrace his word: <hi>yee fooles,</hi> that wrong your own ſouls, <hi>oh turne at my reproof.</hi> Why? This is the reaſon that God reproves a man on this faſhion, it is
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61460:151"/>
that a man may have the Spirit of God granted him. If thou have an eare to <hi>heare</hi> reproof, and a heart to <hi>drink</hi> it in, and to weare it as a crown of gold on thy head, and as a chain about thy neck, thou ſhouldeſt have the Spirit of God for thy labour: the Lord reproves thee that thou mighteſt return back, and have his Spirit, and have mercie and forgiveneſſe. This is all the ill will that Gods Miniſters beare thee, and all the hatred that reprovers ſhew, when they tell thee of thy ſinnes whatſoever they be, that they may ſtop thy ſteps from going downe to Hell.</p>
               <p>When the Lord ſends thee Sermon upon Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Preacher after Preacher, thou art called on day by day, (as you here in this place) This is the infinite goodneſſe of God toward your ſouls; therefore your ſinne is infinite great, if you do not amend, as the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>He that hates reproof ſhall ſurely die, Prov.</hi> 15.10. there is no remedy for that man, that man that puts off re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, God reproves him from day to day, on the Sabbath day, and on the week dayes; hee goes to this man, and there he is reproved; and to another, and there he is reproved; and yet he goes on in this deadneſſe and <hi>formality</hi> in the ordinances of God, that man ſhall ſurely die, there is no remedy, he ſins againſt the infinite mercie of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 3 It is bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove then</note> 
                  <hi>there is no reaſon in the world why reproofe ſhould be taked otherwiſe then with all willingneſſe, and thankfulneſſe, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:61460:152"/>
If a man have but the <hi>reaſon</hi> of a <hi>man</hi> in him, he muſt needs take <hi>reproof</hi> in good part; he muſt be a beaſt that doth not judge well of him that reproves him. There is an excellent place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.1. <hi>He that puts off reproof is bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>; he that hates <hi>reproof,</hi> is a brute, that man hath no reaſon in him. Art thou a ſwearer, and art reproved for it? thy brother tells thee thou wilt be damned for it.

So that whatſoever thy ſin be, he that tells thee of it, there is no reaſon in the world but he ſhould be a dear man to thee. Me thinks of all men under heaven, godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that are faithfull in their place and calling, ſhould be the deareſt men to you upon the face of the earth. Why? becauſe they reprove you, and tell you of your ſins, and what will become of your ſouls, what will be the iſſue and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe of all your wayes. You that come to Church every day, may read a Lecture in the Word of God, what will be your doom at the laſt day: you are told of your pride, and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of your whoredome and oaths, carnall Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers of their ſecure and carnall condition, and common profeſſors of their formality, and other

               <p>The Uſe of this is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, is it ſo,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to want reprovers</note> that it is the infinite mercie of God to reprove men of their ſinnes, to tell them of whatſoever is amiſſe in their hearts and lives? let me tell you, Firſt, <hi>ſee here what an infinite puniſhment God is bringing upon that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome when hee is taking away reprovers, from them</hi>: when God takes away reprovers, he takes away all mercie and loving kindneſſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God when he threatned to deliver up <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> to curſe that Kingdome, to plague them for their rebellion, and utterly to give them over, he ſaith he will take away the reprover; ſaith hee to the Prophet, <hi>Thou ſhalt be dumb, and not open thy mouth, thou ſhalt not be a reprover to this people, Ezek.</hi> 3.26. When the Lord would curſe that people, and bind them over to a reprobate ſenſe, and deliver them to wrath, the Prophet ſhall not be a <hi>reprover,</hi> he ſilences the Prophet. Or as <hi>Piſcator</hi> thinks, the <note n="*" place="margin">or Angel</note> anger of God <hi>ſilenced</hi> him, or confined him to his houſe, that he ſhould not propheſie. So when God ſilences his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that he takes them from a place, or threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to take them away, it is a ſigne of heavie vengeance toward ſuch a people. It may be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked people laughed at them, and made it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of nothing, they were glad that <hi>Ezekiels</hi> mouth was gagged, and it were no matter if the countrey were rid of a company of Puritans; though they had no ſuch word then, they had as bad, they think all is well: but the time will come that they will curſe the day that ever they provoked God to take away their Miniſters; we enjoy them by the mercie of God, other places have loſt them, God knows how ſoon wee may loſe ours. In <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.4. the Lord there when he would ſet out the <hi>deſperate</hi> eſtate of the children of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> he delivers them up to ſuch a ſtate and condition, that none ſhould reprove them, <hi>Let none reprove another.</hi> If they will ſinne let them; if they will go on in idolatry, let them; if they will harden their own hearts, let them; if they will <hi>die</hi> in ſinne, <hi>let them</hi>; if they will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and be damned for ever, let them. <hi>Let no man reprove another.</hi> It is a lamentable ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Generally</hi> people are glad when the Land is ſwept of all the good Miniſters, and the good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God: they had rather heare a fine ſong in a Pulpit, of one that preacheth morally, or it may be preacheth his own ſelfe, or the like, but the time will come, when they ſhall ſay as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is better to heare the reproofe of the wiſe, then the ſong of fooles, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.5.

               <p>Now the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this are,</p>

Herein Gods puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appeares to bee moſt equall, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.5.6. <hi>Thou art righteous, O Lord, in that thou jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt thus: for ſhee hath ſhed the bloud of thy Saints, therefore thou haſt given them bloud to drink, for they are worthy.</hi> Thou thirſtedſt after bloud, there it is for thee: ſo this is moſt equall, when men have dealt thus and thus with God, when God ſhall deal ſo and ſo with thee, thou canſt not find fault. When a man drinks as hebrews, and reaps as he ſowes, and finds as he brings, what inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

is here? <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe, that as when I called they would not hear, ſo when they call, I will not anſwer, Zach.</hi> 7. When God calls upon thee, and thou wilt not hear, afterwards when thou calleſt for mercie, if he do not hear thee, it is juſt.</p>

                     </gap>t ſtops a mans mouth.</note>Secondly, another reaſon is, <hi>becauſe this ſtops a mans mouth, it convinceth a mans conſcience</hi>; when a mans conſcience finds that he is ſerved in his own kind, that he is paid in his own coin, it ſtops his mouth. As <hi>Adonibezek</hi> he had cut off the thumbs and toes of 70. Kings: afterwards hee was ſerved juſt ſo as he had dealt with others; he had cut off their thumbs and toes, and made them gather orts under his table; ſo afterwards his thumbs and toes were cut off. Now mark what his conſcience ſaith, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1.7. <hi>As I have dealt, ſo God hath dealt with me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, God knowes wherefore the children of <hi>Judah</hi> have done this: they know not why they cut off my thumbs, and the reaſon why they cut off my toes; God knowes what they looked at in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing me thus: but Gods juſt providence hath dealt thus with me; in this kind I ſerved others. This is ſo palpable a puniſhment, ſo equall and juſt, that though the ſin were committed twenty yeeres ago, yet a mans conſcience will find out his ſin twenty yeeres after. As <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren they ſold him, and after caſt him into a pit, two and twenty yeeres after, when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was harſh with them, ſee what their conſcience ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61460:155"/>
we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoule, and he beſought us, and we would not heare.</hi> As if they had ſaid; What is the matter why the man is thus harſh? he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw us before, why ſhould he be ſo harſh, and we be ſtrangers? Nay, ſaith conſcience, you are well ſerved, remember you were harſh to your brother; if you dealt ſo with him, marvel not if you be dealt ſo with. And after, when they came to their Inne, and found their mony, they wondred, <hi>What is this that God hath done</hi>? Their conſcience, I warrant you, hit them in the teeth: without doubt they thought the mony that they took for ſelling of their brother, had humbled them as a Ghoſt: did not wee pay the man mony for his corne that we bought? Nay, ſaith conſcience, you are rightly ſerved, here is the money you ſold your brother for, (though it were not ſo) without doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience upbraided them. Naturally wee are apt to find fault with Gods judgements and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but when conſcience ſees the equity of them, we have nothing to ſay.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, all the ſtanders by may ſee the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, when the puniſhment is according to the ſinne: Nay, Divinity makes this argument, that there is a God to judge the earth, becauſe men are puniſhed in their owne kinde. I will ſhew you one example of <hi>Abimilech,</hi> that wretch, that ſlew ſeventy of his brethren upon one ſtone, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.7. afterwards when he came to ſtand under the tower of <hi>Abel,</hi> a woman flung a peice of a milſtone upon his head, and killed him:
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61460:156"/>
This was ſtrange all the ſtanders by might ſay, that <hi>Abimilech</hi> ſhould be killed with a ſtone: no queſtion the woman thought nothing, ſhe flung the ſtone becauſe ſhe had nothing elſe to fling; it was ſtrange that it ſhould hit him ſo pat, it might have hit another as well as him; the ſtone might have fallen to the ground as well as on him; and that it ſhould be by a woman, and a milſtone too: Milſtones are not uſed on the top of a Tower, and a milſtone broken that a woman could lift it, and that he ſhould be killed by a milſtone, and not with a ſword; nay, might all the ſtanders by ſay, This God hath done, he was the ſonne of a ſtrange woman, and a woman hath killed him; he killed his brethren upon one ſtone, and now a ſtone hath killed him; all the world might be able to ſay; This God hath done.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, let no creature in the world complaine of Gods dealing, if he puniſh us according to our kind; he that <hi>kils with the ſword, ſhall bee killed with the ſword.

               <p>Secondly, it is in <hi>Quantity</hi>; God propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the <hi>puniſhment</hi> according to the <hi>ſinne</hi>; he that <hi>ſowes ſparingly, ſhall reap ſparingly</hi>; but he that <hi>ſowes bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully. Little</hi> ſinnes, <hi>little</hi> puniſhments; and <hi>great</hi> ſinnes <hi>great</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:61460:157"/>
puniſhments. There are little ſins, moat ſins, gnat ſins, and there are Camel ſins: ſo there are little and great puniſhments, ſome meet with many, ſome with fewer ſtripes. Juſt according to a mans ſinnes, ſo the Lord ſhapes out the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for great ſinners, great plagues, and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one according to his own meaſure. God hath a pair of Ballance that he means to weigh men in: As he weighed <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> ſo hee will weigh thee, and look how much ſinne thou putteſt in one ſcale, ſo much puniſhment God will put in the other; he will not abate thee one oath, not one idle thought, not one breach of the Sabbath, not one neglect of hearing the Word, or of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties: the Lord will put wrath in one bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, as thou putteſt ſinne in the other; he will make the ſcales even to a haire: as he dealt with <hi>Belſhazzar, He will lay righteouſneſſe to the line,</hi> and judgement to the plummet, and weigh thee out in the ſcales, and thou ſhalt have juſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy ſins.</p>
               <p>As the Lord deales with his own people, he will not abate ſo much as a cup of cold water, but it ſhall be rewarded: he will reward all, from the greateſt to the leaſt; ſo he will deale with the wicked, there ſhall no ſin paſſe unpuniſhed.</p>

                  </gap>here is a proportion in the <hi>Quality</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If <hi>Adam</hi> ſin in eating, he ſhall be puniſhed in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; If the women of <hi>Judah</hi> ſin in apparel, they ſhall be puniſhed in apparel, <hi>Iſay</hi> 3.24. In <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 11.16. <hi>a man ſhall be puniſhed in that that he ſinnes in</hi>; if <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſin in his haire, he ſhall be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

in it; <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> might finde his ſin in his brutiſh condition, and the Prodigall might find his ſin in the Hog-trough: So if thou finde thy ſelfe in want, conſider if thou haſt not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted thy meanes, if thou haſt not beene vaine in building, and prodigall in ſpending, or gaming, or unneceſſary bounty, and immoderate libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, beyond thy means: Art thou puniſhed in thy Trade, or Children, &amp;c. ſee if thou haſt not ſinned in them: for where there is ſin, God will proportion the puniſhment to the ſin.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God proportions the puniſhment to the ſin in regard of the time. The ſame houre that <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was drinking and quaffing in the Temple, the ſame houre the hand of God was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; if it be not upon thee the ſame houre, it may be to morrow at the ſame houre. It may be thou haſt ſinned this day at ſuch an houre, it may be God may ſtrike thee to morrow at the ſame time, or this day ſeven-night, it may be the next year. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was warned of his pride this yeare, and the ſame time twelve month the Lord <hi>drove him from among men.</hi> So in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.42. one Sabbath day the Iewes heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach and went out before the Sermon was quite done they were not able to ſtand to the bleſſing; the ſame day ſeven-night the Lord made the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſhake off the duſt of their feet againſt them, and leave them to a reprobate ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the Lord proportions his puniſhments to the place. It is ſtrange many times, that the drunkard ſhould get his death in the ſame Ale-houſe
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61460:158"/>
where he got his liquor. In <hi>Judg</hi> 7. in that ſtory of <hi>Oreb</hi> and <hi>Zeeb, Oreb</hi> at the rock <hi>Oreb,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed againſt the children of Iſrael, and upon the ſame rock he was killed, And <hi>Zeeb</hi> another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter of the children of God; ſo the Pſalmiſt calls them, he at the Wine-preſſe of <hi>Zeeb,</hi> took victuals from the children of Iſrael, and in the ſame place his own life was taken away.</p>
               <p>Juſt as Judges and Magiſtrates at this day, they hang up men where they have done the villany. As they doe with Dogs and Cats, they carry them to the place, to the Cellar or the Buttery where they do the miſcheif. But the beaſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though they have no reaſon, are able to pick out the meaning of it. The Lord puniſheth ſinners in the ſame place. Here where thou haſt been deaf to hear the word of God, when thy heart riſeth againſt the Preacher, in the ſame place (it may be) the Lord will deliver thee up to a reprobate ſenſe. In the ſame place, at the Lords Table, where thou comeſt unworthily, thou ſhalt eate and drink thine own damnation.</p>
