            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Briſtols ſecond Addreſs,
As it was preſented to their late Members in Parliament, at
their return from Oxford.</head>
            <head type="sub">To THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL
Sir RICHARD HART, Knight, Mayor of the City
of Briſtol, and THOMAS EARL, Eſquire, our late
Repreſentatives in Parliament for the ſaid City and
County of Briſtol.</head>
            <p>I. THAT you may ſee the ſhort life of the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath not influenced <hi>us to Change</hi> by altering
our Duty to <hi>our Sovereign</hi> or our reſpects to You;
We now receive You into this City with the ſame Loyal affections
that we conducted You out on Your journey to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. We are neither <hi>Presbyterians</hi> nor any of thoſe Sects, who
preſuming to pry into Gods ſecret Counſels, are the leſs to be
wondred at, that they ſaucily canvaſs and diſpute all the Actions
of his Vicegerent. And therefore we enter not into the Reaſons
moving His Majeſty unto this ſudden Diſſolution, but humbly
acquieſce therein with Duty and Loyalty becoming honeſt and
peaceably minded Subjects.</p>
            <p>III. Whatever the Author of <hi>Vox Populi</hi> or other factious and
ſeditious Scriblers have with very ill purpoſes and deſigns of
late falſely inſinuated into the People: We are ſenſible that the
Power of <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Diſſolving Parliaments</hi> at pleaſure, is one of
thoſe inſeparable <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> which (no leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the Subjects Safety than the Prince's Grandeur) We in
the third Article of our former Addreſs aſſert and defend againſt
all Oppoſers.</p>
            <p>IV. We are abundantly ſatisfied that our <hi>gracious King,</hi> who
hath hitherto made the <hi>Laws</hi> the meaſure of his <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,</hi>
will ſtill continue to us the ſame juſt practice; And being
aſſured by our former experience and His Royal promiſe in His
moſt Excellent Speech at the Opening of the late Seſſion, <hi>That he
himſelf would neither uſe Arbitrary Power, nor ſuffer it in others;</hi> We
therefore take it for granted, That he ſaw no leſs juſt cauſe for the
Diſſolving this than the preceding Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60983:2"/>
V. Had this Parliament continued a week longer, We had not
(as now) wanted an opportunity of vindicating our Election of
You our true Repreſentatives to the great Diſhonour of Your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors,
in the Refutation of the many ſcandalous and notorious
falſhoods contained in the Petition preſented (as is ſaid) by Sir
<hi>Robert Atkins,</hi> Sir <hi>John Knight,</hi> and others, to the late Houſe of
Commons.</p>
            <p>VI. And (here) We cannot but return you our hearty thanks
and acknowledgments for Your Courage and Reſolution ſhewn on
this Occaſion, and doubt not but You will ſtill retain the ſame
conſtancy and ſteadineſs.</p>
            <p>VII. We deſire, That You will be ready and prepared with Us
with lives and fortunes to ſtand by His Majeſty and the eſtabliſhed
Government both in Church and State, doing in Your reſpective
Stations what in You lies. And wherein Your Power ſhall fall
ſhort, praying from His Majeſty aſſiſtance and encouragement,
countenance and protection for the due Execution of the Statutes
in being, particularly that of the 35<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Eliz.</hi> made upon moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
Counſels (as the Hiſtory of thoſe times atteſts) againſt
all Recuſants and Diſſenters whatever, their Proſecution being in
our Opinion the only means (under God) to preſerve the Kings
Perſon, our Religion, Liberty and Property from the ſecret machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and helliſh conſpiracies of the wicked and ambitious, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Papiſts or Fanaticks.</p>
            <p>VIII. And in this bleſſed Union, let us all with heart and hand
join as one man, and let all honeſt people heartily ſay (as we do)
<hi>God ſave our good King Charles the Second;</hi> let His and our Enemies
be confounded: but upon <hi>Himſelf</hi> and His lawful <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> let the
<hi>Crown</hi> be <hi>for ever</hi> eſtabliſhed and flouriſh, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
