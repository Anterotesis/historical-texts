            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

adioyning to the foote of a very high and ſtéep hil, there was a certaine carrying way for Carte and Waine, to the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunts vſe, and beneath that, towarde the middeſt of it, a foote path did croſſe to the cloſe: Betwéene the ſayd carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way, and the ſayd foote path, were two ſtanding pittes, the one being about ſixe foote déepe of water and more, the other twelue foote at the leaſt, and about foure perches ouer in bredth, hauing ſundry tuffes of Alders and ſome Aſſhes growing in the bottomes of them: the ground on the ſouth ſide of the ſayd pittes, laye mounted higher then the vpper face of the water, about tenne foote.</p>
            <p>Againe, from the great high hill lying at the vpper part of the grounde whereof wee ſpake before, two very little gozels paſſed downe along Southward through the cloſe, theyr water Courſes being diuided aſunder at the vpper end, about the carrying way, twelue perches, and about the middeſt twentie eight perches: All which earth of the ſaid cloſes within the ſayd gozelles, and about an Acre more in bredth one way, and eighty perches in length another way, beganne the ſayd eightéene day of December to alter and chaunge forme and faſhion, and that very diuerſly from day to day, for the ſpace of eleuen dayes togither, after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

ſome place twentie eight and where it was narroweſt xii. pearches, began with the hedges and trées thereon to looſe it ſelf wholy from the reſt of the ground lying round about it, and withal to moue, ſlide, and ſhoote ſouthward, not with any ſuddaine ſhot, but créeping by little, and little, ſo as the motion and ſtirring thereof was not diſcerned nor percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were preſently ſtanding vpon it and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king about it, but only by the ſundrie effects that followed, as the cracking of the rootes of trées, the bruſhing of boughes, the noiſe of the hedge-wood breaking, the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the ground, and the riuing of the earth aſunder, the falling of the torne furrowes and huge trenches after it, ſome foure foote déepe, ſome ſixe and ſome ſeauen and more, whereby there were made in it at the leaſt not ſo fewe as eleuen thouſand furrows, riffes, cracks, and clefts in diuerſe places héere and there. This mouing and cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ground ſouthward continewing ſtil both by day and night for the ſpace of eleuen dayes togither, ſliding a ſlant, ſometimes as it was noted, fouretéene handfulls by meaſure, in one houre and a halfe did wonderfully alter and chaunge the whole face of that land: for in ſome places thereof, the hinder ground comming faſter forwarde (as it ſhoulde appeare) then the former grounde did giue waye vnto it, cauſed it to ſwell vppe in rounde hillocks like vnto graues, the gréene turfe remayning ſtill whole and vnbroken aboue: In other places the hinder grounde came ſo violently, as that it did not only teare the greene turfe aboue, but alſo did riſe and lift vp it ſelfe, and did rolle and tumble euer the other as it were waues or ſurges and ſo ſtayed as ſtanding buts, and at the laſt the whole plotte was ſo touſed, torne and rent, and withall the gréene turfe ſo tattered and turned vp ſide downe, as that there is ſcant ſo much as one pearch togither of al this ground left whole with the graſſe vpon it vncrackt.</p>
            <p>The ground of the two water pits euen from the very muddy bottoms whole, with a great rocke of ſtone vnder the ſame are not onlye remoued out of theyr places
<pb facs="tcp:5211:7"/>
and carried forward toward the South, at the leaſt foure perches a péece, with their tuffes of Alders ſtill ſtanding vpon them, but withall, they are mounted vp aloft, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hilles, ſtanding yet to be ſéene with their ſedge, flags, and blacke mudde vpon the toppe of them ſtill, higher then the vpper face of the water is now (which they haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) by at the leaſt nine foote: and into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place from which they are remoued and ryſen, other ground which lay high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before, is deſcended and come downe, receiuing the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lying now vpon it, as it did before vpon the other.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, in one place of the plaine fielde, there is a great Hole made by ſinking of the earth, to the depthe of thirtie foote at the leaſt, being in breadth in ſome place, two perches ouer, and in length, fiue or ſixe perches.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe there is a hedge of <hi>30.</hi> perches long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and carryed Southward, with his trées and all, ſeuen perches at the leaſt: And of theſe trées ſome do ſtill ſtand, and grow vpright, and ſome are quite ouerthrowne, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and buried, with the folding of the earth running vpon them, and almoſt both the endes of the ſayd hedge are ſunke and couered wholy with the earth: the Eaſt end of it foure perches long, the Weſt end fiue perches long.</p>
            <p>Many other alterations there be of trées that be ſunke and remoued out of their places, ſome fiue perches, ſome ſixe: as namely, one Holly trée is driuen ſeuen perches out of his place, and yet it ſtandeth vpright ſtill, and a great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is torne roote and all cut of the grounde, and carryed from his place foure perches, and there it lyeth, the top tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned downe to the ground.</p>
            <p>Beſide this, there was one péece of ground of halfe an Acre, which in times paſt did lye vp ſhooting in betwéene the two fieldes: this peece now, with an hedge row of trées ſtanding vppon it, is ſlipped quite away Southward, from betwéene thoſe two cloſes: and they two before ſeuered, are now come togither &amp; ioyned as one, and in their comming, are tumbled ouer a ſommer hedge, &amp; withall two other hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and a ſhawe of hazell trées, and buſhes, which did ſeuer them, are now driuen togither on heapes at the Southend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5211:7"/>Sundry other ſinkings there be in diuers places, one of ſixtie fiue foote, an other of forty ſeuen foote, an other of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie foure foote.</p>
            <p>By meanes of all which cofuſion, it is come to paſſe, that where the higheſt hilles were héeretofore, there the deepeſt Dales <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ée now. And where the loweſt Dales were then, now the ground lyeth mounted hieſt.</p>
            <p>The footepath ſpoken of before, is now caryed out of ſquare eight pearches at the leaſt, the lower end of this ground is caryed ſouthward in bredth thrée pearches ouer into two medowes, whereof one is in the poſſeſſion of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man called <hi>Thomas Toller.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally the whole meaſure and content of this breaking grounde, was at leaſt nine acres ſeauen day workes and foure perches, on the twentie ninth day of December whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this figure and meaſure of it was taken, as here ye ſée it ſet downe: And ſince that time it cracketh and cleaueth daily more and more on all ſides round about it.</p>
            <p>Among other things touching this matter, this alſo is eſpecially to bee conſidered, that whereas by the great aboundaunce of water, and continuall rayne which haue fallen ſo many monethes togither of late, ſundrye great bowrnes, and violent ſtreames haue broken out in many places of this land, and at the leaſt ſeauen ſuch within xii. miles of this place euery way, the leaſt whereof is able to driue a corne Mill, where ſeldome or neuer any ſuch haue bin before, and that this ground lyeth (as we haue ſaide) vnder a high hill that might occaſion ſome ſuch iſſue, yet there hath no extraordinary courſe of water broken out vppon it, nor neere vnto it by a mile any way, neither haue the ſmall ſprings thereof, during all this wet wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bin any thing increaſed to ſpeake of. In ſo much as the two little gozelles mentioned before, being they that doo cary moſt water ouer this rouing ground, are neither of them ſo great, but that their ſtreames might at any time all this yeare (and ſo many ſtill) eaſily paſſe through an auger hole of an Inch and halfe broade. Which I ſpeake to this end, that the ſtrange cariage, moouing, dryuing, and
<pb facs="tcp:5211:8"/>
diſplacing of huge maſſe of earth, and the heauing vp of the vallyes and lowe pits, with the great rootes thereof rayſed and mounted vnto hilles, with the trées therevpon, cannot be imputed to the aboundance of water enforcing it as the cauſe therof, as ſome perhaps otherwiſe would imagin and ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p>The whole maner of the ſtraunge confuſion of this plat cannot be diſcribed according as it is but there hath (by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Farmers and others) come to ſee it at ſundry times, from <hi>London</hi> and other partes of the country foure thouſand people ſince it firſt began: to whom it hath ſéemed to be a very ſtraunge and fearefull ſight, giuing occaſion vnto ſome of them, to thinke vpon that great opening of the earth that ſhalbe in the latter day when ſhe ſhall yeelde vp her dead, that be in her to come to the reſurrection, to other to thinke vpon that fearefull gaping of the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Corah</hi> and his company were deuoured.</p>
            <p>And to the intent the reader may not thinke himſelfe to be abuſed in this report by ſome vaine deuiſed fable, ſundry of the neighbors and inhabitants, and they of the beſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit dwelling thereabout, who haue bin at it, and are eye witneſſes thereof, haue bin content here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to giue their teſtimony, by ſubſcribing their names at the beginning of this booke.</p>
