            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He gave his minde to writing, and composed three Books <hi>Of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Philosophy;</hi> afterward an Invective or Cynicall decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the uncertainty and vanity of all things, in which he teacheth that there is no certainty in any thing, but in the solid words of God, and that, to lie hid in the eminency of Gods word; he also wrote an History of the double Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Emperor <hi>Charls,</hi> and also of the excellency of the feminine sexe, and of the apparitions of spirits; but seeing that he published commentaries on the <hi>Ars Brevis</hi> of <hi>Raymun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Lully,</hi> and was very much addicted to Occult Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy and Astrology, there were those who thought that he enjoyed commerce with devils, whom notwithstanding he confuted in his published Apology, and shewed, that he kept himself within the bounds of Art, 1538, He wrote many

I believe that the supercilious censors will object against the Sybils; holy Magicians, and the
<pb facs="tcp:52070:6"/>
Gospel it self sooner then receive the name of Magick into favor; so consciencious are they, that neither <hi>Apollo,</hi> nor all the Muses, nor an Angel from Heaven can redeem me from their curse. Whom therefore I advise, that they read not our writings, nor understand them, nor remember them. For they are pernicious, and full of poyson; the gate of <hi>Acheron</hi> is in this book; it speaks stones, let them take heed that it beat not out their brains. But you that come without prejudice to read it, if you have so much discretion of prudence, as Bees have in gathering hony, read se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, and believe that you shall receive no little profit, and much pleasure; but if you shall find any things that may not please you, let them alone, and make no use of them; for I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of them, but declare them to you; but do not refuse other things, for they that look into the books of Physitians, do together with antidotes and medicines, read also poysons. I confess that Magick it self teacheth many superfluous things, and curious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies for ostentation; leave them as empty things, yet be not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of their causes. But those things which are for the profit of men, for the turning away of evil events, for the destroying of sorceries, for the curing of diseases, for the exterminating of phantasmes, for the preserving of life, honor, fortune, may be done without offence to God, or injury to Religion, because they are, as profitable, so necessary. But I have admonished you, that I have writ many things, rather narratively then affirmatively; for so it seemed needful that we should pass over fewer things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the judgements of <hi>Platonists,</hi> and other Gentile Philosophers when they did suggest an argument of writing to our purpose; therefore if any error have been committed, or any thing hath been spoken more freely, pardon my youth; for I wrote this being scarce a yong man, that I may excuse my self, and say, whilest I was a child, I spake as a childe, I understood as a child, but being become a man, I retracted those things which I did being a boy, and in my book of the vanity and uncertainty of Sciences I did for the most part retract this book. But here haply you may blame me again, saying, Behold thou being a youth didst write, and now being old hast retracted it; what therefore hast thou set forth? I confess whilst I was very yong, I set upon the writing
<pb facs="tcp:52070:6"/>
of these books, but hoping that I should set them forth with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and enlargements, and for that cause I gave them to <hi>Tritemius</hi> a <hi>Neapolitanian</hi> Abbot, formerly a <hi>Spanhemensian,</hi> a man very industrious after secret things. But it happened af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that the work being intercepted, before I finished it, was carryed about imperfect, and impolished, and did fly abroad in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> through many mens hands, and some men, whether more impatiently, or impudently, I know not, would have put it thus imperfect to the press, with which mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif I being affected, determined to set it forth my self, thinking that there might be less danger if these books came out of my hands with some amendments, then to come forth torn, and in fragments out of other mens hands. Moreover I thought it no crime if I should not suffer the testimony of my youth to perish. Also we added some Chapters, and we inserted many things, which did seem unfit to pass by, which the curious Reader shall be able to understand by the inequality of the very phrase; for we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to begin the work anew, and to unravell all that we had done, but to correct it, and put some flourish upon it. Wherefore now I pray thee, Curteous Reader, again, weigh not these things according to the present time of setting them forth, but pardon my curious youth, if thou shalt finde any thing in them that may displease thee.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I was of late (most reverend Father) for a while conversant with you in your Monastery of <hi>Herbipolis,</hi> we conferred together of divers things concerning Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry, Magick, and Cabalie, and of other things, which as yet lye hid in secret Sciences, and Arts; and then there was one great question amongst the rest, why Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, whereas it was accounted by all ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers the chiefest Science, &amp; by the ancient wise men, &amp; Priests was always had in great veneration, came at last after the beginning of the Catholike Church to be alwaies odious to, and suspected by the holy Fathers, and then exploded by Divines, and condemned by sacred Canons, and moreover by all laws, and ordinances forbidden. Now the cause, as I conceive is no other then this, <hi>viz.</hi> because by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fatall depravation of times, and men, many false
<pb facs="tcp:52070:7"/>
Philosophers crep in, and these under the name of Magicians, heaping together through various sorts of errors and factions of false Religions, many curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed superstitions and dangerous Rites, and many wicked Sacriledges, out of Orthodox Religion, even to the perfection of nature, and destruction of men, and injury of God, set forth very many wicked, and unlawfull books, such as we see carryed about in these dayes, to which they have by stealth prefixed the most honest name, and title of Magick. They therefore by this sacred title of Magick, hoped to gain credit to their cursed and detestable fooleries. Hence it is that this name of Magick, formerly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, is now in these dayes become most odious to good and honest men, and accounted a Capital crime, if any one dare profess himself to be a Magician, either in Doctrine or works, unless haply some certain old doting woman, dwelling in the Country, would be believed to be skilful, and have a Divine power, that (as saith <hi>Apuleius</hi> she can throw down the Heaven, lift up the earth, harden foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, wash away mountains, raise up Ghosts, cast down the Gods, extinguish the Stars, illumnate hel, or as <hi>Virgil</hi> sings,
<q>
                  <l>She'l promise by her charms to cast great cares,</l>
                  <l>Or ease the minds of men, and make the Stars</l>
                  <l>For to go back, and rivers to stand still,</l>
                  <l>And raise the nightly ghosts even at her will,</l>
                  <l>To make the earth to groan, and trees to fall</l>
                  <l>From the mountains—</l>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52070:8"/>
Hence those things, which <hi>Lucan</hi> relates of <hi>Thessala</hi> that Magicianess, and <hi>Homer</hi> of the omnipotency of <hi>Circe,</hi> whereof many Iconfess are as well of a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious opinion, as superstitious diligence, &amp; pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labor, as when they cannot come under a wicked Art, yet they presume they may be able to cloak themselves under that venerable title of Magick. Since then these things are so, I wondered much, and was not less angry, that as yet there hath been no man, who did challenge this sublime and sacred discipline with the crime of impiety, or had deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it purely, and sincerely to us, since I have seen of our modern writers <hi>Roger Bacon, Robert</hi> an English man, <hi>Peter Apponus, Albertus</hi> the <hi>Teutonich, Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das de villa Nova, Anselme</hi> the <hi>Parmensian, Picatrix</hi> the <hi>Spaniard, Cicclus Asculus</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and many others, but writers of an obscure name, when they promised to treat of Magick, to do nothing but irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall toies, and superstitions unworthy of honest men. Hence my spirit was moved, and by reason partly of admiration, and partly of indignation, I was willing to play the Philosopher, supposing that I should do no discommendable work, who have been always from my youth a curious, and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed searcher of wonderfull effects, and operations full of mysteries; if I should recover that ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick the discipline of all wise men from the errors of impiety, purifie and adorn it with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per lustre, and vindicate it from the injuries of calumniators; which thing though I long delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of it in my mind, yet never durst as yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, but after some conference betwixt us of
<pb facs="tcp:52070:8"/>
these things at <hi>Herbipolis,</hi> your transcending know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and learning, and your ardent adhortation put courage, and boldness into me. There selecting the opinions of Philosophers of known credit, and purging the introduction of the wicked (who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblingly, with a counterfeited knowledge did teach, that traditions of Magicians must be learned from very reprobate books of darkness, as from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of wonderfull operations) and removing all darkness, have at last composed three compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious books of Magick, and titled them <hi>Of Occult Philosophy,</hi> being a title less offensive, which books I submit (you excelling in the knowledge of these things) to your correction and censure, that if I have wrote any thing which may tend either to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely of nature, offending God, or injury of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you may condemn the error; but if the scandal of impiety be dissolved and purged, you may defend the tradition of truth; and that you would do so with these books, and Magick it self, that nothing may be concealed which may be profitable, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing approved of which cannot but do hurt, by which means these three books having passed your examination with approbation, may at length be thought worthy to come forth with good success in publike, and may not be afraid to come under the censure of posterity.</p>

Now that you may proceed toward higher things, as you have begun, and not suffer such excellent parts of wit to be idle, I do with as much earnestness as I can advise, intreat, and beseech you, that you would exercise your self in laboring after better things, and demonstrate the light of true wisdom to the ignorant, according as you your self are divinely enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; neither let the consideration of idle vain fellows withdraw you from your purpose; I say of them, of whom

conditions, with which you are endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond the common custom of others; I say nothing of those ancient monuments of your eminent nobility, the treasures of your riches, both old, and new, the largness of your dominion, the ornaments of the sacred dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, with the excellency whereof you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, together with the comely form, and strength of the body. Though all these things be very great, yet I esteem you far greater then all these, for those your Heroick, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illustrious vertues, by which you truly have caused, that byhow much the more any one is learned, &amp; loves vertue, so much the more he may desire to insinuate himself into your favor, whence I also am resolved that your favor shall be obtained by me, but after the manner of the people of <hi>Parthia, i. e.</hi> not without a present, which custom of saluting Princes, is indeed derived from the Ages of the Ancients, unto these very times, and still we see it observed.

Truly I was perswaded that I could give nothing more acceptable to you, then a new work of most ancient and abstruse learning; I say a work of my curious youth, but a doctrine of antiquity, by none I dare say hitherto attempted to be restored. Yet my works are not wrote to you, because they are worthy of you, but that they might make a way open for me to gain your favor. I beseech you, if it may be, let them be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by you. I shall be devotedly yours, if these studies of my youth shall by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

You have therefore the work, not only of my youth, but of my present Age, for I have corrected many Errataes of the work of my youth, I have inserted many things in many places, and have added many things to many Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which may easily be perceived by the inequality of the stile; and so shall you know that I shall all my life be devoted to your pleasure.

To have a bare notion of a Diety, to apprehend some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Celestials, together with the common operations thereof, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of some Terrestial productions, is but what is superficiall, and vulgar; But this is true, this is sublime, but <hi>Occult Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;</hi> to understand the mysterious influences of the intellectuall world upon the Celestial, and of both upon the Terrestiall; and to know how to dispose, and fit our selves so, as to be capable of receiving those superiour operations, whereby we may be enabled to operate wonderfull things, which indeed seem impossible, or at least unlawfull, when as indeed they may be effected by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall power, and without either offence to God, or violation of Religion. To defend Kingdoms, to discover the secret counsels of men, to overcome enemies, to redeem captives, to increase riches, to procure the favor of men, to expell diseases, to preserve health, to prolong life, to renew youth, to foretell future events, to see and know things done many miles off, and such like as these, by vertue of superior influences, may seem things incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Yet read but the ensuing Treatise, and thou shalt see the possibility thereof confirmed both by reason, and example. I speak now to the judicious, for as for others, they neither know, nor believe, nor will know any thing, but what is vulgar, nay they think, that beyond this there is scarce any thing knowable; when as indeed there are profound mysteries in all beings, even from God in the highest heavens, to the divels in the lowest hell; Yea in very numbers, names, letters, characters, gestures, time, place, and such like, all which are by this learned Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly

But remember that the best Gold must have the greatest allowance; consider the time of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and of his youth, when, the place where, and the things which he hath discovered and wrote, and thou wilt rather admire his solidity, then condemn his vanity.

            <p>From saying much as touching the excusing, or commending this Author, I am already prevented; For at the beginning and ending of this book there are several Epistles of his own to others, wherein he excuseth what may be excepted against him; and of others to him sufficiently commending what is praise worthy in him; to which may be added that honorable testimony given to him by the author of that most witty, &amp; sublime <hi>The-anthroposophia theo magica,</hi> lately set forth. All that I shall say to perswade thee to read this book, is but to desire thee to cast thine eye upon the Index of the Chapters contained therein, which is at the end thereof: and thou shalt therein see such variety of wonderful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that at the sight thereof thou wilt be impatient till thou hast read them. I shall crave leave now to speak one word for my self. If this my translation shall neither answer the worth of the Author, or expectation of the reader; consider that the unquothness of the Authors stile in many places, the manifold Errata's, as well literall, as those in respect of Grammatical construction, may happily occasion some mistakes in this my translation. Yet nowitht<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, I hope I have, though without much elegancy (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the matter would not bear) put it into as intelligible an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish phrase as the orginal would afford.

<pb facs="tcp:52070:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
according as I have found them. I hope an Artist will be able to understand them; as for Errata's, as I cursorily read over the book, I observed these as you see mentioned.

In this there is no small vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and your observation not little. In your passage thither by Sea, you have seen the wonders of God in the Deep; and by Land, you have seen the astonishing works of God in the unaccessible Mountains. You have left no stone unturned, that the turning thereof might conduce to the discovery of what was Occult, and worthy to be known.

This is the most perfect, and chief Science, that sacred, and sublimer kind of Phylosophy, and lastly the most absolute perfection of all most excellent Philosophy. For seeing that all regulative Philosophy is divided into Naturall, Mathematicall, and Theologicall: (Naturall Philosophy teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the nature of those things which are in the world, searching and enquiring into their Causes, Effects, Times, Places, Fashions, Events, their Whole, and Parts, also

these three principall faculties <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Magick comprehends, unites, and actuates; deservedly therefore was it by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents esteemed as the highest, and most sacred Philosophy. It was, as we find, brought to light by most sage Authours, and most famous Writers; amongst which principally <hi>Zamolxis</hi> and <hi>Zoroaster</hi> were so famous, that many believed they were the inventers of this Science. Their track <hi>Abbaris</hi> the <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borean, Charmondas, Damigeron, Eudoxus, Hermippus</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: there were also other eminent, choice men, as <hi>Mercurius Tresmegistus, Porphyrius, Iamblicus, Plotinus, Proclus, Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus, Orpheus</hi> the Thracian, <hi>Gog</hi> the Grecian, <hi>Germa</hi> the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilonian, <hi>Apollonius</hi> of Tyana, <hi>Osthanes</hi> also wrote excellently in this Art; whose Books being as it were lost, <hi>Democritus</hi> of Abdera recovered, and set forth with his own Commentaries. Besides <hi>Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, Plato,</hi> and many other renowned Philosophers travelled far by Sea to learn this Art: and being returned, published it with wonderfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutness, esteeming of it as a great secret. Also it is well known that <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> went to the Prophets of Memphis to learn it, and travelled through almost all Syria, Egypt, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, and the Schools of the Caldeans, that they might not be ignorant of the most sacred Memorials, and Records of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, as also that they might be furnished with Divine things. Whosoever therefore is desirous to study in this Faculty, if he be not skilled in naturall Philosophy, wherein are discovered the qualities of things, and in which are found the occult pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of every Being, and if he be not skilfull in the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and in the Aspects, and Figures of the Stars, upon which depends the sublime vertue, and property of every thing; and if he be not learned in Theologie, wherein are manifested those immateriall substances, which dispence, and minister all things, he cannot be possibly able to understand the rationality of Magick. For there is no work that is done by meer Magick, nor any work that is meerly Magicall, that doth not comprehend these three Faculties.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the four Elements, their qualities, and mutuall mixtions.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are four Elements, and originall grounds of all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall things, Fire, Earth, VVater, Aire, of which all elementated inseriour bodies are compounded; not by way of heaping them up together, but by transmutation, and union; and when they are destroyed, they are resolved into Elements. For there is none of the sensible Elements that is pure, but they are more or less mixed, and apt to be changed one into the other: Even as Earth becoming dirty, and being dissolved, becomes Water, and the same being made thick and hard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Earth again; but being evaporated through heat, passeth into Aire, and that being kindled, passeth into Fire, and this being extinguished, returns back again into Aire, but being cooled again after its burning, becomes Earth, or Stone, or Sulphur, and this is manifested by Lightening: <hi>Plato</hi> also was of that opinion, that Earth was wholly changeable, and that the rest of the Elements are changed, as into this, so into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther successively. But it is the opinion of the subtiller sort of Philosophers, that Earth is not changed, but relented and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with other Elements, which do dissolve it, and that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns back into it self again. Now every one of the Elements hath two specificall qualities, the former whereof it retains as proper to it self, in the other, as a mean, it agrees with that which comes next after it. For Fire is hot and dry, the Earth dry and cold, the VVater cold and moist, the Aire moist and hot. And so after this manner the Elements, according to two contrary qualities, are contrary one to the other, as Fire to VVater, and Earth to Aire. Moreover, the Elements are upon another account opposite one to the other: For some are heavy, as Earth and VVater, and others are light, as Aire and Fire. VVherefore the Stoicks called the former passives, but the latter actives. And yet once again <hi>Plato</hi> distinguisheth them after another manner, and assigns to every one of them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52070:18"/>
three qualities, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Fire brightness, thinness, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to the Earth darkness, thickness and quietness. And according to these qualities the Elements of Fire and Earth are contrary. But the other Elements borrow their qualities from these, so that the Aire receives two qualities of the Fire, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and motion; and one of the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> darkness. In like manner Water receives two qualities of the Earth, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and thickness, and one of Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> motion. But Fire is twice more thin then Aire, thrice more moveable, and four times more bright: and the Aire is twice more bright, thrice more thin, and four times more moveable then Water. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Water is twice more bright then Earth, thrice more thin, and four times more moveable. As therefore the Fire is to the Aire, so Aire to the Water, and Water to the Earth; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as the Earth is to the VVater, so the VVater to the Aire, and the Aire to the Fire. And this is the root and foundation of all bodies, natures, vertues, and wonderfull works; and he which shall know these qualities of the Elements, and their mixtions, shall easily bring to pass such things that are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, and astonishing, and shall be perfect in Magick.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of a three-fold consideration of the Elements.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are then, as we have said, four Elements, without the perfect knowledge whereof we can effect nothing in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick. Now each of them is three-fold, that so the number of four may make up the number of twelve; and by passing by the number of seven into the number of ten, there may be a progress to the supream Unity, upon which all vertue and wonderfull operation depends. Of the first Order are the pure Elements, which are neither compounded nor changed, nor admit of mixtion, but are incorruptible, and not of which, but through which the vertues of all naturall things are brought forth into act. No man is able to declare their vertues,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52070:19"/>
because they can do all things upon all things. He which is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of these, shall never be able to bring to pass any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull matter. Of the second Order are Elements that are compounded, changeable, and impure, yet such as may by art be reduced to their pure simplicity, whose vertue, when they are thus reduced to their simplicity, doth above all things perfect all occult, and common operations of nature: and these are the foundation of the whole naturall Magick. Of the third Order are those Elements, which originally and of themselves are not Elements, but are twice compounded, various, and changeable one into the other. They are the infallible <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and therefore are called the middle nature, or Soul of the middle nature: Very few there are that understand the deep mysteries thereof. In them is, by means of certain numbers, degrees, and orders, the perfection of every effect in what thing soever, whether Naturall, Celestiall, or Supercelestiall; they are full of wonders, and mysteries, and are operative, as in Magick Naturall, so Divine: For from these, through them, proceed the bindings, loosings, and transmutations of all things, the knowing and foretelling of things to come, also the driving forth of evill, and the gaining of good spirits. Let no man therefore, without these three sorts of Elements, and the knowledge thereof, be confident that he is able to work any thing in the occult Sciences of Magick, and Nature. But whosoever shall know how to reduce those of one Order, into those of another, impure into pure, compounded into simple, and shall know how to understand distinctly the nature, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and power of them in number, degrees, and order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dividing the substance, he shall easily attain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and perfect operation of all Naturall things, and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall secrets.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the wonderfull Natures of Fire, and Earth.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are two things (saith <hi>Hermes) viz.</hi> Fire and Earth, which are sufficient for the operation of all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull things: the former is active, the latter passive. Fire (as saith <hi>Dionysius)</hi> in all things, and through all things, comes and goes away bright, it is in all things bright, and at the same time occult, and unknown; When it is by it self (no other matter coming to it, in which it should manifest its proper action) it is boundless, and invisible, of it self sufficient for every action that is proper to it, moveable, yielding it self after a maner to all things that come next to it, renewing guarding nature, enlightening, not comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by lights that are vailed over, clear, parted, leaping back, bending upwards, quick in motion, high, alwayes raising mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, comprehending another, not Comprehended it self, not standing in need of another, secretly increasing of it self, and manifesting its greatness to things that receive it. Active, Powerfull, Invisibly present in all things at once; it will not be affronted or opposed, but as it were in a way of revenge, it will reduce on a sudden things into obedience to it self, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, impalpable, not lessened, most rich in all dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it self. Fire (as saith <hi>Pliny)</hi> is the boundless, and mischievous part of the nature of things, it being a question whether it destroys, or produceth most things. Fire it self is one, and penetrates through all things (as say the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians)</hi> also spread abroad in the Heavens, and shining: but in the infernall place streightened, dark, and tormenting, in the mid way it partakes of both. Fire therefore in it self is one, but in that which receives it, manifold, and in differing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it is distributed in a different manner, as <hi>Cleanthes</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth in <hi>Cicero.</hi> That fire then which we use is fetched out of other things. It is in stones, and is fetched out by the stroke of the steele: it is in Earth, and makes that, after digging up, to smoake: it is in Water, and heats springs, and wells: it is in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52070:20"/>
depth of the Sea, and makes that, being tossed with winds, warm: it is in the Aire, and makes it (as we oftentimes see) to burn. And all Animals, and living things whatsoever, as also all Vegetables are preserved by heat: and every thing that lives, lives by reason of the inclosed heat. The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Fire that is above, are heat, making all things Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and light, giving life to all things. The properties of the infernall Fire are a parching heat, consuming all things, and darkness, making all things barren. The Celestiall, and bright Fire drives away spirits of darkness; also this our Fire made with VVood drives away the same, in as much as it hath an Analogy with, and is the <hi>vehiculum</hi> of that Superior light; as also of him, who saith, <hi>I am the Light of the World,</hi> which is true Fire, the Father of lights, from whom every good thing that is given, Comes; sending forth the light of his Fire, and communicating it first to the Sun, and the rest of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall bodies, and by these, as by mediating instruments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying that light into our Fire. As therefore the spirits of darkness are stronger in the dark: so good spirits, which are Angels of Light, are augmented, not only by that light, which is Divine, of the Sun, and Celestiall, but also by the light of our common Fire. Hence it was that the first, and most wise insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutors of Religions, and Ceremonies ordained, that Prayers, Singings, and all manner of Divine Worships whatsoever should not be performed without lighted Candles, or Torches. (Hence also was that significant saying of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> Do not speak of God without a Light) and they commanded that for the driving away of wicked spirits, Lights and Fires should be kindled by the Corpses of the dead, and that they should not be removed, untill the expiations were after a Holy manner performed, and they buried. And the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> himself in the old Law Commanded that all his Sacrifices should be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Fire, and that Fire should always be burning upon the Altar, which Custome the Priests of the Altar did always observe, and keep amongst the <hi>Romanes.</hi> Now the Basis, and foundation of all the Elements, is the Earth, for that is the object, subject, and receptacle of all Celestiall rayes, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52070:20"/>
influencies; in it are contained the seeds, and Seminall vertues of all things; and therefore it is said to be Animall, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and Minerall. It being made fruitfull by the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Heavens, brings forth all things of it self; It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the abundance of all things, and is, as it were the first fountain, from whence all things spring, it is the Center, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and mother of all things. Take as much of it as you please, seperated, washed, depurated, subtilized, if you let it lye in the open Aire a little while, it will, being full, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with Heavenly vertues, of it self bring forth Plants, Worms, and other living things, also Stones, and bright sparks of Metals. In it are great secrets, if at any time it shall be purified by the help of Fire, and reduced unto its simplicity by a convenient washing. It is the first matter of our Creation, and the truest Medicine that can restore, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve us.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the wonderfull Natures of Water, Aire, and Winds.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe other two Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> Water, and Aire are not less efficacious then the former; neither is nature want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to work wonderfull things in them. There is so great a necessity of Water, that without it no livin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thing can live. No Hearb, nor Plant whatsoever, without the moistening of Water can branch forth. In it is the Seminary vertue of all things, especially of Animals, whose seed is manifestly wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. The seeds also of Trees, and Plants, although they are earthy, must notwithstanding of necessity be rotted in Water, before they can be fruitfull; whether they be imbibed with the moisture of the Earth, or with Dew, or Rain, or any other Water that is on purpose put to them. For <hi>Moses</hi> writes, that only Earth, and Water bring forth a living soul. But he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes a twofold production of things to Water, <hi>viz.</hi> of things swimming in the VVaters, and of things flying in the Aire
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52070:21"/>
above the Earth. And that those productions that are made in, and upon the Earth, are partly attributed to the very Water, the same Scripture testifies, where it saith that the Plants, and the Hearbs did not grow, because God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth. Such is the efficacy of this Element of Water, that Spirituall regeneration cannot be done without it, as Christ himself testified to <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> Very great also is the vertue of it in the Religious Worship of God, in expiations, and purifications; yea, the necessity of it is no less then that of Fire. Infinite are the benefits, and divers are the uses thereof, as being that by vertue of which all things subsist, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, nourished, and increased. Thence it was that <hi>Thales</hi> of <hi>Miletus,</hi> and <hi>Hesiod</hi> concluded that Water was the beginning of all things, and said it was the first of all the Elements, and the most potent, and that because it hath the mastery over all the rest. For, as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, Waters swallow up the Earth, extinguish flames, ascend on high, and by the stretching forth of the clouds, challenge the Heaven for their own: the same falling down become the Cause of all things that grow in the Earth. Very many are the wonders that are done by Waters, according to the Writings of <hi>Pliny, Solinus,</hi> and many other Historians, of the wonderfull vertue whereof, <hi>Ovid</hi> also makes mention in these Verses.

                  <hi>Josephus</hi> also makes relation of the wonderfull nature of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain river betwixt <hi>Arcea,</hi> and <hi>Raphanea,</hi> Cities of <hi>Syria:</hi> which runs with a full Channell all the Sabboth Day, and then on a sudden ceaseth, as if the springs were stopped, and all the six dayes you may pass over it dry-shod: but again on the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day (no man knowing the reason of it) the Waters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again in abundance, as before. Wherefore the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereabout called it the Sabboth-day river, because of the Seaventh day, which was holy to the Jews. The Gospel also testifies of a sheep-poole, into which whosoever stepped first, after the Water was troubled by the Angel, was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. The same vertue, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy we read was in a spring of the <hi>Jonian Nymphs,</hi> which was in the territories belonging to the Town of <hi>Elis,</hi> at a Village called <hi>Heraclea,</hi> neer the river <hi>Citheron:</hi> which whosoever step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into, being diseased came forth whole, and cured of all his diseases. <hi>Pausanias</hi> also reports, that in <hi>Lyceus,</hi> a mountain of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> there was a spring called <hi>Agria,</hi> to which, as often as the dryness of the Region threatned the destruction of fruits <hi>Jupiters</hi> Priest of <hi>Lyceus</hi> went, and after the offering of Sacrifices, devoutly praying to the VVaters of the Spring, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bough of an Oke in his hand, put it down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the hallowed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pring; Then the waters being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, a Vapour ascending from thence into the Air was blown into Clouds, with which being joyned together, the whole Heaven was overspread: which being a litle after dissolved
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52070:22"/>
into rain, watered all the Country most wholsomly. Moreover <hi>Ruffus</hi> a Physitian of Ephesus, besides many other Authours, wrote strange things concerning the wonders of VVaters, which, for ought I know, are found in no other Authour.</p>
               <p>It remains that I speak of the Aire. This is a vitall spirit, passing through all Beings, giving life, and subsistence to all things, binding, moving, and filling all things. Hence it is that the Hebrew Doctors reckon it not amongst the Elements, but count it as a <hi>Medium</hi> or glew, joyning things together, and as the resounding spirit of the worlds instrument. It immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly receives into it self the influencies of all Celestiall bodies, and then communicates them to the other Elements, as also to all mixt bodies: Also it receives into it self, as if it were a divine Looking-glass, the species of all things, as well naturall, as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall, as also of all manner of speeches, and retains them; And carrying them with it, and entering into the bodies of Men, and other Animals, through their pores, makes an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression upon them, as well when they sleep, as when they be awake, and affords matter for divers strange Dreams and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations. Hence they say it is, that a man passing by a place where a man was slain, or the Carkase newly hid, is moved with fear and dread; because the Aire in that place being full of the dreadfull species of Man-slaughter, doth, being breathed in, move and trouble the spirit of the man with the like speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, whence it is that he comes to be afraid. For every thing that makes a sudden impression, astonisheth nature. Whence it is, that many Philosophers were of opinion that Aire is the cause of dreams, and of many other impressions of the mind, through the prolonging of Images, or similitudes, or species (which are fallen from things, and speeches, multiplyed in the very Aire) untill they come to the senses, and then to the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy, and soul of him that receives them, which being freed from cares, and no way hindred, expecting to meet such kind of species, is informed by them. For the species of things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of their own proper nature, they are carryed to the senses of men, and other animals in generall, may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing get some impression from the Heaven, whilest they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52070:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be in the Aire, by reason of which, together with the aptness and disposition of him that receives them, they may be carryed to the sence of one, rather then of another. And hence it is possible naturally, and far from all manner of superstition, no other spirit coming between, that a man should be able in a very time to signifie his mind unto another man, abiding at a very long and unknown distance from him; although he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not precisely give an estimate of the time when it is, yet of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity it must be within 24. hours; and I my self know how to do it, and have often done it. The same also in time past did the Abbot <hi>Tritenius</hi> both know and do. Also when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain appearances, not only spirituall, but also naturall do flow forth from things, that is to say, by a certain kind of flowings forth of bodies from bodies, and do gather strength in the Air, they offer, and shew themselves to us as well through light as motion, as well to the sight as to other senses, and sometimes work wonderfull things upon us, as <hi>Plotinus</hi> proves and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And we see how by the South wind the Air is condensed into thin clouds, in which, as in a Looking-glass are reflected representations at a great distance of Castles, Mountains, Horses, and Men, and other things, which when the clouds are gone, presently vanish. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Meteors shews, that a Rainbow is conceived in a cloud of the Aire, as in a Looking-glass. And <hi>Albertus</hi> saith, that the effigies of bodies may by the strength of nature, in a moist Aire be easily repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, in the same manner as the representations of things are in things. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> tels of a man, to whom it happened by reason of the weakness of his sight, that the Aire that was near to him, became as it were a Looking-glass to him, and the optick beam did reflect back upon himself, and could not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the Aire, so that whithersoever he went, he thought he saw his own image, with his face towards him, go before him. In like manner, by the artificialness of some certain Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glasses, may be produced at a distance in the Aire, beside the Looking-glasses, what images we please; which when ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant men see, they think they see the appearances of spirits, or souls; when indeed they are nothing else but semblances
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52070:23"/>
kin to themselves, and without life. And it is well known, if in a dark place where there is no light but by the coming in of a beam of the Sun somewhere through a litle hole, a white paper, or plain Looking-glass be set up against that light, that there may be seen upon them, whatsoever things are done without, being shined upon by the Sun. And there is another sleight, or trick yet more wonderfull. If any one shall take images artificially painted, or written letters, and in a clear night set them against the beams of the full Moon, whose resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances being multiplyed in the Aire, and caught upward, and reflected back together with the beams of the Moon, any other man that is privy to the thing, at a long distance sees, reads, and knows them in the very compass, and Circle of the Moon, which Art of declaring secrets is indeed very profitable for Towns, and Cities that are besieged, being a thing which <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> long since did often do, and which is not unknown to some in these dayes, I will not except my self. And all these, and many more, and greater then these are grounded in the very nature of the Aire, and have their reasons, and causes declared in Mathematicks, and Optics. And as these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances are reflected back to the sight, so also sometimes to the hearing, as is manifest in the <hi>Echo.</hi> But there are more secret arts then these, and such whereby any one may at a very remote distance hear, and understand what another speaks, or whispers softly.</p>
               <p>There are also from the airy Element VVinds. For they are nothing else, but Air moved, and stirred up. Of these there are four that are principall, blowing from the four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Heaven, <hi>viz. Notus</hi> from the South, <hi>Boreas</hi> from the North, <hi>Zephyrus</hi> from the West, <hi>Eurus</hi> from the East, which <hi>Pontanus</hi> comprehending in these verses, saith,

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the kinds of Compounds, what relation they stand in to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, and what relation there is betwixt the Elements themselves, and the soul, senses, and dispositions of men.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NExt after the four simple Elements follow the four kinds of perfect Bodies compounded of them, and they are Stones, Metals, Plants, and Animals: and although unto the generation of each of these all the Elements meet together in the composition, yet every one of them follows, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles one of the Elements, which is most predominant. For all Stones are earthy, for they are naturally heavy, and descend, and so hardened with dryness, that they cannot be melted. But Metals are waterish, and may be melted, which Naturalists confess, and Chymists finde to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of a viscous Water, or waterish argent vive. Plants have such an affinity with the Aire, that unless they be abroad in the open Aire, they do neither bud, nor increase. So also all Animals
<q>
                     <l>Have in their Natures a most fiery force,</l>
                     <l>And also spring from a Celestiall source.</l>
                  </q>
And Fire is so naturall to them, that that being extinguished they presently dye. And again every one of those kinds is distinguished within it self by reason of degrees of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For amongst the Stones they especially are called earthy that are dark, and more heavy; and those waterish, which are transparent, and are compacted of water, as Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52070:24"/>
Beryll, and Pearls in the Shels of Fishes: and they are called airy, which swim upon the Water, and are spongious, as the Stones of a Sponge, the pumish Stone, and the Stone Sophus: and they are called fiery, out of which fire is extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or which are resolved into Fire, or which are produced of Fire: as Thunderbolts, Fire-stones, and the Stone Asbestus. Also amongst Metals, Lead, and Silver are earthy; Quicksilver is waterish: Copper, and Tin are airy: and Gold, and Iron are fiery. In Plants also, the roots resemble the Earth, by reason of their thickness: and the leaves, Water, because of their juice: Flowers, the Aire, because of their subtility, and the Seeds the Fire, by reason of their multiplying spirit. Besides, they are called some hot, some cold, some moist, some dry, borrowing their names from the qualities of the Elements. Amongst Animals also, some are in comparison of others earthy, and dwell in the bowels of the Earth, as Worms and Moles, and many other small creeping Vermine: others are watery, as Fishes; others airy, which cannot live out of the Aire: others also are fiery, living in the Fire, as Salamanders, and Crickets, such as are of a fiery heat, as Pigeons, Estriches, Lions, and such as the wise man cals beasts breathing Fire. Besides, in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals the Bones resemble the Earth, Flesh the Aire, the vital spirit the Fire, and the humors the Water. And these humors also partake of the Elements, for yellow choller is instead of Fire, blood instead of Aire, Flegme instead of Water, and black choller, or melancholy instead of Earth. And lastly, in the Soul it self, according to <hi>Austin,</hi> the understanding resembles Fire, reason the Aire, imagination the Water, and the senses the Earth. And these senses also are divided amongst themselves by reason of the Elements, for the sight is fiery, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it perceive without Fire, and Light: the hearing is airy, for a sound is made by the striking of the Aire; The smell, and tast resemble the Water, without the moisture of which there is neither smell, nor tast; and lastly the feeling is wholly earthy, and taketh gross bodies for its object. The actions also, and the operations of man are governed by the Elements. The Earth signifies a slow, and firm motion;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52070:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Water signifies fearfulness, &amp; sluggishness, and remisseness in working: Aire signifies chearfulness, and an amiable dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: but Fire a fierce, quick, and angry disposition. The Elements therefore are the first of all things, and all things are of, and according to them, and they are in all things, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse their vertues through all things.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>How the Elements are in the Heavens, in Stars, in Divels, in Angels, and lastly in God himself.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is the unanimous consent of all Platonists, that as in the originall, and exemplary World, all things are in all; so also in this corporeal world, all things are in all: so also the Elements are not only in these inferiour bodies, but also in the Heavens, in Stars, in Divels, in Angels, and lastly in God, the maker, and orginall example of all things. Now in these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour bodies, the Elements are accompanied with much gross matter; but in the Heavens the Elements are with their natures, and vertues, <hi>viz.</hi> after a Celestiall, and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner, then in sublunary things. For the firmness of the Celestiall Earth is there without the grossness of Water: and the agility of the Aire without running over its bounds; the heat of Fire without burning, only shining, and giving life to all things by its heat. Amongst the Stars also, some are fiery, as <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Sol:</hi> airy, as <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Venus:</hi> watery, as <hi>Saturn,</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> and earthy, such as inhabit the eighth Orbe, and the Moon (which notwithstanding by many is accounted watery) seeing, as if it were Earth, it attracts to it self the Celestiall waters, with which being imbibed, it doth by reason of its neerness to us power out, and communicate to us. There are also amongst the Signes, some fiery, some earthy, some airy, some watery: the Elements rule them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the Heavens, distributing to them these four threefold considerations of every Element, <hi>viz.</hi> the beginning, middle,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52070:25"/>
and end: so <hi>Aries</hi> possesseth the beginning of Fire, <hi>Leo</hi> the progress, and increase, and <hi>Sagittarius</hi> the end. <hi>Taurus</hi> the beginning of the Earth, <hi>Virgo</hi> the progress, <hi>Capricorn</hi> the end. <hi>Gemini</hi> the beginning of the Aire, <hi>Libra</hi> the progress, <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the end. <hi>Cancer</hi> the beginning of Water, <hi>Scorpius</hi> the middle, and <hi>Pisces</hi> the end. Of the mixtions therefore of these Planets, and Signes, together with the Elements are all bodies made. Moreover Divels also are upon this account distinguished the one from the other, so that some are called fiery, some earthy, some airy, and some watery. Hence also those four Infernall Rivers, fiery <hi>Phlegethon,</hi> airy <hi>Cocytus,</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery <hi>Styx,</hi> earthy <hi>Acheron.</hi> Also in the Gospel we read of Hell Fire, and eternall Fire, into which the Cursed shall be commanded to go: and in the Revelation we read of a Lake of Fire, and <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaks of the damned, that the Lord will smite them with corrupt Aire. And in <hi>Job,</hi> They shall skip from the Waters of the Snow to extremity of heat, and in the same we read, That the Earth is dark, and covered with the darkness of death, and miserable darkness. Moreover also these Elements are placed in the Angels in Heaven, and the blessed intelligencies; there is in them a stability of their es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which is an earthy vertue, in which is the stedfast seat of God; also their mercy, and piety is a watery cleansing vertue. Hence by the <hi>Psalmist</hi> they are called Waters, where he speaking of the Heavens, saith, Who rulest the Waters that are higher then the Heavens; also in them their subtill breath is Aire, and their love is shining Fire: Hence they are called in Scripture the Wings of the Wind; and in another place the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks of them, <hi>Who makest Angels thy Spirits and thy Ministers a flaming fire.</hi> Also according to orders of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, some are fiery, as <hi>Seraphin,</hi> and authorities, and powers; earthy as <hi>Cherubin:</hi> watery as Thrones, and Archangels: airy as Dominions, and Principalities. Do we not also read of the original maker of all things, that the earth shall be opened and bring forth a Saviour? Is it not spoken of the same, that he shall be a fountain of living Water, cleansing, and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating? Is not the same Spirit breathing the breath of life: and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52070:26"/>
the same according to <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> testimony, <hi>A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming Fire?</hi> That Elements therefore are to be found every where, and in all things after their manner, no man can deny: First in these inferiour bodies feculent, and gross, and in Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stials more pure, and clear; but in supercelestials living, and in all respects blessed. Elements therefore in the exemplary world are <hi>Idea's</hi> of things to be produced, in Intelligencies are distributed powers, in Heavens are vertues, and in inferiour bodies gross forms.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of the vertues of things Naturall, depending immediatly upon Elements.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OF the naturall vertues of things, some are Elementary, as to heat, to cool, to moisten, to dry; and they are called operations, or first qualities, and the second act: for these qualities only do wholly change the whole substance, which none of the other qualities can do. And some are in things compounded of Elements, and these are more then first qualities, and such are those that are maturating, digesting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, mollifying, hardening, restringing, absterging, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding, burning, opening, evaporating, strengthening, miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating, conglutinating, obstructing, expelling, retaining, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, repercussing, stupifying, bestowing, lubrifying, and many more. Elementary qualities do many things in a mixt body, which they cannot do in the Elements themselves. And these operations are called secondary qualities, because they follow the nature, and proportion of the mixtion of the first vertues, as largely it is treated of in Physick Books. As matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is the operation of naturall heat, according to a certain proportion in the substance of the matter. Induration is the operation of cold; so also is congelation, and so of the rest. And these operations sometimes act upon a certain mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as such which provoke Urine, Milk, the Menstrua, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52070:26"/>
they are called third qualities, which follow the second, as the second do the first. According therefore to these first, second, and third qualities many diseases are both cured, and caused. Many things also there are artificially made, which men much wonder at; as is Fire, which burns Water, which they call the Greek Fire, of which <hi>Aristotle</hi> teacheth many compositions in his particular Treatise of this subject. In like manner there is made a Fire that is extinguished with Oyl, and is kindled with cold Water, when it is sprinkled upon it; and a Fire which is kindled either with Rain, Wind, or the Sun; and there is made a Fire, which is called burning Water, the Confection whereof is well known, and it consumes nothing but it self: and also there are made Fires that cannot be quenched, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combustible Oyles, and perpetuall Lamps, which can be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished neither with Wind, nor Water, nor any other way; which seems utterly incredible, but that there had been such a most famous Lamp, which once did shine in the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> in which the stone <hi>Asbestus</hi> did burn, which being once fired can never be extinguished. Also on the contrary, Wood, or any other combustible matter may be so ordered, that it can receive no harm from the Fire; and there are made cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Confections, with which the hands being anointed, we may carry red hot Iron in them, or put them into melted Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or go with our whole bodies, being first anointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, into the Fire without any manner of harm, and such like things as these may be done. There is also a kind of flax, which <hi>Pliny</hi> cals <hi>Asbestum,</hi> the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of the occult Vertues of things.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere are also other vertues in things, which are not from any Element, as to expell poyson, to drive away the noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vapours of Minerals, to attract Iron, or any thing else; and this vertue is a sequell of the species, and form of this or that thing; whence also it being litle in quantity, is of great effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; which is not granted to any Elementary qualitv. For these vertues having much form, and litle matter, can do very much; but an Elementary vertue, because it hath more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riality, requires much matter for its acting. And they are called occult qualities, because their Causes lie hid, and mans intellect cannot in any way reach, and find them out. Wherefore Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers have attained to the greatest part of them by long experience, rather then by the search of reason: for as in the Stomack the meat is digested by heat, which we know; so it is changed by a certain hidden vertue which we know not: for truly it is not changed by heat, because then it should rather be changed by the Fire side, then in the Stomack. So there are in things, besides the Elementary qualities which we know, other certain imbred vertues created by nature, which we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and are amazed at, being such as we know not, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed seldom or never have seen. As we read in <hi>Ovid</hi> of the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> one only Bird, which renews her self.

                     </l>
                  </q>
And in another place,
<q>
                     <l>Aegyptus came to see this wondrous sight:</l>
                     <l>And this rare Bird is welcom'd with delight.</l>

Long since <hi>Metreas</hi> brought a very great wonderment upon the Greeks, and Romans concerning himself. He said that he nourished, and bred a beast that did devour it self. Hence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to this day are solicitous, what this beast of <hi>Matreas</hi> should be. Who would not wonder that Fishes should be digged out of the Earth, of which <hi>Aristotle, Theophrastus,</hi> and <hi>Polybius</hi> the Historian makes mention? And these things which <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanias</hi> wrote concerning the singing Stones? All these are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of occult vertues. So the Estrich concocts cold, and most hard Iron, and digests it into nourishment for his body; whose Stomack they also report, cannot be hurt with red hot Iron. So that little Fish called <hi>Echeneis</hi> doth so curb the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Winds, and appease the rage of the Sea, that, let the Tempests be never so imperious, and raging, the Sails also bearing a full Gale, it doth notwithstanding by its meer touch stay the Ships, and makes them stand still, that by no means they can be moved. So <hi>Salamanders,</hi> and Crickets live in the Fire; although they seem sometimes to burn, yet they are not hurt. The like is said of a kind of Bitumen, with which the weapons of the <hi>Amazons</hi> were said to be smeared over, by which means they could be spoiled neither with Sword nor Fire; with which also the Gates of <hi>Caspia,</hi> made of Brass, are reported to be smeared over by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. We read also that <hi>Noah's</hi> Ark was joyned together with this Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and that endured some thousands of years upon the Mountains of <hi>Armenia.</hi> There are many such kind of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things, scarce credible, which notwithstanding are known by experience. Amongst which Antiquity makes mention of Satyrs, which were Animals, in shape half men, and half bruits, yet capable of speech, and reason; one whereof S. <hi>Hierome</hi> reporteth, spake once unto holy <hi>Antonius</hi> the Hermite, and condemned the errour of the Gentiles, in worshipping such poor creatures as they were, and desired him that he would pray unto the true God for him; also he affirms that there was one of them shewed openly alive, and afterwards sent to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour.</p>

Now they place <hi>Idea's</hi> in the first place in very goodness it self <hi>(i. e.)</hi> God, by way of cause; and that they are distinguished amongst themselves by some rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive considerations only, least whatsoever is in the world, should be but one thing without any variety, and that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in essence, least God should be a compound substance. In the second place, they place them in the very intelligible it self <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in the Soul of the world, differing the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by absolute forms, so that all the <hi>Idea's</hi> in God indeed are but one form: but in the Soul of the world they are many. They are placed in the minds of all other things, whether they be joyned to the body, or separated from the body, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain participation, and now by degrees are distinguished more, and more. They place them in nature, as certain small seed of forms infused by the <hi>Ideas,</hi> and lastly they place them in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as shadows. Hereunto may be added, that in the Soul of the world there be as many Seminal forms of things, as <hi>Idea's</hi> in the mind of God, by which forms she did in the Heavens above the Stars frame to her self shapes also, and stamped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all these some properties; on these Stars therefore, shapes, and properties, all vertues of inferiour species, as also their properties do depend; so that every species hath its Celestiall shape, or figure that is sutable to it, from which also proceeds a wonderfull power of operating, which proper gift it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from its own <hi>Idea,</hi> through the Seminal forms of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52070:28"/>
Soul of the world. For <hi>Idea's</hi> are not only essentiall causes of every species, but are also the causes of every vertue, which is in the species: and this is that which many Philosophers say, that the properties, which are in the nature of things (which vertues indeed are the operations of the <hi>Idea's)</hi> are moved by certain vertues, <hi>viz.</hi> such as have a certain, and sure foundation, not fortuitous, nor casuall, but efficacious, powerfull, and sufficient, doing nothing in vain. Now these Vertues do not err in their actings, but by accident, <hi>viz.</hi> by reason of the impurity, or inequality of the matter: For upon this account there are found things of the same species, more, or less powerful, according to the purity, or indisposition of the matter; for all Celestial influencies may be hindred by the indisposition, and insufficiency of the matter. Whence it was a Proverb amongst the Platonists, That Celestial Vertues were infused according to the desert of the matter: Which also <hi>Virgil</hi> makes mention of, when he sings,
<q>
                     <l>Their natures fiery are, and from above,</l>
                     <l>And from gross bodies freed, divinely move.</l>
                  </q>
Wherefore those things, in which there is less of the <hi>Idea</hi> of the matter <hi>(i. e.)</hi> such things which have a greater resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of things separated, have more powerfull vertues in operation, being like to the operation of a separated <hi>Idea.</hi> We see then that the situation, and figure of Celestials is the cause of all those excellent Vertues, that are in inferiour species.</p>

               <p>THere are also in many Individuals, or particular things, peculiar gifts, as wonderfull, as in the species, and these also are from the figure, and situation of Celestiall Stars. For
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52070:29"/>
every Individuall, when it begins to be under a determined Horoscope, and Celestiall Constellation, Contracts together with its essence a certain wonderfull vertue both of doing, and suffering something that is remarkable, even besides that which it receives from its species, and this it doth partly by the influence of the Heaven, and partly through that obedienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alness of the matter of things to be generated, to the Soul of the World, which obedientialness indeed is such as that of our bodies to our souls. For we perceive that there is this in us, that according to our conceptions of things, our bodies are moved, and that cheerfully, as when we are afraid of, or fly from any thing. So many times when the Celestiall souls conceive several things, then the matter is moved obedienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to it: Also in Nature there appear divers prodigies, by reason of the imagination of superiour motions. So also they conceive, &amp; imagine divers vertues, not only things naturall, but also sometimes things artificial, and this especially if the Soul of the operator be inclined towards the same. Whence <hi>Avicen</hi> saith, that whatsoever things are done here, must have been before in the motions, and conceptions of the Stars, and Orbes. So in things, various effects, inclinations, and dispositions are occasioned not only from the matter variously disposed, as many suppose, but from a various influence, and diverse form; not truly with a specifical difference, but peculiar, and proper. And the degrees of these are variously distributed by the first Cause of all things, God himself, who being unchangeable, distributes to every one as he pleaseth, with whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing second Causes, Angelical, and Celestial cooperate, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of the Corporeal matter, and other things that are committed to them. All vertues therefore are infused by God, through the Soul of the World, yet by a particular power of resemblances, and intelligences over-ruling them, and concourse of the rayes, and aspects of the Stars in a certain peculiar har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious consent.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Whence the Occult Vertues of things proceed.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is well known to all, that there is a Certain vertue in the Loadstone, by which it attracts Iron, and that the Diamond doth by its presence take away that vertue of the Loadstone: so also Amber, and jeat rubbed, and warmed draw a straw to them, and the Stone Asbestus being once fired is never, or scarce extinguished: a Carbuncle shines in the dark, the Stone Aetites put above the young fruit of Women, or Plants, strengthens them, but being put under, causeth abortion; the Jasper stencheth blood; the litle fish <hi>Echeneis</hi> stops the ships: Rhuharb expels choller; the liver of the <hi>Camelion</hi> burnt, raiseth showers, and thunders. The Stone Heliotropium dazles the sight, and makes him that wears it to be invisible, the Stone Lyucurius takes away delusions from before the eyes, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume of the Stone Lypparis cals forth all the beasts, the Stone Synochitis brings up infernal Ghosts, the Stone Anachitis makes the images of the Gods appear. The Ennectis put under them that dream, causeth Oracles. There is an Hearb in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,</hi> with which they report ponds, and lakes are dryed up, and all things that are shut, to be opened; and we read of an Hearb called Latace which the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings give to their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, that whithersoever they shall come, they shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with plenty of all things. There is also a <hi>Scythian</hi> Hearb, with which being tasted, or at least held in the mouth, they report the <hi>Scythians</hi> will endure twelve dayes hunger, and thirst; and <hi>Apuleius</hi> saith, that he was taught by an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that there were many kinds of Hearbs, and Stones, with which men might prolong their lives for ever, but that it was not lawfull for men to understand the knowledge of those things, because, whereas they have but a short time to live, they study mischief with all their might, and attempt all manner of wickedness; if they should be sure of a very long time, they would not spare the Gods themselves. But from whence these
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52070:30"/>
vertues are, none of all these have shewed, who have set forth huge Volumes of the properties of things, not <hi>Hermes,</hi> not <hi>Bochus,</hi> not <hi>Aaron,</hi> not <hi>Orpheus,</hi> not <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> not <hi>Thebith,</hi> not <hi>Zenothemis,</hi> not <hi>Zoroaster,</hi> not <hi>Evax,</hi> not <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> not <hi>Isaaick</hi> the Jew, not <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Babilonian, not <hi>Albertus,</hi> not <hi>Arnoldus;</hi> and yet all these have confessed the same, that <hi>Zacharias</hi> writes to <hi>Mithridites,</hi> that great power, and humane destinies are couched in the vertues of Stones, and Hearbs. But to know from whence these come, a higher speculation is required. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Peripateticke not going any further then his senses, and qualities, is of the opinion that these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Elements, and their qualities, which haply might be supposed to be true, if those were of the same species; but many of the operations of the Stones agree neither <hi>in genere,</hi> nor <hi>specie.</hi> Therefore <hi>Plato,</hi> and his Schollers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute these vertues to <hi>Idea's,</hi> the formers of things. But <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi> reduceth these kinds of operations to Intelligencies, <hi>Hermes</hi> to the Stars, <hi>Albertus</hi> to the specificall forms of things. And although these Authors seem to thwart one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet none of them, if they be rightly understood, goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the truth: since all their sayings are the same in effect in most things. For God in the first place is the end, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Vertues, he gives the seal of the <hi>Idea's</hi> to his servants the Intelligencies; who as faithfull officers sign all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to them with an Ideall Vertue, the Heavens, and Stars, as instruments, disposing the matter in the mean while for the receiving of those forms which reside in Divine Majesty (as saith <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Timeus)</hi> and to be conveyed by Stars; and the Giver of forms distributes them by the Ministery of his Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which he hath set as Rulers, and Controllers over his Works, to whom such a power is intrusted in things commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, that so all Vertue of Stones, Hearbs, Metals, and all other things may come from the Intelligencies, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. The Form therefore, and Vertue of things comes first from the <hi>Idea's,</hi> then from the ruling, and governing Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, then from the aspects of the Heavens disposing, and lastly from the tempers of the Elements disposed, answering
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52070:30"/>
the influencies of the Heavens, by which the Elements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are ordered, or disposed. These kinds of operations therefore are performed in these inferiour things by express forms, and in the Heavens by disposing vertues, in Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by mediating rules, in the originall Cause by <hi>Idea's,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary forms, all which must of necessity agree in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the effect, and vertue of every thing.</p>
               <p>There is therefore a wonderfull vertue, and operation in every Hearb, and Stone, but greater in a Star, beyond which, even from the governing Intelligencies every thing receiveth, and obtains many things for it self, especially from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Cause, with whom all things do mutually, and exactly correspond, agreeing in an harmonious consent, as it were in Hymnes, alwaies praising the highest Maker of all things, as by the three Children in the fiery furnace were all things called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to praise God with singings. Bless ye the Lord all things that grow upon the Earth, and all things which move in the Waters, all fowls of the Heavens, Beasts, and Cattle, together with the sons of men. There is therefore no other cause of the necessity of effects, then the connexion of all things with the first Cause, and their correspondency with those Divine pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, and eternall <hi>Idea's,</hi> whence every thing hath its deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, and particular place in the exemplary world, from whence it lives, and receives its originall being; And every vertue of Hearbs, Stones, Metals, Animals, Words, and Speeches, and all things that are of God, is placed there. Now the first Cause, which is God, although he doth by Intelligencies, and the Heavens work upon these inferiour things, doth sometimes (these <hi>Mediums</hi> being laid aside, or their officiating being suspended) works those things immediatly by himself, which works then are called Miracles: But whereas secondary causes, which <hi>Plato,</hi> and others call handmaids, do by the Command, and appointment of the first Cause, necessarily act, and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to produce their effects, if God shall notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to his pleasure so discharge, and suspend them, that they shall wholly desist from the necessity of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and appointment; then they are called the greatest
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52070:31"/>
Miracles of God. So the fire in the Chaldeans furnace did not burn the Children: So also the Sun at the Command of <hi>Joshua</hi> went back from its course the space of one whole day; so also at the prayer of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> it went back ten degrees, or hours. So when Christ was Crucified the Sun was darkened, though at full Moon: And the reasons of these operations can by no rationall discourse, no Magick, or occult, or profound Science whatsoever be found out, or understood, but are to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and inquired into by Divine Oracles only.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>DEmocritus,</hi> and <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and many Pythagorians having most diligently searched into the vertues of Celestiall things, and natures of inferiour things, said, That all things are full of God, and not without cause: For there is nothing of such transcending vertues, which being destitute of Divine assistance, is content with the nature of it self. Also they called those Divine powers which are diffused in things, Gods: which <hi>Zoroaster</hi> called Divine allurements, <hi>Synesius</hi> Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call inticements, others called them Lives, and some also Souls; saying, that the vertues of things did depend upon these; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the property of the Soul to be from one matter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended into divers things, about which it operates: So is a man, who extends his intellect unto intelligible things, and his imagination unto imaginable things; and this is that which they understood, when they said, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Soul of one thing went out, and went into another thing, altering it, and hindering the operations of it: As a Diamond hinders the operation of the Loadstone, that it cannot attract Iron. Now seeing the Soul is the first thing that is moveable, and as they say, is moved of it self; but the body, or the matter is of it self unable, and unfit for motion, and doth much degenerate from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52070:31"/>
the Soul, therefore they say there is need of a more excellent <hi>Medium, viz.</hi> Such a one that may be as it were no body, but as it were a Soul, or as it were no Soul, but as it were a body, <hi>viz.</hi> by which the soul may be joyned to the body. Now they conceive such a <hi>medium</hi> to be the spirit of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> that which we call the quintessence: because it is not from the four Elements, but a certain first thing, having its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above, and besides them. There is therefore such a kind of spirit required to be, as it were the <hi>medium,</hi> whereby Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Souls are joyned to gross bodies, and bestow upon them wonderfull gifts. This spirit is after the same manner in the body of the world, as ours is in the body of man. For as the powers of our soul are communicated to the members of the body by the spirit, so also the Vertue of the Soul of the World is diffused through all things by the quintessence: For there is nothing found in the whole world, that hath not a spark of the Vertue thereof. Yet it is more, nay most of all infused into those things which have received, or taken in most of this spirit: Now this spirit is received or taken in by the rayes of the Stars, so far forth as things render themselves conformable to them. By this spirit therefore every occult property is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Hearbs, Stones, Metals, and Animals, through the Sun, Moon, Planets, and through Stars higher then the Planets. Now this spirit may be more advantagious to us, if any one knew how to separate it from the Elements: or at least to use those things chiefly, which do most abound with this spirit. For these things, in which this spirit is less drowned in a body, and less checked by matter, do more powerfully, and perfectly act, and also more readily generate their like: for in it are all generative, &amp; seminary Vertues. For which cause the <hi>Alchymists</hi> endeavour to separate this spirit from Gold, and Silver; which being rightly separated, and extracted, if thou shalt afterward project upon any matter of the same kind <hi>(i. e.)</hi> any Metall, presently will turn it into Gold, or Silver. And we know how to do that, and have seen it done: but we could make no more Gold, then the weight of that was, out of which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the spirit. For seeing that is an extense form, and not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52070:32"/>
intense, it cannot beyond its own bounds change an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect body into a perfect: which I deny not, but may be done by another way.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>How we must find out, and examine the Vertues of things by way of similitude.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>II is now manifest that the occult properties in things are not from the nature of the Elements, but infused from above, hid from our senses, and scarce at last known by our reason, which indeed come from the Life, and the Spirit of the World, through the rayes of the Stars: and can no otherwise but by experience, and conjecture be enquired into by us. Wherefore, he that desires to enter upon this study, must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that every thing moves, and turns it self to its like, and inclines that to it self with all its might, as well in property, <hi>viz.</hi> Occult vertue, as in quality, <hi>viz.</hi> Elementary vertue. Sometimes also in substance it self, as we see in Salt, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hath long stood with Salt, becomes Salt: for every a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, when it hath begun to act, doth not attempt to make a thing inferiour to it self, but as much as may be, like, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to it self. Which also we manifestly see in sensible Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, in which the nutritive Vertue doth not change the meat into an Hearb, or a Plant, but turns it into sensible flesh. In what things therefore there is an excess of any quality, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as heat, cold, boldness, fear, sadness, anger, love, hatred, or any other passion, or Vertue; whether it be in them by nature, or sometimes also by art, or chance, as bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in a harlot; these things do very much move, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke to such a quality, passion, or Vertue. So Fire moves to Fire, and Water moves to Water, and he that is bold moves to boldness. And it is well known amongst Physitians, that brain helps the brain, and lungs, the lungs. So also it is said, that the right eye of a Frog helps the soreness of a mans right
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52070:32"/>
eye, and the left eye thereof, helps the soreness of his left eye, if they be hanged about his neck in a Cloth of its naturall Colour: The like is reported of the eyes of a Crab. So the foot of a Tortoise helps them that have the Gout in their being applyed thus, as foot to foot, hand to hand, right to right, left to left.</p>
               <p>After this manner they say, that any Animall that is barren causeth another to be barren; and of the Animall, especially the Testicles, Matrix, or Urin. So they report that a woman shall not conceive, if she drink every moneth of the Urin of a Mule, or any thing steeped in it. If therefore we would obtain any property or Vertue, let us seek for such Animals, or such other things whatsoever, in which such a property is in a more eminent manner then in any other thing, and in these let us take that part in which such a property, or Vertue is most vigorous: as if at any time we would promote love, let us seek some Animall which is most loving, of which kind are Pigeons, Turtles, Sparrows, Swallows, Wagtailes: and in these let us take those members, or parts, in which the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall appetite is most vigorous, and such are the heart, testicles, matrix, yard, sperme, and menstrues. And it must be done at that time when these Animals have this affection most intense: for then they do much provoke, and draw love. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to increase boldness, let us look for a Lyon, or a Cock, and of these let us take the heart, eyes, or forehead. And so we must understand that which <hi>Psellus</hi> the <hi>Platonist</hi> saith, <hi>viz.</hi> that Dogs, Crows, and Cocks conduce much to watchfulness: also the Nightingale, and Bat, and horn Owle, and in these the heart, head, and eyes especially. Therefore it is said, if any shall carry the heart of a Crow, or a Bat about him, he shall not sleep till he cast it away from him. The same doth the head of a Bat dryed, and bound to the right arme of him that is awake, for if it be put upon him when he is asleep, it is said, that he shall not be awaked till it be taken off from him. After the same manner doth a Frog, and an Owle make one talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and of these specially the tongue, and heart; So the tongue also of a Water-frog laid under the head, makes a man
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52070:33"/>
speak in his sleep, and the heart of a scrich-Owle laid upon the left breast of a woman that is asleep is said to make her utter all her secrets. The same also the heart of the horn Owle is said to do, also the sewet of a Hare laid upon the breast of one that is asleep. Upon the same account do Animals that are long lived, conduce to long life; and whatsoever things have a power in themselves, to renew themselves, conduce to the renovation of our body and restoring of youth, which Physitians have often professed they know to be true; as is manifest of the Viper, and Snake. And it is known that Harts renew their old age by the eating of Snakes. After the same manner the Phoenix is renewed by a fire which she makes for her self; and the like vertue there is in a Pellican, whose right foot being put under warm dung, after three moneths there is of that generated a Pellican. Therefore some Physitians by some certain confections made of Vipers, and Hellebor, and the flesh of some such kind of Animals do restore youth, and indeed do sometimes restore it so, as <hi>Medea</hi> restored old <hi>Pileas.</hi> It is also believed that the blood of a Bear, if it be suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of her wound doth increase the strength of the body, because that Animall is the strongest creature.</p>

               <p>THou must know, that so great is the power of naturall things, that they not only work upon all things that are neer them, by their Vertue, but also besides this, they infuse into them a like power. through which by the same Vertue they also work upon other things, as we see in the Loadstone, which Stone indeed doth not only draw Iron Rings, but also infuseth a Vertue into the Rings themselves, whereby they can do the same which <hi>Austin,</hi> and <hi>Albertus</hi> say they saw. After this manner it is, as they say, that a common harlot, grounded
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52070:33"/>
in boldness, and impudence doth infect all that are neer her, by this property, whereby they are made like her self. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they say that if any one shall put on the inward garment of an Harlot, or shall have about him that looking glass, which she daily looks into, he shall thereby become bold, confident, impudent, and wanton. In like maner they say, that a cloth that was about a dead Corpes hath received from thence the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of sadness, and melancholy and that the halter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a man was hanged hath certain wonderfull properties. The like story tels <hi>Pliny,</hi> if any shall put a green Lizard made blind, together with Iron, or Gold Rings into a glass-vessel, putting under them some earth, and then shutting the vessel, and when it appears that the Lizard hath received his sight, shall put him out of the glass, that those Rings shall help sore eyes. The same may be done with Rings, and a Weesel, whose eyes after they are with any kind of prick put out, it is certain are restored to sight again. Upon the same account Rings are put for a certain time in the nest of Sparrows, or Swallows, which afterwards are used to procure love, and favor.</p>

               <p>In the next place it is requisite that we consider that all things have a friendliness, and enmity amongst themselves, and every thing hath something that it fears &amp; dreads, that is an enemy, and destructive to it; and on the contrary something that it rejoyceth, and delighteth in, and is strengthened by, So in the Elements, Fire is an enemy to Water, and Aire to Earth, but yet they agree amongst themselves.

There is another kind of enmity amongst the Stars, <hi>viz.</hi> when they have opposite houses; as <hi>Saturne</hi> to the Sun and Moon, <hi>Jupiter</hi> to <hi>Mercury, Mars</hi> to <hi>Venus.</hi> And their enmity is stronger, whose exaltations are opposite: as of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and the Sun; of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars;</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury.</hi> But their friendship is the strongest, who agree in nature qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, substance, and power; as <hi>Mars</hi> with the Sun, and <hi>Venus</hi> with the Moon, as <hi>Jupiter</hi> with <hi>Venus,</hi> as also their friendship whose exaltation is in the house of another, as that of <hi>Saturne</hi> with <hi>Venus,</hi> of <hi>Jupiter</hi> with the Moon, of <hi>Mars</hi> with <hi>Saturn,</hi> of the Sun with <hi>Mars,</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> of the Moon with <hi>Venus.</hi> And of what sort the friendships, and enmities of the superiours be, such are the inclinations of things subjected to them in these inferiour. These dispositions therefore of friendship and enmity are nothing else but certain inclinations of things of the one to another, desiring such, and such a thing if it be absent, and to move towards it, unless it be hindred, and to acquiess in it when it is obtained, shunning the contrary, and dreading the approach of it, and not resting in, or being contented with it. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> therefore being guided by this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, professed that all things were made by enmity &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Now the inclinations of friendship are such in Vegetables and Minerals, as is that attractive inclination, which the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone hath upon Iron, and the Emrald upon riches, and favour; the Jasper upon the birth of any thing, and the Stone Achates upon Eloquence; In like manner there is a kind of Bituminous Clay that draws Fire, and leaps into it, wheresoever it sees it: Even so doth the root of the Hearb Aproxis draw Fire from afar off. Also the same inclination there is betwixt the male palme, and female: whereof when the bough of one shall touch the bough of the other, they fold themselves into mutual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, neither doth the female bring forth fruit without the male. And the Almond tree, when she is alone is loss fruitfull.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52070:34"/>
The Vines love the Elme, and the Olive-tree, and myrtle love one the other: also the Olive-tree, and Fig tree. Now in Animals there is amity betwixt the Blackbird, and Thrush, betwixt the Crow, and Heron, betwixt Peacocks, and Pigeons, Turtles, and Parrats. Whence <hi>Sappho</hi> writes to <hi>Phaon.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>To Birds unlike oftimes joyned are white Doves;</l>
                     <l>Also the Bird that's green, black Turtle loves.</l>
                  </q>
Again, the Whale, and the little Fish his guide are friendly. Neither is this amity in Animals amongst themselves, but also with other things, as with Metals, Stones, and Vegetables, so the Cat delights in the Hearb Nip, by rubbing her self upon which she is said to conceive without a male; and there be Mares in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> that expose themselves to the blast of the wind, and by the attraction thereof conceive. So Frogs, Toads, Snakes, and all manner of creeping poisonous things delight in the Plant called Pas flower, of whom, as the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians say, if any one eat, he shall dye with laughing. The Tortoise also when he is hunted by the Adder, eats Origanum, and is thereby strengthened: and the Stork, when he hath eat Snakes, seeks for a remedy in Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganum: and the Weesell, when he goes to fight with the Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk, eats Rue, whence we come to know that Orgianum, and Rue are effectuall against poison. So in some Animals there is an imbred skil, and medicinall art; for when the Toad is wounded with a bite or poison of another Animall, he is wont to go to Rue, or Sage, and Rub the place wounded, and so es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes the danger of the poison. So men have learned many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent remedies of diseases, &amp; vertues of things from bruits; So Swallows have shewed us that Sallendine is very medicinable for the sight, with which they cure the eyes of their young, and the pye when she is sick, puts a Bay-leafe into her nest, and is recovered. In like maner, Cranes, Daws, Partriges, Blackbirds purge their nauseous stomacks with the same, with which also Crows allay the poison of the Chameleon; and the Lyon, if
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52070:35"/>
he be feavorish, is recovered by eating of an Ape. The Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing being surfetted with eating of Grapes, cures himself with Southernwood; so the Harts have taught us that the Hearb Ditany is very good to draw out Darts; for they being wounded with an Arrow, cast it out by eating of this Hearb: the same do Goats in Candy. So Hinds, a little before they bring forth, purge themselves with a certain Hearb called Mountain Ofier. Also they that are hurt with Spiders, seek a remedy by eating of Crabs: Swine also being hurt by Snakes cure themselves by eating of them; and Crows when they perceive they are poisoned with a kinde of French poison, seek for cure in the Oake; Elephants, when they have swallowed a Chameleon help themselves with the wild-olive. Bears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt with Mandrakes, escape the danger by eating of Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires. Geese, Ducks, and such like watery fowle, cure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Hearb called wall-sage. Pigeons, Turtles, Hens, with the Hearb called Pellitory of the wall. Cranes with Bull-rushes. Leopards cure themselves, being hurt, with the Hearb called Wolfes-bane, by mans dung: Boars with Ivy, Hinds with the Hearb called Cinnara.</p>

               <p>ON the contrary there are inclinations of Enmities, and they are as it were the <hi>odium,</hi> and anger, indignation, and a certain kind of obstinate contrariety of nature, so that any thing shuns its contrary, and drives it away out of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.

of the stomack. The Topaze against spirituall heats, such as are coveteousness, lust, and all manner of excesses of love. The like inclination is there also of Pismires against the Hearb O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riganu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and the wing of a Bat, and the heart of a Lapwing, from the presence of which they flie. Also Origanum is contrary to a certain poisonous fly, which cannot endure the Sun, and resists Salamanders, and loaths Cabbage with such a deadly hatred, that they destroy one the other; so Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers hate oile, and will run themselves into a ring least they should touch it. And it is said that the Gall of a Crow makes men afraid, and drives them away where it is, as also certain other things; so a Diamond doth disagree with the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, that being set by it, it will not suffer Iron to be drawn to it; and sheep fly from Frog-parsley as from some deadly thing: and that which is more wonderfull, nature hath pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the sign of this death in the livers of sheep, in which the very figure of Frog-parsly being described, doth nuturally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; So Goats do so hate Garden basil, as if there were nothing more pernicious. And again, amongst Animals, Mice, and Weesels do disagree; whence it is said that Mice will not touch Cheese, if the brains of a Weesel be put into the rennet, and besides that the Cheese will not be corrupt with age. So a Lizard is so contrary to Scorpions, that it makes them afraid with its very sight, as also it puts them into a cold sweat, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are killed with the oile of them, which oile also cures the wounds made by Scorpions. There is also an enmity betwixt Scorpions, and Mice: wherefore if a Mouse be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to a prick or wound made by a Scorpion, it cures it, as it is reported. There is also an enmity betwixt Scorpions, and Stalabors, Aspes, and Waspes. It is reported also that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is so much an enemy to Snakes as Crabs, and that if Swine be hurt therewith they eat them, and are cured. The Sun also being in <hi>Cancer,</hi> Serpents are tormented. Also the Scorpion, and Crocodile kil one the other; and if the Bird Ibis doth but touch a crocodile with one of his feathers, he makes him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable; the Bird called Bustard flies away at the sight of a horse; and a Hart runs away at the sight of a Ram, as also of a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52070:36"/>
Viper. An Elephant trembles at the hearing of the grunting of a Hog, so doth a Lyon at the sight of a Cock: And Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will not touch them that are annointed all over with the broth of a Hen, especially if Garlick hath been boiled in it. There is also enmity betwixt Foxes, and Swans, Buls, and Daws. Amongst Birds also some are at a perpetuall strife one with another, as also with other Animals, as Daws, and Owles, the Kite, and Crows, the Turtle, and Ring-taile, Egepis, and Eagles, Harts, and Dragons. Also amongst Water Animals there is an enmity, as betwixt Dolphins, and Whirpools, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and Pikes, Lampreys, and Congers: Also the fish called Pourcontrel makes the Lobster so much afraid, that the Lobster seeing the other but neer him is struck dead. The Lobster, and Conger tear one the other. The Civet Cat is said to stand so in awe of the Panther, that he hath no power to resist him, or touch his skin; and they say that if the skins of both of them be hanged up one against the other, the haires of the Panthers skin fall off. And <hi>Orus Apollo</hi> saith in his Hiereglyphicks, if any one be girt about with the skin of the Civet Cat, that he may pass safely through the middle of his enemies, and not at all be afraid. Also the Lamb is very much afraid of the Wolf and slies from him. And they say that if the taile, or skin, or head of a Wolf be hanged upon the sheep-coate, the sheep are much troubled, and cannot eat their meat for fear. And <hi>Pliny</hi> makes mention of a Bird called <hi>Marlin,</hi> that breaks Crows Eggs; whose young are annoyed by the Fox that she also will pinch, and pull the Foxes whelps, and the Fox her self al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: which when the Crows see, they help the Fox against her, as against a common enemy. The litle Bird called a Linnet living in Thistles, hates Asses, because they eat the Flowers of Thistles. Also there is such a bitter enmity betwixt the litle Bird called Esalon, and the Asse, that their blood will not mix together, and that at the braying of the Asse both the eggs and young of the Esalon perish. There is also such a disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement betwixt the Olive-tree and a Harlot, that if she Plant it, it will either be alwayes unfruitfull, or altogether wither. A Lyon fears nothing so much as fired Torches, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52070:36"/>
will be tamed by nothing so much as by these: and the Wolf fears neither sword, nor spear, but a stone, by the throwing of which a wound being made, worms breed in the Wolf. A Horse fears a Camell, so that he cannot endure to see so much as his picture. An Elephant when he rageth, is quieted by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Cock. A Snake is afraid of a man that is naked, but pursues a man that is clothed. A mad Bull is tamed by being tyed to a Fig-tree. Amber draws all things to it besides Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Basill, and those things, which are smeared with oile, betwixt which there is a kinde of a naturall Antipathy.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>How the Vertues of things are to be tryed and found out, which are in them specifically, or any one Individuall by way of speciall gift.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MOreover thou must consider that the Vertues of things are in some things according to the species, as boldness, and courage in a Lyon, &amp; Cock: fearfulness in a Hare, or Lamb, ravenousness in a Wolf, treachery, and deceitfulness in a Fox, flattery in a Dog, coveteousness in a Crow, and Daw, pride in a Horse, anger in a Tygre, and Boar, sadness, and melancholy in a Cat, lust in a Sparrow, and so of the rest. For the greatest part of naturall Vertues doth follow the species. Yet some are in things individually; as there be some men which do so wonderfully abhor the sight of a Cat, that they cannot look upon her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out quaking; which fear it is manifest is not in them as they are men. And <hi>Avicen</hi> tels of a man that lived in his time, whom all poisonous things did shun, all of them dying, which did by chance bite him, he himself not being hurt, and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> reports that in a City of the <hi>Ubians</hi> he saw a wench which would catch Spiders to eat them, and being much pleased with such a kind of meat, was wonderfully nourished therewith. So is boldness in a Harlot, fearfulness in a Thief. And upon this account it is that Philosophers say, that any
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52070:37"/>
particular thing that never was sick, is good against any manner of sickness: therefore they say that a bone of a dead man, which never had a feavor, being laid upon the patient, frees him of his quartane. There are also many singular vertues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into particular things by Celestiall bodies, as we have shewed before.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XX. <hi>That naturall Vertues are in some things throughout their whole substance, and in other things in certain parts, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AGain thou must consider, that the vertues of things are in some things in the whole <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the whole substance of them, or in all their parts, as that little fish <hi>Echeneis,</hi> which is said to stop a ship by its meer touch, this it doth not do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any particular part, but according to the whole substance. So the Civet Cat hath this in its whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that Dogs by the very touch of his shadow hold their peace. So Salendine is good for the sight, not according to any one, but all its parts, not more in the root then in the leaves, and seeds; and so of the rest. But some vertues are in things according to some parts of it, <hi>viz.</hi> only in the tongue, or eyes, or some other members, and parts; so in the eyes of a Basilisk, is a most violent power to kill men, assoon as they see them: the like power is there in the eyes of the Civet Cat, which makes any Animall that it hath looked upon, to stand still, to be amazed, and not able to move it self. The like vertue is there in the eyes of some Wolfes, which if they see a man first, make him amazed, and so hoarse, that if he would cry out, he hath not the use of his voice: Of this <hi>Virgil</hi> makes mention, when he sings,
<q>
                     <l>Moeris <hi>is dumb, hath lost his voice, and why?</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>The Wolf on</hi> Moeris <hi>first hath cast his eye.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:52070:37"/>
So also there were some certain women in <hi>Scythia,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and <hi>Triballians,</hi> who as often as they looked angrily upon any man, were said to slay him. Also we read of a certain people of <hi>Rhodes</hi> called <hi>Telchines,</hi> who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted all things with their sight wherefore <hi>Jupiter</hi> drowned them. Therefore Witches, when they would after this manner work by witchcraft, use the eyes of such kind of Animals in their waters for the eyes, for the like effects. In like manner do Pismires fly from the heart of a Lapwing, not from the head, foot, or eyes. So the gall of Lizards being bruised in Water is said to gather Weesels together, not the taile or the head of it; and the gall of Goats put into the Earth in a brazen Vesel, gathers Frogs together; and a Goats liver is an enemy to Butterflies and all Maggots, and Dogs shun them that have the heart of a Dog about them, and Foxes will not touch those poultry that have eaten the liver of a Fox. So divers things have divers vertues dispersed variously through several parts, as they are from above infused into them according to the diversity of things to be received; as in a mans body the bones receive nothing but life, the eyes sight, the ears hearing. And there is in mans body a certain little bone, which the Hebrews call LVZ, of the bigness of a pulse that is husked, which is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to no corruption, neither is it overcome with Fire, but is alwaies preserved unhurt, out of which, as they say, as a Plant out of the seed, our Animall bodies shall in the Resurrection of the dead spring up And these vertues are not cleared by reason, but by experience.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MOreover we must know that there are some properties in things only whilest they live, and some that remain after their death. So the litle fish <hi>Echeneis</hi> stops the ships, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52070:38"/>
the Basilisk, and Catablepa kill with their sight, when they are alive; but when they are dead do no such thing. So they say that in the Colick, if a live Duck be applyed to the belly, it takes away the pain, and her self dies: like to this is that which <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chytas</hi> sayes. If you take a heart newly taken out of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, and whilest it is yet warm, and hang it upon one that hath a quartane feavor, it drives it away. So if any one swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the heart of a Lapwing, or a Swallow, or a Weesel, or a Mole whilest it is yet warm with naturall heat, it shall be helpfull to him for remembring, understanding, and foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: Hence is this generall rule, <hi>viz.</hi> That whatsoever things are taken out of Animals, whether they be Stones, any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Excrements, as Haire, Dung, Nailes, they must be taken from those Animals, whilest they be yet living; and if it be possible, that so they may be alive afterwards. Whence they say, when you take the tongue of a Frog, you must put the Frog into the water again, and if you take the tooth of a Wolf, you must not kill the Wolf; and so of the rest. So writes <hi>Democritus,</hi> if any one take out the tongue of a water-Frog, yet living, no other part of the body sticking to it, and she be let go into the Water again, &amp; lay it upon the place where the heart beats, of a woman, she shall answer truly whatsoever you ask her. Also they say, that if the eyes of a Frog be before Sun rising bound to the sick party, and the Frog be let go again blind into the Water, they will drive away a tertian ague; as also that they will, being bound with the flesh of a Nightingale in the skin of a Hart, keep one alwaies watchfull without sleep. Also the ray of the fork fish being bound to the Navil, is said to make a woman have an easie travel, if it be taken from it alive, and that put into the Sea again. So they say the right eye of a Serpent being applyed, doth help the watering of the eyes, if the Serpent be let go alive. And there is a certain fish, or great Serpent called <hi>Myrus,</hi> whose eye, if it be pulled out, and bound to the forehead of the patient, is said to cure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation of the eyes, and that the eye of the fish grows a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and that he is taken blind that did not let the fish go. Also the teeth of all Serpents, being taken out whilest they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52070:38"/>
are alive, and hanged about the patient, are said to cure the quartane. So doth the tooth of a Mole taken out whilest she is alive, being afterwards let go, cure the tooth-ach: and Dogs will not bark at those that have the taile of a Weesel that is escaped. And <hi>Democritus</hi> relates that the tongue of a Chame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon, if it be taken from her alive, doth conduce to a good success in trials, and is profitable for women that are in travel, if it be about the outside of the house, for you must take heed that it be not brought into the house, because that would be most dangerous; Moreover there be some properties that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main after death: and of these the <hi>Platonists</hi> say, that they are things in which the <hi>Idea</hi> of the matter is less swallowed up, in these, even after death that which is immortall in them, doth not cease to work wonderfull things. So in the Hearbs, and Plants pulled asunder, and dryed, that vertue is quick, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative which was infused at first into them by the <hi>Idea.</hi> Thence it is, that as the Eagle all her life time doth overcome all other birds: so also her feathers after her death destroy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the feathers of all other birds. Upon the same account doth a Lyons skin destroy all other skins: and the skin of the Civet Cat destroyes the skin of the Panther: and the skin of a Wolf corrodes the skin of a Lamb: And some of these do not do it by way of a corporeall contract, but also sometimes by their very sound. So a drum made of the skin of a Wolf, makes a drum made of a Lamb skin not to sound. Also a drum made of the skin of the fish called Rotchet, drives away all creeping things, at what distance soever the sound of it is heard: and the strings of an instrument made of the guts of a Wolf, and being strained upon a Harp, or Lute with strings made of sheeps guts, will make no harmony.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>How inferiour things are subjected to superiour bodies, and how the bodies, the actions, and dispositions of men are ascribed to Stars, and Signes.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is manifest that all things inferiour are subject to the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and after a manner (as saith <hi>Proclus)</hi> they are one in the other, <hi>viz.</hi> in inferiour are superiour, and in superiour are inferiour: so in the Heaven are things Terrestiall, but as in their cause, and in a Celestiall manner; and in the Earth are things Celestiall, but after a Terrestiall manner, as in an effect. So we say that there be here certain things which are Solary, and certain which are Lunary, in which the Sun, and Moon make a strong impression of theirvertue. Whence it is that these kind of things receive more operations, and properties, like to those of the Stars, &amp; Signes which they are under: So we know that Solary things respect the heart, &amp; head, by reason that <hi>Leo</hi> is the house of the Sun, and <hi>Aries</hi> the exaltation of the Sun: so things under <hi>Mars</hi> are good for the head, and testicles, by reason of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Scorpio.</hi> Hence they whose senses faile, and heads ake by reason of drunkenness, if they put their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles into cold Water, or wash them with Vineger, find present help. But in reference to these it is necessary to know how mans body is distributed to Planets, &amp; Signes. Know therefore that according to the doctrine of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the Sun rules over the brain, heart, the thigh, the marrow, the right eye, and the spirit; also the tongue, the mouth, and the rest of the Organs of the senses, as well internall as externall; also the hands, feet, legs, nerves, and the power of imagination. That <hi>Mercury</hi> rules over the spleen, stomack, bladder, womb, and right ear, as also the faculty of the common sense. That <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> rules over the liver, and fleshy part of the stomack. That <hi>Jupiter</hi> over the belly, and navill, whence it is written by the Ancients, that the effigies of a navil was laid up in the temple of <hi>Jupiter Hammon.</hi> Also some attribute to him the ribs,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52070:39"/>
breast, bowels, blood, arms, and the right hand, and left ear, and the powers natural. And some set <hi>Mars</hi> over the blood, and veins, and kidnies the bag of the gall, the buttocks, the back, and motion of the sperm, and the irascible power. Again they set <hi>Venus</hi> over the kidnies, the testicles, the privities, the womb, the seed, and concupiscible power; as also the flesh, fat, belly, breast, navill, and all such parts as serve to venerall acts, also the <hi>Ossacrum,</hi> the back bone, and loins; as also the head, mouth, with which they give a kiss, as a token of love. Now the Moon, although she may challenge the whole body, and every member thereof according to the variety of the Signes: yet more particularly they ascribe to her the brain, lungs, marrow of the back bone, the stomack, the menstrues, and all other excrements, and the left eye, as also the power of increasing. But <hi>Hermes</hi> saith, That there are seven holes in the head of an Animall, distributed to the seven Planets, <hi>viz.</hi> the right ear to <hi>Saturne,</hi> the left to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the right nostrell to <hi>Mars,</hi> the left to <hi>Venus,</hi> the right eye to the <hi>Sun,</hi> the left to the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the mouth to <hi>Mercury.</hi> The severall Signes also of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> take care of their members. So <hi>Aries</hi> governs the head, and face, <hi>Taurus</hi> the neck, <hi>Gemini</hi> the arms, and shoulders, <hi>Cancer</hi> the breast, lungs, stomack, and armes, <hi>Leo</hi> heart, stomack, liver, and back, <hi>Virgo</hi> the bowels, and bottome of the stomack, <hi>Libra</hi> the kidnies, thighs, and buttocks, <hi>Scorpius</hi> the genitals, the privities, and womb, <hi>Sagittarius</hi> the thigh, and groins, <hi>Capricornus</hi> the knees, <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the legs and shins, <hi>Pisces</hi> the feet. And as the triplicities of these Signes answer one the other, and agree in Celestials, so also they agree in the members, which is sufficiently manifest by experience, because with the coldness of the feet, the belly, and breast are affected, which members answer the same tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; whence it is, if a medicine be applyed to the one, it helps the other, as by the warming of the feet, the pain of the belly ceaseth. Remember therefore this order, and know, that things which are under any one of the Planets, have a certain particular aspect, or inclination to those members that are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to that Planet, and especially to the houses, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altations
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52070:40"/>
thereof. For the rest of the dignities, as those tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and markes, and face are of litle account in this; upon this account therefore Piony, Balme, Clove-gilliflowers, Citron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils, sweet Majoram, Cynnamon, Saffron, Lignum Aloes, Frankincense, Amber, Musk, and Myrrh help the head, and heart; by reason of <hi>Sol, Aries,</hi> and <hi>Leo:</hi> so doth Rib-wort, the Hearb of <hi>Mars,</hi> help the head, and testicles by reason of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Scorpio:</hi> and so of the rest. Also all things under <hi>Saturne</hi> conduce to sadness, and melancholly; those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Jupiter</hi> to mirth, and honour; those under <hi>Mars</hi> to bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, contention, and anger; those under the <hi>Sun</hi> to glory; victory, and courage; those under <hi>Venus</hi> to love, lust, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence; those under <hi>Mercury</hi> to Eloquence; those under the <hi>Moon</hi> to a common life. Also all the actions, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of men are distributed according to the Planets. For <hi>Saturne</hi> governes old men, Monkes, melancholly men, and hid treasures; and those things which are obtained with long journies, and difficulty; but <hi>Jupiter,</hi> those that are Religious, Prelates, Kings, and Dukes, and such kind of gains that are got lawfully: <hi>Mars</hi> rules over Barbers, Chirurgeons, Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Sergents, Executioners, Butchers, all that make fires Bakers, Souldiers, who are every where called Matial men. Also do the other Stars signifie their office, as they are described in the books of Astrologers.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. <hi>How we shall know what Stars naturall things are under, and what things are under the Sun, which are called Solary.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw it is very hard to know, what Star, or Signe every thing is under: yet it is known through the imitation of their rayes, or motion, or figure of the superiours. Also some of them are known by their colours and odours, also some by the effects of their operations, answering to some Stars. So then Solary things, or things under the power of the Sun
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52070:40"/>
are, amongst Elements, the lucid flame; in the humours, the purer blood, and spirit of life; amongst tasts, that which is quick, mixed with sweetness. Amongst Metals, Gold by reason of its splendor, and its receiving that from the Sun which makes it cordiall. And amongst stones, they which resemble the rayes of the Sun by their golden sparklings, as doth the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering stone Aetites which hath power against the Falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sickness, and poisons: so also the stone, which is called the eye of the Sun, being of a figure like to the Apple of the eye, from the middle whereof shines forth a ray, it comforts the brain, and strengthens the sight; So the Carbuncle which shines by night, hath a vertue against all aiery, and vaporous poison: so the Chrysolite stone is of a light green colour, in which, when it is held against the Sun, there shines forth a golden Star; and this comforts those parts that serve for breathing, &amp; helps those that be Asthmaticall, and if it be bored through, and the hole filled with the Mane of an Asse, and bound to the left arme, it drives away idle imaginations, and melancholy fears, and puts away foolishness: So the stone called Iris, which is like Crystall in colour, being often found with six corners, when under some roof part of it is held against the rayes of the Sun, and the other part is held in the shadow, it gathers the rayes of the Sun into it self, which, whilest it sends them forth, by way of reflection, makes a Rain-bow appear on the opposite wall. Also the Stone Heliotropion green like the Jasper, or Emrald, beset with red specks, makes a man constant, renowned, and famous, also it conduceth to long life: And the vertue of it indeed is most wonderfull upon the beams of the Sun, which it is said to turn into blood <hi>(e. i.)</hi> to appear of the colour of blood, as if the Sun were eclypsed, <hi>viz.</hi> When it is joyned to the juice of an Hearb of the same name, and be put into a vessell full of Water: There is also another vertue of it more wonderfull, and that is upon the eyes of men, whose sight it doth so dim, and dazel, that it doth not suffer him that carries it to see it, &amp; this it doth not do without the help of the Hearb of the said name, which also is called Heliotropium, <hi>(e. i.)</hi> following the Sun. These vertues doth <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52070:41"/>
and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> confirm in their writings. The Hyacinth also hath a vertue from the Sun against poisons, and pestiferous vapours; it makes him that carries it to be safe, and acceptable; it conduceth also to riches, and wit, it strengthens the hears; being held in the mouth, it doth wonderfully cheer up the mind. Also there is the stone Pyrophylus, of a red mixture, which <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> saith <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> makes mention of in one of his Epistles unto <hi>Octavius Augustus,</hi> saying, that there is a certain poison so wonderfull cold, which preserves the heart of man being taken out from burning, so that if for any time it be put into the Fire, it is turned into a stone, and this is that stone which is called Pyrophylus, from the fire. It hath a wonderfull vertue against poison, and it makes him that carries it, to be renowned and dreadfull to his enemies. But above all, that stone is most Solary, which <hi>Apollonius</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have found, and is called Pantaura, which draws o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stones to it, as the Loadstone doth Iron, most powerfull against all poisons; it is called by some Pantherus, because it is spotted like the beast called the Panther. It is therefore also called Pantochras, because it contains all colours. <hi>Aaron</hi> cals it Evanthum. There are also other Solary stones, as the Topa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius, Chrysopassus, the Rubine, and Balagius. So also is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripigmentum, and things of a golden colour, and very lucid. Amongst plants also and trees, those are Solary, which turn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twards the Sun, as the Marygold, and those which fold in their leaves when the Sun is neer upon setting, but when it riseth unfold their leaves by little and little. The Lote-tree also is Solary, as is manifest by the figure of the fruit &amp; leaves. So also Piony, Sallendine, Balme, Ginger, Gentian, Dittany, &amp; Vervin which is of use in prophecying, and expiations, as also driving away evill spitits. The Bay-tree also is consecrated to <hi>Phoebus,</hi> so is the Cedar the Palm tree the ash, the Ivie, and Vine, and whatsoever repell poisons, and lightnings, and those things which never fear the extremities of the Winter. Solary also are Mint, Mastick, Zedoary, Saffron, Balsome, Amber, Musk, Yellow-honey, Lignum aloes, Cloves, Cinnamon, Calamus, Aromaticus, Pepper, Frankincense, sweet Majoram, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52070:41"/>
Libanotis, which <hi>Orpheus</hi> cals the sweet perfume of the Sun. Amongst Animals those are Solary which are magnanimous, couragious, ambitious of victory, and renown: as the Lyon, King of beasts, the Crocodile, the spotted Wolf, the Ram, the Boar, the Bull, King of the herd, which was by the Egyptians at Heliopolis dedicated to the Sun, which they call Verites; and an Ox was consecrated to <hi>Apis</hi> in Memphi, and in Herminthus a Bull by the name of <hi>Pathis.</hi> The Wolf also was consecrated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Latona.</hi> Also the beast called Baboon is Solary, which twelve times in a day, <hi>viz.</hi> every hour barks, and in time of Equinoctium pisseth twelve times every hour: the same also it doth in the night, whence the Egyptians did Engrave him upon their Fountains. Also amongst birds these are Solary, the Phoenix, being but one of that kind, and the Eagle, the Queen of birds, also the Uultur, the Swan, and those which sing at the rising Sun, and as it were calling upon it to rise, as the Cock, Crow, also the Hawk, which because in the Divinity of the Egyptians is an emblem of the spirit, and light, is by Porphyrius reckoned amongst the Solary birds. Moreover, all such things as have some resemblence of the works of the Sun, as Worms shining in the night, and the Betle, which is a creature that lies under Cow-dung, also according to <hi>Appious</hi> interpretation, such whose eyes are changed according to the course of the Sun, are accounted Solary, and those things which come of them. And amongst fish, the Sea Calf is chiefly Solary, who doth resist lightning, also shell fish, and the fish called <hi>Pulmo,</hi> both which shine in the night, and the fish called Stella for his parching heat, and the fish called Strombi, that follow their King, and Margari, which also have a King, and being dryed, are hardened into a stone of a golden colour.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THese things are Lunary, amongst the Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earth then the Water, as well that of the Sea, as of the Rivers, and all moist things, as the moisture of Trees, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, especially they which are White, as the Whites of Eggs, fat, sweat, flegme, and the superfluities of bodies. Amongst tasts, salt, and insipid: amongst Metals, Silver; amongst stones, Crystall, the Silver Marcasite, and all those stones that are White, and Green. Also the stone Selenites <hi>(e. i.)</hi> Lunary, shining from a white body, with a yellow brightness, imitating the motion of the Moon having in it the figure of the Moon which daily increaseth, or decreaseth as doth the Moon. Also Pearls, which are generated in shels of fishes from the droppings of Water, also the Berill. Amongst Plants and Trees, these are Lunary, as the Selenotropion, which turns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Moon, as doth the Heliotropion towards the Sun, and the Palme tree sends forth a bough at every rising of the Moon; Hyssope also, and Rosemary, Agnus Castu, and the Olive-tree, are Lunary. Also the Hearb Chinosta, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, and decreaseth with the Moon, <hi>viz.</hi> in substance and number of leaves, not only in Sap, and vertue, which indeed is in some sort common to all Plants, except Onions, which are under the influence of <hi>Mars,</hi> which have contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; As amongst flying things the Saturnine bird, called a Quaile is a great enemy to the Moon and Sun. Lunary Animals are such as delight to be in mans company, and such as do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally excell in love, or hatred, as all kinds of Dogs: The Chameleon also is Lunary, which alwaies assumes a colour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of the colour of the object: as the Moon changeth her nature according to the variety of the Signe which it is found in. Lunary also are Swine, Hinds, Goats, and all Animals whatsoever, that observe, and imitate the motion of the Moon: As the Baboon, and Panther, which is said to have a spot upon her shoulder like the Moon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52070:42"/>
into a roundness, and having horns that bend inwards. Cats also are Lunary, whose eyes become greater or less, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the course of the Moon: and those things which are of like nature, as Menstruous blood, of which are made wonderfull strange things by Magicians; The Civet-Cat also changing her sex, being obnoxious to divers Sorceries, and all Animals that live in water as well as on land: as Otters, and such as prey upon fish. Also all Monstrous beasts, such as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manifest seed are equivocally generated, as Mice, which sometimes are generated by Coition, sometimes of the putrefaction of the Earth. Amongst fowle, Geese, Ducks, Didoppers, and all kind of watery fowl as prey upon fish, as the Heron, and those that are equivocally produced, as Wasps of the Carkases of horses: Bees of the putrefaction of Cows, small Flies of putrefied wine, and Betles of the flesh of Asses; but most Lunary of all is the two-horned Betle, horned after the manner of a Bull: which digs under Cow-dung, and there remaines for the space of twenty eight daies, in which time the Moon measures the whole <hi>Zodiack</hi> and in the twenty ninth day, when it thinks there will be a conjunction of their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it opens the dung and casts it into Water, from whence then come Betles. Amongst fish these are Lunary, Aelurus, whose eyes are changed according to the course of the Moon, and whatsoever observe the motion of the Moon, as the Tortoise, the Echeneis, the Crab, Oisters, Cockles, and Frogs.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MOreover the whole Orb of the Earth is distributed by Kingdoms, and Provinces to the Planets, and Signes: For Macedonia, Thracia, Illyria, India, Arriana, Gordiana, (many of which countries are in the lesser Asia) are under <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> with <hi>Capricorn;</hi> but with <hi>Aquarius,</hi> under him are the Sauromatian Country, Oxiana, Sogdiana, Arabia, Phazania, Media, Aethiopia, which Countries for the most part belong to the more inward Asia. Under <hi>Jupiter</hi> with <hi>Sagittarius</hi> are Tuscana, Celtica, Spaine, and happy Arabia: under him with <hi>Pisces,</hi> are Lycia, Lydia, Cilicia, Pamphylia, Paphlagonia, Nasamonia, and Lybia. <hi>Mars</hi> with <hi>Aries</hi> governs Britany, France, Germany, Bastarnia, the lower parts of Syria, Idumea, and Judea: with <hi>Scorpio,</hi> he rules Syria, Comagena, Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Metagonium, Mauritania, and Getulia. The <hi>Sun</hi> with <hi>Leo</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns Italy, Apulia, Sicilia, Phenicia, Chaldea, &amp; the Orchenians. <hi>Venus</hi> with <hi>Taurus</hi> governs the Isles Cyclades, the Seas of litle Asia, Cyprus, Parthia, Media, Persia: but with <hi>Libra</hi> she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the people of the Island Bractia, of Caspia, of Seres, of Thebais, of Oasis, and of Troglodys. <hi>Mercury</hi> with <hi>Gemini,</hi> rules Hircania, Armenia, Mantiana, Cyrenaica, Marmarica, and the lower Egypt: but with <hi>Virgo,</hi> Greece, Achaia, Creta, Babylon, Mesopotamia, Assyria, and Ela, whence they of that place are in Scripture called Elamites. The <hi>Moon</hi> with <hi>Cancer</hi> governs Bithivia, Phrygia, Colchica, Numidia A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, Carthage, and all Carchedonia. These we have in this manner gathered from <hi>Ptolomies</hi> opinion, to which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the writings of other Astrologers many more may be added. But he which knows how to compare these divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Provinces according to the divisions of the Stars, with the Ministery of the ruling-Intelligencies, and blessings of the Tribes of Israel, the lots of the Apostles, and typicall seales of the sacred Scripture, shall be able to obtain great and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall oracles concerning every Region, of things to come.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe like consideration is to be had in all things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the figures of the fixed Stars: so they will have the Terrestiall Ram to be under the rule of the Celestiall <hi>Aries:</hi> and the Terrestiall Bull, and Ox to be under the Celestiall <hi>Taurus.</hi> So also that <hi>Cancer</hi> should rule over Crabs, and <hi>Leo</hi> over Lyons: <hi>Virgo</hi> over Virgins, and <hi>Scorpio</hi> over Scorpions. <hi>Capricorn</hi> over Goats. <hi>Sagittarius</hi> over Horses, and <hi>Pisces</hi> over Fishes. Also the Celestiall <hi>Ursa</hi> over Bears, <hi>Hydra</hi> over Serpents, and the Dog-star over Dogs, and so of the rest. Now <hi>Apuleius</hi> distributes certain and peculiar Hearbs to the Signes, and Planets, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Aries</hi> the Hearb Sange, to <hi>Taurus</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine that grows straight, to <hi>Gemini</hi> Vervine that growes bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to <hi>Cancer</hi> Comfrey, to <hi>Leo</hi> Sowbread, to <hi>Virgo</hi> Calamint, to <hi>Libra</hi> Mug-wort, to <hi>Scorpio</hi> Scorpion-grass, to <hi>Sagittarius</hi> Pimpernell, to <hi>Capricorn</hi> the Dock, to <hi>Aquarius</hi> Dragon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, to <hi>Pisces</hi> Hart-wort. And to the Planets these, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Saturne</hi> Sen-green, to <hi>Jupiter</hi> Agrimony, to <hi>Mars</hi> Sulphur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, to the <hi>Sun</hi> Marygold, to <hi>Venus</hi> Wound-wort, to <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> Mulleine, to the <hi>Moon,</hi> Peony. But <hi>Hermes,</hi> whom <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> follows, distributes to the Planets these, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Saturne</hi> the Daffodill, to <hi>Jupiter</hi> Henbane, to <hi>Mars</hi> Rib-wort, to the <hi>Sun</hi> Knotgrass, to <hi>Venus</hi> Vervine, to <hi>Mercury</hi> Cinquefoile, to the <hi>Moon,</hi> Goos foot. We also know by experience that Asparagus is under <hi>Aries,</hi> and Garden-basill under <hi>Scorpio;</hi> For of the shavings of Rams horn sowed, comes forth Aspara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, and Garden Basill rubbed betwixt two stones, produceth Scorpions. Moreover I will according to the doctrine of <hi>Hermes,</hi> and <hi>Thebit</hi> reckon up some of the more eminent Stars, whereof the first is called the head of <hi>Algol,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst stones, rules over the Diamond, amongst Plants, black Hellebor, and Mugwort. The second are the Pleiades, or seven
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52070:47"/>
Stars, which amongst stones, rule over Crystall, and the stone Diodocus; amongst Plants, the Hearb Diacedon, and Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, and Fennill: and amongst Metals, Quick-silver. The third is the Star <hi>Aldeboran,</hi> which hath under it, amongst stones, the Carbuncle, and Ruby: amongst Plants, the Milky Thistle, and Matry-silva. The fourth is called the Goat-Star, which rules, amongst stones, the Saphir, amongst Plants, Hore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound, Mint, Mugwort, and Mandrake. The fifth is called the great Dog-star, which amongst stones, rules over the Berill: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Plants, Savin, Mugwort, and Dragonwort: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Animals the tongue of a Snake. The sixth is called the lesser Dog-star, and amongst stones, rules over Achates: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Plants the Flowers of Marigold, and Penyroial. The seventh is called the Heart of the Lyon, which amongst stones, rules over the Granate; amongst Plants, Sallendine, Mugwort, and Mastick. The eighth is the Taile of the lesser Bear, which amongst stones rules over the Loadstone, amongst Hearbs, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory, whose leaves, and Flowers turn towards the North, also Mugwort, and the flowers of Perwinckle; and amongst Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals the tooth of a Wolf. The ninth is called the Wing of the Crow, under which, amongst stones, are such stones as are of the Colour of the black Onyx stone: amongst Plants the Bur. Quadraginus, Henbane, and Comfrey; and amongst Animals the tongue of a Frog. The tenth is called Spica, which hath under it, amongst stones, the Emrald: amongst Plants, Sage, Trifoile, Perwinkle, Mugwort, and Mandrake. The eleventh is called Alchamech, which amongst stones, rules over the Jas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: amongst Plants the Plantain. The twelfth is called El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheia, under this, amongst stones, is the Topaze; amongst Plants, Rosemary, Trifoile, and Ivy. The thirteenth is called the Heart of the Scorpion, under which, amongst stones, is the Sardonius, and Amythist; amongst Plants long Aristolochy, and Saffron. The fourteenth is the Falling Vultur, under which, amongst stones, is the Chrysolite: amongst Plants Succo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Fumitary. The fifteenth is the Taile of Capricorn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which, amongst stones, is the Chalcedone: amongst Plants, Majoram, Mugwort, and Nip, and the root of Mandrake.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52070:47"/>
Moreover this we must know, that every stone, or Plant, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall, or any other thing is not governed by one Star alone, but many of them receive influence, not separated, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, from many Stars. So amongst stones, the Chalcedony is under <hi>Saturne,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> together with the Taile of <hi>Scorpion,</hi> and <hi>Capricorn.</hi> The Saphir under <hi>Jupiter, Saturne,</hi> and the Star Alhajoth; Tutia is under <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> the Emrald under <hi>Jupiter, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the Star Spica. The Amethyst, as saith <hi>Hermes,</hi> is under <hi>Mars, Jupiter,</hi> and the Heart of the <hi>Scorpion.</hi> The Jasper which is of diverskinds is under <hi>Mars, Jupiter,</hi> and the Star Alchamech, the Chrysolite is under the <hi>Sun, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> as also under the Star which is called the falling Vultur; the Topaze under the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the Star Elpheia: the Diamond under <hi>Mars,</hi> and the Head of Algol. In like manner amongst Vegetables, the Hearb Dragon is under <hi>Saturne,</hi> and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall Dragon, Mastick, and Mints, are under <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the <hi>Sun;</hi> but Mastick is also under the Heart of the Lyon, and Mint under the Goat star: Hellebor is dedicated to <hi>Mars,</hi> and the Head of Algol, Mosse, and Sanders, to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Venus:</hi> Coriander to <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Saturne.</hi> Amongst Animals, the Sea Calf is under the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter;</hi> The Fox, and Ape under <hi>Saturne,</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> and Domesticall Dogs under <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> And thus we have shewed more things in these inferiours, by their superiours.</p>

               <p>ALl Stars have their peculiar Natures, properties, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, the Seals and Characters whereof they produce through their rayes even in these inferiour things, <hi>viz.</hi> in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in Stones, in Plants, in Animals, and their members, whence every thing receives from an harmonious disposition, and from its Star shining upon it, some particular Seal, or
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52070:48"/>
Character stampt upon it, which is the significator of that Star, or harmony, conteining in it a peculiar vertue differing from other vertues of the same matter, both generically, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically, and numerically. Every thing therefore hath its Character pressed upon it by its Star for some peculiar effect, especially by that Star which doth principally govern it: And these Characters contain, and retain in them the peculiar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, vertues, and roots of their Stars, and produce the like operations upon other things, on which they are reflected, and stir up, and help the influencies of their Stars, whether they be Planets, or fixed Stars, and figures, and Celestiall signes, <hi>viz.</hi> as oft as they shall be made in a fit matter, and in their due, and accustomed times. Which ancient wise men considering, such as laboured much in the finding out of the occult properties of things, did set down in writing the images of the Stars, their figures, Seals, Marks, Characters, such as nature her self did describe by the rayes of the Stars, in these inferiour bodies, some in stones, some in Plants, and joynts, and knots of boughs and some in divers members of Animals. For the Bay-tree, the Lote-tree, the Marygold are Solary Plants, and in their roots and knots being cut off, shew the Characters of the Sun, so also in the bone, and shoulderblades in Animals: whence there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose a spatulary kind of divining <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by the shoulder-blades and in stones, and stony things the Characters, and images of Celestiall things are often found. But seeing that in so great a diversity of things there is not a traditionall knowledge, only in a few things, which humane understanding is able to reach: Therefore leaving those things which are to be found out in Plants, and Stones, and other things, as also, in the members of divers Animals, we shall limit our selves to mans nature on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which seeing it is the compleatest image of the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, containing in it self the whole heavenly harmony, will without all doubt abundantly afford us the Seals, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of all the Stars, and Celestiall influencies, and those as the more efficacious, which are less differing from the Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all nature. But as the number of the Stars is known to God alone, so also their effects, and Seals upon these inferiour
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52070:48"/>
things: wherefore no humane intellect is able to attain to the knowledge of them. Whence very few of those things became known to us, which the ancient Philosophers, &amp; Chyromancers attained to, partly by reason, and partly by experience, and there be many things yet ly hid in the treasury of nature. We shall here in this place note some few Seals, and Characters of the Planets, such as the ancient Chyromancers knew in the hands of men. These doth <hi>Julian</hi> call sacred, and divine letters, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by them according to the holy Scripture is the life of men writ in their hands. And there are in all Nations, and Languages alwaies the same, and like to them, and permanent; to which were added, and found out afterwards many more, as by the ancient, so by latter Chyromancers. And they that would know them must have recourse to their Volumes. It is sufficient here to shew from whence the Characters of Nature have their originall, and in what things they are to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after.</p>

               </head>
               <p>NOw if thou desirest to receive vertue from any part of the World, or from any Star, thou shalt (those things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing used which belong to this Star) come under its peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sluence, as Wood is fit to receive Flame, by reason of Sulphur, Pitch, and Oile. Nevertheless when thou dost to any one species of things, or individual, rightly apply many things, which are things of the same subject scattered amongst themselves, conformable to the same <hi>Idea,</hi> and Star, presently by this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so opportunely fitted, a singular gift is infused by the <hi>Idea,</hi> by means of the soul of the world. I say opportunely fitted, <hi>viz.</hi> under a harmony like to the harmony, which did infuse a certain vertue into the matter. For although things have some vertues, such as we speak of, yet those vertues do so ly hid that there is seldom any effect produced by them: but as in a grain of Mustard seed bruised, the sharpness which lay hid is stirred up: and as the heat of the fire doth make letters apparently seen, which before could not be read, that were writ with the juice of an Onion or milk: and letters wrote upon a stone with the fat of a Goat, and altogether unperceived, when the stone is put into Vineger, appear and shew themselves. And as a blow with a stick stirs up the madness of a Dog, which before lay asleep, so doth the Celestiall harmony disclose vertues ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the water, stirs them up strengtheneth them, and makes them manifest, and as I may so say, produceth that into Act, which before was only in power, when things are rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to it in a Celestiall season. As for example; If thou dest desire to attract vertue from the Sun, and to seek those things that are Solary, amongst Vegetables, Plants, Metals, Stones, and Animals, these things are to be used, and taken chiefly, which in a Solary order are higher. For these are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52070:50"/>
more available: So thou shalt draw a singular gift from the Sun through the beams thereof, being seasonably received to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and through the spirit of the world.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXV. <hi>Of the Mixtions of naturall things one with another, and their benefit.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is most evident, that in the inferiour nature all the powers of superiour bodies are not found comprehended in any one thing, but are dispersed through many kinds of things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us: as there are many Solary things, whereof every one doth not contain all the vertues of the Sun: but some have some properties from the Sun, and others othersome. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is sometimes necessary that there be mixtions in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that if a hundred or a thousand vertues of the Sun were dispersed through so many Plants, Animals, &amp; the like, we may gather all these together, and bring them into one form, in which we shall see all the said vertues, being united, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Now there is a two fold vertue in commixtion, one, <hi>viz.</hi> which was first planted in its parts, and is Celestiall, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is obtained by a certain, and artificiall mixtion of things mixt amongst themselves, and of the mixtions of them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to certain proportions, such as agree with the heaven under a certain Constellation; And this vertue descends by a certain likeness, and aptness that is in things amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves towards their superiours, and as much as the following do by degrees correspond with them that go before, where the patient is fitly applyed to its agent. So from a certain composition of Hearbs. vapours, and such like, made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to naturall Philosophy, and Astronomy, there results a certain common form, endowed with many gifts of the Stars: as in the honey of Bees, that which is gathered out of the juice of innumerable Flowers, and brought into one form, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52070:50"/>
the vertue of all, by a kind of divine, and admirable art of the Bees. Yet this is not to be less wondred at which <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus Giudius</hi> reports of an artificiall kind of honey, which a certain Nation of Gyants in Lybia knew to make out of Flowers, and that very good, and not far inferiour to that of the Bees. For every mixtion, which consists of many severall things, is then most perfect, when it is so firmly compacted on all parts, that it becomes one, is every where firm to it self, and can hardly be dissipated: as we sometimes see stones, and divers bodies to be by a certain naturall power congluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and united, that they seem to be wholly onething: as we see two trees by graffing to become one, also Oisters with stones by a certain occult vertue of nature, and there have been seen some Animals which have been turned into stones, and so united with the substance of the stone, that they seem to make one body, and that also homogeneous. So the tree Ebeny is one while wood, and another while stone. When therefore any one makes a mixtion of many matters under the Celestiall influencies, then the variety of Celestiall actions on one hand, and of naturall powers on the other hand, being joyned together doth indeed cause wonderfull things, by ointments, by collyries, by fumes, and such like, which <hi>viz.</hi> are read in the book of <hi>Chiramis, Archyta, Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi> and <hi>Hermes,</hi> who is named <hi>Alchorat,</hi> and of many others.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVI. <hi>Of the Union of mixt things, and the introduction of a more noble form, and the Senses of life.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MOreover we must know, that by how much the more noble the form of any thing is, by so much the more prone, and apt it is to receive, and powerfull to act. Then the vertues of things do then become wonderfull, <hi>viz.</hi> when they are put to matters that are mixed, and prepared in fit sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to make them alive, by procuring life for them from the Stars, as also a sensible soul, as a more noble form. For there is so great a power in prepared matters which we see do then receive life, when a perfect mixtion of qualities seems to break the former contrariety. For so much the more perfect life things receive, by how much their temper is more remote from contrariety. Now the Heaven, as a prevalent cause doth from the beginning of every thing to be generated by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and perfect digestion of the matter, together with life, bestows Celestiall influences, and wonderfull gifts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Capacity that is in that life, and sensible soul to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more noble, and sublime vertues. For the Celestiall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue doth otherwise lye asleep, as Sulphur kept from Flame, but in living bodies it doth alwaies burn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as kindled Sulphur, then by its vapour it fils all the places that are next to it; so certain wonderfull works are wrought, such as are read in the book of <hi>Nemith,</hi> which is tituled a Book of the Laws of <hi>Pluto,</hi> because such kind of monstrous generations are not produced according to the Laws of Nature. For we know that of Worms are generated Gnats, of a Horse Waspes, of a Calf, and Ox Bees, of a Crab, his legs being taken of, and he buried in the ground, a Scorpion; of a Duck dryed into powder, and put into Water, are generated Frogs; but if it be baked in a Pie, and cut into pieces, and put into a moist place under the ground, Toads are generated of it: of the Hearb Garden Basill bruised betwixt two stones, are generated Scorpions, and of the hairs of a menstruous Woman put under dung, are

bred Serpents; and the hair of a Horse taile put into Water, receiveth life, and is turned into a pernicious Worm. And there is an art wherewith by a Hen sitting upon Eggs may be generated a form like to a man, which I have seen &amp; knew how to make, which Magicians say hath in it wonderfull vertues, and this they call the true Mandrake. You must therefore know which, and what kind of matters are either of nature, or art, begun or perfected, or compounded of more things, and what Celestiall influencies they are able to receive. For a Congruity of naturall things is sufficient for the receiving of influcence from Celestiall; because when nothing doth hinder the Celestials to send forth their lights upon inferiours, they suffer no matter to be destitute of their vertue. Wherefore as much matter as is perfect, and pure, is not unfit to receive the Celestiall influence. For that is the binding and continuity of the matter to the soul of the world, which doth daily flow in upon things naturall, and all things which nature hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, that it is impossible that a prepared matter should not receive life, or a more noble form.</p>

                  <hi>PLatonists,</hi> together with <hi>Hermes,</hi> say, and <hi>Jarchus Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> and the Mecubals of the Hebrews confess, that all sublunary things are subject to generation, and corruption, and that also there are the same things in the Celestiall world, but after a Celestiall manner, as also in the intellectuall world, but in a far more perfect, and better fashion, and manner, but in the most perfect manner of all in the examplary. And after this course, that every inferiour should in its kind answer its superiour, and through this the supream it self, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from heaven that Celestiall power which they call the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52070:52"/>
quintessence, or the spirit of the world, or the middle nature, and from the intellectuall world a spirituall and enlivening vertue transcending all qualities whatsoever, and lastly from the exemplary or originall world, through the mediation of the other, according to their degree receive the originall power of the whole perfection. Hence every thing may be aptly reduced from these inferiours to the Stars, from the Stars to their Intelligencies, and from thence to the first cause it self; from the series, and order whereof whole Magick, and all occult Philosophy flowes: For every day some naturall thing is drawn by art, and some divine thing drawn by nature, which the Egyptians seeing, called Nature a Magicianess, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the very Magicall power it self, in the attracting of like by like, and of sutable things by sutable. Now such kind of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions by the mutuall correspondency of things amongst themselves, of superiours with inferiours, the Grecians called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So the earth agrees with cold water, the water with moist Aire, the Aire with Fire, the Fire with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in water; neither is Fire mixed with water, but by Aire, nor the Aire with the Earth, but by water. So neither is the soul united to the body, but by the spirit, nor the undestand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the spirit but by the soul. So we see when nature hath framed the body of the infant, by this very preparative she presently fetcheth the spirit from the Universe. This spirit is the instrument to obtain of God the understanding, and mind in the soul, and body, as in wood the dryness is fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive oile, and the oile being imbibed is food for the Fire, the Fire is the vehiculum of light. By these examples you see how by some certain naturall, and artificiall preparations, we are in a capacity to receive certain Celestiall gifts from above. For stones, and Metals have a correspondency with Hearbs, Hearbs with Animals, Animals with the Heavens, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens with Intelligencies and those with divine properties, and attributes, and with God himself, after whose image, and likness all things are created. Now the first Image of God is the world, of the world, man, of man, beasts of beasts, the Zeophyton <hi>(i. e.)</hi> half Aniamll, and half Plant; of Zeophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52070:52"/>
plants, of plants, metals, of metals, stones. And again in things spirituall, the Plant agrees with a bruit in Vegetation, a bruit with a man in sense, man with an Angel in understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Angell with God in immortality. Divinity is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the mind, the mind to the intellect, the intellect to the intention, the intention to the imagination, the imagination to the senses, the senses at last to things. For this is the band, and continuity of nature, that all superiour vertue doth flow through every inferiour with a long, and continued series, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persing its rayes even to the very last things; and inferiours through their superiours, come to the very supream of all. For so inferiours are successively joyned to their superiours, that there proceeds an influence from their head, the first cause, as a certain string stretched out, to the lowermost things of all, of which string if one end be touched, the whole doth presently shake, and such a touch doth sound to the other end, and at the motion of the inferiour, the superiour also is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to which the other doth answer, as strings in a Lute well tuned.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MAgicians teach that Celestial gifts may through inferiors being conformable to superiors be drawn down by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune influencies of the Heaven; and so also by these Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, the Celestial Angels, as they are servants of the Stars, may be procured, and conveyed to us. <hi>Jamblichus, Proclus,</hi> and <hi>Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> with the whole School of <hi>Platonists</hi> confirm, that not only Celestiall, and vitall, but also certain Intellectuall, Angelicall, and divine gifts may be received from above by some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain matters, having a naturall power of divinity <hi>(i. e.)</hi> which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52070:53"/>
have a naturall correspondency with the superiors, being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, and opportunely gathered together according to the rules of Naturall Philosophy, and Astronomy: And <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Trismegistus</hi> writes, that an Image rightly made of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proper things, appropriated to any one certain Angel, will presently be animated by that Angel. Of the same also <hi>Austin</hi> makes mention in his eighth book <hi>De Civitate Dei.</hi> For this is the harmony of the world, that things supercelestiall be drawn down by the Celestiall, and super-naturall by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, because there is one operative vertue that is diffused through all kinds of things, by which vertue indeed, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest things are produced out of occult causes; so a Magician doth make use of things manifest, to draw forth things that are occult, <hi>viz.</hi> through the rays of the Stars, through fumes, lights, sounds, and naturall things, which are agreeable to Celestiall: in which, besides corporeall qualities, there is a kind of reason, sense, and harmony, and incorporeall, and divine measures, and orders. So we read that the Ancients were wont often to receive some divine, and wonderfull thing by certain naturall things: so the stone that is bred in the Apple of the eye of a Civet Cat, held under the tongue of a man, is said to make him to divine, or prophesie: The same is Selenites, the Moon stone reported to do, so they say that the Images of Gods may be called up by the stone called Anchitis, and that the Ghosts of the dead may be, being called up, kept up by the stone Synochitis. The like doth the Hearb Aglauphotis do, which is called Marmorites, growing upon the Marbles of Arabia, as saith <hi>Pliny,</hi> and the which Magicians use. Also there is an Hearb called Rheangelida, which Magicians drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of can prophesie. Moreover there are some Hearbs by which the dead are raised to life; whence <hi>Xanthus</hi> the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian tels, that with a certain Hrarb called Balus, a young Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon being killed, was made alive again, also that by the same a certain man of <hi>Tillum,</hi> whom a Dragon killed, was restored to life: and <hi>Juba</hi> reports, that in Arabia a certain man was by a certain Hearb restored to life. But whether or no any such things can be done indeed upon man by the vertue of Hearbs,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52070:53"/>
or any other naturall thing, we shall discourse in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter. Now it is certain, and manifest that such things can be done upon other animals. So if flies, that are drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be put into warm ashes, they revive. And Bees being drowned, do in like manner recover life in the juice of the hearb Nip; and Eels being dead for want of water, if with their whole bodies they be put under mud in vineger, and the blood of a Vultur being put to them, will all of them in a few dayes recover life. They say that if the fish Echeneis be cut into peices, and cast into the sea, the parts will within a little time come together, and live. Also we know that the Pellican doth restore her yong to life, being klled, with her own blood.</p>

               <p>NO man is ignorant that evill spirits, by evill, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Arts may be raised up as <hi>Psellus</hi> saith Sorcerers are wont to do, whom most detestable, and abominable filthiness did follow, and accompany, such as were in times past in the sacrifices of <hi>Priapus,</hi> and in the worship of the <hi>Idoll</hi> which was called <hi>Panor,</hi> to whom they did sacrifice with their privy members uncovered.

By these, and such as these evill spirits are raised. As a wicked spirit spake once to <hi>Iohn,</hi> of one <hi>Cynops</hi> a Sorcerer; all the power, saith he, of Satan dwells there, and he is entred into a confederacy with all the principalities together, and likewise we, with him, and <hi>Cynops</hi> obeys us, and we again obey him.

a pure minde, secret prayers, devout humiliation, and the like. Let no man therefore doubt that in like manner by some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain matters of the world, the Gods of the world may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by us, or at least the ministring spirits, or servants of these Gods, and as <hi>Mercurius</hi> saith, the airy spirits, not supercele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall, much less higher. So we read that the antient Priests made statues, and images, foretelling things to come, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into them the spirits of the stars, which were not kept there by constraint in some certain matters, but rejoycing in them, <hi>viz.</hi> as acknowledging such kinds of matter to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to them, they do alwaies, and willingly abide in them, and speak, and do wonderfull things by them: no otherwise then evill spirits are wont to do, when they possess mens bodies.</p>

               <p>WEE have spoken concerning the vertues, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull efficacy of naturall things. It remains now that we understand a thing of great wonderment: and it is a binding of men into love, or hatred, sickness or health, and such like. Also the binding of thieves, and robbers, that they cannot steale in any place; the binding of Merchants, that they cannot buy, or sell in any place; the binding of an army, that they cannot pass over any bound; the binding of ships, that no winds, though never so strong, shall be able to carry them out of the Haven. Also the binding of a mill, that it can by no force whatsoever be turned round: The binding of a Cisterne, or fountain, that the water cannot be drawn up out of them: The binding of the ground, that it cannot bring forth fruit: The binding of any place, that nothing can be built upon it: The binding of fire, that though it be never so strong, can burn no combustible thing that is put to it. Also
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52070:54"/>
the bindings of lightnings, and tempests, that they shall do no hurt. Also the binding of dogs, that they cannot bark. Also the binding of birds, and wild beasts, that they shall not be able to fly, or run away. And such like as these, which are scarce credible, yet often known by experience. Now there are such kind of bindings as these made by Sorceries, Collyries, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, love potions, by binding to, and hanging up of things, by rings, by charmes, by strong imaginations, and passions, by images, and characters, by inchantments, and imprecations, by lights, by sound, by numbers, by words, and names, invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, sacrifices, by swearing, conjuring, consecrations, devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by divers superstitions, and observations, and such like.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52070:55"/>
with divers odours to be burnt, then presently with an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable power of Magick, and blind force of the Gods, the bodies of those whose haires did smoke, and crash, assume the spirit of a man, and feel, and hear, and walk, and come whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the stink of their haire led them, and insteed of <hi>Baeotius</hi> the young man, come skipping, and leaping with joy, and love into the house. <hi>Austin</hi> also reports, that he heard of some women Sorceresses, that were so versed in these kinds of arts, that by giving cheese to men, they could presently turn them into working cattell, and the work being done, restored them into men again.</p>

               <p>NOw I will shew you what some of the Sorceries are, that by the example of these there may be a way opened for the consideration of the whole subject of them. Of these therefore the first is menstruous bloud, which, how much power it hath in Sorcery, we will now consider; for, as they say, if it comes over new wine, it makes it soure, and if it doth but touch the Vine it spoyles it for ever, and by its very touch it makes all Plants, and Trees barren, and they that be newly set, to dye; it burns up all the hearbs in the garden, and makes fruit fall off from the Trees, it darkens the brightness of a looking glass, dulls the edges of knives, and razors, dims the beauty of Ivory, and it makes Iron presently rusty, it makes brass rust, and smell very strong: it makes dogs mad, if they do but tast of it, and if they being thus mad shall bite any one, that wound is incurable: it kils whole hives of Bees, and drives them from the hives that are but touched with it: it makes linnen black that are boyled, it makes Mares cast their foal if they do but touch it, and makes women miscarry if they be but smeared with it: it makes Asses barren as long as they eat of the corn that hath been touched with it. The ashes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52070:56"/>
of menstruous clothes, if they be cast upon purple garments that are to be washed, change the colour of them, and takes away colours from flowers. They say that it drives away ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and quartane Agues, if it be put into the wooll of a black Ram, and tyed up in a silver bracelet, as also if the soles of the patients feet be noynted therewith, and especially if it be done by the woman her self the patients not knowing of it; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it cures the fits of the falling sickness. But most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it cures them that are affraid of water, or drink after they are bitten with a mad dog, if onely a menstruuos cloth be put under the cup. Besides, they report, that if menstruous women shall walk naked about the standing corn, they make all cankars, worms, beetles, flyes, and all hurtfull things fall off from the corn: but they must take heed that they do it before Sun rising, or else they will make the corn to wither. Also they say they are able to expell hail, tempests, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, more of which <hi>Pliny</hi> makes mention of. Know this, that they are a greater poyson if they happen in the decrease of the Moon, and yet much greater, if they happen betwixt the decrease, and change of the Moon: But if they happen in the Eclypse of the Moon or Sun, they are an incurable poyson. But they are of greatest force of all, when they happen in the first years, even in the years of virginity, for if they do but touch the posts of the house there can no mischeif take effect in it. Also they say that the threads of any garment touched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, cannot be burnt, and if they be cast into the fire, it will spread no further. Also it is said that the root of Peony being given with Castor, and smeared over with a menstruous cloth, cureth the falling sickness. Moreover if the stomack of a Hart be burnt or rosted, and to it be put a perfuming made with a menstruous cloth, it will make crass-bows useless for the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of any game: The haires of a menstruous woman put under dung, breed Serpents: and if they be burnt, will drive away Serpents with their smell. So great a poysonous force is in them, that they are poyson to poysonous creatures. There is also Hippomanes, which amongst Sorceries is not the least taken notice of, and it is a little venemous piece of flesh as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52070:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
big as a fig, and black, which is in the forehead of a Colt newly foaled, which unless the Mare her self doth presently eat, she will never after love her foals, or let it suck. And for this cause they say there is a most wonderful power in it to procure love, if it be powdered, and drank in a cup with the blood of him that is in love. There is also another Sorcery, which is called by the same name, <hi>viz.</hi> Hippomanes, <hi>viz.</hi> a venemous humour, issuing out of the share of a Mare what time she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires a horse, of which <hi>Virgill</hi> makes mention, when he sings

                  <hi>Apollonius</hi> also in his Argonanticks makes mention of the hearb of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> which he saith groweth from corrupt blood dropping upon the earth, whilest the Vultur was gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the liver of <hi>Prometheus</hi> upon the hill Caucasus. The flowre of this hearb, he saith, is like Safforn, having a double stalk hanging out, one further then another the length of a cubit, the root under the earth, as flesh newly cut, sends forth a blackish juice as it were of a beech; with which, saith he, if any one shall after he hath performed his devotion to <hi>Proserpina,</hi> smear over his body, he cannot be hurt either with sword, or fire. Also <hi>Saxo Gramaticus</hi> writes, that there was a certain man called <hi>Froton,</hi> who had a garment, which when he had put on he could not be hurt with the point or edge of any weapon. The civet Cat also abounds with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries: for, as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, the posts of a dore being touched with her blood, the Arts of Juglers, and Sorcerers are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallid, that the Gods cannot be called up, and will by no means be perswaded to talk with them. Also that they that are noynted with the ashes of the ankle bone of her left foot,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52070:57"/>
being decocted with the blood of a Weesell shall become odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all. The same also is done with the eye, being decocted. Also it is said that the straight gut is administred against the injustice, and corruption of Princes, and great men in power, and for success of Petitions, and to conduce to ending of suits, and controversies, if any one hath never so little of it about him, and that if it be bound unto the left arm, it is such a present charm, that if any man do but look upon a woman, it will make her follow him presently; and that the skin of her forehead doth withstand bewitchings. They say also that the blood of a Basilisk, which they call the blood of <hi>Saturn,</hi> hath such great force in Sorcery, that it procures for him that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes it about him, good success of his Petitions, from great men in power, and of his prayers from God, and also remedies of diseases, and grant of any priveledge. They say also that a tyke, if it be pulled out of the left care of a dog, and if be it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together black, hath great vertue in the prognostick of life, for if the sick party shall answer him that brought it in, who stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at his feet, &amp; shall ask of him concerning his disease, there is certain hope of life, and that he shall dye, if he make no answer. They say also, that a stone that is bit with a mad dog hath power to cause discord, if it be put in drink, and that he shall not be barked at by dogs, that puts the tongue of a dog in his shooe under his great toe, especially if the hearb of the same name, <hi>viz.</hi> houndstongue be joyned with it. And that a membrane of the secondines of a dog doth the same; and that dogs will shun him that hath a dogs heart. And <hi>Pliny</hi> reports that there is a red toad that lives in bryers, and brambles, and is full of Sorceries, and doth wonderfull things: for the little bone which is in his left side, being cast into cold water, makes it presently very hot, by which also the rage of dogs is restrained, and their love is procured, if it be put in drink; and if it be bound to any one, it stirreth up lust. On the contrary, the litle bone which is on the right side, makes hot water cold, and that it can never be hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, unless that be taken out, also it is said to cure quartanes if it be bound to the sick in a snakes skin, as also all other fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52070:57"/>
and restrain love, and lust. And that the spleen, and heart is an effectuall remedy against the poisons of the said Toad. Thus much <hi>Pliny</hi> writes. Also it is said that the sword, with which a man is slain, hath wonderfull power in Sorceries: For if the snaffle of the bridle, or spurs be made of it, they say that with these any horse, though never so wild, may be tamed, and gentled: and that if a Horse should be shod with shooes made with it, he would be most swift and fleet, and never, though never so hard rod, tire. But yet they will that some Characters, and names should be written upon it. They say also, if any man shall dip a sword, wherewith men were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, in wine; and the sick drink thereof, he shall be cured of his quartane. They say also that a cup of liquor being made with the brains of a Bear, and drank out of the skull, shall make him that drinks it, be as fierce, and as raging as a Bear, and think himself to be changed into a Bear, and judge all things he sees to be Bears, and so to continue in that madness, untill the force of that draught shall be dissolved, no other distemper being all this while perceived in him.</p>

               <p>SOme Suffumigations also, or perfumings, that are proper to the Stars, are of great force for the opportune receiving of Celestiall gifts under the rayes of the Stars, in as much as they do strongly work upon the Aire, and breath. For our breath is very much changed by such kind of vapours, if both vapours be of another like: The Aire also being through the said vapours easily moved, or affected with the qualities of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, or Celestiall, daily, and quickly penetrating our breast, and vitals, doth wonderfully reduce us to the like quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Wherefore Suffumigations are wont to be used to them that are about to Sooth-say, for to affect their fancy, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed being appropriated to any certain Deities, do fit us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52070:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
divine inspiration: So they say that fumes made with Lin-seed, and Flea-bane seed, and roots of Violets, and Parsly, doth make one to fore-see things to come, and doth conduce to prophecying. Let no man wonder how great things suffumigations can do in the Aire, especially when he shall with <hi>Porphyrius</hi> consider, that by certain vapours exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from proper suffumigations, airy spirits are presently rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as also Thundrings, and Lightnings, and such like things. As the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iver of a Chamelion being burnt on the top of the house, doth, as it is manifest, raise showers, and Lightnings. In like manner the head, and throat, if they be burnt with Oken wood, cause Storms, and Lightnings. There are also suffumigations under opportune influencies of Stars, that make the images of spirits forthwith appear in the Aire, or elswhere. So they say, that if of Coriander, Smallage, Henbane, and Hemlock be made a fume, that spirits will presently come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; hence they are called the spirits Hearbs. Also it is said that a fume made of the root of the reedy Hearb Sagapen, with the juice of Hemlock, and Henbane, and the Hearb Tapsus Barbatus red Sanders, and black Poppy, makes spirits and strange shapes appear: and if Smallage be added to them, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth away spirits from any place, and destroyes their visions. In like manner a fume made of Calamint, Peony, Mints, and Palma Christi, drives away all evil spirits, and vain imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Moreover it is said that by certain fumes certain Animals are gathered together, and put to flight, as <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the stone Liparis, that with the fume thereof all beasts are called ont; so the bones in the upper part of the throat of a Hart, being burnt, gather all the Serpents together, but the horn of the Hart being burnt doth with its fume chase them all away. The same doth a fume of the feathers of Peacocks. Also the lungs of an Asse being burnt, puts all poisonous things to flight; the fume of the burnt hoof of a Horse drives away Mice, the same doth the hoof of a Mule, with which also if it be the hoof of the left foot, Flies are driven away; And they say, if a house, or any place be smoaked with the gall of a Cutle fish, made into a confection with red Slyrax, Roses, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52070:58"/>
Lignum-aloes, and if then there be some Sea Water, or blood cast into that place, the whole house will seem to be full of Water, or blood; and if some Earth of plowed ground be cast there, the Earth will seem to quake. Now such kinds of vapours we must conceive do infect any body, and infuse a vertue into it, which doth continue long, even as any contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or poisonous vapour of the Pestilence, being kept for two yeers in the Wall of a house, infect the inhabitants, and as the contagion of Pestilence, or Leprosie lying hid in a garment, doth long after infect him that wears it. Therefore were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain suffumigations used to images, rings, and such like instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Magick, and hid treasures, and as <hi>Porphyrius</hi> saith, very effectually. So they say, if any one shall hide Gold, or Silver, or any other pretious thing, the Moon being in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Sun, and shall fume the place with Coriander, Saffron, Henbane, Smallage, and black Poppy, of each a like quantity, bruised together, and tempered with the juice of Hemlock, that which is so hid shall never be found, or taken away, and that spirits shall continually keep it: and if any one shall endeavour to take it away, he shall be hurt by them, and shall fall into a frensie. And <hi>Hermes</hi> saith, that there is nothing like the fume of Sperma Ceti for the raising of spirits: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a fume be made of that, and Lignum-aloes, Pepper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Musk, Saffron, red Storax tempered together, with the blood of a Lapwing, it will quickly gather airy spirits together, and if it be used about the graves of the dead, it gathers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spirits, and the Ghosts of the dead. So, as often as we direct any work to the Sun, we must make suffumigations with Solary things, if to the Moon, with Lunary things, and so of the rest. And we must know, that as there is a contrariety and enmity in Stars, and spirits, so also in suffumigations unto the same. So there is a contrariety betwixt Lignum-aloes, and Sulphur, Frankincense, and Quick-silver, and spirits that are raised by the fume of Lignum-aloes, are allayed by the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sulphur. As <hi>Proclus</hi> gives an example in a spirit, which was wont to appear in the form of a Lion, but by the setting of a Cock before it, vanished away, because there is a contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52070:59"/>

               <p>MOreover Collyries, and Unguents conveying the vertues of things Naturall, and Celestiall to our spirit, can mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, transmute, transfigure and transform it accordingly, as also transpose those vertues which are in them into it, that so it cannot act only upon its own body, but also upon that which is neer it, and affect that by visible rayes charmes, and by touching it, with some like quality. For because our spirit is the subtile, pure lucid, airy, and unctuous vapour of the blood; it is therefore fit to make Collyries of the like vapours, which are more sutable to our spirit in substance, for then by reason of their likeness, they do the more stir up, attract, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the spirit. The like vertues have certain ointments, and other confections. Hence by the touch sometimes sickness, poisonings, and love is induced; some things, as the hands, or garments being anointed: Also by kisses, some things being held in the mouth, love is induced, as in <hi>Virgil</hi> we read that <hi>Venus</hi> prayes <hi>Cupid</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>

               </p>
               <p>Now the sight, because it perceives more purely, and cleerly then the other senses, and fastening in us the marks of things more acutely, and deeply, doth most of all and before others agree with the Phantastick spirit, as is apparent in dreams, when things seen do more often present themselves to us then things heard, or any thing coming under the other senses. Therefore when Collyries transform visuall spirits, that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth easily affect the imagination, which indeed being
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52070:60"/>
affected with divers species, and forms, transmits the same by the same spirit unto the outward sense of sight, by which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion there is caused in it a perception of such species, and forms in that manner, as if it were moved by externall objects, that there seem to be seen terrible images, and spirits, and such like: so there are made Collyries, making us forthwith to see the images of spirits in the Aire, or elswhere, as I know how to make of the gall of a man, and the eyes of a black Cat, and of some other things. The like is made also of the blood of a Lapwing, of a Bat, and of a Goat, and they say, if a smooth shining piece of Steel be smeered over with the juice of Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, and made to fume, it will make invocated spirits to be seen in it. So also there are some suffumigations, or unctions, which make men speak in their sleep, to walk, and to do those things which are done by men that are awake, and sometimes to do those things, which men that are awake cannot, or dare not do. Some there are that make us to hear horrid, or delect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sounds, and such like. And this is the cause why Mania<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and Melancholy men believe they see, and hear those things without, which their imagination doth only fancy within, hence they fear things not to be feared, and fall into wonderfull, and most false suspicions, and fly when none pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth them, are angry, and contend, no body being present, and fear where no fear is. Such like passions also can magicall confections induce, by Suffumigations, by Collyries, by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents, by potions, by poisons, by lamps, and lights, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glasses, by images, enchantments, charms, sounds, and Musick. Also by divers rites, observations, ceremonies, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and superstitions; all which shall be handled in their piaces. And not only by these kind of arts, passions, appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and images are induced, but also things themselves, which are really changed, and transfigured into divers forms, as the Poet relates of <hi>Proteus, Periclimenus, Acheloas,</hi> and <hi>Merra,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Erisichthon:</hi> So also <hi>Circe</hi> changed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of <hi>Ulysses,</hi> &amp; of old in the sacrifices of <hi>Jupiter Lycaeus,</hi> the men that tasted of the inwards of the sacrifices, were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Wolves, which <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, befell a certain man
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52070:61"/>
called <hi>Demarchus,</hi> the same opinion was <hi>Austin</hi> of: for he saith, whilest he was in <hi>Italy,</hi> he heard of some women that by giving Sorceries in cheese to travellors, turned them into wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Catle, and when they had done such work as they would have them, turned them into men again, and that this befell a certain Father called <hi>Prestantius.</hi> The Scriptures themselves testify that <hi>Pharao's</hi> Sorcerers turned their rods into Serpents, and water into blood, and did such like things.</p>

               <p>WHen the soul of the world, by its vertue doth make all things that are naturally generated, or artificially made, fruitfull, by infusing into them Celestiall properties for the working of some wonderfull effects, then things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not only applyed by suffumigations, or Collyries, or oyntments, or potions, or any other such like way, but also when they being conveniently wrapt up, are bound to, or hang ed about the neck, or any other way applyed, althoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by never so easy a contact, do impress their vertue upon us. By these alligations therefore, supensions, wrappings up, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and contacts the Accidents of the body, and mind are changed into sickness, health, boldness, fear, sadness, and joy, and the like: They render them that carry them, gratious, or terrible, acceptable, or rejected, honoured, and beloved, or hatefull, and abominable. Now these kind of passions are conceived to be by the abovesaid, infused no otherwise, then is manifest in the graffing of trees, where the vitall vertue is sent, and Communicated from the trunk to the twig graffed into it, by way of contact and alligation; so in the female Palme tree, when she comes neer to the male, her boughs bend to the male, and are bowed: which the gardners seeing, bind ropes from the male to the female, which becomes straight again, as if it had by this continuation of the rope received
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52070:61"/>
the vertue of the male. In like manner we see, that the cramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish being touched afar off with a long pole, doth presently stupify the hand of him that toucheth it. And if any shall touch the sea Hare with his hand or stick, doth presently run out of his wits. Also if the fish called Stella, as they say, being fastned with the blood of a Fox and a brass nail to a gate, evill medicines can do no hurt. Also it is said, that if a woman take a needle, and beray it with dung, and then wrap it up in earth, in which the carkass of a man was buryed, and shall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it about her in a cloth which was used at the funerall, that no man shall be able to ly with her as long as she hath it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her. Now by these examples we see, how by certain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of certain things, as also suspensions, or by a simple contact, or the continuation of any thread, we may be able to receive some vertues thereby. It is necessary that we know the certain rule of alligation, and suspension, and the manner which the Art requires, <hi>viz.</hi> that they be done under a certain, and sutable constellation, and that they be done with wyer, or silken threads, with hair, or sinews of certain animals. And things that are to be wrapped up must be done in the leaves of hearbs, or the skins of animals, or fine cloths, and the like, according to the sutableness of things: as if you would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the solary vertue of any thing, this being wrapped up in bay leaves, or the skin of a Lion, hang it about thy neck with a golden thread, or a silken thread of a yallow colour, whilest the Sun rules in the heaven: so thou shalt be endued with the Solary vertue of that thing. But if thou dost desire the vertue of any Saturnine thing, thou shalt in like maner take that thing whilest <hi>Saturn</hi> raignes, and wrap it up in the skin of an Ass, or in a cloth used at a funerall, especially if thou desirest it for sadness, and with a black thread hang it about thy neck. In like manner we must conceive of the rest.</p>

               <p>RIngs also, which were alwaies much esteemed of by the Ancients, when they are opportunely made, do in like manner impress their vertue upon us, in as much as they do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the spirit of him that carries them with gladness or sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and render him courteous, or terrible, bold, or fearfull, amiable, or hatefull; in as much also as they do fortifie us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sickness, poisons, enemies, evill spirits, and all manner of hurtfull things, or at least will not suffer us to be kept under them.

So we read in <hi>Philostratus Jarchus,</hi> that a wise Prince of the Indians bestowed seven Rings made after this manner, marked with the vertues, and names of the seven Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> of which he wore every day one, distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them according to the names of the dayes, by the benefit of which he lived above one hundred and thirty years, as also alwaies retained the beauty of his youth. In like manner <hi>Moses</hi> the Law-giver, and ruler of the Hebrews, being skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Egyptian Magick, is said by <hi>Josephus</hi> to have made Rings of love, and oblivion. There was also, as saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> amongst the <hi>Cireneans</hi> a Ring of <hi>Battus,</hi> which could procure love and honour. We read also that <hi>Eudamus</hi> a certain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher made Rings against the bites of Serpents, bewitchings, and evil spirits. The same doth <hi>Josephus</hi> relate of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Also we read in <hi>Plato</hi> that <hi>Gygus,</hi> King of Lydia had a Ring
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52070:62"/>
of wonderfull, and strange vertues, the seal of which, when he turned toward the palm of his hand, no body could see him, but he could see all things: by the opportunity of which Ring he ravished the Queen, and slew the King his Master, and killed whomsoever he thought stood in his way, and in these villanies no body could see him, and at length by the benefit of this Ring he became King of Lydia.</p>

               <p>THere be wonderfull vertues of places accompanying them, either from things there placed, or the influences of the Stars, or any other way. For as <hi>Pliny</hi> relates of a Cuckow, in what place any one doth first hear him, if his right foot be marked about, and that foot-step digged up, there will no Fleas be bred in that place where it is scattered. So they say that the dust of the track of a Snake being gathered up and scattered amongst Bees, makes them return to their hives. So also that the dust, in which a Mule hath rolled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, being cast upon the Body, doth mitigate the heats of love, and that the dust wherein a Hawk hath rolled her self, if it be bound to the body in a bright red cloth, cures the quartane. So doth the stone taken out of the nest of a Swallow, as they say, presently relieve those that have the falling sickness, and being bound to the party, continually preserve them, especially if it be rolled in the blood, or heart of a Swallow. And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, That if any one having cut a veine and being fasting, shall go over a place where any one lately fell with the fit of a Falling sickness, that he shall fall into the same disease. And <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, that to fasten an Iron naile in that place where he that fell with a fit of the Falling sickness first pitched his head, will free him from his disease. So they say that an Hearb growing upon the head of any image, being gathered, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52070:63"/>
bound up in some part of ones garment with a red thread, shall presently allay the headach; and that any Hearb gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the brooks or rivers before Sun rising, that no body see him that gathers it, shall cure the Tertian, if it be bound to the left arm, the sick party not knowing what is done. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst places that are appropriated to the Stars, all stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places, dark, underground, religious, and mournfull places, as Church-yards, tombes, and houses not inhabited by men, and old, tottering, obscure, dreadfull houses, and solitary dens, caves, and pits, also fish-ponds, standing pools, fennes, and such like are appropriated to <hi>Saturne.</hi> Unto <hi>Jupiter</hi> are ascribed all priviledged places, Consistories of noble men, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, Chaires, places for Exercises, Schools, and all beautifull, and clean places, scattered, or sprinkled with divers odours. To <hi>Mars,</hi> fiery, and bloody places, furnaces, bake-houses, shambles, places of execution, and places where there have been great battailes fought, and slaughters made, and the like. To the <hi>Sun,</hi> light places, the Serene Aire, Kings Pallaces, and Princes Courts, Pulpits, Theators, Thrones, and all kingly, and Magnificent places. To <hi>Venus,</hi> pleasant fountains, green Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, flowrishing Gardens, garnished beds, stews (and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Orpheus)</hi> the sea, the sea shore, baths, dancing-places, and all places belonging to women. To <hi>Mercury,</hi> shops, schools, ware-houses, an Exchange for Merchants, and the like. To the <hi>Moon,</hi> wildernesses, woods, rocks, hils, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, forrests, fountains, waters, rivers, seas, sea-shores, ships, groves, high-waies, and granaries for Corn, and such like. Upon this account they that endeavor to procure love, are wont to bury for a certain time the instruments of their art, whether they be rings, images, looking-glasses, or any other, to hide them in a stew house, because in that place they will contract some venerall faculty, no otherwise then things that stand in stinking places, become stinking, and those in an Aromaticall place, become Aromaticall, and of a sweet favour. The four corners of the Earth also pertain to this matter. Hence they that are to gather a Saturnall, Martiall, or Joviall Hearb, must look towards the East, or South, partly because
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52070:63"/>
they desire to be orientall from the Sun, and partly, because their principall houses, <hi>viz. Aquarius, Scorpius, Sagittarius</hi> are Southern signes, so also are <hi>Capricornus,</hi> and <hi>Pisces.</hi> But they that will gather a <hi>Venerall, Mercuriall,</hi> or <hi>Lunary</hi> Hearb, must look towards the West, because they delight to be western, or else they must look Northward, because their principall houses, <hi>viz. Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Virgo</hi> are Northern signes, so in any <hi>Solary</hi> work we must look towards the East, or South, but rather towards the <hi>Solary</hi> body, and light.</p>

               <p>LIght also is a quality that partakes much of form, and is a simple act, and a representation of the understanding: it is first diffused from the Mind of God into all things, but in God the Father, the Father of light, it is the first true light; then in the Son a beautifull overflowing brightness, and in the Holy Ghost a burning brightness, exceeding all Intelligencies; yea, as <hi>Dyonisius,</hi> saith, of <hi>Seraphins,</hi> In Angels therefore it is a shining intelligence diffused, an abundant joy beyond all bounds of reason, yet received in divers degrees, according to the Nature of the intelligence that receives it; Then it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends into Celestiall bodies, where it becomes a store of life, and an effectuall propagation, even a visible splendor. In the fire a certain naturall liveliness infused into it by the heavens. And lastly in men, it is a clear discourse of reason, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of divine things, and the whole rationall: but this is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52070:64"/>
manifold, either by reason of the disposition of the body, as the Peripateticks will have it, or which is more true, by reason of the good pleasure of him that bestows it, who gives it to every one as he pleaseth. From thence it passeth to the fancy, yet above the sense, but only imaginable, and thence to the sence, but especially to that of the eyes; In them it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a visible clearness, and is extended to other perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous bodies, in which it becomes a colour, and shining beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but in dark bodies it is a certain beneficiall and generative vertue, and penetrates, to the very center, where the beames of it being collected into a narrow place, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a dark heat, tormenting, and scorching, so that all things perceive the vigour of the light according to their capacity, all which joyning to it self with an enlivening heat, and passing through all things, doth convey its qualities, and vertues through all things. Therefore Magicians forbid the Urin of a sick man to be sprinkled in the shadow of a sick man, or to be uncovered against the <hi>Sun</hi> or the <hi>Moon,</hi> because the rayes of the light penetrating, bringing suddenly with it the noxious qualities of the sick bodies, convey them into the opposite bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and affect that with a quality of the same kind. This is the reason why Enchanters have a care to cover their Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with their shadow. So the Civet Cat makes all Dogs dumb with the very touch of her shadow. Also there are made artificially some Lights, by Lamps, Torches, Candles, and such like, of some certain things, and liquors opportunely chosen, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of the Stars, and composed amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves according to their congruity, which when they be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and shine alone, are wont to produce some wonderfull, and Celestiall effects, which men many times wonder at, as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports out of <hi>Anaxilaus,</hi> of a poison of Mares after co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, which being lighted in Torches, doth monstrously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present a sight of Horse heads: the like may be done of Asses, and flies, which being tempered with wax, &amp; lighted, make a strange sight of flies: and the skin of a Serpent lighted in a Lamp, makes Serpents appear. And they say when Grapes are in their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52070:64"/>
flower, if any one shall bind a Viall to them full of Oile, and shall let it alone till they be ripe, and then the Oile be lighted in a Lamp, it makes Grapes to be seen. And so in other fruits. If Centory be mixed with Honey, and the blood of a Lapwing, and be put in a Lamp, they that stand about will seem a great deal bigger then they are wont: and if it be lighted in a clear night, the Stars will seem to be scattered the one from the other. Such force also is in the inke of the Cuttle fish, that it being put into a Lamp, makes Black-mores appear. It is also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that a Candle made of some certain Saturnine things, if being lighted, it be extinguished in the mouth of a man new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead, will afterwards, as oft as it shines alone, bring great sadness, and fear upon them that stand about it. Of such like Torches, Lamps, doth <hi>Hermes</hi> speak more of, also <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Chyrannides,</hi> and of the latter writers <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> ina certain Treatise of this particular thing. Colours also are a kind of lights, which being mixed with things, are wont to expose them to those Stars, to which they are agreeable. And we shall afterwards speak of some colours, which are the lights of the Planets, by which even the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of fixed Stars themselves are understood, which also may be applyed to the flames of Lamps, and Candles. But in this place we shall relate how the colours of inferiour mixt things are distributed to divers Planets. For all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, black, lucid, earthy, leaden, brown, have relation to <hi>Saturne.</hi> Saphire, and airy colours, and those which are alwaies green, clear, purple, darkish, golden, mixed with Silver, belong to <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Red colours, and burning, fiery, flaming, violet, purple, bloody, and iron colours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble <hi>Mars.</hi> Golden, Saffron, purple, and bright colours, resemble the <hi>Sun.</hi> But all white, fair, curious, green, ruddy, betwixt saffron, and purple, resemble <hi>Venus, Mercury,</hi> and the <hi>Moon.</hi> Moreover amongst the houses of the heaven, the first, and seventh hath white colour: the second, and twelfth green: the third, and eleventh saffron: the fourth, and the tenth red: the fift, and ninth honey colour: the sixt, and eighth,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52070:65"/>
black. The Elements also have their colours, by which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Philosophers judge of the complexion and property of their nature; For an earthy colour, caused of coldness, and dryness is brown, and black, and manifests black choller, and a Saturnine nature; the blew tending towards whiteness, doth denote flegme: for cold makes white, moisture and dryness makes black: reddish colour shews blood, but fiery, flaming, burning hot, shew choller, which by reason of its subtilty, and aptness to mix with others doth cause divers colours more: for if it be mixed with blood, and blood be most predominant, it makes a florid red; if choller predominate, it makes a redish colour; if there be an equall mixtion, it makes a sad red. But if adust choller be mixed with blood, it makes a Hempen colour, and red, if blood predominate, and somewhat red if choller prevaile; but if it be mixed with a melancholy humour, it makes a black colour, but with malancholy, and flegme to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in an equall proportion, it makes a Hempen colour: If flegme abound, a mud colour, if melancholy, a blewish; but if it be mixed with flegme alone, in an equall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, it makes a citrine colour; if unequally, a pale, or palish. Now all colours are more prevalent, when they be in silk, or in metals, or in perspicuous substances, or pretious stones; and in those things which resemble Celestiall bodies in colour, especially in living things.</p>

               <p>FAscination is a binding, which comes from the spirit of the Witch, through the eyes of him that is bewitched, entering to his heart. Now the instrument of Fascination is the spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> a certain pure, lucid subtile vapour, generated of the purer blood, by the heat of the heart. This doth alwaies send forth through the eyes, rayes like to it self; Those rayes being sent forth, do carry with them a spirituall vapour, and that vapour a blood, as it appears in bleer, and red eyes, whose raies being sent forth to the eyes of him that is opposite, and looks upon them, carries the vapour of the corrupt blood, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it self, by the contagion of which, it doth infect the eyes of the beholder with the like disease. So the eye being opened, and intent upon any one with a strong imagination, doth dart its beams, which are the Vehiculum of the spirit into the eyes of him that is opposite to him, which tender spirit strikes the eyes of him that is bewitched, being stirred up from the heart of him that strikes, and possesseth the breast of him that is stricken, wounds his heart, and infects his spirit. Whence <hi>Apuleius</hi> saith, Thy eyes sliding down through my eyes, into mine inward breast, stirs up a most vehement burning in my Marrow. Know therefore that men are then most bewitched, when with often beholding they direct the edge of their sight to the edg of their sight that bewitch them, and when their eyes are reciprocally intent one upon the other, and when raies are joyned to raies, and lights to lights, for then the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the one is joyned to the spirit of the other, and fixeth its sparks: So are strong ligations made, and so most vehement loves are inflamed with the only raies of the eyes, even with a certain sudden looking on, as if it were with a dart, or stroke penetrating the whole body, whence then the spirit, and amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous blood being thus wounded, are carried forth upon the lover, and enchanter, no otherwise then the blood, and spirit
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52070:66"/>
of the vengeance of him that is slain, are upon him that slayes him. Whence <hi>Lucretius</hi> sang concerning those amorous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchings.

                     <l>
                        <hi>Is wounded with the darts of</hi> Cupid <hi>blind.</hi>

               <p>So great is the power of Fascination, especially when the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of the eyes are subservient to the affection. Therefore Witches use collyries, ointments, alligations, and such like, to affect, and corroborate the spirit this or that manner. To procure love, they use venereall collyries, as Hippomanes, the blood of Doves, or Sparrows, and such like. To induce fear, they use Martiall Collyries, as of the eyes of Wolves, the Civet Cat, and the like. To procure misery or sickness, they use Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnine, and so of the rest.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LI. <hi>Of certain observations, producing wonderfull Vertues.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THey say that certain acts, and observations have a certain power of naturall things, that they believe diseases may be expelled, or brought thus, and thus. So they say that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes may be driven away if the parings of the nails of the sick be bound to the neck of a live Eel in a linnen clout, and she be let go into the water. And <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, that the paring of the sick mans nailes of his feet, and hands being mixed with wax, cure the quartane, tertian, and quotidian Ague, and if they be before Sun rising fastened to another mans gate, will cure such like diseases. In like manner let all the parings of the nailes be put into Pismires caves, and they say that that which begun to draw the nailes first must be taken, and bound to the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52070:66"/>
neck, and by this means will the disease be removed. They say that by Wood stricken with lightning, and cast behind the back with ones hands, any disease may be cured, and in quartanes a piece of a naile from a Gibbet, wrapt up in Wooll, and hanged about the neck, cures them; also a Rope doth the like, that is taken from a Gallows, and hid under ground, that the Sun cannot reach it. Also the throat of him that hath a hard swelling, or imposthume, being touched with the hand of him that dyed by an immature death, is cured thereby. Also they say, that a woman is presently eased of her hard travel, if any one shall put into the bed, where the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in travel is, a stone, or dart, with which either of these Animals, <hi>viz.</hi> a Man, a Boar, or a Bear were at one blow killed. The same also, as they say, doth a spear that is pulled out of the body of a man, if it shall not first touch the ground; also they say that Arrows pulled out of the body of man, if they have not touched the Earth, and be put under any one lying down, will procure love; Also they say that the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sickness is cured by meat made of the flesh of a wild beast, slain in the same manner as a man is slain. Also they say that a mans eyes that are washed three times with the water wherein he hath washed his feet, shall never be sore or bleer. It is said that some do cure diseases of the groin with threed taken out of the Weavers Loom, being tyed in nine, or seven knots, the name of some Widow being named at every knot. Also the Spleen of Catle extended upon pained Spleens, cures them, if he that applies it, saith that he is applying a medicine to the Spleen to cure, and ease it: After this, they say, the patient must be shut into a sleeping room, the dore being sealed up with a Ring, and some verse be repeated over nineteen times. The Urine of a green Lizard cures the same disease, if it be hanged up in a pot before the patients bed-chamber, so that he may, as he comes in and out, touch it with his hand. Also a Lizard killed in the Urine of a Calf, as they say, restrains his lust that put it in: but he that shall put his own Urine into a Dogs Urine, is said to be made thereby dull to venerous acts, and to feel a benummedness in his loins. They say, that if ones
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52070:67"/>
own Urine be dropped upon the foot in the morning, it is a remedy against all evil medicines. And a little Frog climbing up a tree, if any one shall spit in his mouth, and then let him escape, is said to cure the Cough. It is a wonderfull thing, but easy to experience, what <hi>Pliny</hi> speaks of, If any one shall be sorry for any blow that he hath given another afar off, or nigh at hand, if he shall presently spit into the middle of that hand with which he gave the blow, the party that was smitten shall presently be freed from pain. This hath been approved of in a four-footed beast that hath been sorely hurt. Some there are that aggravate the blow before they give it. In like maner spitle carried in the hand, or to spit in the shooe of the right foot before it be put on, is good when any one passeth through a dangerous place. They say that Wolves will not come to a field, if one of them be taken, and the blood let by little and little out of his legs, being unbroken, with a knife, and sprinkled about the outsides of the field, and he himself be buried in that place, from which he was first drawn. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanenses, Citizens of Trezenium, accounted it as a present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for preserving of Vines from the wrong of the Southern wind, having alwaies found it by most certain experience; if whilest the wind blows, a white Cock should be pulled to pieces in the middle by two men, both which keeping their part, must walk round the Vineyard, and both meeting in the place from whence they began their Circuit, must in that place bury the pieces of the Cock. They say also that if any one shall hold a Viper over a vapour with a staffe, he shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and that the staffe wherewith a Snake was beaten is good against diseases of breeding women. These things <hi>Pliny</hi> recites. It is said also in gathering of roots and hearbs, we must draw three circles round about them, first with a sword, then dig them up, taking heed in the mean time of a contrary wind. Also they say, that if any one shall measure a dead man with a rope, first from the Elbow to the biggest finger, then from the shoulder to the same finger, and afterwards from the head. to the feet, making thrice those mensurations, if any one after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shall be measured with the same rope, in the same maner,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52070:67"/>
he shall not prosper, but be unfortunate, and fall into misery, and sadness. And <hi>Albertus</hi> out of <hi>Chyrannis</hi> saith, that if any woman hath enchanted thee to love her, take the sheet she lies in, and piss through her hood, and her right sleeve, out of doors, and the enchantment will be quitted. And <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, that to sit by women great with child, or when a medicine is given to any one of them, the fingers being joyned together like the teeth of a Kemb, is a charm. This was known by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in <hi>Alcumena</hi> breeding <hi>Hercules:</hi> and so much the worse, if that be done about one, or both knees. Also to sit cross legged, is Sorcery, therefore it was forbiden to be done in the Counsels of Princes, and Rulers, as a thing which hindred all acts. And it is said, if any one stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the door call the man by his name, that is lying with a woman, and he answer, if then he fasten a knife, or needle on the door, and break it, the edge being downward, he that is in the bed with the woman cannot cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with her as long as those things shall be there.</p>

How much also the countenance, gesture, do affect the sight, imagination, and Animall spirit, no man is ignorant. So they that couple for generation, for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52070:68"/>
the most part are wont to make an impression on the children that are then begotten, of that countenance which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves then form, or imagine: So a mild, and cheerfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a Prince in the City, makes the people joyfull: but fierce, and sad, terrifies them: so the gesture, and countenance of any one lamenting, doth easily move to pitty: So the shape of an amiable person, doth easily excite to love. Thou must know that such like gestures, and figures, as harmonies of the body do expose it no otherwise to the Celestials, then odours, and the spirit of a Medicine, and internall passions do the soul. For as Medicines, and passions of the mind are by certain dispositions of the Heaven increased so also the gesture, and motion of the body do get an efficacy by certain influences of the heavens. For there are gestures resembling <hi>Saturne,</hi> which are melancholy, and sad, as are beating of the breast, striking of the head: also such as are Religious, as the bowing of the knee, and a fixt looks downward, as of one praying, also weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and such like, as are used by an Austere, and Saturnine man, such an one as the <hi>Satyrist</hi> describes, saying,

               <p>A cheerfull, and honest countenance, a worshipfull gesture, clapping of the hands, as of one rejoycing, and praising; also the bending of the knee, with the head lifted up, as of one that is worshipping, are ascribed to <hi>Jupiter.</hi> A sowre, fierce, cruell, angry, rough countenance, and gesture, are ascribed to <hi>Mars. Solary</hi> are honourable, and couragious gestures, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: also walkings abroad, bending of the knee, as of one honoring a King with one knee. <hi>Venereal,</hi> are dances, embraces, laughters, amiable, and cheerfull countenances. <hi>Mercuriall</hi> are inconstant, quick, variable, and such like gestures, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. <hi>Lunary</hi> are such as are moveable, poisonfull, and childish, and the like. And as we have spoke of gestures, so also are the shapes of men distinct. For <hi>Saturne</hi> bespeaks a man to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52070:68"/>
be of a black, and yellowish colour, lean, crooked, of a rough skin, great veines, hairy all over his body, little eyes, of a frowning forehead, of a thin beard, great lips, eyes intent upon the ground, of a heavy gate, striking his feet together as he walks, crafty, witty, a seducer, and murderous. <hi>Jupiter</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a man to be of a pale colour, darkish red, a handsome body, good stature, bold, of great eyes, not black altogether, large pupill, short nostrils, not equall, great teeth before, curld hair, of good disposition, and manners. <hi>Mars</hi> makes a man red, of a red hair, round face, yellowish eyes, of a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and sharp looks, bold, jocund, proud, crafty. The <hi>Sun</hi> makes a man of a tauny colour, betwixt yellow and black, dasht with red, of a short stature, yet of a handsome body, without much hair, and curld, of yellow eyes, wise, faithfull, desirous of praise. <hi>Venus</hi> signifies a man to be tending towards blackness, but more white, with mixture of red, of a handsome body, a fair, and round face, fair hair, fair eyes, the blackness whereof is more intense, of good manners, and honest love, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so kind, patient, and jocund; <hi>Mercury</hi> signifies a man not much white, or black, of a long face, high forehead, fair eyes, not black, to have a streight, and long nose, thin beard, long fingers, to be ingenious, a subtile inquisitor, turn-coat, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many fortunes. The <hi>Moon</hi> signifies a man to be in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour white, mixed with a litle red, of a fair stature, round face, with some marks in it, eyes not fully black, frowning forehead, also kind, gentle, sociable. The Signes also, and faces of Signes have their figures, and shapes, which he that would know, must seek them out in books of Astrology. Lastly, upon these figures, and gestures Physiognomy, and Metoposcopy, arts of divination do depend: Also Chyromancy, foretelling future events, not as causes, but as signes through like effects, caused by the same cause. And although these divers kinds of divinations may seem to be done by inferiour, and weak signes, yet the judgements of them are not to be slighted, or condemned, when prognostication is made by them, not out of superstition, but by reason of the harmoniacall correspondency of all the parts of the body. Whosoever therefore doth the more exactly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52070:69"/>
imitate the Celestiall bodies, either in nature, study action, motion, gesture, countenance, passions of the mind, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the season, is so much the more like to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies, and can receive larger gifts from them.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THere are some other kinds of divinations depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on naturall causes, which are known to every one in his art, and experience, to be in divers things; by which Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, husbandmen, shepheards, Mariners, and every one of these out of probable signes do Prognosticate. Many of these kinds <hi>Aristotle</hi> made mention of in his Book of <hi>Times.</hi> Amongst which <hi>Auguria,</hi> and <hi>Auspicia</hi> are the chiefest, which were in former time in such esteem amongst the Romanes, that they would do nothing that did belong to private or publique busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, without the counsell of the <hi>Augures: Cicero</hi> also in his Book of Divinations largely declares, that the people of <hi>Tuscia</hi> would do nothing without this art. Now there are divers kinds of <hi>Auspicia's</hi> for some are called <hi>Pedestria (i. e.)</hi> which are taken from four footed beasts: Some are called <hi>Auguria,</hi> which are taken from birds: Some are Celestiall, which are taken from thundrings, and lightnings; some are called <hi>Caduca (i. e.)</hi> when any fell in the temple, or elswhere; Some were sacred, which were taken from sacrifices. Some of these were called <hi>Piacula,</hi> and sad <hi>Auspicia,</hi> as when a sacrifice es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped from the Altar, or being smitten made a bellowing, or fell upon another part of his body then he should. To these is added <hi>Exauguration, viz.</hi> when the rod fell out of the hand of the <hi>Augure,</hi> with which it was the custome to view, and take notice of the <hi>Auspicium. Michael Scotus</hi> makes mention of twelve kinds of <hi>Auguria's, viz.</hi> Six on the right hand, the names of which he saith are <hi>Fernova, Fervetus, Confert,</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:52070:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Emponenthem, Sonnasarnova, Sonnasarvetus:</hi> and the other six on the left hand, the names of which are, <hi>Confernova, Confervetus, Viaram, Herrenam, Scassarnova, Scassarvetus.</hi> Then expounding their names, he saith, <hi>Fernova</hi> is an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurium;</hi> when thou goest out of thy house for to do any busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and in going thou seest a man, or a bird going, or flying, so that either of them set himself before thee upon thy left hand, that is a good signification in refrence to thy business. <hi>Fervetus</hi> is an <hi>Augurium;</hi> when thou shalt go out of thy house for to do any business, and in going thou findest or seest a bird, or a man resting himself before thee on the left side of thee, that is an ill sign in reference to thy business: <hi>Viaram</hi> is an <hi>Augurium;</hi> when a man or a bird in his journey, or flying passeth before thee, coming from the right side of thee, and bending toward the left, goeth out of thy sight, that is a good sign concerning thy business. <hi>Confernova</hi> is an <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium;</hi> when thou dost first find a man, or a bird going, or fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then he rests himself before thee on thy right side, thou seeing of it, that is a good sign concerning thy business; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervetus</hi> is an <hi>Augurium;</hi> when first thou findest, or seest a man, or a bird bending from thy right side, it is an ill sign concerning thy business. <hi>Scimasarnova</hi> is an <hi>Augurium;</hi> when a man, or a bird comes behind thee, and outgoeth thee, but before he comes at thee, he rests, thou seeing of him on thy right side, it is to thee a good sign. <hi>Scimasarvetus</hi> is an <hi>Augurium;</hi> when thou seest a man, or a bird behind thee, but before he comes to thee he rests in that place, thou seeing of it, it is a good sign. <hi>Scassarvetus</hi> is when thou seest a man, or a bird passing by thee, and resting in a place on thy left side, it is an evill sign to thee. <hi>Emponenthem</hi> is when a man, or a bird coming from thy left side, and passing to thy right, goeth out of thy sight without resting, it is a good sign. <hi>Hartena</hi> is an <hi>Augurium;</hi> if a man or a bird coming from thy right hand, passing behind thy back to thy left, and thou shalt see him resting any where, this is an evill sign. Thus much <hi>Scotus.</hi> The Ancients did also prognosticate from sneesings, of which <hi>Homer</hi> in the seventeenth book of his <hi>Odes,</hi> makes mention, because
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52070:70"/>
they thought they proceeded from a sacred place, <hi>viz.</hi> the head, in which the intellect is vigorous, and operative. Whence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so whatsoever speech came into the breast, or mind of a man rising in the morning unawares, is said to be some presage, and an <hi>Augurium.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. LIIII. <hi>Of divers certain Animals, and other things which have a signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in</hi> Auguria's.</head>
               <p>ALL the <hi>Auspicia</hi> which first happen in the beginning of any enterprise are to be taken notice of: as if in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of thy work thou shalt perceive that Rats have gnawn thy garments, desist from thy undertakings; If going forth thou shalt stumble at the threshold, or in the way thou shalt dash thy foot against any thing, forbear thy journey; If any ill omen happen in the beginning of thy business, put off thy undertakings, least thy intentions be wholly frustrated, or accomplished to no purpose; but expect and wait for a fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate hour for the dispatching of thy affairs with a better omen. We see that many Animals are, by a naturall power imbred in them, propheticall. Doth not the Cock by his crowing diligently tell you the hours of the night, and morning, and with his wings spread forth chase away the Lion; and many birds with their singing, and chattering, and flies by their sharp pricking foretell rain, and Dolphins by their often leaping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the water, fore-run tempests. It would be too long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all the passages, which the <hi>Phrygians Cilicians, Arabians, Umbrians, Tuscians,</hi> and other people, which follow the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guria's,</hi> learned by birds. These they have proved by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, and examples. For in all things the Oracles of things to come are hid: but those are the chiefest which Ominall birds shall foretell. These are those which the Poets relate were turned from men into birds. Therefore what the Daw declares, hearken, and mark, observing her setting as she sits, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52070:70"/>
her manner of flying, whether on the right hand, or left, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clamorous, or silent, whether she goes before, or follows after, whether she waits for the approach of him that passeth by, or flies from him, and which way she goes; all these things must be diligently observed. <hi>Orus Apollo</hi> saith in his Hyero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks, Daws that are twins signifie marriage, because this Animall brings forth two eggs, out of which male, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male must be brought forth: But if (which seldom happens) two males be generated, or two females, the males will not couple with any other females, nor females with any other males, but will alwaies live without a mate; and solitary. Therefore they that meet a single Daw, divine thereby that they shall live a single life. The same also doth a black Hen Pigeon betoken; for after the death of her mate, she alwaies lives single. Thou shalt as carefully observe Crows, which are as significant as Daws, yea, and in greater matters. It was <hi>Epictetus</hi> the Stoicks Philosophers judgement, who was a Sage Author, that if a Crow did croke over against any one, it did betoken some evill, either to his body, fortune, honour, wife, or children. Then thou shalt take heed to Swans, who foreknow the secrets of the waters, for their cheerfulness doth presage happy events not only to Marriners, but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther travellers, unless they be overcome by the coming over of a stronger, as of an Eagle, who by the most potent Majesty of her soveraignty makes null the predictions of all other birds, if she speaks to the contrary; for she slies higher then all other birds, and is of more acute sight, and is never excluded from the secrets of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> She portends advancement, and victory, but by blood; because she drinks no water but blood. An Eagle flying over the Locrensians, fighting against the Croto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niensians gave them victory. An Eagle setting her self una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares upon the Target of <hi>Hiero,</hi> going forth to the first War, betokened that he should be King. Two Eagles sitting all day upon the house at the birth of <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> did portend to him an omen of two Kingdomes, <hi>viz. Asia,</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> An Eagle also taking off the hat of <hi>Lucias Tarquinius Priscus,</hi> Son to <hi>Demarathus</hi> the <hi>Corinthian</hi> (flying from home
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52070:71"/>
by reason of some discord, and being come into <hi>Hetraria,</hi> and going to <hi>Rome)</hi> and then flying high with it, and afterwards putting it upon his head again, did portend to him the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Vulturs also signifie diffiulty, hardness, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venousness, which was verified in the beginning of building of Cities. Also they foretell the places of slaughter, coming seven dayes before hand; and because they have most respect to that place where the greatest slaughter shall be, as if they gaped af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the greatest number of the slain; therefore the ancient Kings were wont to send out spies to take notice what place the Vulturs' had most respect to. The Phoenix promiseth singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good success, which being seen a new, <hi>Rome</hi> was built very auspiciously. The Pellican, because she hazards her self for her young, signifies that a man should out of the zeal of his love undergo much hardship. The painted bird gave the name to the City of <hi>Pictavia,</hi> and foreshewed the lenity of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by its colour, and voice. The Heron is an <hi>Augurium</hi> of hard things. The Stork is a bird of concord, and makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Cranes gives us notice of the trechery of enemies. The bird Cacupha betokens gratitude, for she alone doth express love to her Dam, being spent with old age. On the contrary, Hippopotamus that kils his Dam, doth betoken ingratitude for good turn, also injustice. The bird Origis is most envious, and betokens envy.</p>
               <p>Amongst the smaller birds, the Pie is talkative, and foretels guests. The bird Albanellus flying by any one, if from the left to the right, betoken cheerfulness of entertainment, if contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywise, betokens the contrary. The scrich Owl is alwaies unlucky, so also is the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Owl, who because she goes to her young by night unaware as death comes unawares, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said to foretell death: yet sometimes, because she is not blind in the dark of the night, doth betoken diligence and watchfulness, which she made good, when she sate upon the spear of <hi>Hiero. Dido,</hi> when she sees the unlucky Owl, pittied <hi>Aeneas,</hi> whence the Poet sang,
<q>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:52070:71"/>
                     <l>The Owl sitting on top of th' house alone,</l>
                     <l>Sends forth her sad complaints with mournfull tone.</l>
                  </q>
An in another place,
<q>
                     <l>The slothfull Owl by mortals is esteem'd</l>
                     <l>A fatall omen—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The same bird sang in the Capitoll when the Romane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires were low at Numantia, and when Fregelia was pulled down for a conspiracy made against the Romans. <hi>Almadel</hi> saith, that Owls, and night-ravens, when they turn aside to strange countries, or houses, betoken the death of the men of that country, and those houses; for those birds are delighted with dead Carkases, and perceive them before hand. For men that are dying have a neer affinity with dead Carkases. The Hawk also is a foreteller of contention, as <hi>Naso</hi> sings.
<q>
                     <l>We hate the Hawk, because that arms amongst</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lelius</hi> the Embassadour of <hi>Pompey</hi> was slain in Spain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Purveyours, which misfortune, a Hawk flying over his head, is said to foretell. And <hi>Almadel</hi> saith, that these kind of birds fighting amongst themselves, signifie the change of a Kingdome; but if birds of another kind shall fight with them, and are never seen to come together again, it portends a new condition, and state of that Country. Also little birds by their coming to, or departing from, fore shew that a family shall be inlarged, or lessened, and their flight, by how much the more serene it is, by so much the more laudable. Whence <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampus</hi> the <hi>Augure</hi> conjectured at the slaughter of the Greeks by the flight of little birds, when he saith, Thou seest that no bird taketh his flight in fair weather. Swallows, because when they are dying they provide a place of safety for their young, do portend a great patrimony, or Legacy after the death of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52070:72"/>
friends. A Bat meeting any one running away, signifies an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: for although she have no wings, yet she flies. A Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is a bad omen to one that runs away, for she flies from the Hawk, and makes hast to the Owl, where she is in as great danger: yet in love she is fortunate, for being stirred up with lust, couples seven times in an hour. Bees are a good omen to Kings, for they signifie an obsequious people. Flies signifie importunity, and impudency, because being oftentimes driven away, they do yet continually return. Also domestick birds are not without some <hi>Auguria's,</hi> for Cocks by their crowing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote hope, and the journey of him that is undertaking it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>Livia</hi> the mother of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when she was great with him, took a Hen-Egg and hatched it in her bosome, and at length came forth a Cock chick with a great comb, which the <hi>Augures</hi> interpreted that the child that should be born of her should be King. And <hi>Cicero</hi> writes that at <hi>Thebais</hi> Cocks, by their crowing all night, did presage that the Baeotians would obtain victory against the Lacedaemonians: and the reason is according to the <hi>Augures</hi> interpretations, because that bird when he is beaten is silent, but when he himself hath overcome, crows. In like manner also omens of events are taken from beasts. For the meeting of a Weesel is ominous, also meeting of a Hare is an ill omen to a traveller, unless she be taken. A Mule also is bad, because barren. A Hog is pernicious, for such is his nature, and therefore signifies pernicious men. A Horse betokens quarrellings, and fightings: whence <hi>Anchises</hi> seeing of white Horses, cries out in <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                  <q>With War are Horses arm'd, yea threaten War.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But when they are joyned together in a Chariot, because they draw with an equall yoke, they signifie that peace is to be hoped for. An Asse is an unprofitable creature, yet did <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> good, who when he was pronounced enemy to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, saw an Asse disdaining provender that was offered to him, and running to the water, by which <hi>Augury,</hi> he supposing he saw a way of safety shewed to him, intreated the aid of his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52070:72"/>
friends, that they would convey him to the Sea; which being granted, he was set into a little ship, and so escaped the threats of <hi>Silla</hi> the Conqueror. If the Foal of an Asse meet any one going to an <hi>Augury,</hi> he signifies labor, patience, and hinderances. A Wolf meeting any one is a good sign, the effect whereof was seen in <hi>Hiero</hi> of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> from whom a Wolf snatching away a book whilest he was at School, confirmed to him the success of the Kingdom: but yet the Wolf makes him speechless whom he sees first. A Wolf rent in peices a Watchman of P. <hi>Africanus,</hi> and C. <hi>Fulvius</hi> at <hi>Minturn,</hi> when the Romane Army was overcome by the fugitives in Sicilia. Also he signifies perfidious men, such as you can give no credit to: which was known in the progeny of Romanes. For the faith which they long since sucked from their mother the Wolf, and kept to themselves from the beginning, as by a certain law of nature, passed over to their posterity. To meet a Lion, seeing she is amongst Animals the strongest, and striking terrour into all the rest, is good. But for a woman to meet a Lionesse, is bad, because she hinders conception, for a Lionesse brings forth but once. To meet Sheep, and Goats is good. It is read also in the <hi>Ostentarian</hi> of the <hi>Tuscians,</hi> if this Animall shall wear any unusuall colour, it portends to the Emperour plenty of all things, together with much happiness. Whence <hi>Virgil</hi> to <hi>Pollio</hi> sings thus,
<q>
                     <l>But in the Meadows Rams shall Skarlet bear,</l>
                     <l>And changing, sometimes golden Fleeces wear.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is good also to meet Oxen treading out Corn, but better to meet them plowing, which although breaking the way hinder thy journey, yet by the favour of their <hi>Auspicium</hi> will recompence thee again. A Dog in a journey is fortunate, because <hi>Cyrus</hi> being cast into the woods was nourished by a Dog till he came to the Kingdom, which also the Angel, companion of <hi>Tobit</hi> did not scorn as a companion. The Castor, because he bites off his Testicles, and leaves them to the Hunters, is an ill omen, and portends that a man will injure himself. Also
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52070:73"/>
amongst small Animals, Mice signifie danger. For the same day that they did gnaw Gold in the Capitoll, both the Consuls were intercepted by <hi>Hannibal</hi> by way of ambush neer Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. The Locust making a stand in any place, or burning the place, hinders one from their wishes, and is an ill omen; on the contrary the Grass-hoppers promote a journey, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell a good event of things. The Spider weaving a line down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is said to signifie hope of money to come. Also the Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires, because they know how to provide for themselves, and to prepare safe nests for themselves, portend security, and riches, a great Army. Hence, when the Pismires had devoured a tame Dragon of <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> it was advised, that he should take heed of the tumult of a multitude. If a Snake meet thee, take heed of an ill tongued enemy; For this Animall hath no other power but in his mouth. A Snake creeping into <hi>Tiberius</hi> his pallace, portended his fall. Two Snakes were found in the bed of <hi>Sempronius Gracchus,</hi> wherefore a Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer told him, if he would let the male, or the female escape, either he or his wife would shortly dye; he preferring the life of his wife, killed the male, and let the female escape, and within a few dayes he dyed. So a Viper signfies lewd women, and wicked children; and an Eel signifies a man displeased with every body: For she lives apart from all other fishes, nor is ever found in the company of any. But amongst all <hi>Auspicia's</hi> and omens, there is none more effectuall, and potent then man, none that doth signifie the truth more cleerly. Thou shalt therefore diligently note, and observe the condition of the man that meeteth thee, his age, profession, station, gesture, motion, exercise, complexion, habit, name, words, speech, and all such like things. For seeing there are in all other Animals so many discoveries of presages, without all question these are more efficatious, and cleer, which are infused into mans soul; which <hi>Tully</hi> himself testifies, saying, that there is a certain <hi>Auspicium</hi> naturally in mens souls of their eternity, for the knowing of all the courses, and causes of things. In the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the City of Rome the head of a man was found with his whole face, which did presage the greatness of the Empire, and gave the name to the Mountain of the Capitoll. The
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52070:73"/>
                  <hi>Brutian</hi> souldiers fighting against <hi>Octavius,</hi> and M. <hi>Antonius,</hi> found an Aethiopian in the gate of their Castle; whom though they did slay as a presage of ill success, yet they were unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the batle, and <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> both Generals, were slain. Meeting of Monks is commonly accounted an ill omen, and so much the rather, if it be early in the morning, because these kind of men live for the most by the sudden death of men, as Vulturs do by slaughters.</p>

                     <l>Nor think I Heaven on them such knowledge states,</l>
                     <l>Nor that their prudence is above the fates.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now this instinct of nature, as saith <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> is more sublime then all humane apprehension, and very neer, and most like to prophecy. By this instinct there is a certain wonderfull light of divination in some Animals naturally, as it manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears in some Dogs, who know by this instinct theeves, and men that are hid, unknown both to themselves, and men, and finde them out, and apprehend them, falling upon them with a full mouth. By the like instinct Vulturs foresee future slaughters in batles, and gather together into places where they
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52070:74"/>
shall be, as if they fore-saw the flesh of dead Carkases. By the same instinct Partridges know their Dam, which they never saw and leave the Partridge which stole away her Dams Eggs, &amp; sate upon them. By the same instinct also certain hurtful and terrible things are perceived (the soul of the men being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant of them) whence terror, and horror ceaseth much upon men when they think nothing of these things. So a thief lying hid in any house, although no body knows, or thinks of his being there, strikes fear, and terror, and a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>someness of mind into the inhabitants of that house, although haply not of all, because the brightness of this instinct is not in all men; yet of some of them. So a harlot being hid in some very large house, is sometimes perceived to be there by some one that is altogether ignorant of her being there. It is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Histories that <hi>Heraiscus</hi> a certain Egyptian, a man of a divine nature, could discern unclean women, not only by his eyes, but by their voice, being heard afar off, and thereupon did fall into a most grievous headach. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> also makes mention of a certain woman in his time, that by the same instinct perceived a man whom she loved, coming two miles off. Also he relates that in his time was a certain Stork convicted of inchastity by the smell of the male, who being judged guilty by a multitude of Storks whom the male ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, discovering to them the fault of his mate, was, her feathers being first pulled off, torn in pieces by them. He also makes mention of a certain horse, who not knowing his dam, and leaping of her, when afterwards he understood what he had done, bit off his own Stones by way of revenge upon himself for his incest. The same doth <hi>Varro, Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> relate concerning horses. And <hi>Pliny</hi> makes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a certain Serpent, called the <hi>Asp,</hi> that did such a like thing, for she coming to a certain mans table in Egypt, was there daily fed, and she having brought forth some young, by one of which a son of her hosts was killed, after she knew of it, killed that young one, and would never return to that house any more. Now by these examples you see, how the lights of presage may descend upon some Animals, as signs, or marks
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52070:74"/>
of things, &amp; are set in their gesture, motion, voice, flying, going, meat, colour, and such like. For according to the doctrine of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> there is a certain power put into inferiour things, by which for the most part they agree with the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; whence also the racid consents of Animals seem to agree with divine bodies, and their bodies, and affections to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with their powers, by the name of which they are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the Dieties. We must consider therefore what Animals are Saturnall, what are Joviall, and what Martiall, and so of the rest, and according to their properties to draw forth their presages: so those birds which resemble <hi>Saturn,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> are all of them called terrible, and deadly, as the Scritch Owl, the Hawlet, and others which we have mentioned before, also the horn Owl, because she is a Saturnall Solitary bird, also nightly, and is reputed to be most unfortunately ominous, of which the Poet saith,
<q>
                     <l>The ugly Owl, which no bird well resents,</l>
                     <l>Foretels misfortunés, and most sad events.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But the Swan is a delicious bird, Venereall, and Dedicated to <hi>Phoebus,</hi> and is said to be most happy in her presages, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the <hi>Auspicia's</hi> of Mariners, because she is never drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in water, whence <hi>Ovid</hi> sings,
<q>
                     <l>Most happy is the cheerfull, singing Swan</l>
                     <l>In her presages—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There are also some birds that presage with their mouth, and singing, as the Crow, Pie, Daw, whence <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>—This did fore-show</l>
                     <l>Oft from the hollow holm that ominous Crow.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now the birds that portend future things by their flying are, <hi>viz.</hi> Buzzards, the bone-Breakers, Eagles, Vulturs, Cranes, Swans, and the like: for they are to be considered in their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52070:75"/>
flying, whether they fly slowly, or swiftly, whether to the right hand, or to the left, how many fly together: upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count if Cranes fly apace, they signifie a tempest: when slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fair weather. Also when two Eagles fly together, they are said to portend evill, because that is a number of confusion. In like manner thou shalt enquire into the reason of the rest, as this is shewed of number. Moreover it belongs to an artist to observe a similitude in these conjectures, as in <hi>Virgil, Venus</hi> dissembling, teacheth her son <hi>Aeneas</hi> in these verses.
<q>

                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>And Heaven surrounding in a long consort.</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Most wonderful is that kind of Auguring of theirs, who hear, &amp; understand the speeches of Animals, in which as amongst the Ancients, <hi>Melampus,</hi> and <hi>Tiresias,</hi> and <hi>Thales,</hi> and <hi>Apollonius</hi> the <hi>Tyanean,</hi> who as we read, excelled, and whom they report had excellent skill in the language of birds: of whom <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus,</hi> and <hi>Porphyrius</hi> speak, saying, that of old when <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> sate in company amongst his friends, seeing Sparrows sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon a tree, and one Sparrow coming from elswhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, making a great chattering and noise, and then flying away, all the rest following him, he said to his companions, that that Sparrow told the rest that an Asse being burdened with wheat fell down in a hole neer the City, and that the wheat was scattered upon the ground: many being much moved with these words, went to see, and so it was, as <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> said, at which they much wondered. Also <hi>Porphyrius</hi> the Platonist in his third book of Sacrifices, saith, that there
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52070:75"/>
was a Swallow: for it was certain, because every voice of any Animall is significative of some passion of its soul, as joy, sadness, or anger, or the like, which voices it is not so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a thing should be understood by men conversant about them. But <hi>Democritus</hi> himself declared this art, as saith <hi>Pliny,</hi> by naming the birds, of whose blood mixed together was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a Serpent, of which whosoever did eat, should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the voices of birds. And <hi>Hermes</hi> saith, if any one shall go forth to catch birds on a certain day of the Kalends of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> and shall boil the first bird which he catcheth, with the heart of a Fox, that all that shall eat of this bird, shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the voices of birds, and all other Animals. Also the <hi>Arabians</hi> say, that they can understand the meaning of bruits, who shall eat the heart, and liver of Dragons. <hi>Proclus</hi> also the Platonist believed, and wrote, that the heart of a Mole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to presages. There were also divinations, and <hi>Auspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia's</hi> which were taken from the inwards of sacrifices, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor whereof was <hi>Tages,</hi> of whom <hi>Lucan</hi> sang,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>And if the Inwards have no credit gained,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>And if this Art by</hi> Tages <hi>was but feigned.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Romane Religion thought that the liver was the head of the inwards. Hence the Sooth-sayers enquiring after future things in the inwards, did first look into the liver, in which were two heads, whereof the one was called the head for the City, the other for the enemy; and the head of this, or another part being compared together, they pronounced Victory, as we read in <hi>Lucan,</hi> that the inwards did signifie the slaughter of <hi>Pompeys</hi> men, and the Victory of <hi>Caesars,</hi> according to these verses,
<q>
                     <l>I'th inwards all defects are ominous</l>
                     <l>On part, and branch of th' entrals doth increase,</l>
                     <l>Another part is weak, and flagging lies,</l>
                     <l>Beats, and moves with quick pulse the arteries.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:52070:76"/>
Then the bowels being finished, they search the heart. Now if there were a sacrifice found without an heart, or a head was wanting in the Liver, these were deadly presages, and were called <hi>piacularia.</hi> Also if a sacrifice fled from the Altar, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing smitten, made a lowing, or fell upon any part of his body then he ought to do, it was the like ominous. We read that when <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> upon a day went forth to procession with his purple Robe, and sitting in a golden chair, and sacrifice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there was twice a Heart wanting; And when C. <hi>Marius Utica</hi> was sacrificing, there was wanting a Liver. Also when <hi>Caius</hi> the prince, and M. <hi>Marcellus,</hi> C. <hi>Claudius,</hi> and L. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius Coss:</hi> were offering sacrifices, that the Liver was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed away suddenly: and not long after, one of them dyed of a disease, another was slain by men of Lyguria, the entrals foretelling so much: which was thought to be done by the power of the Gods, or help of the divell: Hence it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a thing of great concernment amongst the Ancients as oft as any thing unusuall was found in the inwards: as when <hi>Sylla</hi> was sacrificing at Laurentum, the figure of a Crown ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the head of the Liver: which <hi>Posthumius</hi> the Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer interpreted to portend a Victory with a Kingdome, and therefore advised that <hi>Sylla</hi> should eat those entrals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The colour also of the inwards is to be considered. Of these <hi>Lucan</hi> made mention.
<q>
                     <l>Struck at the colour Prophets were with fear,</l>
                     <l>For with foul spots pale entrals tinged were.</l>
                     <l>Both black, and blew, with specks of sprinkled blood</l>
                     <l>They were—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>There was in times past such a venerable esteem of these arts, that the most potent, and wise men sought after them yea the Senate, and Kings did nothing without the Counsell of the <hi>Augures.</hi> But all these in these dayes, partly by the negligence of men, and partly by the authority of the Fathers, are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LVI. <hi>Of the Sooth sayings of Flashes, and Lightenings, and how Monstrous, and prodigious things are to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw the Sooth-sayings of Flashes, and Lightenings, and of wonders, and how monstrous, and prodigious things are to be interpreted, the Prophets, and Priests of <hi>Hetruscus</hi> have taught the Art. For they have ordained sixteen Regions of the Heavens, and have ascribed Gods to every one of them; and besides eleven kinds of Lightenings, and nine Gods, which should dart them forth, by shewing rules for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the signification of them. But as often as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, prodigious, and wondrous things happen, they do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, as is most certain, some great matter. Now their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter must be some excellent conjecturer of similitudes, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so some curious searcher, and of them who at that time are employed about the affairs of Princes, and Provinces. For the Celestials take such care only for Princes, peoples, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, that before the rest they might be prefigured, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished, by Stars, by Constellations, by wonders, and by prodigies. Now if the same thing, or the like hath been seen in former Ages, we must consider that very thing, and what happened after that, and according to these, to foretell the same, or the like because the same signs are for the same things, and the like for like. So prodigies have come before the birth, and death of many emient men and Kings; as <hi>Cicero</hi> makes mention of <hi>Midas</hi> a boy, into whose mouth, whilest he was sleeping, the Pismire put corns of Wheat, which was an omen of great riches. So Bees sate upon the mouth of <hi>Plato</hi> when he was sleeping in the Cradle, by which was soretold the sweetness of his speech. <hi>Hecuba,</hi> when she was bringing forth <hi>Paris,</hi> saw a burning Torch, which should set on fire Troy, and all Asia. There appeared unto the mother of <hi>Phalaris</hi> the image of <hi>Mercury</hi> pouring forth blood upon the earth, with which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52070:77"/>
the whole house was over-flowed. The mother of <hi>Dionysius</hi> dreamed she brought forth a <hi>Satyr,</hi> which prodigious dreams the event that followed made good. The wife of <hi>Tarquinius Priscus</hi> seeing a flame lick the head of <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that he should have the Kingdom. In like manner after Troy was taken, <hi>Aeneas</hi> disputing with <hi>Anchises</hi> his father concerning a flight, there appeared a flame licking the Crown of <hi>Ascanius</hi> his head, and doing of him no hurt: which thing, seeing it did portend the Kingdom to <hi>Ascanius,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to depart, for monstrous prodigies did fore-run great and eminent destruction. So we read in <hi>Pliny,</hi> that M. <hi>Attilius,</hi> and C. <hi>Portius</hi> being Consuls, it rained Milk and Blood, which did presage that a very great Pestilence should the next yeer over-spread Rome. Also in Lucania it rained spongi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iron &amp; in the yeer before <hi>Marcus Crassus</hi> was slain in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia; with which also all the souldiers of Lucania, being a very numerous Army, were slain. Also L. <hi>Paulus,</hi> and C. <hi>Marcellus</hi> being Consuls, it rained Wool about the Castle of Corisanum, neer which place a yeer after <hi>T. Annius</hi> was slain by <hi>Milus.</hi> Also in the wars of Denmark, the noise of Arms. and sound of a Trumpet was heard in the Aire. And <hi>Livie</hi> concerning the Macedonian wars, saith, in the yeer when <hi>Annibil</hi> dyed it rained blood for two dayes. Also concerning the second pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick war, he saith, that water mixed with blood came down from Heaven like rain, at that time when <hi>Annibal</hi> did spoil Italy. A little before the destruction of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>euctra the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians heard a noise of Arms in the temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and at the same time in the temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> the doors that were shut with bars, opened themselves, and the arms that were hanged on the wall, were found on the ground. The like events may be prognosticated of other like things, as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in times past something hath been foretold of them. But concerning these also, the judgements of the Celestial influencies must not be neglected, of which we shall more largely treat in the following Chapters.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LVII. <hi>Of Geomancy, Hydromaency, Aeromancy, Pyromancy, four Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations of Elements.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MOreover the Elements themselves teach us fatall events; whence those four famous kinds of Divinations, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy, Hydromancy, Aeromancy, and Pyromancy, have got their names, of which that Sorceress in <hi>Lucan</hi> seems to boast her self, when she saith,
<q>
                     <l>The Earth, the Aire, the Chaos, and the Skie,</l>
                     <l>The Seas, the Fields, the Rocks, and Mountains high</l>
                     <l>Foretell the truth—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The first therefore is Geomancy, which foresheweth future things by the motions of the earth, as also the noise, the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the trembling, the chops, the pits, and exhalation, and other impressions, the art of which <hi>Almadel</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> sets forth. But there is another kind of Geomancy, which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines by points written upon the earth, by a certain power in the fall of it, which is not of present speculation; but of that we shall speak hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now Hydromancy doth perform its presages by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of water, their ebbing and flowing, their increases, and depressions, their tempests, and colours, and the like; to which also are added visions, which are made in the waters. A kind of Divination found by the <hi>Persians,</hi> as <hi>Varro</hi> reports, a boy saw in the water the effigies of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which foretold in an hundred and fifty verses all the event of <hi>Mithridates</hi> his War. We read also that <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> practised Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy; for in the water he called up the gods, and learned of them things to come. Which art also <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> a long time after <hi>Numa</hi> practised. There was of old a kind of Hydroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, had in great esteem amongst the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Lecanomancy, from a skin full of water, upon which they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52070:78"/>
put plates of Gold, and Silver, and pretious Stones, written upon with certain images, names, and characters. To this may be referred that art, by which Lead, and Wax being melted, and cast into the water, do express manifest marks of images, what we desire to know. There were also in former years Fountains that did foretell things to come, as the <hi>Fathers-</hi>Fountain at <hi>Achaia,</hi> and that which was called the water of <hi>Juno</hi> in <hi>Epidaurus;</hi> but of these more in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where we shall speak of Oracles.</p>
               <p>Hither also may be referred the divination of Fishes, of which kind there was use made by the <hi>Lycians</hi> in a certain place, which was called <hi>Dina,</hi> neer the Sea, in a Wood dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> made hollow in the dry sand, into which, he that went to consult of future things, let down roasted meat, and presently that place was filled with waters, and a great multitude of Fish, and of strange shapes, unknown to men, did appear, by the forms of which the Prophet foretold what should come to pass. These things doth <hi>Atheneus</hi> more at large relate out of <hi>Polycharmus,</hi> in the History of the <hi>Lycians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the same maner doth Aeromancy divine by airy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, by the blowing of the Winds, by Rainbows, by Circles about the Moon and Stars, by Mists, and Clouds, and by imaginations in Clouds, and visions in the Aire.</p>
               <p>So also Pyromancy divines by fiery impressions, and by Stars with long Tailes, by fiery Colours, by visions, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in the fire. So the wife of <hi>Cicero</hi> foretold that he would be Consul the next year, because when a certain man after the Sacrifice was ended, would look in the ashes, there suddenly broke forth a flame. Of this kind are those that <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> speaks of, that terrene, pale, and buzzing fires presage tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, Circles about the snuffs of Candles betoken rain; if the flame fly turning, and winding, it portends wind. Also Torches when they strike the fire before them, and are not kindled: Also when a Coal sticks to Pots taken off from the fire, and when the fire casts off the ashes, and sparkles, or when ashes are hard grown together on the hearth, and when a Coal is very bright.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LVIII. <hi>Of the reviving of the dead, and of sleeping, and wanting victuals many years together.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Arabian</hi> Philosophers agree, that some men may elevate themselves above the powers of their body, and above their sensitive powers; and those being surmounted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into themselves by the perfection of the Heavens, and Intelligencies, a divine vigour. Seeing therefore all the souls of men are perpetuall, and also all the spirits obey the perfect souls; Magicians think that perfect men may by the powers of their soul repair their dying bodies with other inferiour souls newly separated, and inspire them again; As a Weesell that is killed, is made alive again by the breath, and cry of his Dam; And Lions make alive their dead Whelps by breathing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52070:79"/>
upon them. And because, as they say, all like things being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to their like, are made of the same natures; and every patient, and thing that receives into it self the act of any agent, is endowed with the nature of that agent, and made con-naturall. Hence they think, that to this vivification, or making alive, some Hearbs, and Magicall confections, such as they say are made of the ashes of the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> and the cast skin of a Snake do much conduce, which indeed to many seems fabulous, and to some impossible, unless it could be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted approved by an Historicall faith. For we read of some that have been drowned in water, others cast into the fire, and put upon the fire, others slain in war, others otherwise tryed, and after a few dayes were alive again, as <hi>Pliny</hi> testifies of <hi>Aviola,</hi> a man pertaining to the Consull, of L. <hi>Lamia, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Tubero, Corfidius, Gabienus,</hi> and many others. Also we read that <hi>Aesop</hi> the Tale-maker, <hi>Tindoreus, Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Palicy,</hi> the sons of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Thalia</hi> being dead, were raised to life again; also that many were by Physitians, and Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans raised from death again, as the Historians relate of <hi>Aesculapius;</hi> and we have above mentioned out of <hi>Juba,</hi> and <hi>Xanthus,</hi> and <hi>Philostratus</hi> concerning <hi>Tillo,</hi> and a certain Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian, and <hi>Apollonius</hi> the <hi>Tyanean.</hi> Also we read that <hi>Glaucus,</hi> a certain man that was dead, whom they say, beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Physitians coming to see it, the hearb Dragon-wort restored to life. Some say that he revived by the puting into his body a medicine made of Honey, whence the proverb, <hi>Glaucus</hi> was raised from death by taking in Honey into his body. <hi>Apuleius</hi> also relating the manner of these kinds of restorings to life, saith of <hi>Zachla</hi> the Egyptian prophet: The prophet being thus favourable, layes a certain Hearb upon the mouth of the body of a young man being dead, and another upon his brest, then turning towards-the East, or rising of the propitious Sun, praying silently (a great assembly of people striving to see it) in the first place heaved up his brest, then makes a beating in his veines, then his body to be filled with breath, after which the Carkase ariseth, and the young man speaks. If these things are true, the dying souls must, sometimes
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52070:79"/>
lying hid in their bodies, be oppressed with vehement extasies, and be freed from all bodily action: So that the life, sense, motion, forsake the body, but so, that the man is not yet truly dead, but lies astonied, and as it were dead for a certain time. And this is often found, that in times of Pestilence many that are carried for dead to the graves to be buryed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive again. The same also hath often befaln women, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of fits of the Mother. And <hi>Rabbi Moises</hi> out of the book of <hi>Galen,</hi> which <hi>Patriarcha</hi> translated, makes mention of a man, who was suffocated for six dayes, and did neither eat, nor drink, and his arteries became hard. And it is said in the same book, that a certain man by being filled with Water, lost the pulse of his whole body, so that his heart was not perceived to move, and he lay like a dead man. Also it is said that a man by reason of a fal from an high place, or great noise, or long staying under the Water, may fall into a swoun, which may continue fourty eight hours, and so he lye as if he were dead, with his face being very green. And in the same place there is mention made of a man that buried a man that seemed to be dead seventy two hours after his seeming decease, and so killed him, because he buried him alive, and there are given signs whereby it may be known who are alive; although they seem to be dead, and indeed will dye, unless there be some means used to recover them, as Phlebotomy, or some other cure. And these are such as very seldom happen. This is the manner, by which we understand Magicians, and Physitians do raise dead men to life, as they that were tryed by the sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Serpents, were by the Nation of the <hi>Marsi,</hi> and the <hi>Psilli</hi> restored to life. Now we may conceive that such kind of extasies may continue a long time, although a man be not truly dead, as it is in Dor-mice, and Crocodiles, and many other Serpents, which sleep all Winter, and are in such a dead sleep, that they can scarce be awakened with fire. And I have often seen a Dor mouse dissected, and continue immovable, as if she were dead, untill she was boyled, and then presently in boyling the water the dissected members did shew life. Also, although it be hard to be believed, we read in some approved
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52070:80"/>
Historians, that some men hvae slept for many yeers together, and in the time of sleep, untill they awaked, there was no alteration in them, as to make them seem older: The same doth <hi>Pliny</hi> testifie of a certain boy, whom he saith, being wearied with heat, and his journey, slept fifty seven yeers in a Cave. We read also that <hi>Epimenides Gnosius</hi> slept fifty seven yeers in a Cave. Hence the proverb arose, To outsleep <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides. M. Damascenus</hi> tels, that in his time a certain coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try man being wearied in Germany, slept for the space of a whole Autumn, and the Winter following, under a heap of hay, untill the Summer, when the hay began to be eaten up, then he was found awakened as a man halfe dead, and out of his wits. Eclesiasticall Histories confirm this opinion concerning the seven sleepers, whom they say slept 196 yeers. There was in Norvegia a Cave in a high Sea-shore, where, as <hi>Paulus Diaconus,</hi> and <hi>Methodius</hi> the Martyr write, seven men lay sleeping a long time without any corruption, and the people that went in to disturb them were contracted, or drawn together, so that after a while being forewarned by that punishment, they durst not hurt them. Now <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> a man of no mean repute amongst Philosophers was of opinion, that this long sleeping was appointed by God as a punishment for some certain sins. But <hi>Marcus Damascenus</hi> proves it by many reasons to be possible, and naturall, neither doth he think it irrationall, that some should without meat, and drink, and avoyding excrements, without consuming, or corruption, sleep many moneths. And this may befall a man by reason of some poisonous potion, or sleepy disease, or such like causes, for certain dayes, moneths, or years, according to the intention, or remission of the power of the medicine, or of the passions of their mind. And Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians say that there are some Antidotes, of which they that take too great a potion, shall be able to endure hunger a long time, as <hi>Elias</hi> in former time being fed with a certain food by an Angell, walked, and fasted in the strength of that meat, fourty dayes. And <hi>John Bocatius</hi> makes mention of a man in his time, in <hi>Venice,</hi> who would every yeer fast four dayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any meat. But that was a greater wonder, that there was
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52070:80"/>
a woman in lower Germany at the same time, who took no food till the thirteenth yeer of her age, which to us may seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, but that he lately confirmed it; as also he tels of a Miracle of our Age, that his brother <hi>Nicolaus Stone,</hi> an Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian by Nation, who lived twenty yeers in the wilderness without meat, till he dyed. That also is wonderfull which <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus</hi> mentions concerning a certain man, called <hi>Philinus,</hi> who used no meat, or drink, besides Milk. And there are grave Authors who describe a certain hearb of Sparta, with which they say the Scythians can endure twelve dayes hunger, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meat or drink, if they do but tast it, or hold it in their mouth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LIX. <hi>Of Divination by Dreams.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is also a certain kind of Divination by Dreams, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the traditions of Philosophers, the authorities of Divines, the examples of Histories, and daily experience. A Dream I call here, not vain Dreams, or idle imaginations: for those are vain, and have no Divination in them, but arise from the remains of watchings, and disturbance of the body. For as the mind is taken up about, and wearied with cares, it sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests it self to him that is asleep. I call that a Dream here, which is caused by the Celestiall influences in the phantastick spirit, mind, or body, being all well disposed. The rule of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this is found amongst Astrologers, in that part which is wrote concerning questions; but yet that is not sufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these kind of Dreams come by use to divers men after a divers manner, according to the divers quality, and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the phantastick spirit: wherefore there cannot be given one common rule to all for the interpretation of Dreams. But according to the opinion of <hi>Synesius,</hi> seeing there are the same accidents to things, and like befall like; so he which hath often fallen upon the same visible thing, hath assigned to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the same opinion, passion, fortune, action, event, and as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52070:81"/>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, the memory is confirmed by sence, and by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in memory the same thing knowledge is obtained, as also by the knowledge of many experiences, by little, &amp; little, arts, and sciences are obtained. After the same account you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of Dreams. Whence <hi>Synesius</hi> commands that every one should observe his Dreams, and their events, and such like rules, <hi>viz.</hi> to commit to memory all things that are seen, and accidents that befall, as well in sleep, as watching, and with a diligent observation consider with himself the rules by which these are to be examined, for by this means shall a Diviner be able by little, and little to interpret his Dreams, if so be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing slip out of his memory. Now Dreams are more efficati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when the Moon over-runs that Sign, which was in the ninth number of the Nativity, or revolution of that yeer, or in the ninth Sign from the Sign of perfection. For it is a most true, and certain divination, neither doth it proceed from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or humane Arts, but from purified minds, by divine inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now we shall discuss, and examine that which belongs to prophecyings, and oracles.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LX. <hi>Of Madness, and Divinations which are made when men are awake, and of the power of a Melancholy humor, by which Spirits are sometimes induced into mens bodies.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT happens also sometimes, that not only they that are asleep, but also they that are watchfull do with a kind of instigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of minde, Divine, which Divination <hi>Aristotle</hi> cals ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or a kind of madness, and teacheth that it proceeds from a melancholy humor, saying in his Treatise of divination: Melancholy men, by reason of their earnestness, do far better conjecture, and quickly conceive a habit, and most easily receive an impression of the Celestials. And in his Problemes saith, that the <hi>Sybils,</hi> and the <hi>Bacchides,</hi> and <hi>Niceratus</hi> the <hi>Syracusan,</hi> and <hi>Amon,</hi> were by their naturall Melancholy complexion
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52070:81"/>
Prophets, and Poets. The cause therefore of this madness, if it be any thing within the body, is a melancholy humor, not that which they call black choller, which is so obstinate, and terrible a thing, that the violence of it is said by Physitians, and Naturall Phylosophers, besides mandness, which it doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, also to entice evill spirits to seize upon mens bodies. Therefore we understand a melancholy humor here, to be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and white choller. For this, when it is stirred up, burns, and stirs up a madness conducing to knowledge, and divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, especially if it be helped by any Celestiall influx, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of <hi>Saturn,</hi> who seeing he is cold, and dry, as is a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly humor, hath his influence upon it, increaseth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth it. Besides, seeing he is the Author of secret contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and estranged from all publike affairs, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all the planets, doth alwaies as with call his mind from outward businesses, so also makes it ascend higher, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows upon him the knowledge, and passages of future things. And this is <hi>Aristotles</hi> meaning in his book of Problemes. By Melancholy, saith he, some men are made as it were divine, foretelling things to come, and some men are made Poets. He saith also, that all men that were excellent in any Science, were for the most part melancholy. <hi>Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> attest the same, saying, that there were some melancholy men, that had such excellent wits, that they were thought, and seemed to be rather divine then humane. So also there have been many melancholy men at first rude, ignorant, and untractable, as they say, <hi>Hesiod, Jon, Tynnichus, Calcinenses, Homer,</hi> and <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> were, who on a suddain were taken with a madness, and became Poets, and prophecied wonderfull, and divine things, which they themselves scarce understood. Whence divine <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Jon</hi> saith, many Prophets, after the violence of their madness was abated do not well understand what they wrote, yet treated acurately of each Art in their madness, as all Artists by reading of them judge. So great also they say the power of melancholy is of, that by its force, Celestiall spirits also are sometimes drawn into mens bodies, by whose presence, and instinct, antiquity testifies men have been made drunk, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52070:82"/>
spake most wonderful things. And that they think happens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a threefoold difference, according to a threefold apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the soul, <hi>viz.</hi> imaginative, rationall, and mentall. They say therefore, when the mind is forced with a melancholy humor, nothing moderating the power of the body, and passing beyond the bonds of the members, is wholly carried into imagination, and doth suddenly become a seat for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior spirits, by whom it oftentimes receives wonderfull wayes, and forms of manuall Arts. So we see that any most ignorant man doth presently become an excellent painter, or contrivers of building, and to become a master in anysuch Art. But when these kinds of spirits portend to us future things, then they shew those things which belong to the disturbing of the Elements, and changes of times, as rain, tempests, innuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, earthquakes, great mortality, famine, slaughter, and the like. As we read in <hi>Aulus Gelius,</hi> that <hi>Cornelius Patarus</hi> his Priest did at that time, when <hi>Cesar,</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> were to fight in <hi>Thessalia,</hi> being taken with a madness, foretell the time, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and issue of the battell. But when the mind is turned wholly into reason, it becomes a receptacle for midle spirits. Hence it obtains the knowledge, and understanding of natural, and humane things. So we see that a man sometimes doth on a suddain become a Philosopher, Physitian, or an excellent Orator, and foretels mutations of Kingdomes, and restitutions of Ages, and such things as belong to them, as the <hi>Sybill</hi> did to the <hi>Romanes;</hi> but when the mind is wholly elevated into the understanding, then it becomes a receptable of sublime spirits, and learns of them the secrets of divine things, as the Law of God, the orders of Angels, and such things as belong to the knowledge of things eternall, and salvation of souls. It foresees things which are appointed by Gods speciall predestination, as future prodigies, or miracles, the prophet to come, the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law. So the <hi>Sybills</hi> Prophecyed of Christ a long time before his coming. So <hi>Virgil</hi> understanding that Christ was at hand, and remembring what the <hi>Sybill Cumaea</hi> had said, sang thus to <hi>Pollio.</hi>

                     <l>And the deceitfull hearb of venome fall.</l>
                  </q>
Yet he intimates that some sparks of originall sin shall remain, when he saith,

               <p>IT is the opinion of some Divines, That God did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately creat the body of man, but by the assistance of the heavenly Spirits compound, and frame him; which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>Alcinous,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> favour; thinking that God is the chief Creator of the whole world, of the spirits both good and bad, and therefore immortalized them: but that all kinds of mortall animals were made at the command of God; for if he should have created them, they must have been immortall. The spirits therefore mixing Earth, Fire, Aire, and Water to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, made of them all, put together, one body, which they subjected to the service of the soul, assigning in it severall Provinces to each power thereof, to the meaner of them, mean and low places: as to Anger the Midrist, to Lust the Womb, but to the more noble senses the Head, as the Tower of the whole body, and then the manifold Organs of Speech. They divide the Sense into External, and Internall. The externall are divided into five, known to every one, to which there are allotted five Organs, or subjects, as it were Foundations; being so ordered, that they which are placed in the more eminent part of the body, have a greater degree of purity. For the Eyes placed in the uppermost place, are the most pure, and have an affinity with the Nature of Fire, and Light: then the Ears have the second order of place, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and are compared to the Aire: the Nostrils have the third order, and have a middle nature betwixt the Aire, and the Water; then the Organ of tasting, which is grosser and most like to the nature of Water: Last of all, the touching is diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through the whole body, and is compared to the grossness of Earth. The more pure senses are those which perceive their Objects farthest off, as Seeing, and Hearing, then the Smelling,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52070:83"/>
then the Tast, which doth not perceive but those that are nigh. But the touch perceives both wayes, for it perceives bodies nigh; and as Sight discerns by the medium of the Aire, so the touch perceives by the medium of a stick or pole, bodies Hard, Soft, and Moist. Now the touch only is common to all animals. Fot it is most certain that man hath this sence, and in this, and tast he excels all other animals, but in the other three he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled by some animals, as by a Dog, who Hears, Sees, and Smels more acutely then Man, and the Linx, and Eagles see more acutely then all other Animals, &amp; Man. Now the interior senses are, according to <hi>Averrois,</hi> divided into four, whereof the first is called Common sence, because it doth first collect, and perfect all the representations which are drawn in by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward senses. The second is the imaginative power, whose of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is, seeing it represents nothing, to retain those represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which are received by the former senses, and to present them to the third faculty of inward sense, which is the phantasie, or power of judging, whose work is also to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and judge by the representations received, what or what kind of thing that is of which the representations are, and to commit those things which are thus discerned, and adjudged, to the memory to be kept. For the vertues thereof in generall, are discourse, dispositions, persecutions, and flights, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings up to action: but in particular, the understanding of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellecutals, vertues, the manner of Discipline, Counsel, Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this is that which shews us future things by dreams: whence the Fancy is sometimes named the Phantasticall Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. For it is the last impression of the understanding; which, as saith <hi>Iamblicus,</hi> is belonging to all the powers of the mind, and forms all figures, resemblances of species, and operations, and things seen, and sends forth the impressions of other powers unto others: And those things which appear by sence, it stirs up into an opinion, but those things which appear by the Intellect, in the second place it offers to opinion, but of it self it receives images from all, and by its property, doth properly assign them, according to their assimilation, forms all the actions of the soul, and accommodates the externall to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52070:84"/>
the internall, and impresses the body with its impression. Now these senses have their Organs in the head, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sence, and imagination take up the two former Cels of the brain, although <hi>Aristotle</hi> placeth the Organ of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sence in the heart, but the cogitative power possesseth the highest, and middle part of the head; and lastly, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the hinmost part thereof. Moreover, the Organs of Voice, and Speech are many, as the inward muscles of the breast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ribs, the breasts, the lungs, the arteries, the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, the bowing of the Tongue, and all those parts and mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that serve for breathing. But the proper Organ of Speech is the Mouth, in which are framed words, and speeches, the Tongue, the Teeth, the Lips, the Palate, &amp;c. Above the sensible soul, which expresseth its powers by the Organs of the body, the incorporeall mind possesseth the highest place, and it hath a double nature, the one, which inquireth into the causes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and progress of those things which are contained in the order of nature, and is content in the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth, which is therefore called the contemplative intellect. The other is a power of the mind, which discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by consulting what things are to be done, and what things to be shunned is wholly taken up in consultation, and action, and is therefore called the Active Intellect. This Order of powers therefore nature ordained in man, that by the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sences we might know corporeall things, by the internall the representations of bodies, as also things abstracted by the mind and intellect, which are neither bodies, nor any thing like them. And according to this threefold order of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the soul, there are three appetites in the soul: The first is naturall, which is an inclination of nature into its end, as of a stone downward, which is in all stones: another is animal, which the sense follows, and it is divided into irascible, and concupiscible the third is intellective, which is called the will, differing from the sensitive, in this, the sensitive is of it self, of these things, which may be presented to the senses, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring, nothing unless in some manner comprehended. But the will, although it be of it self, of all things that are possible,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52070:84"/>
yet because it is free by its essence, it may be also of things that are impossible, as it was in the Devil, desiring himself to be equall with God, and therefore is altered and depraved with pleasure and continuall anguish, whilest it assents to the inferiour powers. Whence from its depraved appetite there arise four passions in it, with which in like manner the body is affected sometimes. Whereof the first is called Oble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, which is a certain quietness or assentation of the mind or will, because it obeys, and not willingly consents to that pleasantness which the senses hold forth; which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore defined to be an inclination of the mind to an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate pleasure. The second is called effusion, which is a remission of, or dissolution of the power, <hi>viz.</hi> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the oblectation the whole power of the mind, and intension of the present good is melted, and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it self to enjoy it. The third is vaunting, and loftiness, thinking it self to have attained to some great good, in the enjoyment of which it prides it self, and glorieth. The fourth and the last is Envy, or a certain kind of pleasure or delight at another mans harm, without any advantage to it self. It is said to be without any advantage to it self, because if any one should for his own profit rejoyce at an other mans harm, this would rather be out of love to himself, then out of ill wil to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And these four passions arising from a depraved appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of pleasure, the grief or perlexity it self doth also beget so many contrary passions, as Horror, Sadness, Fear, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at anothers good, without his own hurt, which we call Envy, <hi>i. e.</hi> Sadness at anothers prosperity, as pity is a certain kind of sadness at anothers misery.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe passions of the mind are nothing else but certain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or inclinations proceeding from the apprehension of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52070:85"/>
any thing, as of good or evill, convenient or inconvenient. Now these kind of apprehensions are of three sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, Rationall, and Intellectuall. And according to these three, are three sorts of passions in the Soul; For when they follow the sensitive apprehension, then they respect a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good or evill, under the notion of profitable, or unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, delightfull and offensive, and are called naturall, or animall passions. When they follow the rational apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and so respect good or bad, under the notions of Vertue or Vice, praise or disgrace, profitable or unprofitable, honest or dishonest, they are called rationall, or voluntary passions. When they follow the Intellectuall apprehension, and respect good or bad, under the notion of just or unjust, true or false, they are called intellectuall passions, or synderesis. Now the subject of the passions of the soul, is the concupitive power of the soul, and is divided into concupiscible, and ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scible, and both respect good and bad, but under a different notion. For when the concupiscible power respects good, and evil absolutely; Love or Lust, or on the contrary, hatred is caused: When it respects good, as absent, so desire is caused; or evill, as absent, or at hand, and so is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed horror, flying from, or loathing: or if it respect good, as present, then there is caused delight, mirth, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; but if evill, as present, then sadness, anxiety, grief. But the irascible power respects good or bad, under the notion of some difficulty; to obtain the one, or avoid the other, and this sometimes with confidence: and so there is caused Hope or Boldness; but when with diffidency, then Despair, and Fear. But when that irascible power riseth into revenge, and this be onely about some evill past, as it were of injury or hurt offered, there is caused Anger. And so we find eleven passions in the mind, which are, Love, Hatred, Desire, Horror, Joy, Grief, Hope, Despair, Boldness, Fear, and Anger.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LXIII. <hi>How the passions of the mind change the proper body, by changing the Accidents, and moving the spirit.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Phantasie, or imaginative power hath a ruling power over the passions of the soul, when they follow the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall apprehension. For this doth of its own power, according to the diversity of the Passions, First of all change the proper body with a sensible transmutation, by changing the Accidents in the body, and by moving the spirit upward or downward, inward, or outward, and by producing divers qualities in the members. So in joy, the spirits are driven outward, in fear, drawn back, in bashfulness, are moved to the brain. So in joy, the heart is dilated outward, by little, and little, in sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is constringed by little, and little inward. After the same manner in anger or fear, but suddenly. Again anger, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of revenge produceth heat, redness, a bitter tast, and a loosness. Fear induceth cold, trembling of the heart, speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness, and paleness. Sadness causeth sweat, and a blewish whiteness. Pitty, which is a kind of sadness, doth often ill affect the body of him that takes pitty, that it seems to be the body of another man affected. Also it is manifest, that amongst some lovers there is such a strong tye of love, that what the one suffers, the other suffers. Anxiety induceth dryness, and blackness. And how great heats love stirs up in the Liver, and pulse, Physitians know, discerning by that kind of judgement the name of her that is beloved, in an Heroick Passion. So <hi>Naustratus</hi> knew that <hi>Antiochus</hi> was taken with the love of <hi>Stratonica.</hi> It is also manifest that such like Passions, when they are most vehement, may cause death. And this is manifest to all men, that with too much joy, sadness, love, hatred, men ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times dye, and are sometimes freed from a disease. So we read, that <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrant, did both suddenly dye at the news of a Tragicall victory. So a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain woman seeing her son returning from the <hi>Canensian</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:52070:86"/>
battle, dyed suddenly. Now what sadness can do, is known to all. We know that Dogs oftentimes dye with sadness for the death of their masters. Sometimes also by reason of these like Passions, long diseases follow, and are sometimes cured. So also some men looking from an high place, by reason of great fear, tremble, are dim-sighted, and weakened, and sometimes loose their senses. So fears, and falling-sickness, sometimes follow sobbing. Sometimes wonderfull effects are produced, as in the son of <hi>Craesus,</hi> whom his mother brought forth dumb, yet a vehement fear, and ardent affection made him speak, which naturally he could never do. So with a suddain fall oftentimes life, sense, motion on a suddain leave the members, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently again are sometimes returned. And how much vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anger, joyned with great audacity, can do, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great shews, who being circumvented with a battle in <hi>India,</hi> was seen to send forth from himself lightening and fire. The Father of <hi>Theodoricus</hi> is said to have sent forth out of his body, sparks of fire; so that sparkling flames did leap out with a noyse. And such like things sometimes appear in beasts, as in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his horse, which is said to send forth a flame out of his mouth.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe foresaid Passions sometimes alter the body by way of imitation, by reason of the vertue which the likness of the thing hath to change it, which power the vehement imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moves, as in seeting the teeth on edge at the sight or hearing of something, or because we see or imagine another to eat sharp or soure things: So he which sees another gape, gapes also; and some when they hear any one name soure things, their tongue waxeth tart. Also the seeing of any filthy thing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52070:86"/>
causeth nauseousness. Many at the sight of mans blood fall into a swoun. Some when they see bitter meat given to any, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a bitter spitle in their mouth. And <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> saith, that he saw a man, that at the sight of a medicine, went to stool as oft as he pleased; when as neither the substance of the medicine, nor the odour, nor the tast of it came to him: but only a kind of resemblance was apprehended by him. Upon this account some that are in a dream think they burn, and are in a fire, and are fearfully tormented, as if they did truly burn, when as the substance of the fire is not neer them, but only a resemblance apprehended by their imagination. And sometimes mens bodies are transformed, and transfigured, and also transported, and this oft-times when they are in a dream, and sometimes when they are awake. So <hi>Cyprus</hi> after he was chosen King of <hi>Italy,</hi> did very much wonder at, and meditate upon the sight, and victory of Buls, and in the thought thereof did sleep a whole night, but in the morning was found horned, no otherwise then by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative power being stirred up by a vehement imagination, elevating corniferous humors into his head, and producing horns. For a vehement cogitation, whilest it vehemently moves the species, pictures out the figure of the thing thought on, which they represent in their blood, and the blood im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth from it self, on the members that are nourished by it, as upon those of the same body, so upon those of anothers. As the imagination of a woman with child impresseth the mark of the thing longed for upon her infant, and the imagination of a man bit with a mad Dog, impresseth upon his Urine the image of Dogs. So men may grow grey on a suddain. And some by the dream of one night, have grown up from boies into perfect men. Hitherto may be referred those many scarrs of King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobertus,</hi> and Marks of <hi>Franciscus,</hi> which they received, the one whilest he was afraid of correction, the other whilest he did wonderfully meditate upon the wounds of Christ. So, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are transpored from place to place, passing over rivers, fires, and unpassable places, <hi>viz.</hi> when the species of any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement desire, or fear, or boldness are impressed upon their
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52070:87"/>
spirits, and being mixed with vapors, do move the Organ of the touch in their original, together with phantasie, which is the original of locall motion. Whence they stir up the members, and Organs of motion to motion, and are moved without any mistake unto the imagined place, not out of sight, but from the interiour fantasy. So great a power is there of the soulupon the body, that which way soever that imagines, and dreams that it goes, thither doth it lead the body. We read many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples by which the power of the soul upon the body is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully explaned, as is that which <hi>Avicen</hi> describes of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain man, who when he pleased could affect his body with the palsie. They report of <hi>Gallus Vibius,</hi> that he did fall into madness, not casually, but on purpose: for whilest he did imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate mad men, he assimilated their madness to himself, and became mad indeed. And <hi>Austin</hi> makes mention of some men who would move their ears at their pleasure, and some that would move the crown of their head to their forehead, and could draw it back again when they pleased: and of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that could sweat at his pleasure. And it is well known, that some can weep at their pleasure, and pour forth abundance of tears: and that there are some that can bring up what they have swallowed, when they please, as out of a bag, by degrees. And we see that in these dayes there are many who can so imitate, and express the voices of Birds, Cattle, Dogs, and some men, that they can scarce at all be discerned. Also <hi>Pliny</hi> relates by divers examples, that women have been turned into men. <hi>Pontanus</hi> testifieth that in his time a certain women called <hi>Caietava,</hi> and another called <hi>Aemilia,</hi> who after many years, after they were married, were changed into men Now how much imagination can do upon the soul, no man is ignorant: for it is neerer to the substance of the soul then the sense is; wherefore it acts more upon the soul then the sense doth. So women by certain strong imaginations, dreams, and suggestions brought in by certain Magicall Arts do often times bind them into most strong loving of any one. So they say that <hi>Medea</hi> only by a dream, burnt in love towards <hi>Jason.</hi> So the soul sometimes is by a vehement imagination, or specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52070:87"/>
altogether abstracted from the body, as <hi>Celsus</hi> relates of a certain Presbyter, who as oft as he pleased, could make himself senseless, and lie like a dead man, that when any one pricked, or burned him, he felt no pain, but lay without any motion or breathing, yet he could, as he said, hear mens voices as it were afar off, if they cryed out aloud. But of these ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions we shall discourse more fully in the following Chapters.</p>

               <p>THE Passions of the Soul which follow the phantasie, when they are most vehement, cannot only change their own body, but also can transcend so, as to work upon another bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, so that some wonderfull impressions are thence produced in Elements, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es of the mind or body. For the Passions of the Soul are the chiefest cause of the temperament of its proper body. So the Soul being strongly elevated, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with a strong imagination, sends forth health or sickness, not only in its proper body, but also in other bodies. So <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicen</hi> is of the opinion, that a Camell may fall by the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of any one. So he which is bitten with a mad Dog pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fals into a madness, and there appear in his Urine the shapes of Dogs. So the longing of a woman with Child, doth act upon anothers body, when it Signs the infant in the womb with the mark of the thing longed for. So, many monstrous generations proceed from monstrous imaginations of women
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52070:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with Child, as <hi>Marcus Damascenus</hi> reports was at <hi>Petra San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta,</hi> a Town scituated upon the territories of <hi>Pisa,</hi> viz. a wench that was presented to <hi>Charls</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who was rough and hairy all over her body, like a wild beast, whom her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affected with a religious kind of horrour upon the picture of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> which was by her bed, in time of conception, afterwards brought after this fashion. And this we see is not only in men, but also is done amongst bruit Creatures. So we read that <hi>Jacob</hi> the Patriarch, with his speckled Rods set in the watering places, did discolour the Sheep of <hi>Laban.</hi> So the imaginative powers of Pea-Cocks, and other Birds, whilest they be coupling, impress a colour upon their wings. Whence we produce white Pea-Cocks, by hanging round the places where they couple, with white Clothes. Now by these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples it appears how the affection of the phantasie, when it vehemently intends it self, doth not only affect its own proper body, but also anothers. So also the desire of Witches to hurt, doth bewitch men most perniciously with stedfast lookes. To these things <hi>Avicen, Aristotle, Algazel,</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> assent. For it is manifest that a body may most easily be affected with the vapour of anothers diseased body, which we plainly see in the Plague, and Leprosie. Again, in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of the eyes there is so great a power, that they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch and infect any that are near them, as the Cockatrice, or Basilisk, killing men with their looks. And certain women in <hi>Scythia,</hi> amongst the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and <hi>Triballi,</hi> killed whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they looked angry upon. Therefore let no man wonder that the body, and soul of one may in like manner be affected with the mind of another, seeing the mind is far more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, strong, fervent, and more prevalent by its motion then vapours exhaling out of bodies; neither are there wanting Mediums, by which it should work, neither is anothers body less subjected to anothers mind then to anothers body. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account they say, that a man by his affection, and habit only, may act upon another. Therefore Philosophers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, that the society of evill, and mischievous men be shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52070:88"/>
for their soul being full of noxious rayes, infects them that are near with a hurtfull Contagion. On the contrary, they advise that the society of good, and fortunate men be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured after, because by their nearness they do us much good. For as the smell of Assa-fetida, or Musk, so of bad something of bad, of good something of good, is derived upon them that are nigh, and sometimes continues a long time. Now then if the foresaid Passions have so great a power in the Phantasie, they have certainly a greater power in the reason, in as much as the reason is more excellent then the Phantasie; and lastly, they have much greater power in the mind; for this, when it is fixt upon God for any good with its whole intention, doth oftentimes affect anothers body as well as its own with some divine gift. By this means we read that many miracles were done by <hi>Apollonius, Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Empedocles, Philolaus,</hi> and many Prophets, and holy men of our Religion.</p>
               <p>But of these more fully in the following Chapters, where we shall discourse of Religion.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Passions of the mind are much helped, and are helpfull, and become most powerfull by vertue of the Heaven, as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52070:89"/>
they agree with the heaven, either by any naturall agreement, or voluntary Election. For as saith <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> he which choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that which is the better, seems to differ nothing from him who hath this of nature. It conduceth therefore very much for the receiving the benefit of the Heavens, in any work, if we shall by the Heaven make our selves sutable to it in our thoughts, affections, imaginations, elections, deliberations, contemplations, and the like. For such like passions do vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently stir up our spirit to their likeness, and suddenly exposs us, and ours to the superior significators of such like passions; and also by reason of their dignity, and neerness to the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, do much more partake of the Celestials, then any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall things. For our mind can through imaginations, or reason by a kind of imitation, be so conformed to any Star, as suddenly to be filled with the vertues of that Star, as if it were a proper receptacle of the influence thereof. Now the contemplating mind, as it withdraws it self from all sense, imagination, nature, and deliberation, and cals it self back to things separated, unless as it exposeth it self to <hi>Saturn,</hi> is not of present consideration, or enquiry. For our mind doth effect divers things by faith, which is a firm adhesion, a fixt intension, and vehement application of the worker, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, to him that co-operates in any thing, and gives power to the work which we intend to do. So that there is made as it were in us the image of the vertue to be received, and the thing to be done in us, or by us. We must therefore in every work, and application of things, affect vehemently, imagine, hope, and believe strongly, for that will be a great help. And it is verified amongst Physitians, that a strong belief, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted hope, and love towards the Physitian, and medicine, conduce much to health, yea more sometimes than the medicine it self. For the same that the efficacy, and vertue of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine works, the same doth the strong imagination of the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian work, being able to change the qualities in the body of the sick, especially when the patient placeth much confidence in the Physitian, by that means disposing himself for the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52070:89"/>
receiving the vertue of the Physitian, and Physick. Therefore he that works in Magick, must be of a constant belief, be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, and not at all doubt of the obtaining the effect. For as a firm, and strong belief doth work wonderfull things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be in false works, so distrust and doubting doth dissipate, and break the vertu of the mind of the worker, which is the medium betwixt both extreams, whence it happens, that he is frustrated of the desired influence of the superiors, which could not be joyned, and united to our labours without a firm, and solid vertue of our mind.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Philosophers, especially the <hi>Arabians,</hi> say, that mans mind, when it is most intent upon any work, through its passion, and effects, is joyned with the mind of the Stars, and Intelligencies, and being so joyned is the cause that some won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull vertue be infused into our works, and things; and this, as because there is in it an apprehension, and power of all things, so because all things have a naturall obedience to it, and of necessity an efficacy, and more to that which desires them with a strong desire. And according to this is verified the Art of Characters, images, inchantments, and some speeches, and many other wonderfull experiments to every thing which the mind affects. By this means whatsoever the mind of him that is in vehement love affects, hath an efficacy to cause love, &amp; whatsoever the mind of him that strongly hates, dictates, hath an efficacy to hurt, and destory. The like is in other things, which the mind affects with a strong desire. For all those things which the mind acts, and dictates by Characters, Figures, Words, Speeches, Gestures, and the like, help the appetite of the soul, and acquire certain wonderfull vertues, as from the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52070:90"/>
soul of the operator, in that hour when such a like appetite doth invade it, so from the opportunity, and Celestiall influence, moving the mind in that manner. For our mind, when it is carried upon the great excess of any Passion, or vertue, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times presently takes of it self a strong, better, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient hour, or opportunity. Which <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> in his third book against the Gentiles, confesseth. So many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull vertues both cause, and follow certain admirable opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by great affections, in those things which the soul doth dictate in that hour to them. But know that such kind of things confer nothing, or very little but to the Author of them, and to him which is inclined to them, as if he were the Author of them: And this is the manner by which their efficacy is found out. And it is a generall rule in them, that every mind that is more excellent in its desire, and affection, makes such like things more fit for it self, as also efficatious to that which it desires. Every one therefore that is willing to work in Magick, must know the vertue, measure, order, and degree of his own soul, in the power of the universe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THere is also a certain vertue in the minds of men, of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, attracting, hindring, and binding to that which they desire, and all things obey them, when they are carried into a great excess of any Passion or vertu, so as to exceed those things which they bind. For the superior binds that which is inferior, and converts it to it self, and the inferior is by the same reason converted to the superior, or is otherwise affected, and wrought upon. By this reason things that receive a superior degree of any Star, bind, or attract, or hinder things which have an inferior, according as they agree, or disagree amongst themselves. Whence a Lion is afraid of a Cock, because the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52070:90"/>
presence of the Solary vertue is more agreeable to a Cock then to a Lion: So a Loadstone draws Iron, because in order it hath a superior degree of the Celestiall Bear.</p>
               <p>So the Diamond hinders the Loadstone, because in the order of <hi>Mars</hi> it is superior then it. In like manner any man when he is opportunely exposed to the Celestiall influencies, as by the affections of his mind, so by the due applications of naturall things, if he become stronger in a Solary vertue, binds and draws the inferior into admiration, and obedience, in order of the Moon to servitude or infirmities, in a Saturnall order to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness or sadness; in order of <hi>Jupiter</hi> to worship, in order of <hi>Mars</hi> to fear, and discord, in order of <hi>Venus</hi> to love, and joy, in 3. <hi>Mercuriall</hi> order to perswasion, and obsequiousness, and the like. Now the ground of such a kind of binding is the very vehement, and boundless affection of the souls, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Celestiall order. But the dissolutions, or hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of such a like binding, are made by a contrary effect, and that more excellent or strong, for as the greater excess of the mind binds, so also it looseth, and hindreth. And lastly, when the fearest <hi>Venus,</hi> oppose <hi>Saturn.</hi> When <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Venus</hi> or <hi>Jupiter:</hi> for Arstologers say, that these are most at enmity, and contrary the one to the other <hi>(e. i.)</hi> causing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects in these inferior bodies; For in the heaven, where there is nothing wanting, where all things are governed with love, there can in no wise be hatred, or enmity.</p>

               <p>IT being shewed that there is a great power in the affections of the soul, you must know moreover, that there is no less Vertue in words, and the names of things, but greatest of all in speeches, and motions, by which we chiefly differ from bruits, and are called rationall, not from reason, which is taken for that part of the soul, which contains the affections,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52070:91"/>
which <hi>Galen</hi> saith, is also common to bruits, although in a less degree; but we are called rationall, from that reason which is according to the voice understood in words, and speech, which is called declarative reason, by which part we do chiefly excell all other Animals. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greek signifies, reason, speech, and a word. Now a word is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> internall, and uttered; An internall word is a conception of the mind, and motion of the soul, which is made without a voice. As in dreams we seem to speak, and dispure with our selves, and whilest we are awake we run over a whole speech silently. But an uttered word hath a certain act in the voice, and properties of locution, and is brought forth with the breath of a man, with opening of his mouth, and with the speech of his tongue, in which nature hath coupled the corporeall voice, and speech to the mind, and understanding making that a declarer, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the conception of our intellect to the hearers, And of this we now speak. Words therefore are the fittest medium betwixt the speaker and the hearer, carrying with them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the conception of the mind, but also the vertue of the speaker with a certain efficacy unto the hearers, and this often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with so great a power, that oftentimes they change not only the hearers, but also other bodies, and things that have no life. Now those words are of greater efficacy then others, which represent greater things, as intellectuall, Celestiall, and supernaturall, as more expresly, so more misteriously. Also those that come from a more worthy tongue, or from any of a more holy order: for these, as it were certain Signs, and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, receive a power of Celestiall, and supercelestiall things, as from the vertue of things explained, of which they are the vehicula, so from a power put into them by the vertue of the speaker.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LXX. <hi>Of the vertue of proper names.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THat proper names of things are very necessary in Magicall operations, almost all men testifie: For the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power of things proceeds first from the objects to the senses, and then from these to the imagination, and from this to the mind, in which it is first conceived, and then is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by voices, and words. The <hi>Platonists</hi> therefore say, that in this very voice, or word, or name framed, with its Articles, that the power of the thing as it were some kind of life, lies under the form of the signification. First conceived in the mind as it were through certain seeds of things, then by voices or words, as a birth brought forth, and lastly kept in writings. Hence Magicians say, that proper names of things are certain rayes of things, every where present at all times, keeping the power of things, as the essence of the thing signified, rules, and is discerned in them, and know the things by them, as by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and living Images. For as the great operator doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce divers species, and particular things by the influencies of the Heavens, and by the Elements, together with the vertues of Planets; so according to the properties of the influencies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names result to things, and are put upon them by him who numbers the multitude of the Stars, calling them all by their names, of which names Christ in another place speaks, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Your names are written in Heaven. Adam</hi> therefore that gave the first names to things, knowing the influencies of the Heavens, and properties of all things, gave them all names according to their natures, as it is written in <hi>Genesis,</hi> where God brought all things that he had created before <hi>Adam,</hi> that he should name them, and as he named any thing, so the name of it was, which names indeed contain in them wonderfull powers of the things signified. Every voice therefore that is significative, first of all signifies by the influence of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall harmony: Secondly, by the imposition of man, although
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52070:92"/>
oftentimes otherwise by this, then by that. But when both significations meet in any voice or name, which are put upon them by the said harmony or men, then that name is with a double vertue, <hi>viz.</hi> naturall, and arbitrary, made most efficati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to act, as oft as it shall be uttered in due place, and time, and seriously with an intension exercised upon the matter rightly disposed, and that can naturally be acted upon by it. So we read in <hi>Philostratus,</hi> that when a maid at <hi>Rome</hi> dyed the same day she was married, and was presented to <hi>Apollonius,</hi> he acurately inquired into her name, which being known, he pronounced some occult thing, by which she revived. It was an observation amongst the <hi>Romanes</hi> in their holy rites, that when they did besiege any City, they did diligently enquire into the proper, and true name of it, and the name of that God, under whose protection it was, which being known, they did then with some verse call forth the Gods that were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of that City, and did curse the inhabitants of that City, so at length their Gods being absent, did overcome them, as <hi>Virgil</hi> sings,
<q>
                     <l>—That kept this Realm, our Gods</l>
                     <l>Their Altars have for sook, and blest abodes.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now the verse with which the Gods were called out, and the enemies were curst, when the City was assaulted round about, let him that would know, finde it out in <hi>Livy,</hi> and <hi>Macrobius;</hi> but also many of these <hi>Serenus Samonicus</hi> in his book of secret things makes mention of.</p>

               <p>BEsides the vertues of words, and names, there is also a greater vertue found in sentences, from the truth contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, which hath a very great power of impressing, changing, binding, and establishing, so that being used it doth shine the more, and being resisted is more confirmed, and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solidated; which vertue is not in simple words, but in senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by which any thing is affirmed, or denyed, of which sort are verses, inchantments, imprecations, deprecations, orations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, obtestations, adjurations, conjurations, and such like. Therefore in composing verses, and orations, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the vertue of any Star, or Deity, you must diligently consider what vertues any Star contains, as also what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and operations, and to infer them in verses, by praising, extolling, amplifying, and setting forth those things which such a kind of Star is wont to cause by way of its influence, and by vilifying, and dispraising those things which it is wont to destroy, and hinder, and by supplicating, and begging for that which we desire to get, and by condemning, and detesting that which we would have destroyed &amp; hindred: and after the same manner to make an elegant oration, and duly distinct by Articles, with competent numbers, and proportions. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Magicians command that we call upon, and pray by the names of the same Star, or name, to them to whom such a verse belongs, by their wonderfull things, or miracles, by their courses, and waies in their sphear, by their light, by the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their Kingdome, by the beauty, and brightness that is in it, by their strong, and powerfull vertues, and by such like as these. As <hi>Psyche</hi> in <hi>Apuleius</hi> prayes to <hi>Ceres;</hi> saying, I beseech thee by thy fruitfull right hand, I intreat thee by the joyfull Ceremonies of harvests, by the quiet silence of thy chests, by the winged Chariors of Dragons thy servants, by the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52070:93"/>
furrows of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> earth, the devouring Wagon, the clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my earth, by the place of going down into cellars at the light Nuptials of <hi>Proserpina,</hi> and returns at the light inventions of her daughter, and other things which are concealed in her temple in the City <hi>Eleusis</hi> in <hi>Attica.</hi> Besides, with the divers sorts of the names of the Stars, they command us to call upon them by the names of the Intelligencies, ruling over the Stars themselves, of which we shall speak more at large in their proper place. They that desire further examples of these, let them search into the hymns of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> then which nothing is more efficatious in naturall Magick, if they together with their circumstances, which wise men know, be used according to a due harmony, with all attention. But to return to our purpose. Such like verses being aptly, and duly made according to the rule of the Stars, and being full of signification, &amp; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and opportunely pronounced with vehement affection, as according to the number, proportion of their Articles, so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the form resulting from the Articles, and by the violence of imagination, do confer a very great power in the inchanter, and sometimes transfer it upon the thing inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to bind, and direct it to the same purpose for which the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and speeches of the inchanter are intended. Now the instrument of the inchanters is a most pure harmoniacall spirit, warm, breathing, living, bringing with it motion, affection and signification, composed of its parts, endued with sence, and conceived by reason. By the quality therefore of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by the Celestiall similitude thereof, besides those things which have already been spoken of, verses also from the opportunity of time, receive from above most excellent vertues, and indeed more sublime, and efficatious then spirits, &amp; vapors exhaling out of the Vegetable life, out of hearbs, roots, gums, aromaticall things, and fumes, and such like. And therefore Magicians inchanting things, are wont to blow, and breath-up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the words of the verse, or to breath in the vertue with the spirit, that so the whole vertue of the soul be directed to the thing inchanted, being disposed for the receiving the said vertue. And here it is to be noted, that every oration, writting,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52070:93"/>
and words, as they induce accustomed motions by their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed numbers, and proportions, and form, so also besides their usuall order, being pronounced, or wrote backwards, more unto unusuall effects.</p>

And whatsoever is in the mind, in voice, in word, in oration, and in speech, the whole, and all of this is in writing also. And as nothing which is conceived in the mind is not expressed by voice, so nothing which is expressed is not also written. And therefore Magicians command, that in every work, there be imprecations, and inscriptions made, by which the operator may express his affection: that if he gather an Hearb, or a Stone, he declare for what use he doth it; if he make a picture, he say, and write to what end he maketh it; which imprecations, and inscriptions, <hi>Albertus</hi> also in his book

called <hi>Speculum,</hi> doth not disallow, without which all our works would never be brought into effect; Seeing a disposition doth not cause an effect, but the act of the disposition. We find also that the same kind of precepts was in use amongst the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, as <hi>Virgil</hi> testifies, when he sings,

               </head>
               <p>GOD gave to man a mind, and speech, which (as saith <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Trismegistus)</hi> are thought to be a gift of the same vertue, power, and immortality. The omnipotent God hath by his providence divided the speech of men into divers languages; which languages have according to their diversity received divers, and proper Characters of writing, consisting in their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order, number, and figure, not so disposed, and formed by hap, or chance, nor by the weak judgement of man, but from above, whereby they agree with the Celestiall, and divine bodies, and vertues. But before all notes of languages, the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52070:95"/>
writing of the Hebrews is of all the most sacred in the figures of Characters, points of vowels, and tops of accents, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in matter, form, and spirit.</p>
               <p>The position of the Stars being firct made in the seat of God, which is heaven, after the figure of them (as the masters of the Hebrews testifie) are most fully formed the letters of the Celestiall mysteries, as by their figure, form, and signification, so by the numbers signified by them, as also by their various harmony of their conjunction. Whence the more curious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubals of the Hebrews do undertake by the figure of their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the forms of Characters, and their signature, simpleness, composition, separation, crookedness, directness, defect, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding, greatness, litleness, crowning opening, shutting, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, transmutation, joyning together, revolution of letters, and of points, and tops, and by the supputation of numbers by the letters of things signified to explain all things, how they proceed from the first cause, and are again to be reduced into the same. Moreover they divide the letters of their Hebrew Alphabet, <hi>viz.</hi> into twelve simple, seven double, and three mothers, which they say signifie as Characters of things, the twelve Signs, seven Planets, and three Elements, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, Water, and Earth, for they account Aire no Element, but as the glew, and spirit of the Elements. To these also they appoint points, and tops: As therefore by the aspects of Planets, and Signs, together with the Elements, the working spirit, and truth all things have been, and are brought forth, so by these Characters of letters, and points, signifying those things that are brought forth, the names of all things are appointed, as certain Signs, and vehicula's of things explained carrying with them every where their essence, and vertues. The profound meanings, and Signs are inherent in those Characters, and figures of them, as also numbers, place, order, and revolution; so that <hi>Origenes</hi> therefore thought that those names being translated into another Idiome, do not retain their proper vertue. For only originall names, which are rightly imposed, because they signify naturally, have a naturall activity: It is not so with them which signifie at pleasure, which have no
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52070:96"/>
activity, as they are signifying, but as they are certain naturall things in themselves. Now if there be any originall, whose words have a naturall signification, it is manifest that this is the Hebrew, the order of which he that shall profoundly, and radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally observe. and shall know to resolve proportionably the letters thereof, shall have a rule exactly to find out any Idiome. There are therefore two and twenty Letters, which are the foundation of the world, and of creatures that are, and are named in it, and every saying, and every creature are of them, and by their revolutions receive their Name, being, and Vertue.</p>
               <p>He therefore that will find them out, must by each joyning together of the Letters so long examine them, untill the voice of God is manifest, and the framing of the most sacred letters be opened and discovered. For hence voices, and words have efficacy in Magicall works: because that in which nature first exerciseth Magicall efficacy, is the voice of God. But these are of more deep speculation, then to be handled in this book. But to return to the division of the Letters. Of these, amongst the Hebrews, are three mothers, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </gap>; are simple. The same rule is amongst the Chaldeans; And by the imitation of these also the letters of other tongues are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed to Signs, Planets, and Elements, after their order. For the Vowels in the Greek tongue, <hi>viz.</hi> AEHIOT<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are attributed to the twelve Signs of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> the other five <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> represent the four Elements, and the spirit of the world. Amongst the Latine there is the same signification of them. For the five Vowels AEIOU, and J and V Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants are ascribed to the seven Planets; but the Consonants BCDFGLMNPRST are answerable to the twelve Signs. The rest <hi>viz.</hi> KQXZ make four Elements. H the aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration represents the Spirit of the World. Y because it is a Greek, and not a Latine Character, and serving only to Greek words, follows the nature of its Idiome.</p>
               <p>But this you must not be ignorant of, that it is observed by
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52070:96"/>
all wise men, that the Hebrew letters are the most efficacious of all, because they have the greatest similitude with Celestials, and the world, and that the letters of the other tongues have not so great an efficacy, because they are more distant from them. Now the dispositions of these, the following Table will explain. Also all the Letters have double numbers of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>viz.</hi> Extended, which simply express of what number the letters are, according to their order: and collected, which recollect with themselves the numbers of all the preceding letters. Also they have integrall numbers, which result from the names of Letters, according to their various manners of numbring. The vertues of which numbers, he that shall know, shall be able in every tongue to draw forth wonderfull myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by their letters, as also to tell what things have been past, and foretell things to come. There are also other myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious joynings of letters with numbers: but we shall abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discourse of all these in the following Books: Wherefore we will now put an end to this first Book.</p>

Then the wickedness of some Pulpit-sycophants, and of some School-Sophisters incessantly raging against me for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation I put forth concerning the Vanity of things, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the word of God, and contending against me continually with bitter hatred, envy, malice, and calumnies, hindred me from putting of it forth; whereof some very proudly, with a full mouth, and loud voice aspersed me with impiety in the Temple amongst a promiscuous people.

Hence I began to be at a stand, whether I should put forth the rest of the book or no, whilest I did doubt that I should by this means expose my self to greater calumnies, and as it were cast my self out of the smoke into the fire, a certain rude fear seised upon me, least by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them forth I should seem more offensive then officious to you,</hi>

have root, and foundation in them: yet nevertheless without naturall vertues, of Mathematicall Doctrines only works like to naturals can be produced, as <hi>Plato</hi> saith, a thing not partaking of truth or divinity, but certain Images kin to them, as bodies going, or speaking, which yet want the Animall faculty, such as were those which amongst the Ancients were called <hi>Dedalus</hi> his Images, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, of which <hi>Aristotle</hi> makes mention, <hi>viz.</hi> the threefooted Images of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and <hi>Dedalus,</hi> moving themselves, which <hi>Homer</hi> saith came out of their own accord to the exercise, and which we read, moved themselves at the feast of <hi>Hiarba</hi> the Philosophicall Exerciser: As also that golden Statues performed the offices of Cup bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Carvers to the guests. Also we read of the Statues of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which did speak, and the wooden Dove of <hi>Arthita,</hi> which did fly, and the miracles of <hi>Boethius,</hi> which <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> made mention of, <hi>viz Diomedes</hi> in Brass, sounding a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and a brazen Snake hissing and pictures of birds singing most sweetly. Of this kind are those miracles of Images which proceed from Geometry, and Opticks, of which we made some mention in the first book, where we spoke of the Element of Aire. So there are made glasses, some Concave, others of the form of a Columne, making the representations of things in the Aire feem like shadows at a distance: of which sort <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> in their Books <hi>De Perspectiva,</hi> and <hi>Speculis,</hi> taught the making, and the use. And we read that <hi>Magnus Pompeius</hi> brought a certain glass amongst the spoils from the East, to <hi>Rome,</hi> in which were seen Armies of Armed men. And there are made certain transparent glasses, which being dipped in some certain juices of Hearbs, and irradiated with an artificiall light, fill the whole Aire round about with visions. And I know how to make reciprocall glasses, in which the Sun shining, all things which were illustrated by the raies thereof are apparently seen many miles off. Hence a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, expert in naturall Philosophy, and Mathematicks, and knowing the middle sciences consisting of both these, Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, Musick, Geometry, Opticks, Astronomie, and such sciences that are of weights, measures, proportions, articles,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52070:100"/>
and joynts, knowing also Mechanicall Arts resulting from these, may without any wonder, if he excell other men in Art, and wit, do many wonderfull things, which the most prudent, and wife men may much admire. Are there not some reliques extant of the Ancients works, <hi>viz. Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Alexanders</hi> pillars, the gate of <hi>Caspia</hi> made of brass, and shut with Iron beams, that it could by no Wit or Art, be broken? And the Pyramis of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> erected at Rome neer the hill Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus, and Mountains built by Art in the middle of the Sea, and Towers, and heaps of Stones, such as I saw in <hi>England</hi> put together by an incredible Art. And we read in faithfull Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, that in former times Rocks have been cut off, and Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies made, and Mountains made into a Plain. Rocks have been digged through, Promontories have been opened in the Sea, the bowels of the Earth made hollow, Rivers divided, Seas joyned to Seas, the Seas restrained, the bottome of the Sea been searched, Pools exhausted, Fens dryed up, new Islands made, and again restored to the continent, all which, although they may seem to be against nature, yet we read have been done, and we see some reliques of them remaining till this day, which the vulgar say were the works of the divell, seeing the Arts, and Artificers thereof have been dead out of all memory, neither are there any that care to understand, or search into them. Therefore they seeing any wonderfull sight, do impute it to the divell, as his work, or think it is a miracle, which indeed is a work of naturall, or Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Philosophy. As if any one should be ignorant of the vertue of the Loadstone, and should see heavy Iron drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or hanged in the Aire (as we read the Iron Image of <hi>Mercury</hi> did long since as <hi>Treveris</hi> hand up in the middle of the Temple by Loadstones, this verse attesting the same.
<q>The Iron white rod bearer flies i'th Aire.</q>
The like to which we read was done concerning the image of the Sun at Rome, in the Temple of <hi>Serapis)</hi> would not such an ignorant man, I say, presently say it is the work of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell? But if he shall know the vertue of the Loadstone to the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52070:101"/>
Iron, and shall make triall of it, he presently ceaseth to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and doth no more scruple it to be the work of nature. But here it is convenient that you know, that as by naturall vertues we collect naturall vertues, so by abstracted, mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall, and celestiall, we receive celestiall vertues, as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, life, sense, speech, southsaying, and divination, even in matter less disposed, as that which is not made by nature, but only by art. And so images that speak, and foretell things to come, are said to be made, as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> relates of a brazen head made under the rising of <hi>Saturn,</hi> which they say spake with a mans voice. But he that will choose a disposed matter, and most fit to receive, and a most powerfull agent, shall undoubtedly produce more powerfull effects. For it is a generall opinion of the Pythagoreans, that as Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall things are more formall then Naturall, so also they are more efficacious: as they have less dependence in their being, so also in their operation. But amongst all Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call things, numbers, as they have more of form in them, so also are more efficacious, to which not only Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, but also Hebrew, and Christian Divines do attribute vertue, and efficacy, as well to effect what is good, as what is bad.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>SEverinus Boethius</hi> saith, that all things which were first made by the nature of things in its first Age, seem to be formed by the proportion of numbers, for this was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall pattern in the mind of the Creator. Hence is borrowed the number of the Elements, hence the courses of times, hence the motion of the Stars, and the revolution of the heaven, and the state of all things subsist by the uniting together of numbers. Numbers therefore are endowed with great and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52070:101"/>
sublime vertues. For it is no wonder, seeing there are so many, and so great occult vertues in naturall things, although of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest operations, that there should be in numbers much greater, and more occult, and also more wonderfull, and efficacious, for as much as they are more formall, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and naturally in the celestialls, not mixt with separated substances; and lastly, having the greatest, and most simple commixtion with the Idea's in the mind of God, from which they receive their proper, and most efficacious vertues: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also they are of most force, and conduce most to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of spirituall, and divine gifts, as in naturall things, elementary qualities are powerfull in the transmuting of any elementary thing. Again, all things that are, and are made, subsist by, and receive their vertue from numbers. For time consists of number, and all motion, and action, and all things which are subject to time, and motion.</p>
               <p>Harmony also, and voices have their power by, and consist of numbers, and their proportions, and the proportion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising from numbers, do by lines, and points make Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and figures: And these are proper to Magicall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, the middle which is betwixt both being appropriated by declining to the extreams, as in the use of letters. And lastly, all species of naturall things, and of those things which are above nature, are joyned together by certain numbers: which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> seeing, saith, that number is that by which all things consist, and distributes each vertue to each number. And <hi>Proclus</hi> saith, Number hath alwaies a being: Yet there is one in voyce, another in the proportion of them, another in the soul, and reason, and another in divine things. But <hi>Themistius,</hi> and <hi>Boethius,</hi> and <hi>Averrois</hi> the <hi>Babilonian,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Plato,</hi> do so extoll numbers, that they think no man can be a true Philosopher without them. Now they speak of a rationall, and formall number, not of a materiall, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, or vocall, the number of Merchants buying, and selling, of which the <hi>Pythagorians,</hi> and <hi>Platonists,</hi> and our <hi>Austin</hi> make no reckoning, but apply it to the proportion resulting from it, which number they call naturall, rationall, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52070:102"/>
from which great mysteries flow, as well in naturall, as divine, and heavenly things. By it is there a way made for the searching out, and understanding of all things knowable. By it the next access to naturall prophecying is had: and the <hi>Abbot Joachim</hi> proceeded no other way in his Prophecies, but by formall numbers.</p>

               <p>THat there lyes wonderfull efficacy, and vertue in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as well to good as to bad, not only most eminent Philosophers do unanimously teach, but also Catholike Doctors, and especially <hi>Hierom, Austin, Origen, Ambrose, Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzen, Athanasius, Basilius, Hilarius, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus, Bede,</hi> and many more confirm. Hence <hi>Hilarius</hi> in his Commentaries upon the Psalms, testifies that the seventy Elders, according to the efficacy of numbers, brought the Psalms into order. <hi>Rabanus</hi> also, a famous Doctor, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an excellent book of the vertues of numbers: But now how great vertues numbers have in nature, is manifest in the hearb which is called Cinquefoil, <hi>i. e.</hi> five leaved Grass; for this resists poysons by vertue of the number of five; also drives away divells, conduceth to expiation; and one leafe of it taken twice in a day in wine, cures the Feaver of one day: three the tertian Feaver: foure the quartane. In like manner four grains of the seed of Turnisole being durnk, cures the quartane, but three the tertian. In like manner <hi>Vervin</hi> is said to cure Feavers, being durnk in wine, if in tertians it be cut from the third joynt, in quartans from the fourth. A Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, if he be once struck with a Spear, dieth, if twice, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers strength. These and many such as these are read, and testified in divers Authors. We must know now whence these are done, which certainly have a cause, which is a various
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52070:102"/>
proportion of various numbers amongst themselves. There is also a wonderfull experiment of the number of seven, that every seventh male, born without a female coming betwixt, hath power to cure the Kings evill by his touch alone, or word. Also every seventh daughter that is born, is said won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully to help forward the birth of children neither is the naturall number here considered, but the formall consideration that is in the number. And let that which we spake before, be alwaies kept in mind, <hi>viz.</hi> that these powers are not in vocall, or numbers of merchants buying, and selling, but in rationall, formall, and naturall; These are distinct mysteries of God and nature. But he that knows how to joyn together the vocall numbers, and naturall with divine, and order them into the same harmony, shall be able to work and know wonderfull things by numbers; the Pythagorians profess that they can prognosticate many things by the numbers of names, in which truly, unless there did ly a great mysterie, <hi>John</hi> had not said in the Revelation, He which hath understanding, let him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the number of the name of the beast, which is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a man, and this is the most famous manner of compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting amongst the Hebrews, and Cabalists, as we shall shew afterwards. But this you must know, that simple numbers signifie Divine things: numbers of ten; Celestiall numbers of an hundred; terrestiall numbers of a thousand; those things that shall be in a future age. Besides, seeing the parts of the mind are according to an Arithmeticall Mediocrity, by reason of the identity, or equality of excess, coupled together. But the body, whose parts differ in their greatness, is according to Geometricall mediocrity, compounded: But an animall consists of both, <hi>viz</hi> soul and body, according to that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity, which is sutable to harmony: Hence it is that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers do work very much upon the soul, figures upon the body, and harmony upon the whole animall.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of Unity, and the Scale thereof</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw let us treat particularly of numbers themselves: and because number is nothing els but a repetition of Unity, let us first consider Unity it self. For Unity doth most simply go through every number, and is the common measure, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and originall of all numbers, contains every number joyned together in it self intirely, the beginner of every mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, alwayes the same, and unchangable: whence also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multiplyed into it self, produceth nothing but it self: it is indivisible, void of all parts: But if it seem at any time to be divided, it is not cut, but indeed Multiplied into Unities: yet none of these Unities is greater or lesser then the whole Unity, as a part is less then the whole: It is not therefore Multiplyed into parts, but into it self: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some called it concord, some piety, and some friendship, which is so knit, that it cannot be cut into parts. But <hi>Martianus,</hi> according to the opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, it is named <hi>Cupid,</hi> because it is made one alone, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bewail it self, and beyond it self it hath nothing but being void of all haughtiness, or coupling, turns its proper heats into it self. It is therefore the one beginning, and end of all things, neither hath it any beginning, or end it self: Nothing is before one, nothing is after one, and beyond it is nothing, and all things which are, desire that one, because all things proceeded from one, and that all things may be the same, it is necessary that they partake of that one: And as all things proceeded of one into many things, so all things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to return to that one, from which they proceeded; it is necessary that they should put off multitude. One therefore is referred to the high God, who seeing he is one, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, yet creates innumerable things of himself, and contains them within himself. There is therefore one God, one world of the one God, one Sun of the one world, also one Phoenix in the World, one King amongst Bees, one Leader amongst
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52070:103"/>
Flocks of Catel, one Ruler amongst heards of Beasts, &amp; Cranes follow one and many other Animalls honour Unity; Amongst the Members of the body there is one Principle by which all the rest are guided, whether it be the head, or (as some will) the heart. There is one Element overcoming, and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all things, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire. There is one thing created of God, the subject of all wondring, which is on Earth, or in Heaven, it is actually Animal, Vegetable, and Minnerall, every where found, known by few, called by none by its proper name, but covered with figures, and Riddles, without which neither Alchymie, nor Naturall Magick, can attain to their compleat end, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. From one man, <hi>Adam,</hi> all men proceed, from that one all become mortall, from that one <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> they are regenerated: and as saith <hi>Paul,</hi> one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God, and Father of all, one mediator betwixt God and man, one most high Creator, who is over all, by all, and in us all. For there is one Father, God, from whence all, and we in him: one Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> by whom all, and we by him: one God Holy Ghost, into whom all, and we into him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the Number of Two, and the Scale thereof.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe first Number is of two, because it is the first Multitude, it can be measured by no number besides unity alone, the common measure of all Numbers: It is not compounded of Numbers, but of one unity only; neither is it called a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber uncompounded, but more properly not compounded: The Number of three is called the first Number uncompound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But the Number of two is the first branch of unity, and the first procreation: Hence it is called generation, and <hi>Juno,</hi> and an imaginable Corporation, the proof of the first moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the first form of parity: the number of the first equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, extremity, and distance betwixt, and therefore of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar equity, and the proper act thereof, because it consists of two equally poysed: and it is called the Number of Science, and Memory, and of light, and the number of man, who is called another, and the lesser World: it is also called the number of charity, and mutuall love, of marriage, and socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as it is said by the Lord, Two shall be one flesh. And <hi>Solomon</hi> saith: It is better that two be together then one, for they have a benefit by their mutuall society: If one shall fall, he shall be supported by the other. Wo to him that is alone, because when he falls he hath not another to help him: and if two sleep together, they shall warm one the other; how shall one be hot alone? and if any prevaile against him, two resist him. And it is called the number of Wedlock and Sex; for there are two sexes, Masculine, and Feminine: and two Doves bring forth two Eggs, out of the first of which is hatched the Male, out of the second the Female. It is also called the midle, that is capable, that is good, and bad, partaking, and the beginning of division, of Multitude, and distinction, and signifies matter. This is also sometimes the number of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and confusion, of misfortune, and uncleanness, whence Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> against <hi>Jovianus</hi> saith, that therefore it was not
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52070:105"/>
spoken in the second day of the creation of the world, and God said, That it was good, because the number of two is evill. Hence also it was that God commanded that all unclean Animals should go into the Ark by couples: because as I said, the number of two, is a number of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and it is most unhappy in their Soothsayings, especially if those things, from whence the Soothsaying is taken, be <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnall,</hi> or <hi>Martiall,</hi> for these two are accounted by the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers unfortunate. It is also reported, that the number of two doth cause apparitions of Ghosts, and fearfull Goblins, and bring mischiefs of evill spirits to them that travell by night. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> reports) said, that Unity was God, and a good intellect; and that Duality was a Divell, and an evill intellect, in which is a materiall multitude: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Pythagorians</hi> say, that two is not a number, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain confusion of unities. And <hi>Plutarke</hi> writes, that the <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorians</hi> called unity <hi>Apollo,</hi> and two, strife, and boldness; and three, Justice, which is the highest perfection, and is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many mysteries. Hence there were two Tables of the Law in <hi>Sina,</hi> two Cherubins looking to the Propitiatory in <hi>Moses,</hi> two Olives dropping oyle, in <hi>Zachariah,</hi> two natures in Christ, Divine, and Humane; Hence <hi>Moses</hi> saw two appearances of God, <hi>viz.</hi> his face, and back-parts, also two Testaments, two commands of Love, two first dignities, two first people, two kinds of Spirits, good, and bad, two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall creatures, an Angell, and soul, two great lights, two Solstia, two equinoctials, two poles, two Elements, producing a living soul, <hi>viz.</hi> Earth, and Water.</p>

               <p>THE number of three is an incompounded number, a holy number, a number of perfection, a most powerfull num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. For there are three persons in God, there are three Theologicall vertues in Religion.

Whence <hi>Virgil</hi> sings,

Odd numbers to the God delightfull are.</q>

And in <hi>Pliny</hi> it was the custome in every medicine to spit with three deprecations, and hence to be cured. The number of three is perfected with three Augmentations, long, broad, and deep, beyond which there is no progression of dimension, whence the first number is called square. Hence it is said that to a body that hath three measures, and to a square number, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be added. Wherefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the beginning of his speeches concerning Heaven, cals it as it were a Law, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which all things are disposed. For Corporeall, and spirituall things consist of three things, <hi>viz.</hi> beginning, middle, and end. By three (as <hi>Tresmegistus</hi> saith) the world is perfected: He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>armene, necessity, and order <hi>(i. e.)</hi> concurrence of causes,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52070:106"/>
which many call fate, and the execution of them to the fruit, or increase, and a due distribution of the increase. The whole measure of time is concluded in three, <hi>viz.</hi> Past, present, to come; All magnitude is contained in three; line, superficies, and body, every body consists of three Intervals, length, bredth, thickness. Harmony contains three consents in time, Diapason, Hemiolion, Diatessaron. There are also three kinds of souls, Vegetative, sensitive, and intellectuall. And as saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, God orders the world by number, weight, and measure, and the number of three is deputed to the Ideall forms there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as the number of two is to the procreating matter, and unity to God the maker of it. Magicians do constitute three Princes of the world, <hi>Oromasis, Mitris, Araminis (i. e.)</hi> God, the Mind, and the Spirit. By the three square or solid, the three numbers of nine of things produced are distributed, <hi>viz.</hi> of the supercelestiall into nine orders of Intelligencies: of Celestiall into nine Orbs: of inferiours into nine kinds of generable, and corruptible things. Lastly in this ternall Orb, <hi>viz.</hi> twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty seven, all Musicall proportions are included, as <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> do at large discourse. And the number of three hath in a harmony of five, the grace of the first voyce. Also in Intelligencies there are three Hierarchies of Angelicall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. There are three powers of Intellectuall creatures, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, mind, and will. There are three orders of the blessed, <hi>viz.</hi> of Martyrs, Confessors, and Innocents. There are three quaternions of Celestiall Signs, <hi>viz.</hi> Of fixt, moveable, and common, as also of houses, <hi>viz.</hi> centers, succeeding, and falling. There are also three faces, and heads in every Sign, and three Lords of each triplicity. There are three fortunes amongst the Planets. Three graces amongst the Goddesses. Three Ladies of destiny amongst the infernall crew. Three Judges. Three furies. Three headed Cerberus. We read also of a thrice double He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. Three moneths of the Virgin <hi>Diana.</hi> Three persons in the supersubstantiall Divinity. Three times, of Nature, Law, and Grace. Three Theologicall vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charity. <hi>Jonas</hi> was three days in the Whales belly; and so many was Christ in the grave.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the Number of Four, and the Scale thereof.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Pythagorians call the Number of four Tetractis, and prefer it before all the vertues of Numbers, because it is the foundation, and root of all other numbers; whence also all foundations, as well in artificiall things, as naturall, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, are four square, as we shall shew afterwards: and it signifies solidity, which also is demonstrated by a four square figure. For the number four is the first four square plain, which consists of two proportions, whereof the first is of one to two, the latter of two to four, and it proceeds by a double procession and proportion, <hi>viz.</hi> of one to one, and of two to two, beginning at a unity, and ending at a quaternity: which proportions differ in this, that according to Arithmatick, they are unequall to one the other: but according to Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are equall. Therefore a four square is ascribed to God the Father, and also contains the mysterie of the whole Trinity: for by its single proportion, <hi>viz.</hi> by the first of one to one, the unity of the paternall substance is signified, from which proceeds one Son, equall to him; by the next procession, also simple, <hi>viz.</hi> of two to two, is signified by the second procession the Holy Ghost from both, that the Son be equall to the Father by the first procession; and the Holy Ghost be equall to both by the second procession. Hence that super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent, and great name of the divine Trinity in God is written with four letters, <hi>viz. Iod, He,</hi> and <hi>Vau; He,</hi> where it is the aspiration <hi>He,</hi> signifies the proceeding of the spirit from both: for <hi>He</hi> being duplicated, terminates both sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the whole name, but is pronounced <hi>Jove</hi> as some will, whence that <hi>Jovis</hi> of the heathen, which the Ancients did picture with four ears, whence the number four is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and head of the whole divinity. And the Pythagorians call it the perpetuall fountain of nature: for there are four degrees in the Scale of nature, <hi>viz.</hi> to be, to live, to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52070:108"/>
to understand. There are four motions in nature, <hi>viz.</hi> ascendent, descendent, going forward, circular. There are four Corners in the heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> rising, falling, the midle of the heaven, and the bottome of it. There are four Elements un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, Aire, Water, and Earth; according to these there are four triplicities in Heaven: There are four first qualities under the Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> Cold, Heat, Driness, and Moystness, from these are the four Humours, Blood, Flegm, Choller, Melancholy. Also the year is divided into four parts, which are the Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter; also the wind is divided into Eastern, Western, Northern, and Southern. There are also four rivers of Paradise, and so many infernall. Also the number four makes up all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: first it fills up every simple progress of numbers with four termes, <hi>viz.</hi> with one, two, three, and four consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting the number ten. It fills up every difference of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the first even, and conteining the first odd in it. It hath in Musick Diatessaron, the grace of the fourth voice. Also it conteins the instrument of four strings, and a Pythagorean Diagram, whereby are foundout first of all musicall tunes, and all harmony of Musick. For Double, Treble, fourtimes double, one and halfe, one and a third part, a concord of all, a double concord of all, of five, of four, and all consonancy is limited within the bounds of the number four. It doth also contein the whole of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in four terms, <hi>viz.</hi> point, line, superficies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity. It comprehends all nature in four terms, <hi>viz.</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, quality, quantity, and motion. Also all naturall Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, in which are the seminary vertues of nature, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall springing, the growing form, and the compositum. Also Metaphysick is comprehended in four bounds, <hi>viz.</hi> being, essence, vertue, and action. Morall Phylosophy is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended with four vertues, <hi>viz.</hi> prudence, justice, fortitude, temperance. It hath also the power of justice: hence a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold law, of providence from God: fatall, from the soul of the world: of nature from Heaven: of prudence, from man. There are also four judiciary powers in all things being, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:52070:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the intellect, discipline, opinion, and sense. It hath also great power in all mysteries. Hence the Pythagorians did ratifie the number four with an oath, as if it were the cheifest ground whereon their faith was grounded, and their belief might be confirmed. Hence it was called the <hi>Pythagorians</hi> oath, which is expressed in these verses.
<q>
                     <l>I with pure minde by th' number four do swear</l>
                     <l>That's holy, and the fountain of nature</l>
                     <l>Eternall, parent of the mind—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Also there are four rivers of Paradise; four Gospels received from four Evangelists throughout the whole Church. The Hebrews received the cheifest name of God written with four letters. Also the <hi>Egyptians, Arabians, Persians, Magicians, Mahumitans, Grecians, Tuscans, Latines,</hi> write the name of God with only four letters, <hi>viz.</hi> thus, <hi>Thet, Alla, Sire, Orsi, Abdi,</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>Esar, Deus.</hi> Hence the Lacedemonians were wont to paint <hi>Jupiter</hi> with four wings. Hence also in <hi>Orpheus</hi> his divinity, it is said that <hi>Neptunes</hi> Chariots are drawn with four horses. There are also four kinds of divine furies, proceeding from severall deities, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Muses, Dionysius, Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> Also the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw four beasts by the river <hi>Chobar,</hi> and four Cherubims in four wheels. Also in <hi>Daniel,</hi> four great beasts did ascend from the Sea, and four winds did fight. And in the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> four beasts were full of eyes, before, and behind: standing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

esteeming the vertue of it to be so much more excellent then the number four, by how much a living thing is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then a thing without life. For in this number the Father <hi>Noah</hi> found favour with God, and was preserved in the floud of waters. In the vertue of this number <hi>Abraham,</hi> being an hundred years old, begat a Son of <hi>Sarah,</hi> being ninety years old, and a barren Woman, and past child bearing, and grew up to be a great people. Hence in time of grace the name of divine omnipotency is called upon with five letters. For in time of nature the name of God was called upon with three letters. <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of the Number Seaven, and the Scale thereof.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe number seaven is of various, and manifold power, for it consists of one, and six, or of two, and five, or of three and four, and it hath a Unity, as it were the coupling together of two threes: whence if we consider the severall parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the joyning together of them, without doubt we shall confess that it is as well by the joyning together of the parts hereof, as by its fulness apart most full of all Majesty. And the <hi>Pythagorians</hi> call it the Vehiculum of mans life, which it doth not receive from its parts so, as it perfects by its proper sight of its whole, for it contains body, and soul, for the body consists of four Elements, and is endowed with four qualities: Also the number three respects the soul, by reason of its threefold power, <hi>viz.</hi> rationall, irascible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscible. The number seaven therefore, because it consists of three, and four, joyns the soul to the body, and the vertue of this number relates to the generation of men, and it causeth man to be received, formed, brought forth, nourished, live, and indeed altogether to subsist. For when the genitall seed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> received in the womb of the woman, if it remain there seaven hours after the effusion of it, it is certain that it will abide there for good: Then the first seaven dayes it is coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ated, and is fit to receive the shape of a man: then it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth mature infants, which are called infants of the seaventh moneth, <hi>i. e.</hi> because they are born the seaventh moneth. After the birth, the seaventh hour tryes whether it will live or no: for that which shall bear the breath of the aire after that hour is conceived will live. After seaven dayes it casts off the reliques of the Navell.</p>
               <p>After twice seaven dayes its sight begins to move after the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>reely. After seaven moneths it breeds teeth: After the second seaventh moneth it sits without fear of falling: After
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52070:113"/>
the third seaventh moneth it begins to speak: After the fourth seaventh moneth it stands strongly, and walks: after the fifth seaventh moneth it begins to refrain sucking its Nurse: After seaven years its first teeth fall, and new are bred fitter for harder meat, and its speech is perfected: After the second seaventh year boys wax ripe, and then is a beginning of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: At the third seaventh year they grow to be menin stature, and begin to be hairy, and become able, and strong for generation: At the fourth seaventh year they begin to barnish, and cease to grow taller: In the fifth seaventh year they attain to the perfection of their strength: The sixt seaven year they keep their strength; The seaventh seaventh year they attain to their utmost descretion, and wisdome, and the perfect age of men. But when they come to the tenth seaventh year where the number seaven is taken for a compleat number, then they come to the common tearm of life, the Prophet say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Our age is seaventy years. The utmost hight of mans body is seaven feet. There are also seaven degrees in the body, which compleat the dimension of its altitude from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome to the top, <hi>viz.</hi> marrow, bone, nerve, vein, attery, flesh, skin. There are seaven, which by the <hi>Greeks</hi> are called black members, the Tongue, the Heart, the Lunges, the Liver, the Spleen, and two Kidnies. There are also seaven principle parts of the body, the head, the breast the hands, the feet, and the privy members. It is manifest concerning breath, and meat, that without drawing of the breath the life doth doth not endure above seaven hours: and they that are star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with famine, live not above seaven dayes. The Veins also, and arteries (as Physitians say) are moved by the seaventh number. Also judgements in diseases are made with greater manifestation upon the seaventh dayes, which Physitians call criticall, <hi>i. e.</hi> judiciall. Also of seaven portions God Creates the soul, as divine <hi>Plato</hi> witnesseth in <hi>Timeus.</hi> The soul also receives the body by seaven degrees. All difference of voices proceeds to the seaventh degree, after which there is the same revolution. Again, there are seaven modulations of the voyces, Ditonus, Semiditonus, Diutessaron, Diapente with a tone, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52070:113"/>
with a half time, and Diapason. There is also in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestials a most potent power of the number seven. For seeing there are four corners of the Heaven Diametrically looking one towards the other, which indeed is accounted a most full, and powerfull aspect, and consists of the number seven. For it is made from the seventh Sign, and makes a Cross, the most powerfull figure of all, of which we shall speak in its due place. But this you must not be ignorant of, that the number seven hath a great Communion with the Cross. By the same radiation, and number the solstice is distant from Winter, and the Winter equinoctium from the Summer, all which are done by seven Signs. There are also seven Circles in the Heaven, according to the longitudes of the Axel tree. There are seven Stars about the Articke Pole, greater, and lesser, called <hi>Charls Wain</hi> also seven Stars called the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> and seven Planets, according to those seven dayes constituting a week. The Moon is the seventh of the Planets &amp; next to us observing this number more then the rest, this number dispensing the motion, and light thereof. For in twenty eight dayes it runs round the Compass of the whole <hi>Zodiack,</hi> which number of dayes, the number seven, with its seven tearms, <hi>viz.</hi> from one to seven, doth make, and fill up, as much as the several numbers, by adding to the Antecedents, and makes four times seven dayes, in which the Moon runs through, and about all the longitude, and latitude of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> by measuring, and measuring again: with the like seven of dayes it lispenseth its light, by changing it; For the first seven dayes unto the middle as it were of the divided world, it increaseth; the second seven dayes it fils its whole Orb with light; the third by decreasing is again contracted into a divided Orb; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fourth seven dayes, it is renewed with the last diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its light, and by the same seven of dayes it disposeth the increase, and decrease of the Sea, for in the first seven of the increase of the Moon, it is by little lessened; in the second by degrees increased: but the third is like the first, and the fourth doth the same as the second. It is also applyed to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> which ascending from the lower, is the seventh Planet, which betokens rest, to which the seventh day is ascribed,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52070:114"/>
which signifies the seven thousandth, wherein (as <hi>John</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth) the Dragon, which is the Divell, and Satan, being bound, men shall be quiet, and lead a peaceable life. Moreover the <hi>Phythagorians</hi> call seven the number of Virginity, because the first is that which is neither generated, or generates, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be divided into two equall parts, so as to be generated of another number repeated, or being doubled to bring forth any other number of it self, which is contained within the bounds of the number ten, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly the first bound of numbers, and therefore they dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the number seven to <hi>Pallas.</hi> It hath also in Religion mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> potent signs of its esteem, and it is called the number of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oath. Hence amongst the Hebrews to swear is called Septe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to protest by seven. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he made a Covenant with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> appointed seven Ewe Lambs for a testimony. It is also called the number of blessedness, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, whence that,
<q>O thrice, and four times blessed!</q>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> in soul, and body. The seventh day the Creator reste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> from his work, wherefore this day was by <hi>Moses</hi> called the Sabbath <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the day of rest; hence it was that Christ rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the seventh day in the grave. Also this number hath a great communion with the Cross, as is above shewed, as also with Christ. For in Christ is all our blessedness, rest, and felicity besides, it is most convenient in purifications. Whence <hi>Apule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> saith, and I put my self forthwith into the bath of the Sea, to be purified, and put my head seven times under the Waves. And the Leprous person that was to be cleansed, was sprinkled seven times with the blood of a Sparrow; and <hi>Elis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> the Prophet, as it is written in the Second Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> saith unto the Leprous preson; Go, and wash thy self seven times in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and thy flesh shall be made whole, and thou shalt be cleansed, and it follows a little after, And he washed himself seven times in <hi>Jordan,</hi> according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets saying, and he was cleansed. Also it is a number of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52070:114"/>
and remission: Hence was ordeined the seaventh years repentance for every sin, according to the opinion of the wise man, saying, And upon every sinner seaven fold: Also the seaventh year there were granted remissions, and after full seaven years there was giving a full remission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is read in <hi>Leviticus.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> with seaven petitions finished his speech of our satisfaction: hence also it is called the number of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, because the seaventh year the <hi>Hebrew</hi> servant did challenge liberty for himself. It is also most sutable to divine praises. Whence the Prophet saith, Seaven times a day do I praise thee, because of thy righteous judgements. It is moreover called the number of revenge, as saith the Scripture, and <hi>Cain</hi> shall be revenged seaven fold. And the Psalmist saith, Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto our Neighbours seaven fold into their bosome, their reproach. Hence there are seaven wickednesses, as saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and seaven wickeder spirits taken, are read of in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. It signifies also the time of the present circle, because it is finished in the space of seaven days. Also it is consecrated to the Holy Ghost, which the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> describes to be seaven fold, according to his gifts, <hi>viz.</hi> the spirit of wisdom, and understanding, the spirit of counsell, and strength, the spirit of knowledge, and holiness, and the spirit of the fear of the Lord, which we read in <hi>Zachariah</hi> to be the seaven eyes of God. There are also seaven Angells spirits standing in the presence of God, as is read in <hi>Tobias,</hi> and in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> seaven Lamps did burn before the Throne of God, and seaven golden Candlesticks, and in the midle thereof was one like to the son of man, and he had in his right hand seaven Stars. Also there were seaven spirits before the Throne of God, and seaven Angells stood before the Throne, and there were given to them seaven Trumpets. And he saw a Lamb having seaven horns, and seaven eyes, and he saw the book sealed with seaven Seales, and when the seaventh seal was opened, there was made si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in heaven. Now by all what hath been said, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that the number seaven, amongst the other numbers, may deservedly be said to be most full of all efficacy. Moreover, the number seaven hath great conformity with the number
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52070:115"/>
twelve; Fot as three, and four make seaven, so thrice four make twelve, which are the numbers of the celestiall Planets, and signs, resulting from the same root, and by the number three partaking of the divinity, and by the number four of the nature of inferiour things. There is in sacred writ a very great observance of this number, before all others, and many, and very great are the mysteries thereof; many we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to reckon up here, repeating them out of holy writ, by which it will easily appear, that the number seaven doth signifie a certain fulness of sacred mysteries. For we read in <hi>Genesis,</hi> that the seaventh was the day of the rest of the Lord; &amp; <hi>Enoch,</hi> a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, holy man, was the seaventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> and that there was another seaventh man from <hi>Adam,</hi> a wicked man, by name <hi>Lamech,</hi> that had two wives; and that the sin of <hi>Cain</hi> should be abolished the seaventh generation: As it is written, <hi>Cain</hi> shall be punished seaven fold: and he that shall slay <hi>Cain,</hi> shall be revenged seaven fold, to which the Master of the History collects, that there were seaven sins of <hi>Cain.</hi> Also of all clean beasts seaven, and seaven were brought into the Ark, as also of Fowles: And after seaven days the Lord rained upon the Earth, and upon the seaventh day the fountains of the deep were broken up, and the waters cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Earth. Also <hi>Abraham</hi> gave to <hi>Abimelech</hi> seaven Ewe Lambs: and <hi>Jacob</hi> served seaven years for <hi>Leah,</hi> and seaven more for <hi>Rachel:</hi> and seaven dayes the people of <hi>Israel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed the death of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Moreover, we read in the same place, of seaven Kine, and seaven Ears of Corn, seaven years of plenty, and seaven years of scarcity. And in <hi>Exodus,</hi> the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both of Sabboths, the holy rest to the Lord, is commanded to be on the seaventh day. Also on the seaventh day <hi>Moses</hi> ceased to pray. On the seaventh day there shall be a solemnity of the Lord, the seaventh year the servant shall go out free: seaven dayes let the Calf, and the Lamb be with its damm; the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year let the ground that hath been sown six years, be at rest: the seaventh day shall be a holy Sabboth, and a rest: the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, because it is the Sabboth, shall be called holy. In <hi>Leviticus</hi> the seaventh day also shall be more observed, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52070:115"/>
be more holy: and the first day of the seaventh moneth shall be a Sabboth of memoriall. Seaven dayes shall the sacrifices be offered to the Lord, seaven dayes shall the holy dayes of the Lord be celebrated, seaven dayes in a year everlastingly in the generations. In the seaventh moneth you shall cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate feasts, and shall dwell in Tabernacles leaven dayes: seaven times he shall sprinkle himself before the Lord, that hath dipped his finger in blood: he that is cleansed from the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosy, shall dip seaven times in the blood of a sparrow: seaven days shall she be washed with running water, that is menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: seaven times he shall dip his finger in the blood of a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock: seaven times I will smite you for your sins: In <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy</hi> seaven people possessed the Land of promise. There is also read of a seaventh year of remission, and seaven Candles set up on the South side of the Candlesticks. And in <hi>Numbers</hi> it is read, that the sons of <hi>Israel</hi> offered up seaven Ewe Lambs without spot, and that seaven dayes they did eat unleavened bread, and that sin was expiated with seaven Lambs &amp; a Goat, and that the seaventh day was celebrated, and holy, and the first day of the seaventh moneth was observed, and kept holy, and the seaventh moneth of the feast of Tabernacles, &amp; seaven Calves were offered on the seaventh day, and <hi>Baalam</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected seaven Altars; seaven dayes <hi>Mary</hi> the sister of <hi>Aaron</hi> went forth leprous out of the Camp, seaven dayes he that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a dead Carkass was unclean. And in <hi>Joshua</hi> seaven priests carried the Ark of the Covenant before the Host, and seaven dayes they went round the Cities, and seaven trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets were carried by the seaven Priests, and on the seaventh day the seaven Priests sounded the Trumpets. And in the book of <hi>Judges, Abessa</hi> raigned in <hi>Israel</hi> seaven years, <hi>Sampson</hi> kept his nuptialls seaven dayes, and the seaventh day he put forth a Riddle to his wife, he was bound with seaven green withs, seaven locks of his head were shaved off, seaven years were the children of <hi>Israel</hi> oppressed by the King of <hi>Maden.</hi> And in the books of the Kings, <hi>Elias</hi> prayed seaven times, and at the seaventh time, behold a little cloud! seaven dayes the children of <hi>Israel</hi> pitched over against the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and in the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52070:116"/>
seaventh day the battell was joyned: seaven years famine was threatened to <hi>David</hi> for the peoples murmuring; and seaven times the child neesed, that was raised by <hi>Elisha,</hi> and seaven men were crucified together in the dayes of the first harvest. <hi>Naaman</hi> was made clean with seaven washings by <hi>Elisha,</hi> the seaventh moneth <hi>Golias</hi> was slain. And in <hi>Hester</hi> we read, that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> had three <hi>Eunuchs:</hi> and in <hi>Tobias</hi> seaven men were coupled with <hi>Sara</hi> the daughter of <hi>Raguel:</hi> And in <hi>Daniel Nebucadnezzars</hi> Furnace was heated seaven times hotter then it was used to be, and seaven Lions were in the den, and the seaventh day came <hi>Nebucadnezzar.</hi> In the book of <hi>Job</hi> there is made mention of seaven sons of <hi>Job,</hi> and seaven dayes and nights <hi>Jobs</hi> friends sate with him on the Earth; and in the same place. In seaven troubles no evill shall touch thee. In <hi>Ezra</hi> we read of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his seaven coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers: and in the same place the trumpet sounded: the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth moneth of the feast of tabernacles were in <hi>Ezraes</hi> time, whilest the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were in the Cities: and on the first day of the seaventh moneth <hi>Esdras</hi> read the Law to the people. And in the Psalmes <hi>David</hi> praised the Lord seaven times in a day: silver is tryed seaven times; and he renders to our neighbours seaven fold into their bosomes. And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> saith, that wisdom hath hewen her self seaven Pillars; seaven men that can render a reason, seaven abominations which the Lord abhors, seaven abominations in the heart of an enemy, seaven overseers, seaven eyes beholding. <hi>Isaiah</hi> numbers up seaven gifts of the Holy Ghost, and seaven wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men shall take hold on a man. And in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> she that hath born seaven, languisheth, she hath given up the ghost. In <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the Prophet continued sad for seaven dayes. In <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi> seaven lamps, and seaven pipes to those seaven lamps, and seaven eyes running to and fro throughout the whole Earth, and seaven eyes upon one stone, and the fast of the seaventh day is turned into ioy. And in <hi>Micah,</hi> seaven shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds are raised against the Assyrians. Also in the Gospel we read of seaven blessednesses, and seaven vertues, to which seaven vices are opposed; seaven petitions of the Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52070:116"/>
seaven words of <hi>Christ</hi> upon the cross, seaven words of the blessed <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> seaven loaves distributed by the Lord, seaven baskets of fragments, seaven brothers having one wife, seaven disciples of the Lord that were fishers, seaven water pots in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galile,</hi> seaven woes which the Lord threatens to the Hypocrites, seaven divels cast out of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean woman, and seaven wickeder divells taken in after that which was cast out.

               </head>
               <p>THe <hi>Pythagorians</hi> call eight the number of justice, and fulness: first, because it is first of all divided into num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers equally even, <hi>viz,</hi> into four, and that division is by the same reason made into twice two, <hi>viz.</hi> by twice two twice; and by reason of this equality of division, it took to it self the name of justice, but the other received the name, <hi>viz.</hi> of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by reason of the contexture of the corporeall solidity, since the first makes a solid body. Hence that custome of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi> swearing by eight dieties, if at any time he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech divine justice, whose names are these. Fire, Water, Earth, the Heaven, Moon, Sun, Phanes, the Night. There are also only eight visible Spheres of the heavens: also by it the property of corporeall nature is signified which <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi> comprehends in eight of his Sea songs. This is also called the covenant or circumcision, which was commanded to be done by the <hi>Jewes</hi> the eight day.</p>

Hence the Ancients called Ceremonies Denary, because they that were to be expected and to offer sacrifices, were to abstain from some certain things for ten dayes. Whence amongst the Egyptians i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There are ten sanguine parts of man, the Menstrues, the Sperm, the Plasmatick spirit the Mass, the Humours, the Organicall body, the vegetative part, the sensitive part, reason, and the mind. There are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so ten simple integrall parts constituting man, the bone, cartilage, nerve, fibre, ligament, artery, vein, membrane flesh, skin. There are also ten parts of which a man consists intrinsecally; The spirit, the brain, the lungs, the heart, the liver, the gall, the spleen, the kidnies, the testicles, the Matrix. There were ten Curtains in the Temple, ten strings in the Psaltery; ten musicall instruments with which Psalms were sang, the names whereof were, Neza, on which their Odes were sang, Nablum, the same as Organs, Mizmor, on which the Psalms, Sir, on which the Canticles, Tehila, on which O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Beracha, on which Benedictions, Halel, on which

There were also ten singers of Psalms, <hi>viz.

This lastly is the number, in which <hi>Jacob</hi> wrestling with the Angel all sight overcame, and at the rising of the Sun was blessed, and called by the name of <hi>Israel</hi> In this number <hi>Joshua</hi> overcame thirty one kings, and <hi>David</hi> overcame <hi>Goliah,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of the Number eleven, and the number twelve; with a double Scale of the Number twelve Cabilisticall, and Orphicall.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE number eleven as it exceeds the number ten, which is the number of the commandements, so it fals short of the number twelve, which is of grace and perfection, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called the number of sins, and the penitent. Hence in the tabernacle there were commanded to be made eleven Coats of hair which is the habit of those that are penitent, and lament for their sins, whence this number hath no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Divine or Celestiall things, nor any attraction, or scale tending to things above: neither hath it any reward; but yet sometimes it receives a gratuitous favor from God, as he which was called the eleventh hour to the vineyard of the Lord received the same reward as those who had born the burden, and heat of the day. Now the number twelve is divine, and that whereby the Celestials are measured; it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the number of the Signs in the <hi>Zodiack</hi> over which there are twelve angels as chief, supported by the irrigation of the great name of God. In twelve yeers also <hi>Jupiter</hi> perfects his course, and the Moon daily runs through twelve degrees. There are also twelve chief joynts in the body of man, <hi>viz.</hi> in hands, elbones, shoulders, thighs, knees, and vertebrae of the feet. There is also a great power of the number twelve in divine mysteries God chose twelve families of <hi>Israel,</hi> and set over them twelve Princes; so many stones were placed in the midst of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and God commanded that so many should be set on the breast of the Priest; twelve Lyons did bear the brazen Sea that was made by <hi>Solomon:</hi> there were so many fountains in Helim, and so many spies sent to the land of promise, and so many Apostles of Christ set over the twelve tribes, and twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand people were set apart and chosen; the queen of Heaven crowned with twelve Stars, and in the Gospel twelve baskets
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52070:124"/>
of the fragments were taken up, and twelve Angels are set over the twelve gates of the City, and twelve stones of the heavenly Jerusalem. In inferior things many breeding things proceed after this number; so the Hare and Coney being most fruitfull, bring forth twelve times in the yeer, and the Cammel is so many moneths in breeding, and the Pea-cock brings forth twelve Eggs.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>Of the Numbers which are above twelve, and of their powers, and vertues.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE other numbers also which are above twelve, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with many, and various effects, the vertues where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you must understand by their originall, and parts, as they are made of a various gathering together of simple numbers, or maner of multiplication. Sometimes as their significations arise from the lessening, or exceeding of another going before, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially more perfect, so they contain of themselves the signs of certain divine mysteries. So you see the third number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ten, shews the mysteries of Christs appearing to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, for the thirteenth day after his birth a Star was a guide to the wise men. The fourteenth day doth typifie Christ, who the fourteenth day of the first moneth was sacrificed for us; upon which day the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were commanded by the Lord to celebrate the Passeover. This number <hi>Mathew</hi> doth so carefully observe, that he passed over some generations, that he might every where observe this number in the generations of Christ. The fifteenth number is a token of spirituall ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, therefore the song of degrees is applyed to that in fifteen <hi>Psalmes.</hi> Also fifteen yeers were added to the life of King <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> and the fifteenth day of the seventh moneth was observed, and kept holy. The number sixteen, the Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorians call the number of felicity. It also comprehends all the Prophets of the old Testament, and the Apostles, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists of the new. The number eighteen, and twenty, Divines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret to be unhappy, for in the former, <hi>Israel</hi> served <hi>Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab;</hi> in the other <hi>Jacob</hi> served, and <hi>Joseph</hi> was sold. And lastly, amongst creatures that have many feet, there is none that hath above twenty feet. The twenty two signifies the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of wisdom, and so many are the Characters of the Hebrew letters, and so many Books doth the old Testament contain. To the number twenty eight, the favour of the Moon is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52070:127"/>
for the motion thereof is distant from the course of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stars, &amp; as it were alone is compleated the twenty eighth day, when it returns to the same point of the <hi>Zodiake</hi> from whence it came. Hence twenty eight Mansions of the Moon, having singular vertue, and influence, are numbred in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. The number thirty is memorable for many mysteries, Our Lord Jesus Christ was baptized the thirtieth yeer of his Age, and began to do miracles, and to teach the Kingdom of God. Also <hi>John Baptist</hi> was thirty yeers old when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to preach in the wilderness, and to prepare the wayes of the Lord. Also <hi>Ezekiel</hi> at the same Age began to prophecy; and <hi>Joseph</hi> was brought out of Prison on the thirtieth yeer of his Age, and received the government of Egypt from <hi>Pharoah.</hi> The number thirty two, the Hebrew Doctors ascribe to wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and so many paths of wisdom are described by <hi>Abraham.</hi> But the Pythagorians call this the number of Justice, because it is alwaies divisible into two parts, even unto a unity. The number fourty, the Ancients did honour with great observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, concerning which they did celebrate the feast Tessarosten: It is said that it doth conduce to the account of birth, for in so many daies the seed is fitted, and transformed in the womb, untill it be by its due, and harmoniacall proportions brought unto a perfect organicall body, being disposed to receive a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall soul. And so many dayes they say women be, after they have brought forth, before all things are setled within them, and they purified, and so many dayes infants refrain from smiling, are infirme, and live with a great deal of hazard. This also is in Religion a number of expiation, and penitency, and signifying great mysteries. For in the time of the deluge the Lord rained fourty dayes, and nights upon the earth: The children of <hi>Israel</hi> lived fourty yeers in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; fourty dayes the destruction of <hi>Nineveh</hi> was put off. The same number was accounted as holy in the fasts of the Saints: For <hi>Moses, Elias,</hi> and Christ fasted fourty dayes. Christ was carried fourty weeks in the womb of a Virgin, Christ tarryed fourty dayes after his birth at <hi>Bethelem</hi> before he was presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Temple: He preached fourty months publickly: he lay
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:52070:128"/>
fourty hours dead in the Sepulchre, the fourtieth day after his resurrection he ascended into heaven, all which Divines say, were not done without some occult property, and mysterie of this number. The number fifty signifies remission of sins, of servitudes, and also liberty. According in the Law, on the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year they did remit debts, and every one did return to his own possessions. Hence by the yeer of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> and by the <hi>Psalm</hi> of repentance it shews a sign of indulgency, and repentance. The law also, and the holy Ghost are declared in the same: For the fiftieth day after <hi>Israels</hi> going forth out of Egypt, the Law was given to <hi>Moses</hi> in mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> The fiftieth day after the resurrection, the holy Ghost came down upon the Apostles in mount Sion; Whence also it is called the number of grace, and attributed to the Holy Ghost. The number sixty, was holy to the Egyptians, for it is proper to the Crocodile, that as she in sixty dayes brings forth sixty eggs, and so many dayes sits on them, so she is said also to live so many yeers, and to have so many teeth: and so many dayes every yeer to rest solitary without any meat. The number seventy hath also its mysteries, for so many yeers the fire of the sacrifice in the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian Captivity lay under the water, and was alive: so many yeers <hi>Jeremiah</hi> foretold the destruction of the Temple, and so many yeers the Babylonian Captivity endured, and in so many yeers the desolation of Jerusalem was finished. Also there were seventy Palms in the place where the children of <hi>Israel</hi> pitched their Tents. The Fathers went down to Egypt with seventy souls. Also seventy Kings with their fingers, and toes cut off did gather meat under the table of <hi>Adonibezeck</hi> seventy sons came forth of the loins of <hi>Joas,</hi> seventy men, all ions of <hi>Jero,</hi> seventy weights of silver were given to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and so many men <hi>Abimelech</hi> slew upon one stone; <hi>Abdon</hi> had seventy sons, and Nephews, who rod upon seventy Foals of Asses; <hi>Solomon</hi> had seventy thousand men which carried burdens. Seventy sons of King <hi>Ahab</hi> were beheaded in <hi>Samaria;</hi> seventy yeers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> are the Age of man. <hi>Lamech</hi> shall be avenged seventy seven fold; Thou shalt forgive thy brother if he offend against thee, seventy seven times. Also the number
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52070:128"/>
seventy seven times. Also the number seventy two was famous for so many languages, for so many Elders of the Synagogue, for so many interprers of the old Testament, for so many Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ: It hath also a great Communion with the number twelve; hence in the heavens, every sign being divided into six parts, there result seventy two fives, over which so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny angels bear rule; and so many are the names of God; and every five is set over one Idiom with such efficacy, that the Astrologers, and Physiognomists can know from thence from what Idiom every one ariseth. Answerable to these are so many manifest joynts in mans body, whereof in every finger and toe there are three, which together with the twelve Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reckoned before in the number twelve make up seventy two. The number a hundred in which the sheep that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Of the notes of numbers, placed in certain gesturings.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Have often read in books of Magicians, and their works, and experiments certain, wonderful, &amp; as they seemed to me ridiculous gesturings, and I did think they were certain occult agreements of the divels, by reason of which I did reject them: but after I did more seriously examine the matter, then I did presently understand that they were not the compacts of divels; but that there lay in them the reason of numbers, by which the ancients did by the various bending forward, and backward, their hands, and fingers represent numbers, by whose gesturings the Magicians did silently signifie words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known by sound, various with numbers, yet of great vertue, by their fingers joyned together, and sometimes changed, and did with sacred silence worship the Gods that rule over the world. The rites whereof <hi>Martianus</hi> also makes mention of in his Arithmetick, saying, The fingers of the Virgin were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all manner of wayes, who after she went in, did by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing seven hundred and seventeen numbers with her bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fingers call upon <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But that these things may be the better understood, I shall bring something out of the saying of <hi>Beda</hi> who saith, When thou sayest one, bend in the litle fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on thy left hand, and set it in the middle of the Palme; when thou sayest two, place the next singer to the litle finger in the same place; when three, the middle finger after the same manner; when four, thou shalt lift up thy little finger; when five, the next to it after the same manner; when six, the middle, that finger alone which is called the ring finger, being fixt on the mddle of the Palme: when thou sayest seven, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> shalt put only thy little finger above the root of thy Palm, the rest in the mean time being lifted up; and by when thou sayest eight, thy ring finger; when thou sayest ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> thou shalt set thy middle finger contrary to them; when thou sayest ten, thou shall set the naile of thy fore-finger, or the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52070:129"/>
middle joynt of thy thumb. When thou sayest twenty, thou shalt put the top of thy middle finger close betwixt the joynts of thy thumb, and forefinger. When thou sayest thirty, thou shalt joyn the naile of thy thumb, and fore-finger lightly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When thou sayest fourty, thou shalt bring the inside of thy thumb to the outside of thy fore-finger, both being lifted up. When thou sayest fifty, thou shalt bend thy thumb with the outward joynt, like to the Greek Gamma, to the Palme. When thou sayest sixty, compass about thy thumb being bended as before, with thy fore-finger bowed over it. When thou sayest seventy, thou shalt supply thy fore-finger being bowed about as before, with thy thumb stretched at length, the naile there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being lifted up beyond the middle joynt of thy fore-finger. When thou sayest eighty, thou shalt supply thy fore-finger bowed about as before, with thy thumb stretched forth at length, the naile thereof being set upon the middle joynt of the fore-finger. When thou sayest ninty, thou shall set the naile of thy fore-finger bent into the root of thy thumb stretched out. Thus much for the left hand. Now thou shalt make 100. on thy right hand, as thou didst ten on thy left; and 200. on thy right, as thou didst twenty on thy left; 2000. on thy right, as thou didst two on thy left, and so to 9000. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over when thou sayest 10000. thou shalt put thy left hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on thy brest, thy fingers only being lifted towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. When thou sayest 20000. thou shalt put the same spread forth upon thy breast. When thou sayest 30000. thou shalt put thy thumb on the same hand downards, on the cartilage of the middle of thy brest. When thou sayest 40000. thou shalt lay the same upright, and stretched forth on thy navell. When thou sayest 50000. thou shalt lay thy thumb of the same hand downard on thy navell. When thou sayest 60000. thou shalt hold thy left thigh with the same, being downards. When thou sayest 70000. the same thou shalt put upon thy thumb upright. When thou sayest 80000. thou shalt put the same downward on thy thigh. When thou sayest 90000. thou shalt hold thy loyns with the same, thy thumb being turned down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But when thou sayest 100000. or 200000. and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52070:130"/>

yet makes others to signifie, either tens, or hundreds, or thousands, as is well known to Arithmeticians.

               <p>THE Graecians use the Alphabeticall letters for their notes of numbers, and that three wayes; first by every Element according to the series of the Alphabet signifying the number of its place. For in the order of which any number doth possesse the place of the Alphabet, it represents the number thereof, as here you may see.</p>

               <p>And this is the first order of numbers amongst the Greeks. Secondly, the Greeks divide the whole Alphabet into three Classes, whereof the first beginning from Alpha, is of unites. The second beginning from Iota is of tens. The third begining from Rho is of hundreds; and this order by the latter of the Greeks is instituted after the imitation of the Hebrews. Now because their Alphabet wants by that rule, three letters, it is necessary to add to them three figures, and to interlace them with the letters, by which, <hi>viz.</hi> they explain the sixt, the ninetieth, and the nine hundreth, as is manifest in the following Classes.</p>

He therefore that would know them, must seek them, of them that are skilful of these letters. For the Caldeans mark the numbers with the letters of their Alphabet after the manner of the Hebrews. We have set down their Alphabet in the end of the first book. Moreover I found in two most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient books of Astrologers, and Magicians, certain most ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant marks of numbers, which I thought good to set down in this place; Now they were in both Volums such.</p>

               <p>THE Pythagorians say <hi>(Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> are of opinion) that the very Elements of letters have some certain divine numbers, by which collected from proper names of things, we may draw conjectures concerning occult things to come. Whence they call this kind of divination Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy, because, <hi>viz.</hi> it is done by numbers, as <hi>Terentianus</hi> hath made mention of it in these verses.

Also <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, That there was added to what <hi>Pythagoras</hi> invented, an uneven number of vowels of imposed names, which did betoken lameness, or want of eyes, and such like misfortunes, if they be assigned to the right side parts; but an even number to them of the left. And <hi>Alexandrinus</hi> the Philosopher taught, How that by the number of letters we may find out the ruling Stars of any one that is born, and whether the husband or wife shall dye first, and know the prosperous, or unhappy events of the rest of our works. His traditions which were not disallowed by <hi>Ptolemy</hi> the Astrologer we shall here add, and put under. But those numbers, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to each letter, we have above shewed in the Greek, and Hebrew letters, the Alphabet being divided into three Classes, whereof the first is of unites, the second of tens, the third of hundreds. And seeing in the Roman Alphabet there are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four to make up the number of twenty seven Characters, their places are supplyed with I, and V simple consonants, as in the names of <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Valentine,</hi> and hi, and hu aspirate consonants as in <hi>Hierom,</hi> and <hi>Huilhelme,</hi> although the

               <head>CHAP. XXI. <hi>What numbers are consecrated to the Gods, and which are ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to what Elements.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MOreover the Pythagorians have dedicated to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and dieties of Heaven sacred numbers; for to the Aire they have assigned the number eight, and to fire five, to the earth six, to the water twelve. Besides, unity is ascribed to the Sun, which is the only King of the Stars, in which God put his Tabernacle; and that this also is of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> doth the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sative power of his ideal and intellectuall species testifie, who is the head, and the father of the Gods, as unity is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and parent of numbers: The number two is ascribed to the Moon, which is the second great light, and figures out the soul of the world, and is called <hi>Juno,</hi> because betwixt that and unity there is the first conjunction, and neer fellowship; it is also ascribed to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> two unfortunate Planets with the Astrologers; so the number three is ascribed to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Venus, viz.</hi> three fortunate planets, and is deputed to <hi>Vesta, Hecata,</hi> and <hi>Diana;</hi> hence they say,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Threefold is</hi> Hecate, <hi>three months</hi> Diana</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>The Virgin hath—</hi>
                     </l>

The number three therefore is dedicated to this Virgin whom they say to be powerfull in Heaven, and in Hell. The number four is of the Sun, which by that number constitutes the corners of the heavens, and distinguisheth seasons: it is also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to <hi>Cyllenius,</hi> because he alone is called the four square God. The number five consisting of the first even, and the first odd, as of female, and male, both sexes, is assigned to <hi>Mercury</hi> it is also attributed to the Celestiall world, which beyond the four Elements is it self under another form, the fift. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber six, which consists of two threes, as a Commixtion of both sexes, is by the Pythagorians ascribed to generation, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and belongs to <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Juno.</hi> The number seven is of rest, and belongs to <hi>Saturn;</hi> the same also doth dispence the motion, and light of the Moon, and therefore is called by the name of <hi>Tritonia</hi> the Virgin, because it begets nothing. It is assigned to <hi>Minerva,</hi> because it proceeds of nothing; also to <hi>Pallas</hi> the <hi>Virago,</hi> because it consists of numbers, as of males, and females. This also <hi>Plutarck</hi> ascribes to <hi>Apollo.</hi> The number eight, by reason it containes the mysterie of justice, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to <hi>Jupiter;</hi> it is also dedicated to <hi>Vulcan,</hi> for of the first motion, and number two, which is <hi>Juno</hi> drawn twice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it self, it consists; It is also attributed to <hi>Cybele</hi> the mother of the Gods, to whom every four square is attributed. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarck</hi> assigns it to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> or <hi>Dionysius,</hi> who is said to be born the eighth moneth: others, because Infants of the eight moneth do not live, have attributed it to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the three Ladies of destiny. The number nine belongs to the <hi>Moon,</hi> the utmost receptacle of all Celestiall influences, and vertues, as also it is dedicated to the nine Muses, as also to <hi>Mars,</hi> from whom is the end of all things. The number ten is <hi>Circular,</hi> and belongs to the <hi>Sun,</hi> after the same manner as unity; also it is attributed to <hi>Janus,</hi> because it is the end of the first order, and from whence begins the second unity; it is also ascribed to the world. In like manner the number twelve, because the Sun going round twelve signes, distributes the yeer into twelve moneths, is attributed to the world, the Heaven, and the Sun. The number eleven, because it is semicircular, is attributed to the Moon, and also deputed to <hi>Neptune.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>Of the tables of the Planets, their vertues, forms, and what Divine names, Intelligencies, and Spirits are set over them.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is affirmed by Magicians, that there are certain tables of numbers distributed to the seven planets, which they call the sacred tables of the planets, endowed with many, and very great vertues of the Heavens, in as much as they represent that divine order of Celestiall numbers, impressed upon Celestials by the <hi>Idea's</hi> of the divine mind, by means of the soul of the world, and the sweet harmony of those Celestiall rayes, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying according to the proportion of effigies, supercelestiall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencies, which can no other way be expressed, then by the marks of numbers, and Characters. For materiall numbers, and figures can do nothing in the mysteries of hid things, but representatively by formall numbers, and figures, as they are governed, and informed by intelligencies, and divine numerations, which unite the extreams of the matter, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to the will of the elevated soul, receiving through great affection, by the Celestiall power of the operator, a power from God, applyed through the soul of the universe, and observations of Celestiall constellations, to a matter fit for a form, the mediums being disposed by the skill, and industry of Magicians; But let us hasten to explain the tables severally. The first of them is assigned to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and consists of a square of three, containing the particular numbers of nine, and in every line three every way, and through each Diameter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fifteen. Now the whole sum of numbers is fourty five. Over this are of Divine names set such names as fill up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with an Intelligency to what is good, with a spirit to what is bad, and out of the same numbers is drawn the seal, or Character of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and of the spirits thereof, such as we shall beneath ascribe to its table. They say that this table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a fortunate <hi>Saturn</hi> engraven on a plate of lead, doth
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52070:136"/>
help to bring forth, or birth, and to make a man safe, and powerfull, and to cause success of petitious with princes, and powers: but if it be done with an unfortunate <hi>Saturn,</hi> that it hinders buildings, plantings, and the like, and casts a man from honours, and dignities, and causes discords, and quarrellings, and disperses an Army. The second is called the table of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which consists of a Quaternian drawn into it self, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing sixteen particular numbers, and in every line, and Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter four, making thirty four. Now the Sum of all is 136. And there are over it divine names with an Intelligence to good, with a spirit to bad, and out of it is drawn the Character of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the spirits thereof. They say that if it be impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon a Silver plate with <hi>Jupiter</hi> being powerfull, and rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it conduceth to gain, and riches, favor, and love, peace, and concord, and to appease enemies, to confirm honors, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and counsels, and dissolve enchantments if it be engraven on a corall. The third table belongs to <hi>Mars,</hi> which is made of a square of four containing twenty five numbers, and of these in every side and Diameter five, which make sixty five, and the sum of all is 325. And there are over it Divine names with an Intelligence to good, with a spirit to bad, and out of it is drawn the Character of <hi>Mars,</hi> and of his spirits. These with <hi>Mars</hi> being fortunate, being engraven on an Iron plate, or sword, makes a man potent in war, and judgments, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, and terrible to his enemies, and victorious against them; and if engraven upon the Stone Correola, it stops blood, and the mestrues; but if it be engraven with <hi>Mars</hi> being unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, on a plate of red Brass it hinders buildings, casts down the powerfull from dignities, honors, and riches, and causeth discord, strife, and hatred of men, and beasts, chaseth away Bees, Pigeons, and Fish, and hinders Mils, and renders them unfortunate that go forth to hunting, or fighting, and causeth barreness in men and women, and other Animals, and strikes a terror in all enemies, and compels them to submit. The fourth table is of the Sun, and is made of a square of six, and contains thirty six numbers, whereof six in every side, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter, produce III. and the sum of all is 666. There are over
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52070:136"/>
it divine names with an Intelligency to what is good, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to what is evil, and out of it are drawn Characters of the Sun, and of the spirits thereof. This being engraven on a Golden plate with the Sun being fortunate, renders him that wears it to be renowned, amiable, acceptable, potent in all his works, and equals a man to Kings, and Princes, elevating him to high fortunes, inabling to do whatsoever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth: but with an unfortunate Sun, it makes a tyrant, and a man to be proud, ambitious, unsatisfiable, and to have an ill ending. The fifth table is of <hi>Venus,</hi> consisting of a square of seven drawn into it self, <hi>viz.</hi> of fourty nine numbers, whereof seven on each side and Diameter make 175. and the sum of all is 1225. And there are over it divine names with an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligency to good, and spirit to evil; And there is drawn out of it the Character of <hi>Venus,</hi> and of the spirits thereof. This being engraven on a Silver plate, <hi>Venus</hi> being fortunate, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth concord, endeth strife, procureth the love of women, conduceth to conception, is good against barreness, causeth abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for generation, dissolves enchantments, and causeth peace between man, and woman, and maketh all kind of Animals and Cattle fruitful; and being put into a Dove-house, causeth an increase of Pigeons. It conduceth to the cure of all melancholy distempers, and causeth joyfulness; and being carryed about tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers makes them fortunate. But if it be formed upon Brass with an unfortunate <hi>Venus,</hi> it causeth contrary things to all that hath bin above said. The sixt table is of <hi>Mercury</hi> resulting from the square of eight drawn into it self, containing sixty four numbers, whereof eight on every side and by both Diameters make 260. and the sum of all 2080. and over it are set di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine names with an Intelligency to what is good, with a spirit to what is evil, and from it is drawn a Character of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and of the spirits thereof; and if it be with <hi>Mercury</hi> being fortunate engraven upon Silver, or Tin, or yellow Brass, or be writ upon Virgin Parchment, it renders the bearer thereof gratefull, and fortunate to do what he pleaseth: it bringeth gain, and prevents poverty, conduceth to memory, understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and divination, and to the understanding of occult things
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52070:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by dreams: and if it be an unfortunate <hi>Mercury,</hi> doth all things contrary to these. The seventh table is of the Moon, of a square of nine multipled into it self, having eighty one num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in every side and Diameter nine, producing 369. and the sum of all is 3321. And there are over it divine names with an Intelligency to what is good, and a spirit to what is bad. And it are drawn the Characters of the Moon, and of the spirits thereof. This fortunate Moon being engraven on Silver, renders the bearer thereof grateful, aimiable pleasant, cheerfull, honored, removing all malice, and ill will. It caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth security in a journey, increase of riches, and health of body, drives away enemies and other evil things from what place thou pleasest; and if it be an unfortunate Moon engraven in a plate of Lead, where ever it shall be buried, it makes that place unfortunate, and the inhabitants thereabouts, as also Ships, Rivers, Fountains, Mills, and it makes every man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, against which it shall be directly done, making him fly from his Country, and that place of his abode where it shall be buried, and it hinders Physitians, and Orators, and all men whatsoever in their office, against whom it shall be made. Now how the seals, and Characters of the Stars, and spirits are drawn from these tables, the wise searcher, and he which shall understand the verifying of these tables, shall easily find out.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. <hi>Of Geometrical Figures and Bodies, by what vertue they are powerful in Magick, and which are agreeable to each Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Heaven.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>GEometricall Figures also arising from numbers, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be of no less power. Of these first of all, a Circle doth answer to Unity, and the number ten; for Unity is the Center, and circumference of all things; and the number ten being heaped together returns into a Unity from whence it had its beginning, being the end and complement of all numbers. A circle is called an infinite line in which there is no <hi>Terminus a quo,</hi> nor <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> whose beginning and end is in every point, whence also a circular motion is called infinite, not according to time, but according to place; hence a circular being the largest and perfectest of all is judged to be most fit for bindings and conjurations; Whence they who adjure evil spirits, are wont to environ themselves about with a circle. A Pentangle also, as with the vertue of the number five hath a very great command over evil spirits, so by its lineature, by which it hath within five obtuse angles, and without five acutes, five double triangles by which it is surrounded. The interior pentangle containes in it great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which also is so to be enquired after, and understood; of the other figures, <hi>viz.</hi> triangle, quadrangle, sexangle, septangle, octangle, and the rest, of which many, as they are made of many and divers insections, obtain divers significations and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues according to the divers manner of drawing, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of lines, and numbers. The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> confirmed that the figure of the Cross hath very great power, and that is the most firm receptacle of all Celestial powers, and intelligencies, because it is the rightest figure of all, containing foure right angles, and it is the first description of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, having longitude and latitude: And they said it is inspired with the fortitude of the Celestials, because their fortitude
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52070:143"/>
results by the straitness of angles and rayes: And stars are then most potent when they possess four corners in the figure of the heaven, and make a cross, by the projection of their rayes mutually. It hath moreover (as we shewed before) a very great correspondency with the numbers 5. 7. 9. most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent numbers. It was also reckoned by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests, from the beginning of Religion amongst sacred letters, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying amonst them allegorically the life of future salvation. It was also impressed on the Picture of <hi>Serapis,</hi> and was had in great veneration amongst the Greeks. But what here belongs to Religion we shall discuss elsewhere. This is to be observed, whatsoever wonderfull thing figures work when we write them in Papers, Plates, or Images, they do not do it but by the vertue acquired from sublimer figures, by a certain affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which a natural apitude or resemblance procures, in as much as they are exactly configured to them, as from an opposite wall the Eccho is caused, and in a hollow glass the collection of the solarie rayes, which afterward reflecting upon an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site body, either wood, or any combustible thing, doth forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with burne it: or as an Harpe causeth a resounding in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Harpe, which is no otherwise but because a sutable and a like figure is set before it, or as two strings on a Harpe being touched with an equall distance of time, and modulated to the same intention, when one is touched the other shakes also: Also the figures, of which we have spoken, &amp; what characters so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever concern the vertues of the Celestial figures as they shall be opportunely impressed upon things, those ruling, or be rightly framed, as one figure is of affinity with, and doth express an other. And as these are spoken of figures, so also they are to be understood of Geometrical bodies, which are a Sphear, a Tetracedron, Hexacedron, Octocedron, Icocedron, Dodeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedron, and such like. Neither must we pass over what figures <hi>Phythagoras</hi> and his followers, <hi>Timeus, Locrus,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> assigned to the Elements and Heavens: for first of all they assigned to the earth a four square, and a square of eight solid angles, and of twenty four plains, and six bases in form of a Dice: to the fire, a Pryamis of a four triangular basis, and of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52070:143"/>
so many solid angles, and of twelve plaines; to the aire Octoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, of eight triangular bases, and six solid angles, and twenty four plains: and lastly, to Water they have assigned Icoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron twenty bases, twelve solid angles: To the Heaven they have assigned Dodecacedron of twelve five cornered bases, and twenty solid angles, and sixty plaines. Now he which knows the powers, relations, and proprieties of these figures, and bodies, shall be able to work many wonderful things in Natural and Mathematical Magick, especially in Glasses. And I knew how to make by them wonderful things, in which any one might see whatsoever he pleased at a long distance.</p>

               <p>MUsical Harmony also is not destitute of the gifts of the Stars; for it is a most powerful imaginer of all things, which whilst it follows opportunely the Celestial bodies, doth wonderfully allure the Celestial influence, and doth change the affections, intentions, gestures, motions, actions and dispositions of all the hearers, and doth quietly allure them to its own properties, as to gladness, lamentation, to boldness, or rest, and the like; also it allures Beasts, Serpents, Birds, Dolphins to the hearing of its pleasant tunes. So Birds are allured with Pipes, and Harts are caught by the same. Fish in the lake of <hi>Alexandria</hi> are delighted with a noise. Musick hath caused friendship betwixt Men and Dolphins. The sound of the Harp doth lead up and down the Hyperborean Swans. Melodious voyces tame the <hi>Indian</hi> Elephants: and the very Elements delight in Musick. The <hi>Hulesian</hi> fountain otherwise calm, and quiet, if the Trumpet sound, riseth up rejoycing, and swells over its banks. There are in <hi>Lydia</hi> those which they call the Nymphs Ilands, which at the sound of a Trumpet forthwith come into the middle of the sea, and turning round <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ead a dance, and then are returned to the shores; M. <hi>Varro</hi> testifies that he saw them. And there are more wonderful
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52070:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things then these. For in the shore of <hi>Attica</hi> the sea sounds like a Harpe. A certain stone of <hi>Megaris</hi> makes a sound like a Harpe every time the string of a Harpe is struck; so great is the power of Musick, that it appeaseth the minde, raiseth the spirit, stirreth up souldiers to fight, and refresheth the weary, calls back them that are desperate, refresheth travellers. And the <hi>Arabians</hi> say, that Camels carrying burdens are refreshed by the singing of their leaders. In like manner, they that carry great burdens, sing, and are thereby strengthened and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for singing causeth delight and strength, pacifieth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, cheareth up those that are sad and heavy, pacifieth ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, moderates the rage of mad men, chaseth away vain ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations: Hence it is that <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Theophrastus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that some diseases of the body, and minde may thus be cured, or caused. So we read that <hi>Therpander,</hi> and <hi>Arion</hi> of <hi>Lesbos</hi> cured the <hi>Lesbians,</hi> and <hi>Jonians</hi> by Musick; and <hi>Ismenia</hi> of <hi>Thebes</hi> cured divers of very great diseases by Musick; More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Orpheus, Amphion, David, Phythagoras, Empedocles, Asclepiades, Timotheus,</hi> were wont to do many wonderful things by sounds: Sometimes they did stir up dull spirits by familiar sounds; sometimes they did restrain wanton, furious, angry spirits by more grave tones. So <hi>David</hi> with a Harp mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated <hi>Saul</hi> in a rage. So <hi>Phythagoras</hi> recalled a luxurious yong man from immoderate lust. So <hi>Timotheus</hi> stirred up King <hi>Alexander</hi> to a rage, and again repressed him. <hi>Saxo</hi> the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matian, in his History of the <hi>Danes,</hi> tells of a certan Musician who boasted that he could by his Musick make every one that heard it to be mad; and when he was constrained by the King command to perform the same, he endeavoured to work seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wayes upon the affections; and first, by a tone of Musical gravity filled the hearers with a kinde of sadness and unsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness; then by a more lively sound he made them rejoyce, and dance; and lastly, he by a more earnest Musick, reduced them to fury and madness. We read also, that they in <hi>Apulia</hi> that were touched with a kinde of dangerous Spider, were astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed untill they heard a certain sound, at the hearing of which every one riseth up and danceth. And it is believed <hi>(Gelli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </head>
               <p>MOreover we shall not deny, that there is in Sounds a vertue to receive the heavenly gifts; if with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> we thought the heavens to consist by an Harmonial composition, and to rule and cause all things by Harmonial tones and motions: Singing can do more then the sound of an Instrument, in as much as it arising by an Harmonial consent, from the conceit of the minde, and imperious affection of the phantasie and heart, easily penetrateth by motion, with the refracted and well tempered Air, the aerious spirit of the hearer, which is the bond of soul and body; and transferring the affection and minde of the Singer with it, It moveth the affection of the hearer by his affection, and the hearers phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie by his phantasie, and minde by his minde, and striketh the minde, and striketh the heart, and pierceth even to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the soul, and by little and little, infuseth even dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions: moreover it moveth and stoppeth the members and the humors of the body. From hence in moving the affections har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony conferreth so much, that not onely natural, but also ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial and vocal Harmony doth yield a certain power both to the souls and bodies: but it is necessary that all Conforts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from fit foundations, both in stringed instruments, in pipes, and vocall singings, if you would have them agree well together: for no man can make the roaring of Lions, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>owing of Oxen, the neighing of Horses, the braying of Asses, the grunting of Hogs to be harmonious: neither can the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52070:145"/>
strings made of Sheeps and Wolves guts, be brought to any agreement, because their soundations are dissonant; but the many and divers voyces of men agree together, because they have one foundation in the species or kinde: so many birds agree, because they have one nigh genus or kinde, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance from above; also artificiall instruments agree with natural voyces, because the similitude that is betwixt them, is either true and manifest, or hath a certain analogy. But every harmony is either of sounds or voyces. Sound is a breath, voyce is a sound and animate breath; Speech is a breath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with sound, and a voyce signifying something: the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of which proceedeth out of the mouth with sound and voyce; <hi>Chaludius</hi> saith that a voyce is sent forth out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cavity of the breast and heart, by the assistance of the spirit. By which, together with the tongue, forming, and striking the narrow passages of the mouth, and by the other vocall organs, are delivered forth articulate sounds; the elements of speech, by which Interpreter the secret motions of the minde are laid open: but <hi>Lactantius</hi> saith, that the nature of the voyce is very obscure, and cannot be comprehended how it is made, or what it is. To conclude, All Musick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in voice, in sound, and hearing: sound without Air can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Audible, which though it be necessary for hearing, yet, as Aire, it is not of it self audible, nor to be perceived by any sense, unless by accident; for the Sight seeth it not, unless it be coloured, nor the Ears unless sounding, nor the Smell unless odoriferous, nor the Taste unless it be sapid, nor the Touch unless it be cold or hot, and so forth: Therefore though sound cannot be made without Air, yet is not sound of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Air, nor air of the nature of sound, but air is the body of the life of our sensitive spirit, and is not of the nature of any sensible object, but of a more simple and higher vertue; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. <hi>Concerning the agreement of them with the Celestial bodies, and what harmony and sound is correspondent of every Star.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BUt understanding now, that of the seven Planets, <hi>Saturn, Mars,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> have more of the voice then of the Harmony. <hi>Saturn</hi> hath sad, hoarse, heavy, and slow words, and sounds, as it were pressed to the Center; but <hi>Mars,</hi> rough, sharp, threatning great and wrathful words: the <hi>Moon</hi> observeth a mean betwixt these two; but <hi>Jupiter, Sol, Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> do possess Harmonies; yet <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath grave, constant, fixed, sweet, merry, and pleasant Consorts; <hi>Sol</hi> venerable, settled, pure and sweet, with a certain grace; but <hi>Venus</hi> lascivious, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, delicate, voluptuous, dissolute and fluent: <hi>Mercury</hi> hath Harmonies more remiss, and various, merry and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, with a certain boldness: but the Tone of particulars, and proportionated Consorts obeyeth the nine <hi>Muses. Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> hath the grace of the octave, and also the quinte, <hi>viz.</hi> the Diapason with the Diapente: <hi>Sol</hi> obtains the melody of the octave voice, <hi>viz.</hi> Diapason; in like manner by fifteen Tones, a Disdiapason; <hi>Venus</hi> keepeth the grace of the quinte or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apente. <hi>Mercury</hi> hath Diatessaron; <hi>viz.</hi> the grace of the quarte: Moreover the ancients being content with four strings, as with the number of Elements, accounted <hi>Mercury</hi> the Author of them, as <hi>Nicomachus</hi> reports, and by their Base strings would resemble the earth, by their Pathypas or middle the water; by their note <hi>Diezeugmenon,</hi> or Hyperboleon the fire; by the Paranete or Synemmenon, or treble, the Air; but afterwards <hi>Terpander</hi> the <hi>Lesbian</hi> finding out the seventh string, equalled them to the number of the Planets. Moreover, they that followed the number of the Elements, did affirm, that the four kinds of Musick do agree to them, and also to the four humors, and did think the <hi>Dorian</hi> musick to be conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the water and phlegm, the <hi>Phrygian</hi> to choler and

fire, the <hi>Lydian</hi> to blood and air; the mixt <hi>Lydian</hi> to melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and earth: Others respecting the number and vertue of the Heavens, have attributed the <hi>Dorian</hi> to the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> to <hi>Mars,</hi> the <hi>Lydian</hi> to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the mixt <hi>Lydian</hi> to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> the <hi>Hypophrygian</hi> to <hi>Mercury,</hi> the <hi>Hypolydian</hi> to <hi>Venus,</hi> the <hi>Hypodorian</hi> to the <hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>Hypo</hi> mixed <hi>Lydian</hi> to the mixed <hi>Stars:</hi> Moreover they refer these modes of Musick to the Muses, and the strings to the Heavens, but not in that order as we have declared concerning the nine Muses, amongst our numbers and celestial souls; for they say <hi>Thalia</hi> hath no Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, therefore ascribe her to Silence, and the Earth; but <hi>Clio</hi> with the <hi>Moon</hi> move after the <hi>Hypodorian</hi> manner; the string <hi>Proslambanomenos</hi> &amp; Asre. <hi>Calliope</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> possess the <hi>Hypophrygian</hi> maner, and the <hi>Chord, Hypate-Hypa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> or <hi>B.

               <p>Moreover there are some who find out the harmony of the Heavens by their distance one from another. For that space which is betwixt the Earth and the Moon, <hi>viz</hi> an hundred and twenty six thousand <hi>Italian</hi> Miles, maketh the Intervall of a Tone; But from the Moon to Mercury being half that space, maketh half a Tone; And so much from Mercury to Venus maketh another half Tone; But from thence to the Sun, as it were a threefold Tone and a half, and makes <hi>Diapente;</hi> But from the Moon to the Sun, maketh a twofold <hi>Diatessaron</hi> with a half; Again from the Sun to <hi>Mars</hi> is the same space as from the Earth to the Moon, making a Tone; from thence to <hi>Jupiter</hi> half of the same making half a Tone; So much likewise from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> to <hi>Saturn,</hi> constituting an half Tone, from whence to the starry firmament is also the space of an half Tone. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is from the Sun to the fixed Stars a Diatessaron distance of two tones and an half, but from the Earth a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Diapason of six perfect tones; moreover also from the proportion of the motions of the planets amongst themselves, and with the eight Sphere, resulteth the sweetest Harmony of all; for the proportion of the motions of <hi>Saturn</hi> to <hi>Jupiters</hi> motion, is two fold and an half; of <hi>Jupiter</hi> to <hi>Mars,</hi> a six fold proportion; of <hi>Mars</hi> to the Sun, <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> which in a manner finish their course in the same time, is a double proportion; their motions to the Moon have a twelve-fold proportion: but <hi>Saturns</hi> proportion to the starry Sphere is a a thousand and two hundred if it be true which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> saith, <hi>viz.</hi> that, that Heaven is moved contrary to the <hi>primum mobile</hi> in an hundred yeers one degree. Therefore the proper motion of the Moon being more swift, maketh a more acute sound then the starry firmament, which is the slowest of all,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52070:147"/>
and therefore causeth the most base sound; But by the violent motion of the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> is the most swift, and acute sound of all; but the violent motion of the Moon is most slow and heavy, which proportion and reciprocation of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons yeelds a most pleasant Harmony; from hence there are not any songs, sounds, or musicall instruments more powerfull in moving mans affections, or introducing magicall impressions, then those which are composed of numbers, measures, and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>portions, after the example of the Heavens. Also the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Elements is drawn forth from their Bases, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, of the which we have spoken before; for between Fire and Aire, there is a double proportion in the Bases, and one and an half in solid Angles; again in Planes, a double; there aris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hence an Harmony of a double Diapason, and a Diapente. Betwixt the Aire and Water, the proportion in their Bases is double, and one and an half; hence Diapason, and Diapente; but in their Angles double; Hence again Diapason; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Water and Earth the proportion in the Bases, is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and a third part more; from hence ariseth Diapason, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente, Diatessaron; but in the Angles one and an half, again constituting Diapente. To conclude, betwixt Earth and Fire, in the Bases the proportion is one and an half, making Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente; but in the Angles, double, causing Diapason; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Fire, and Water, Aire and Earth, there is scarce any consonancy, because they have a perfect contrariety in their qualities, but they are united by the intermediate Element.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. <hi>Of the proportion, measure, and Harmony of mans body.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SEeing man is the most beautifull and perfectest work of God, and his Image, and also the lesser world; therefore he by a more perfect composition, and sweet Harmony, and more sublime dignity doth contain and maintain in himself all numbers, measures, weights, motions, Elements, and all other things which are of his composition; and in him as it were in the supreme workmanship, all things obtain a certain high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, beyond the ordinary consonancy which they have in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compounds. From hence all the Ancients in time past did number by their fingers, and shewed all numbers by them; and they seem to prove that from the very joynts of mans body all numbers measures, proportions, and Harmonies were invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Hence according to this measure of the body, they fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and contrived their temples, pallaces, houses, Theaters; also their ships, engins, and every kind of Artifice, and every part and member of their edifices, and buildings, as columnes, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters of pillars, bases, buttresses, feet of pillars, and all of this kind. Moreover God himself taught <hi>Noab</hi> to build the Arke according to the measure of mans body, and he made the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the world proportionable to mans body; from hence it is called the great world, mans body the lesse; Therefore some who have written of the Microcosme or of man, measure the body by six feet, a foot by ten degrees, every degree by five minutes; from hence are numbred sixty degrees, which make three hundred minutes, to the which are compared so many Geometrical cubits, by which <hi>Moses</hi> describes the Arke; for as the body of man is in length three hundred mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, in breath fifty, in height thirty; so the length of the Arke was three hundred cubits, the breadth fifty, and the eight thirty; that the proportion of the length to the breadth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e six fold, to the heighth ten fold, and the proportion of the breadth to the height about two thirds. In like manner the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52070:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
measures of all the members are proportionate, and consonant both to the parts of the world, and measures of the Archetype, and so agreeing, that there is no member in man which hath not correspondence with some sign, Star, intelligence, divine name, something in God himself the Archetype. But the whole measure of the body may be turned, and proceeding from roundness, is knowen to tend to it again.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:52070:148"/>
Also the four square measure is the most proportionated body; for, if a man be placed upright with his feet together, and his arms stretched forth, he will make a quadrature equilateral, whose center is in the botom of his belly.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:52070:149"/>
But if on the same center a circle be made by the crown of the head, the arms being let fall so far till the end of the fingers touch the circumference of that circle, and the feet spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the same circumference, as much as the fingers ends are distant from the top of the head; Then they divide that circle, which was drawn from the center of the lower belly, into five equale parts, and do constitute a perfect Pentagon; and the Heels of the feet, having reference to the navile, make a triangle of equal sides.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:52070:149"/>
But if the Heels being unmoved, the feet be stretched forth on both sides to the right and left, and the hands lifted up to the line of the head, then the ends of the fingers and Toes do make a square of equall sides, whose center is on the navile, in the girdling of the body.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:52070:150"/>
But if the hands be thus elevated, and the feet and Thighes extended in this manner, by the which a man is made shorter by the fourteenth part of his upright stature, then the distance of his feet having reference to the lower belly, they will make an equilatecall Triangle; and the center being placed in his navile, a circle being brought about, will touch the ends of the fingers and toes.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:52070:150"/>
But if the hands be lifted up as high as can be, above the head, then the elbow will be equal to the crown of the head, and if then the feet being put together, a man stand thus, he may be put into an equilaterall square brought by the extremities of the hands and feet: the center of this square is the navel, which is the middle betwixt the top of the head and the knees.</p>

                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:52070:151"/>
Now let us proceed to particular measures. The compass of a man under the armpits contains the middle of his length, whose middle is the bottom of his breast: and from thence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the middle of his breast betwixt both dugges, and from the middle of his breast unto the crown of his head, on every side the fourth part; also from the bottom of his breast to the bottom of the knees, and from thence to the bottom of the ankles the fourth part of man. The same is the latitude of his shoulder-blades from one extream to the other: The same is the length from the elbow to the end of the longest finger, and therefore this is called a cubit. Hence four cubits make the length of man, and one cubit the bredth which is in the shoulder-blades, but that which is in the compass, one foot; now six hand-bredths make a cubit, four a foot, and four fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers bredths make a hand-bredth, and the whole length of man is of twenty four hand bredths, of six foot, of ninty six fingers bredths. From the bottom of his breast to the top of his breast, is the sixth part of his length, from the top of his breast to the top of his forehead, and lowermost root of his hairs, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth part of his length; of a strong, and well set body, a foot is the sixth part of the length, but of a tall the seventh. Neither can (as <hi>Varro,</hi> and <hi>Gellius</hi> testifie) the tallness of mans body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed seven feet. Lastly, the Diameter of his compass is the same measure as is from the hand, being shut unto the inward bending of the elbow, and as that which is from the breast to both dugs, upward to the upward lip, or downward to the navel; and as that which is from the ends of the bones of the uppermost part of the breast compassing the gullet; and as that which is from the sole of the foot to the end of the call of the legg, and from thence to the middle whirle bone of the knee. All these measures are co-equall, and make the seventh part of the whole height. The nead of a man from the bottom of the chin to the crown of his head is the eighth part of his length, as also from the elbow to the end of the shoulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blade: So great is the Diameter of the compass of a tall man. The compass of the head drawn by the top of the forehead, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the hincer part of the head, make the fist part of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:52070:151"/>
his whole length; So much also doth the bredth of the breast. Nine face-bredths make a square well set man, and ten a tall man. The length of man therefore being divided into nine parts the face from the top of the forehead to the bottome of the chin is one; then from the bottom of the throat, or the top of the breast unto the top of the stomack is another; from thence to the navell is a third; from thence to the bottom of the thigh, a fourth; from thence the hipp, to the top of the calf of the leg, makes two; from thence to the joynt of the foot the leggs make two more; all which are eight parts. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the space from the top of the forehead to the crown of the head &amp; that which is from the chin to the top of the breast, and that which is from the joynt of the foot to the sole of the foot, I say these three spaces joyned together make the ninth part. In bredth the breast hath two parts, and both Arms seven. But that body which ten face bredths make, is the most exactly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned. Therefore the first part of this is from the crown of the head to the bottome of the nose; from thence to the top of the breast, the second; and then to the top of the stomack the third; and from thence to the navel, the fourth; from thence to the privy members, the fifth; where is the middle of the length of man; from whence to the soles of his feet are five other parts, which being joyned to the former, make ten whole, by which every body is measured by a most proportioned measure. For the face of a man from the bottom of his chin, to the top of his forehead, and bottom of the hair is the tenth part. The hand of a man from the shutting, to the end of the longest fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is also one part; also betwixt the middle of both dugs is one part, and from both to the top of the gullet is an equilate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall triangle. The latitude of the lower part of the forehead from one eare to the other is another part; the latitude of the whole breast, <hi>viz.</hi> from the top of the breast to the joynts of the shoulder-blades, is on both sides one part, which make two. The compass of the head cross-wise from the distance of the eye brows by the top of the forehead unto the bottom of the hinder part of the head, where the hair ends, hath also two parts; from the shoulders on the outside unto the coupling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52070:152"/>
of the joynts of the hand, and on the inside from the arm-pits unto the beginning of the palm of the hand, and of the fingers, are three parts. The compass of the head by the middle of the forehead hath three parts; the compass of the girdling place hath four parts in a well set man, but in a thin body three parts and a half, or as much as is from the top of the breast to the bottom of the belly. The compass of the breast by the arm-pit to the back hath five parts, <hi>viz.</hi> as much as half the whole length. From the crown of the head, to the knurles of the gullet is the thirteenth part of the whole altitude. The arms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stretched upward, the elbow is even to the crown of the head. But now let us see how equal the other commensurations are to one the other. As much as the distance is from the chin to the top of the breast, so great is the latitude of the mouth; as much as is the distance betwixt the top of the breast, to the nàvell, so great is the compass of the mouth; as much as the distance is from the chin to the crown of the head, so great is the latitude of the girdling place; as is the distance from the top of the nose to the bottom, such is the distance betwixt the chin, and the throat. Also the cavity of the eyes from the place betwixt the eye-brows unto the inward corners, and the extension of the bottom of the nose, and the distance from the bottom of the nose to the end of the upper lip; I say these three are equals amongst themselves; and as much as from the top o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the nail of the forefinger to the lowermost joynt thereof.</p>

               <p>And from thence where the hand is joyned to the arm on the outside, and in the inside from the top of the naile of the middle finger unto the lowermost joynt, and from thence to the shut<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of the hand; I say all these parts are equall amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

joynt of the middle finger equals that space which is betwixt the end of the nose to the end of the chin; and the second joynt of the middle finger is as much as the distance from the bottom of the chin to the top of the lower lip; but the third as from the mouth to the end of the nose, but the whole hand as much as the whole face. The greater joynt of the thumb is as much as the widness of the mouth, and as the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the bottom of the chin, and the top of the lower lip; but the lesser joynt is as much as the distance betwixt the top of the lower and the end of the nose; the nailes are half as much as those joynts which they call the naile joynts. The distance betwixt the middle of the eye brows to the outward corners of the eyes is as much as betwixt those corners and the ears. The hight of the forehead, the length of the nose, and the widness of the mouth are equall. Also the bredth of the hand, and foot are the same. The distance betwixt the lower part of the ankle to the top of the foot is the same as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the top of the foot and the end of the nailes. The distance from the top of the forehead to the place betwixt the eyes, and from that to the end of the nose, and from thence to the end of the chin is the same. The eye-brows joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are as much as the circle of the eyes, and the half circle of the ears equals the widness of the mouth: Whence the circles of the eyes, ears, and mouth opened are equall. The bredth of the nose is as much as the length of the eye; Hence the eyes have two parts of that space which is betwixt both extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the eyes; a third part the nose that is betwixt take up. From the crown of the head to the knees the navel is the middle; from the top of the breast to the end of the nose the knurle of the throat makes the middle; from the crown of the head to the bottom of the chin, the eyes are the middle from the space betwixt the eyes to the bottom of the chin, the end of the nose is the middle: from the end of the nose to the bottom of the chin, the end of the lower lip is the middle; third part of the same distance is the upper lip.

to the wrest in a circular Measure in a double proportion and half; For it contains it twice and a half as five is to two; But the proportion of the same to the brawn of the Arm neer the shoulder is triple; The greatnesse of the leg is to that of the Arm, a proportion half so much again as of three to two; And the same proportion is of the neck to the leg, as of that to the Arm. The proportion of the thigh is triple to the Arm; The proportion of the whole Body to the Trunk, is eigth and a half; From the Trunk or Brest to the legs, and from thence to the soles of the Feet, a Third and a half; From the neck to the navell, and to the end of the trunk a Double. The latitude of them to the latitude of the thigh, is half so much again; of the head to the neck triple, of the head to the knee triple, the same to the leg. The length of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head betwixt the temples is fourfold to the height thereof; These are those measures which are every where found; by which the members of mans body according to the length, bredth, height, and circumference thereof agree amongst themselves, and also with the Celestials themselves: all which measures are divided by manifold proportions either upon them that divide, or are mixed, from whence there results a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Harmony. For a double proportion makes thrice a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apason; four times double, twice a Diapason, and Diapente. After the same manner are Elements, qualities, complexions, and humors proportioned. For these weights of humors and complexions are assigned to a sound and well composed man, <hi>viz.</hi> the eight weights of blood, of flegm four, of choler two, of melancholy one, that on both sides there be by order a double proportion; but of the first to the third, and of the second to the fourth, a four times double proportion; but of the first to the last an eightfold. <hi>Dioscorides</hi> saith, that the heart of a man in the first yeer hath the weight of two Drams, in the second four, and so proportionably in the fiftyeth yeer to have the weight of a hundred Drams, from which time the decreases are again reckoned to an equilibrium, which, the course being ended, may return to the same limit, and not

exceed the space of life by the decay of that member: by which account of a hundred years, he circumscribed the life of man. And this saith <hi>Pliny</hi> was the heresie of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> The motions also of the members of mens bodies answer to the Celestial motions, and every man hath in himself the motion of his heart, which answers to the motion of the Sun, and being diffused through the Arteries into the whole body, signifies to us by a most sure rule, years, moneths, dayes, hours, and minutes. Moreover, there is a certain Nerve found by the Anatomists about the nod of the neck, which being touched doth so move all the members of the body, that every one of them move according to its proper motion; by which like touch <hi>Aristotle</hi> thinks the members of the world are moved by God. And there are two veines in the neck, which being held hard presently the mans strength failes, and his senses are taken away untill they be loosened. Therefore the eternal Maker of the world when he was to put the soul into the body, as into its habitation, first made a fit lodging worthy to receive it, and endows the most excellent soul with a most beautiful body, which then the soul knowing its own divinity, frames and adorns for its own habitation. Hence the people of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which were governed by the wisdom of <hi>Gymno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophists,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> witnesseth, did make them Kings, not of those which were most strong, and wealthy, but those onely which were most proper and beautiful; for they conceived that the gallantry of the minde did depend upon the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the body. Which many Philosophers, as well ancient as moderne, considering, such as searched into the secrets of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses hid in the very Majesty of Nature, were bold to assert, that there was no fault of, and no disproportion in the body, which the vice and intemperance of the minde did not follow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is certain that they do increase, thrive, and operate by the help one of the other.</p>

So when thou art working any thing which belongs to any Planet, thou must place it in its dignities, fortunate, and powerful, and ruling in the day, hour, and in the Figure of the Heaven. Neither shalt thou expect the signification of the work to be powerful, but also thou must observe the <hi>Moon</hi> opportunely directed to this; for thou shalt do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the assistance of the <hi>Moon:</hi> And if thou hast more patterns of thy work, observe them all being most powerful, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon one the other with a friendly aspect: and if thou canst not have such aspects, it will be convenient at least that thou take them angular. But thou shalt take the <hi>Moon,</hi> either when she looks upon both, or is joyned to one, and looks upon the other; or when she passeth from the conjunction, or aspect of one to the conjuction or aspect of the other: for that I conceive must in no wise be omitted; also thou shalt in every work observe <hi>Mercury;</hi> for he is a messenger betwixt the higher gods, and infernal gods; when he goeth to the good he increaseth their goodness; when to the bad, hath influence upon their wickedness We call it an unfortunate Sign, or Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, when it is by the aspect of <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> especially op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, or quadrant; for these are aspects of enmity; but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, or a trine, or sextile aspect are of friendship; betwixt these there is a greater conjunction: but yet if thou dost alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy behold it through a trine, and the Planet be received, it is accounted as already conjoyned.

               <p>THere is the like consideration to be had in all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fixt stars. Know this that all the fixt stars are of the signification and nature of the seven Planets; but some are of the nature of one Planet, and some of two: Hence as often as any Planet is joyned with any of the fixt stars of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the signification of that star is made more powerful, and the nature of the Planet augmented: but if it be a star of two natures, the nature of that which shall be the stronger with it shall overcome in signification; as for example, if it be of the nature of <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> if <hi>Mars</hi> shall be the stronger with it, the nature of <hi>Mars</hi> shall overcome; but if <hi>Venus,</hi> the nature of <hi>Venus</hi> shall overcome. Now the natures of fixt stars are discovered by their colours, as they agree with certain Planets, and are ascribed to them. Now the colours of the Planets are these: of <hi>Saturn,</hi> blew, and leaden, and shining with this: of <hi>Jupiter</hi> citrine neer to a paleness, and clear with this; of <hi>Mars,</hi> red, and fiery; of the <hi>Sun,</hi> yellow, and when it riseth red, afterward glittering: of <hi>Venus,</hi> white and shining; white with the morning, and reddish in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: of <hi>Mercury,</hi> glittering; of the <hi>Moon,</hi> fair. Know also that of the fixed stars by how much the greater, and the brighter and apparent they are, so much the greater and stronger is the signification; such are these stars which are called by the Astrologers of the first, and second Magnitude. I will tell thee some of these which are more potent to this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, as are <hi>viz</hi> the Navel of <hi>Andromeda</hi> in two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> of the nature of <hi>Venus</hi> &amp; <hi>Mercury:</hi> some call it <hi>Jovial,</hi> &amp; <hi>Saturnine.</hi> The head of <hi>Algol</hi> in the eighteenth degree of <hi>Taurus,</hi> of the nature of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi> The <hi>Pleiades</hi> are also in the two and twentieth degree, a <hi>Lunary</hi> star by Nature and by complexion Martial.

The Star which is called the right wing of the Crow is in the seventh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Libra,</hi> and in the thirteenth degree of the same is the left wing of the same, and both of the nature of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars.</hi> The Star called <hi>Spica</hi> is in the sixteenth degree of the same, and is Venereal and Mercurial. In the seventeenth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the same is <hi>Alcameth,</hi> of the nature of <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter;</hi> but of this when the <hi>Suns</hi> aspect is full towards it; of that when on the contrary. <hi>Elepheia</hi> in the fourth degree of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> of the nature of <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mars:</hi> The Heart of the <hi>Scorpion</hi> is in the third degree of <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> of the nature of <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter:</hi> the falling Vulture is in the seventh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> Temperate, Mercurial, and Venereal: The taile of <hi>Capricorn</hi> is in the sixteenth degree of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> of the nature of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> The Star called the Shoulder of the Horse, is in the third degree of <hi>Piscis,</hi> of the nature of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars.</hi> And it shall be a general rule for thee to expect the proper gifts of the Stars whilest they rule, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented of them, they being unfortunate, and opposite, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove shewed.

               </head>
               <p>THe Sun, and Moon have obtained the administration or ruling of the Heavens, and all bodies under the heavens. The Sun is the Lord of all Elementary vertues; and the Moon by vertue of the Sun is the mistress of generation, increase, or decrease. Hence <hi>Albumasar</hi> saith, that by the Sun and Moon life is infused into all things, which therefore <hi>Orpheus</hi> cals the enlivening eyes of the heaven. The Sun giveth light to all things of it self, and give, it plentifully to all things not only in the Heaven, Aire, but Earth and Deep: whatsoever good we have, as <hi>Jamblicus</hi> saith, we have it from the Sun alone, or from it through other things. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> cals the Sun the fountain of Celestiall light; and many of the <hi>Platonists</hi> placed the soul of the world chiefly in the Sun, as that which filling the whole Globe of the Sun doth send forth its rayes on all sides as it were a spirit through all things, distributing life, sense and motion to the very Universe. Hence the ancient Naturalists called the Sun the very heart of heaven; and the <hi>Caldeans</hi> put it as the middle of the Planets. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> also placed it in the middle of the world, <hi>viz.</hi> betwixt the two fives of the world, <hi>e. i.</hi> above the Sun they place five Planets, and under the Sun, the Moon and four Elements. For it is amongst the other Stars the image and statue of the great Prince of both worlds, <hi>viz.</hi> Terrestiall, and Celestiall; the true light, and the most exact image of God himself; whose Essence resembles the Father, Light the Son, Heat the Holy Ghost. So that the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists have nothing to hold forth the Divine Essence more manifestly by, then this. So great is the consonancy of it to God, that <hi>Plato</hi> cals it the conspicuous Son of God; and <hi>Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicus</hi> cals it the divine image of divine intelligence. And our <hi>Dionysius</hi> cals it the perspicuous statue of God. It sits as King in the middle of other Planets, excelling all in light, greatness, fairness, enlightning all, distributing vertue to them to dispose inferior bodies, and regulating and disposing of their motions,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52070:158"/>
so that from thence their motions are called daily, or nightly, Southern, or Northren, Orientall, or Occidentiall, direct, or retrograde; and as it doth by its light drive away all the darkness of the night, so also all powers of darkness, which we read of in <hi>Job;</hi> Assoon as morning appears, they think of the shadow of death: And the Psalmist speaking of the Lyons whelps seeking leave of God to devour, saith, The Sun is risen, and they are gathered together, and shall be placed in their dens; which being put to flight, it followes, Man shall go forth to his labor. The Sun therefore as it possesseth the middle Region of the world, and as the heart is in Animals to the whole body, So the Sun is over the heaven, and the world, ruling over the whole Universe, and those things which are in it, the very author of seasons, from whence day and year, cold and heat, and all other qualities of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and as saith <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> when it comes unto the place of any Star, it stirs up the power thereof which it hath in the Aire. So as with <hi>Mars,</hi> heat; with <hi>Saturn,</hi> cold; and it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposeth even the very spirit and mind of man; from hence it is said by <hi>Homer,</hi> and approved by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that there are in the mind such like motions, as the Sun the Prince and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of the Planets every day bringeth to us; but the Moon, the nighest to the Earth, the receptacle of all the heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, by the swiftness of her course is joyned to the Sun, and the other Planets and Stars, every month, and being made as it were the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52070:158"/>
which it diversely issueth forth in these Inferiors, according to the diverse complexion, motion, situation, and different aspects to the planets and others Stars; and though it receiveth powers from all the Stars, yet especially from the Sun; as oft as it is in conjunction with the same, it is replenished with vivifying ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and according to the aspect thereof it borroweth its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; for in the first quarter, as the Peripatetickes deliver, it is hot and moist; in the second, hot and dry; in the third, cold and dry; in the fourth cold and moist; and although it is the lowest of the stars, yet it bringeth forth all the conceptions of the superiors; for from it in the heavenly bodies beginneth that series of things which <hi>Plato</hi> calleth the Golden Chain, by the which every thing and cause being linked one to an other, do depend on the superior, even untill it may be brought to the supreme cause of all, from which all things depend; from hence is it, that without the Moon intermediating, we cannot at any time attract the power of the superiors. Therefore <hi>Thebit</hi> adviseth vs, for the taking of the vertue of any Star, to take the stone and herb of that plant, when the Moon doth either fortunately get under or hath a good aspect on that Star.</p>

all things, but also in Images, Seals, Rings, Glasses, and some other Instruments, being opportunely framed under a certain constellation, some Celestiall Illustration may be taken, and some wonderfull thing may be received; for the beams of the Celestiall bodies being animated, living, sensuall, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with them admirable gifts, and a most violent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, do, even in a moment, and at the first touch, imprint won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull powers in the Images, though their matter be less ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. Yet they bestow more powerfull vertues on the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, if they be framed not of any, but of a certain matter, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whose naturall, and also specificall vertue is agreeable with the work, and the figure of the image is like to the Celestial; for such an Image, both in regard of the matter naturally congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the operation and Celestiall influence, and also for its figure being like to the Heavenly one, is best prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the operations and powers of the Celestiall bodies and figures, and instantly receiveth the Heavenly gift into it self; then it constantly worketh on another thing, and other things do yeeld obedience to it.

               </head>
               <p>THere remains as yet an other manner of images not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the similitude of Celestiall figures, but according to the similitude of that which the mind of the worker desires, of whose they are the effigies, and representation: So to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure love we make images embracing one the other: to discord, striking one the other; to bring misery, or destruction as dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to a man or house, or City or any thing else, we make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages distorted, broken in members, and parts after the likeness and figure of that thing which we would destroy or damnifie; And Magicians advise us that in casting or engraving images we would write upon it the name of the effect; and this on the back when evill, as destruction; on the belly when good, as love. Moreover in the forehead of the image let be written the name of the species or Jndividuum which the image re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents, or for whom or against whom it is made. Also on the breast let the name of the signe or face ascending, and Lord thereof be written; also the names and Characters of its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. Moreover in making the image they advise that prayer for the effect for which it is made, be used. All which <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Magnus</hi> in his <hi>Speculo</hi> affirms. Now they use the images being made diversly according to the vertues thereof; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they hang them or binde them to the body; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they bury them under the Earth, or a River; sometimes they hang them in a Chimny over the smoak, or upon a tree that they be moved by the wind; sometime with the head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, &amp; sometimes downward; sometimes they put them into hot water, or into the fire. For they say as the workers of the images do affect the image it self, so doth it bring the like pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

art that when he drowned those images in water, that the ships of his enemies were in like maner drowned in the Sea, and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arded. Now that part of Astrology which is writ concerning elections, teacheth us that the constellations also are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for the making of images, and such like.</p>

               <head>CHAP. L. <hi>Of certain Celestial observations and the practise of some Images.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I will now shew thee the observation of Celestiall bodyes, which are required for the practise of some of these kind of images; So to make any one fortunate, we make an image in which these are fortunate, <hi>viz.</hi> the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator of the life thereof, the givers of life, the signs, and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. Moreover let the ascendent, the middle of the heaven, and the Lords thereof be fortunate: also the place of the Sun, and place of the Moon; part of fortune, and Lord of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or prevention made before their nativity, by depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Malignant Planets. But if we will make an image to procure misery, we must do contrarywise, and those which we place here fortunate, must there be infortunate, by raising ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Stars. In like manner must we do to make any place, Region, City, or house fortunate. Also for destroying or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing any of the foresaid; Let there be made an image under the ascension of that man whom thou wouldst destroy, and prejudice, and thou shall make unfortunate, the Lord of the house of his life, the Lord of the ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Moon, the lord of the house of the Moon, and the lord of the house of the lord ascending, and the tenth house, and the lord thereof. Now for the fitting of any place, place fortunes in the ascendent thereof; and in the first, and tenth and second, and eighth house, thou shall make the lord of the ascendent, and the lord of the house of the Moon fortunate. But to chase away certain Animals from certain places, that they may not be generated, or abide there, let there be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age made under the ascension of that Animal, which thou
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:52070:172"/>
wouldst chase away, and after the likeness thereof; as if thou wouldest chase away <hi>Scorpions</hi> from any place, let an image of the <hi>Scorpion</hi> be made, the sign of <hi>Scorpio</hi> ascending with the Moon, and thou shalt make unfortunate the ascendent, and lord thereof, and the Lord of the house of <hi>Mars;</hi> and thou shall make unfortunate the lord of the ascendent in the eighth house, and let them be joyned with an aspect malignant, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, or quadrant: and let there be writ upon the image the name of the ascendent, of the Lord thereof, and of the Moon, and of the lord of the day, and of the Lord of the hour. And let there be a pit made in the middle of the place, from which thou wouldst drive them; and let there be carryed into it, some of the earth taken out of the four corners of the same place, and let the image be buryed there with the head down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with saying, this is the burying of the <hi>Scorpions,</hi> that they may not come into this place, and so of the rest. So for gain let there be made an image under the ascendent of the nativity of the man, or under the ascension of that place to which thou wouldest appoint the gain; and thou shall make the lord of the second house, which is in the house of substance to be joyned with the Lord of the ascendent in the trine or sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, and let there be a reception amongst them; thou shall make fortunate the eleventh and the Lord thereof, and the eighth; and if thou canst, put part of the fortune in the ascendent, or second; and let the image be buryed in that place, or carryed from that place, to which thou wouldest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the gain. Also for concord, and love, let there be an image made in the day of <hi>Jupiter</hi> under the ascendent of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of him whom thou wouldst have be beloved, make for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate the ascendent, and the tenth, and hide the evil from the ascendent; and thou must have the Lord of the tenth, and planets of the eleveneth fortune, joyned to the Lord of the ascendent, from the trine or sextil with reception; then make an other image for him whom thou wouldest stir up to love; consider if he be a friend, or companion of him whom thou wouldst have be beloved; and if so, let there be an image made under the ascension of the eleventh house from the ascendent
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:52070:173"/>
of the first image; but if the party be a wife, or a husband, let it be made under the ascension of the seventh; if a brother, or a sister, or a cousin, let it be made under the ascension of the third, and so of the like; and put the significator of the ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the second image, joyned to the significator of the ascendent of the first image; and let there be betwixt them a reception, and let the rest be fortunate, as in the first image; afterwards joyn both images together into a mutual embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or put the face of the second image to the back of the first image, and let them be wrapt up in silk, and cast away or spoiled. Also for success of petitions, and for the obtaining of a thing denyed, or taken, or possessed by an other, let there be an image made under the ascendent of him who peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the thing; and cause that the Lord of the second be joyned with the lord of the ascendent from a trine, or sextile, and let there be a reception betwixt them, and if it can be, let the Lord of the second be in the obeying signs, and the Lord of the ascendent in the ruling, make fortunate the ascendent, and the Lord thereof, and take heed that the lord of the ascendent be not retrograde or combust, or falling, or in the house of opposition <hi>i. e.</hi> in the seventh from his own house; let him not be hindred by the malignant, let him be strong, &amp; in an angle; Thou shalt make fortunate the ascendent, and the Lord of the second and the Moon; and make another image for him that is peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to, and begin it under the ascendent belonging to him, as if he be a King or a Prince, begin it under the ascendent of the tenth house from the ascendent of the first image; If he be a father under the fourth; if a son under fifth, and so of the like; and put the significator of the second image, joyned with the lord of the ascendent of the first image, from a trine, or sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and let him receive it, and put them both strong, and fortunate without any let; make all evill fall from them. Thou shall make fortunate the tenth, and the fourth if thou canst or any of them; and when the second image shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, joyn it with the first, face to face, and wrap them in clean linnen, and bury them in the middle of his house who is the petitioner under a fortunate significator, the fortune being
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:52070:173"/>
strong, and let the face of the first image be toward the North, or rather toward that place where the thing petitioned for doth abide; or if it happen that the petitioner goeth forward towards him with whom the thing petitioned for is, let him bring the images with him as far ar he goes. And let there be made an image of dreams, which being put under the head of him that sleeps, makes him dream true dreams concerning any thing that he hath formerly deliberated of; and let the figure of that be the figure of a man sleeping in the bosome of an Angel, which thou shall make in the Lyon ascending, the Sun keeping the nineth house in <hi>Aries;</hi> thou shalt writ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the breast of the man the name of the effect desired, and in the hand of the Angel the name of the intelligence of the Sun. Let the same image be made in <hi>Virgo</hi> ascending, <hi>Mercury</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fortunate in <hi>Aries</hi> in the ninth house, or <hi>Gemini</hi> ascending in <hi>Mercury</hi> being fortunate, and keeping the ninth house in <hi>Aquarius;</hi> and let it be received from <hi>Saturn</hi> with a fortunate aspect, and let the name of the spirit of <hi>Mercury</hi> be writ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. Let also the same be made in <hi>Libra</hi> ascending, <hi>Venus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received from <hi>Mercury</hi> in <hi>Gemini</hi> in the ninth house, by writting upon it the Angel of <hi>Venus.</hi> Besides also let the same image be made in <hi>Aquarius</hi> ascending, <hi>Saturn</hi> fortunately possessing the ninth house in his exaltation, which is in <hi>Libra,</hi> and let there be writ upon it the Angel of <hi>Saturn.</hi> Moreover let it be made in <hi>Cancer</hi> ascending the Moon being received by <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Pisces,</hi> and being fortunately placed in the ninth house, and let there be writ upon it the spirit of the Moon. There are also made rings of dreams of wonderfull efficacy; and there are rings of the Sun, and <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the constellation of them is when the Sun or <hi>Saturn</hi> ascend in their exaltations in the ninth house, and when the Moon is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Saturn</hi> in the ninth house, and in that signe, which was the ninth house of Nativity; and let there be writ upon the rings the name of the spirit of the Sun, or <hi>Saturn.</hi> Let this which hath been spoken suffice concerning images, for nowthou mayst find out more of this nature of thy self. But know this
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:52070:174"/>
that such images work nothing, unless they be so vivified that either a naturall, or Celestiall, or Heroicall, or animasticall, or Demoniacall, or angelicall vertue be in them, or assistant to them. But who can give a soul to an image, or make a stone to live, or mettal, or wood, or wax? and who can raise out of stones children unto <hi>Abraham?</hi> Certainly this Arcanum doth not enter into an Artist of a stiffe neck; neither can he give those things which hath them not. No body hath them but he who doth (the Elements being restrained, nature being overcome, the Heavens being over powered) transcend the progress of Angels, and comes to the very Archetype it self, of which being then made a cooperator may do all things, as we shall speak afterwards.</p>

               <p>WE have spoken above of a certain manner of Images made not after the likeness of Celestial Images, but according to the emulation of that which the minde of the Operator doth desire. In like manner also it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of Characters; for such like Characters are nothing else then images ill dearticulated; yet having a certain probable si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude with the Celestial images, or with that which the mind of the Operator desires, whether that be from the whole image, or from certain markes thereof expressing the whole image. As the Characters of <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Taurus</hi> we make thus from their horns ♈ ♉.

               <p>WE have spoken in the foregoing Chapters of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kindes of Divinations: But this is to be noted that all these require the use and rules of Astrology, as a key most necessary for the knowledge of all secrets; and that all kinds of Divinations whatsoever have their root and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Astrologie so, as that without it they are of little or no use; yet Astrological Divination, in as much as the Celestials are causes and signs of all those things which are, and are done
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:52070:178"/>
in these inferiors, doth give most certain demonstations by the situation, and motion onely of Celestial bodies, of those things which are occult or future; of which we shall in this place speak no further, since of this Science huge Volums have been wrote by the Ancients, and are everywhere extant. Therefore whether the Physiognomists lookupon the body, or countenance or forehead, or hand, or the Soothsayer, searcheth by dreams or Auspicia, that the judgment may be right, the figure of heaven is also to be enquired into. From the judgements whereof, together with conjectures of similitudes and signs, are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced true opinions of the significators. Also if any prodigie shall appear, the Figure of the heaven is to be erected; also such things are to be enquired after, which have gone before in the revolutions of years from great conjunctions, and Eclipses: then also the Nativities, beginnings, intronizations, foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and revolutions, perfections, directions of Princes, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Kingdoms, Cities, when these shall appear, and upon what place of the Celestial figure these fell; that by all these at length we may come to a rational and probable significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these things. After the same manner, but with less la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, we must proceed in the Exposition of dreams. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they that being distempered foretell future things, do it not but as they are instigated by the stars, or inferior instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of these, whence their Predictions must at length be imputed to the Celestials, as we read in <hi>Lucan</hi> the old Prophet <hi>Tuscus,</hi>

                     <l>The Light'nings motion, and the veines which are</l>

After the City was viewed, the Sacrifice slain, the inspection into the intrals did at length by the dispositions of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial stars pronounce judgement. Also Geomancy it self the most accurate of Divinations, which divines by points of the earth, or any other superfices, or by a fall, or any other power inscribed, doth first reduce them to Celestial figures, <hi>viz.</hi> to

those sixteen which we above named, making judgement after an Astrological manner, by the properties and observations thereof: and hither are referred all natural Divinations by lots whatsoever, the power whereof can be from no where else then from the heaven, and from the minde of them that work them. For whatsoever is moved, caused or produced in these inferiors, must of necessity imitate the motions, and influences of the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, to which, as to its roots, causes, and signs it is reduced, the judgement whereof is shewed by Astrological Rules. Hence Dice, Tetracedron, Exacedron, Octocedron, Dodera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedron, Icocedron being made by certain Numbers, Signs, and Stars at opportune times, under the influencies of the Celestials, and being inscribed, obtain a worderful vertue of Divining, and foretelling by their castings, such as those Dice <hi>Preneste</hi> had, in which we read the Destinies of the <hi>Romans</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>

               <p>WHatsoever Divinations and Predictions of humane events are made by Lottery, must of necessity, besides the lot, have some sublime occult cause; which indeed shall not be a cause by accident, such as <hi>Aristotle</hi> describes Fortune to be. For in the series of Causes, seeing according to the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> a cause by accident can never be the prime and sufficient cause, we must look higher, and finde out a cause which may know and intend the effect. Now this we must not place in corporeal Nature, but in immaterial, and incorporeal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which indeed administer the Lot, and dispence the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the truth, as in mens souls, or separated spirits, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irect such kinde of lots, it is hence manifest, because there is
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:52070:179"/>
in our soul a divine vertue, and similitude, and apprehension, and power of all things; And as we said in the first Book, All things have a natural obedience to it, and of necessity have a motion and efficacy to that which the soul desires with a strong desire; and all the vertues and operations of natural and artifical things, obey it when it is carried forth into the excess of desire, and then all Lots of what kinde soever are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting to the appetite of such a minde, and acquire to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wonderful vertues of passages, as from that, so from the Celestial opportunity in that hour in which the excess of such a like appetite doth most of all exeeed in it. And this is that ground and foundation of all Astrological Questions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the minde being elevated into the excess of any desire, taketh of it self an hour and opportunity most convenient and efficacious, on which the Figure of the heaven being made, the Astrologer may then judge in it, and plainly know concerning that which any one desires, and is inquisitive to know. But now because Lots are not directed alwayes by mans minde, but also, as we said before, by the help of other Spirits; nor is the minde of a Prophet alwayes disposed to that excess of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as we spoke of: hence amongst the Ancients, it was a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome to premise before the casting of the Lot, some sacred performances, in which they called upon divine Intelligencies and spirits for to direct the Lot aright. Whatsoever kinde of presage therefore these kinde of Lots portend, must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity not be by chance or fortune, but from a spiritual cause, by vertue whereof the Phantasie, or hand of him that cast the Lot is moved, whether that power proceed from the soul of the Operator through the great excess of his affection, or from a Celestial influence, and opportunity, or from a certain Diety or spirit assisting, or moving from on high, whether these Lots are placed in casting of Cockalls, or throwing of Dice, or in the meeting of Verses, such as were formerly the Lot of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> of which we read in <hi>Aetlius</hi> of <hi>Sparta, Hadrianus</hi> long since made enquiry, and which we read befell <hi>Trajanus</hi> the Emperour.

               <p>IT is necessary that the heaven and Celestial bodies, seeing they have a power, influence, and manifest operation upon these inferiors, should be animated: seeing an operation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed from a meer body. All famous Poets, and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers affirm therefore that the world and all Celestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies must have a soul, and that also intelligent: Hence <hi>Marcus Mavillius</hi> in his Astronomy to <hi>Augustus,</hi> sings,

                     <l>A divine soul doth rule, a Diety</l>

                     <l>The Moons bright Globe, and Stars Titanian</l>
                     <l>A spirit fed within, spread through the whole</l>

For what do these verses seem to mean, then that the world should not only have a spirit soul, but also to partake of the divine mind: and that the originall, vertue, and vigour of all inferiour things do depend on the soul of the world? This do all <hi>Platonists, Pythagorians, Orpheus, Trismegistus, Aristotle,</hi>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:52070:180"/>
                  <hi>Theophrastus, Avicen, Algazeles,</hi> and all Peripateticks confess, and confirm.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LVI. <hi>The same is confirmed by reason.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe world, the heavens, the Stars, and the Elements have a soul, with which they cause a soul in these inferior and mixed bodies. They have also as we said in the former book, a spirit, which by the mediating of the soul is united to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: For as the world is a certain whole body, the parts whereof are the bodies of all living creatures, and by how much the whole is more perfect and noble then the parts, by so much more perfect, and noble is the body of the world then the bodies of each living thing. It would be absurd, that all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect bodies and parts of the world, and every base Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, as Flies, and Worms should be worthy of a life, and have a life and soul, and the whole entire world a most perfect, whole, and most noble body, should have neither life, nor soul; It is no less absurd, that Heavens, Stars, Elements, which give to all things life, and soul most largely, should themselves be without life, and soul; and that every plant, or tree should be of a more noble condition then the Heaven, Stars, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are naturally the cause of them; And what living man can deny that earth, and water live, which of themselves, generate, vivifie, nourish, and increase innumerable trees, plants, and living creatures? as most manifestly appears in things that breed of their own accord, and in those which have no corporeall seed. Neither could Elements generate and nourish such kind of living creatures, if they themselves were without life or soul. But some haply may say, that such kind of living creatures are not generated by the soul of the earth, or water, but by the influencies of Celestiall souls; These the <hi>Platonists</hi> answer, that an Accident cannot beget a substance, unless haply as an instrument it be subjected to the next sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, because an instrument removed from an artificer is not
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:52070:181"/>
moved to the effect of the art; so also those Celestiall influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, seeing they are certain accidents being removed far from vital substances, or from the life it self, cannot generate a vital substance in these inferiors. And <hi>Mercurius</hi> in his book which he cals <hi>De Communi,</hi> saith, All that is in the world is moved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by increase, or decrease. Now what moves, must needs have life; and seeing that all things move, even the earth, especially with a generative and alterative motion, they must themselves live. And if any doubt that the heavens live, saith <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> he is not to be accounted a Philosopher; and he which denyes the heaven to be animated, so that the mover thereof is not the form thereof, destroyes the foundation of all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy; The world therefore lives, hath a soul, and sense; for it gives life to plants, which are not produced of seed; and it gives sense to Animals, which are not generated by coition.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LVII. <hi>That the soul of the world, and the Celestiall souls are rationall, and partake of Divine understanding.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THat the above named souls have reason, is apparent hence; For whereas the universall works of the foresaid souls do with a certain perpetuall order conspire amongst themselves, it is necessary that they be governed not by chance but by reason; by which reason they do direct, &amp; bring all their operations to a certainty. For it is necessary that the earth should have the reason of terrene things, and water of watery things; and so in the rest; by which reason each in their time, place, and order are generated, and being hurt are repaired. Therefore Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers do not think the soul of the earth to be as it were the soul of some contemptible body, but to be rationall and also intelligent, yea and to be a diety. Besides it would be absurd, seeing we have reasons of our works, that Celestiall souls, and the soul of the universe should not have reasons of theirs. But if (as saith <hi>Plato)</hi> the world be made by very
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:52070:181"/>
goodness it self, as well as it could be made, it is certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with not only life, sense, and reason, but also under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. For the perfection of a body is its soul, and that body is more perfect which hath a more perfect soul; It is necessary therefore, seeing Celestiall bodies are most perfect, that they have also most perfect minds. They partake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of an intellect and a minde; which the <hi>Platonists</hi> also prove by the perseverance of their order, and tenor, because motion is of its nature free, it may easily swarve, and wander now one way, now another, unless it were ruled by an intellect and a mind, and that also by a perfect mind foreseeing from the beginning the best way, and chief end. Which perfect mind indeed, because it is most powerfull in the soul, as is the soul, and as are the souls of Celestiall bodies, and of Elements, without all doubt doth most orderly, and perfectly govern the work allotted to it. For bodies do not resist a most powerfull soul, and a perfect mind doth not change its counsel. The soul of the world therefore is a certain only thing, filling all things, bestowing all things, binding, and knitting together all things, that it might make one frame of the world, and that it might be as it were one instrument making of many strings, out one sound, sounding from three kinds of creatures, intellect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall, Celestiall, and incorruptible, with one only breath and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe names of Celestiall souls are very many, and diverse according to their manifold power and vertue upon these inferior things, from whence they have received divers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:52070:182"/>
double vertue; the one placed in knowing, the other in vivifying, and governing its body. Upon this account in the Celestiall spheres, <hi>Orpheus</hi> cals the former vertue <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the other a Muse. Hence he is not inebriated by any <hi>Bacchus,</hi> who hath not first been coupled to his Muse. Therefore nine <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus's</hi> are designed about the nine Muses. Hence in the ninth sphere <hi>Orpheus</hi> puts <hi>Bacchus Cribonius,</hi> and the Muse <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ope;</hi> in the starry heaven <hi>Picionius,</hi> and <hi>Urania;</hi> in the sphere of <hi>Saturn, Amphietus,</hi> and <hi>Polyphymnia;</hi> in the sphere of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Sabasius,</hi> and <hi>Terpsichore;</hi> in the sphere of <hi>Mars, Bassarius,</hi> and <hi>Clio;</hi> in the sphere of the <hi>Sun, Trietericus,</hi> and <hi>Melpemene;</hi> in the sphere of <hi>Venus, Lysius,</hi> and <hi>Erato;</hi> in the sphere of <hi>Mercury, Silenus,</hi> and <hi>Euterpe;</hi> in the sphere of the <hi>Moon, Bacchus, Lyeus,</hi> and the Muse <hi>Thalia.</hi> Also in the spheres of the Elements, he names the souls after this manner. In the fire he puts the planet, and the morning; in the air lightening <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Juno;</hi> in water the Ocean, and <hi>Thetys;</hi> in the earth <hi>Pluto,</hi> and <hi>Proserpina;</hi> but the soul of the world or universe Magicians call the <hi>Jupiter</hi> of the world, and the mind of the world <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the nature of the world, <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</hi> Besides in the fire they put <hi>Vulcan,</hi> in the water <hi>Neptune,</hi> and they did name them by divers names.

And most ancient <hi>Orpheus</hi> writing to <hi>Muscus,</hi> reckons up more Dieties of the heavens then these, signifying their names, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, and duties, calling them all in proper songs. Let no one therefore think that they are the names of evill deceiving spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; but of naturall, and divine vertues, distrubted to the world by the true God, for the service, and profit of man, who knew how to use them: and antiquity it self hath ascribed to each of these Dieties the severall members of man; as the ear to memory, which <hi>Virgil</hi> also dedicates to <hi>Phebus,</hi> saying, <hi>Cynthius</hi> puls my ear, and admonisheth me. So the right hand being a token of fortitude, &amp; by which an oath is made, <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> as saith <hi>Livy,</hi> hath dedicated to faith: The fingers are under the tuition of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and the knees given to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifullness; Hence they that beg pardon bend them. Some dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Navell to <hi>Venus</hi> as the place of luxury; some who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all the members to it as the center, say it is dedicated to <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Hence in the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Hammon</hi> the effigies of a navel is celebrated. Many other things the ancients did observe, ascribing every little member and joynt to their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, which if they be rightly understood, and the true Dieties ruling over them known, would not at all swerve from their duty, seeing also sacred writ testifies that all our members are governed by the superior vertues, of which we shall speak more largely in the following book; and not members only, but every exercise of men is distributed to its Dietie, as hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to <hi>Diana,</hi> wars to <hi>Pallas,</hi> husbandry to <hi>Ceres,</hi> of which thus speaks <hi>Apollo</hi> in his Oracles in <hi>Porphyrie.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. LX. <hi>That humane imprecations do naturally impress their powers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on externall things; And how mans mind through each degree of dependencies ascends into the intelligible world, and becomes like to the more sublime spirits, and Intelligencies.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Celestiall souls send forth their vertues to the Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bodies, which then transmit them to this sensible world. For the vertues of the terrene orb proceed from no other cause then Celestiall. Hence the Magician that will worke by them, useth a cunning invocation of the superiors, with mysterious words, and a certain kind of ingenious speech, drawing the one to the other, yet by a naturall force through a certain mutuall agreement betwixt them, whereby things follow of their own accord, or sometimes are drawn unwillingly. Hence saith <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the sixth book of his Mysticall Philosophy, that when any one by binding or bewitching doth call upon the Sun or other stars, praying them to be helpfull to the work de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, the Sun and other Stars do not heare his words, but are moved after a certain manner by a certain conjunction, and mutuall series, whereby the parts of the world are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually subordinate the one to the other, and have a mutuall consent, by reason of their great union: As in mans body one member is moved by perceiving the motion of another, and in a harp one string is moved at the motion of another. So when any one moves any part of the world; other parts are moved by the perceiving the motion of that. The knowledge therefore of the dependency of things following one the other, is the foundation of all wonderfull operation, which is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required to the exercising the power of attracting superior vertues. Now the words of men are certain naturall things;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:52070:185"/>
and because the parts of the world mutually draw one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore a Magician invocating by words, works by powers fitted to nature, by leading some by the love of one to the other, or drawing others by reason of the following of one after the other, or by repelling by reason of the enmity of one to the other, from the contrariety and difference of things, and multitude of vertues; which although they are contrary, and different, yet perfect one part; sometimes also he compels things by way of authority, by the Celestiall vertue, because he is not a stranger to the heaven. A man therefore, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the impression of any ligation, or fascination, doth no: receive it according to the rationall soul, but sensuall, and if he suffers in any part, suffers according to the Animall part. For they cannot draw a knowing and intelligent man by reason, but by receiving that impression and force by sense, in as much as the Animal spirit of man is by the influence of the Celestials, and cooperation of the things of the world, affected beyond his former and naturall disposition. As the son moves the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to labor, although unwilling, for to keep and maintain him, although he be wearied; and the desire to rule is moved to anger and other labors, for to get the dominion. And the indigency of nature, and fear of poverty, moves a man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire riches. And the ornaments, and beauty of women is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to concupiscence. And the harmony of a wise Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian moves his hearers with various passions, whereof some do voluntary follow the consonancy of art, others conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by gesture, although unwillingly, because their sense is captivated their reason not being intent to these things. But these kinds of fascinations &amp; ligations the vulgar doth neither admire, nor detest, by reason of their usualness: but they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire other naturall things, because they are ignorant of them, and are not accustomed to them. Hence they fall into errors, thinking those things to be above nature, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature, which indeed are by nature, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature. We must know therefore that every supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior moves its next inferior, in its degree, and order, not only in bodies, but also in spirits. So the universall soul moves the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:52070:185"/>
aprticular soul; and the rational acts upon the sensual, and that upon the vegetable; and every part of the world acts upon another, and every part is apt to be moved by another; and every part of this inferior world suffers from the heavens according to their nature, and aptitude, as one part of the Animall body suffers from another. And the superior intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall world moves all things below it self, and after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner contains all the same beings from the first to the last, which are in the inferior world. Celestiall bodyes therefore move the body of the elementary world, compounded, generable, sensible, from the circumference to the center, by superior, perpetual, and spirituall essences, depending on the primary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, which is the acting intellect; but upon the vertue put in by the word of God, which word the wise Chaldeans of <hi>Babylon</hi> call the cause of causes, because from it are produced all beings, the acting intellect which is the second from it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; and that by reason of the union of this word with the first author, from whom all things being are truely produced; The word therefore is the image of God, the acting intellect the image of the word, the soul is the image of this intellect; and our word is the image of the soul, by which it acts upon naturall things naturally, because nature is the work thereof. And every one of those perfects his subsequent, as a father his son, and none of the latter exists without the former. For they are depending amongst themselves, by a kind of ordinate dependency, so that when the latter is corrupted, it is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into that which was next before it, untill it come to the heavens, then unto the universall soul, and lastly unto the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intellect, by which all other creatures exist, and which it self exists in the principall author, which is the creating word of God, to which at length all things are returned. Our soul there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if it will work any wonderfull thing in these inferiors, must have respect to their beginning, that it may be strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and illustrated by that, and receive power of acting through each degree from the very first author. Therefore we must be more diligent in contemplating the souls of the Stars then their bodies, and the supercelestiall, and intellectuall
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:52070:186"/>
world, then the Celestial corporeall, because that is more noble, although also this be excellent, and the way to that; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which <hi>medium</hi> the influence of the superiour cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to. As for example, the Sun is the King of Stars, most full of light, but receives it from the intelligible world above all other Stars, because the soul thereof is more capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible splendor. Wherefore he that desires to attract the influence of the Sun, must contemplate upon the Sun, not only by the speculation of the exterior light, but also of the interior. And this no man can do unless he return to the soul of the Sun, and become like to it, and comprehend the intelligible light thereof with an intellectuall sight, as the sensible light with a corporeal eye. For this man shalbe filled with the light thereof; and the light thereof which is an under type impressed by the supernal Orb it receives into it self, with the illustration whereof his intellect being endowed &amp; truely like to it, &amp; being assisted by it shall at length attain to that supreme brightness, and to all forms that partake thereof. And when he hath received the light of the supreme degree, then his soul shall come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and be made like to the spirits of the Sun, and shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the vertues, and illustrations of the supernaturall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and shall enjoy the power of them, if he hath obtained faith in the first author. In the first place therefore we must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore assistance from the first author, and praying not only with mouth but a Religious gesture and supplicant soul, also abundantly, uncessantly, and sincerely, that he would enlighten our mind, and remove darkness growing upon our souls by reason of our bodies.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a very excellent opinion of the Ancient Magicians (most Illustrious Prince) That we ought to labour in nothing more in this life, then that we degenerate not from Excellency of the mind, by which we come neerest to God and put on the Divine nature: least at any time our mind wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dull by vain idleness, should decline to the frailty of our earthly body and vices of the flesh: so we should loose it, as it were cast down by the dark precipices of perverse lusts. Wherefore we ought so to order our mind, that it by it self being mindfull of its own dignity and excellency, should alwayes both Think, do and operate something worthy of it self; But the knowledge of the Divine science, doth only and very powerfully perform this for us. When we by the remembrance of its majesty being alwaies busied in Divine studies do every moment contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate Divine things, by a sage and diligent inquisition, and by all the degrees of the creatures ascending even to the Archetype him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, do draw from him the infallible vertue of all things, which those that neglect, trusting only to naturall and wordly things, are wont often to be confounded by divers errors &amp; fallacies, and very
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:52070:187"/>
oft to be deceived by evill spirits; But the understanding of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, purgeth the mind from errors, and rendreth it Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, giveth infallible power to our works, and driveth far the deceits and obstacles of all evil spirits, and together subjects them to our commands; Yea it compels even good Angels and all the powers of the world unto our service <hi>viz.</hi> the virtue of our works being drawn from the Archetype himself, To whom when we ascend, all creatures necessarily obey us, and all the quire of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven do follow us: For (as <hi>Homer</hi> saith) none of the gods durst remain in their seats, <hi>Jove</hi> being moved; and then presently he ruleth (as saith <hi>Aristophanes)</hi> by one of the gods, whose right it is to execute his commands, who then out of his duty doth manage our petitions according to our desire. Seeing therefore (most Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Prince) you have a Divine and immortall soul given you, which seeing the goodness of the Divine providence, a well disposed fate, and the bounty of nature have in such manner gifted, that by the acuteness of your understanding, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of senses you are able to view, search, contemplate, discern and pierce thorow the pleasant theaters of naturall things, the sublime house of the heavens, and the most difficult passages of Divine things: I being bound to you by the band of these your great vertues am so far a debtor as to communicate without envy by the true account of all opinions, Those mysteries of Divine and Ceremoniall Magick which I have truly learned, and not to hide the knowledge of those things, whatsoever concerning these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the <hi>Isiaci</hi> those old Priests of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Caldeans,</hi> the ancient prophets of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the <hi>Cabalists,</hi> the Divine Magicians of the Hebrews, also the <hi>Orpheans, Pythagoreans</hi> and <hi>Platonists,</hi> the profoundest Philosophers of <hi>Greece,</hi> further what the <hi>Bragmanni</hi> of the Indians, the <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and the uncorrupted <hi>Theologians</hi> of our Religion have delivered, and by what force of words, power of Seals by what charms of Benedictions and imprecations, and by what vertue of observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they in old time wrought so stupendious and wonderfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, intimating to you in this third book of <hi>Occult Philosophy</hi> and exposing to the light those things which have been buryed in the dust of antiquity and involved in the obscurity of oblivion, as
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:52070:187"/>
in <hi>Cymmerian</hi> darkness even to this day. We present therefore now to you, a compleat and perfect work in these three books of <hi>Occult Philosophy</hi> or <hi>Magick,</hi> Which we have prefected with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent care, and very great labor and pains both of mind and body; and though it be untrimmed inrespect of words, yet its most elaborate truly in respect of the matter: Wherefore I desire this one favor, that you would not expect the grace of an Oration, or the elegancy of speech in these books, which we long since wrote in our youth when our speech was as yet rough, and our language rude; and now we have respect, not to the stile of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but only to the series or order of sentences; We have studyed the less elegancy of speech, abundance of matter succeeding in the place thereof; and we suppose we have sufficiently satisfied our duty, if we shall to the utmost of our power perform those things we have promised to declare concerning the secrets of Magick, and have freed our conscience from a due debt. But seeing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, many scoffing Sophisters will conspire against me, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of those who boast themselves to be allyed to God, and fully replenished with Divinity, and presum to censure the leaves of the Sibilles, and will undertake to judge and condemn to the fire these our works even before they have read or rightly understood any thing of them (because such lettice agrees not with their lips, and such sweet oyntment with their nose and also by reason of that sparke of hatred long since conceived against me, and scarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it self under the ashes.) Therefore (most Illustrious Prince and wise Prelate) we further submit this work ascribed by me to the merits of you vertue, and now made yours, to your censure, and commend it to your protection, That, if the base and perfidious Sophisters would defame it, by the grosse madness of their envy and malice, you would by the prespicacy of your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and candor of judgement, happily protect and defend it.</p>

then a man to be truly sound when body and soul are so cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and agree together, that the firmness of the mind and spirit be not inferior to the powers of the body; But a firm and stout mind (saith <hi>Hermes)</hi> can we not otherwise obtain, than by integrity of life, by piety, and last of all, by Divine Religion: for holy Religion purgeth the mind, and maketh it Divine, it helpeth nature, and strengtheneth naturall powers, as a Physitian helpeth the health of the body, and a Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the strength of the earth. Whosoever therefore (Religion being laid aside,) do confide only in naturall things, are wont very oft to be deceived by evill spirits; but from the knowledge of Religion, the contempt and cure of vices ariseth, and a safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard against evil spirits; To conclude, nothing is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and acceptable to God, than a man perfectly pious, and truly Religious, who so far excelleth other men, as he himself is distant from the Immortall gods; Therefore we ought, being first purged, to offer and commend our selves to divine piety and Religion; and then our senses being asleep, with a quiet mind to expect that Divine <hi>Ambrosian Nectar (Nectar</hi> I say, which <hi>Zachary</hi> the prophet calleth Wine making maids merry) praising and adoring that supercelestiall <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the chiefest ruler of the gods and priests, the author of regeneration, whom the old poets sang was twice born, from whom rivers most Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine flow into our hearts.</p>

Hence also in celebrating the holy mysteries of <hi>Ceres Eleusine,</hi> they only were admitted to be initiated, the cryer proclaiming the prophane vulgar to depart; and in <hi>Esdras</hi> we read this precept concerning the Cabalisticall secret of the Hebrews, declared in these verses, Thou shalt deliver those books to the wise men of the people, whose hearts thou knowest can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, and keep those secrets. Therefore the Religious volumes of the Egyptians &amp; those belonging to the secrets of their ceremonies, were made of consecrated paper; in these they did write down leters which might not easily be known which they call holy. <hi>Macrobius Marcellinus</hi> and others say, they were called Hieroglyphicks, least perchance the writings of this kind should be known to the prophane, which also <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius</hi> testifies in these words, saying, The sacrifice being ended,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:52070:190"/>
from a secret retyred closet he bringeth forth certain books noted with obscure letters, affording compendious words of the conceived speech, partly by the figures of beasts of this kind, partly by figures full of knots, and crooked in manner of a wheele &amp; set thick, twining about like vine tendrels, the reading thereby being defended from the curiosity of the prophane; Therefore we shall be worthy scholars of this science, if we be silent, and hide those things which are secret in religion, for the promise of silence (as saith <hi>Tertullian)</hi> is due to Religion; but they which do otherwise, are in very great danger, whence <hi>Apuleius</hi> saith concerning secrets of holy Writs; I would tell it you, if it were lawfull to tell it; you should know it, if it were lawfull to hear it; but both ears and tongue would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the same guilt of rash curiosity. So we read <hi>Theodorus</hi> the tragick poet, when he would have referred somethings of the mysteries of the Jews Scripture to a certain fable, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of sight. <hi>Theopompus</hi> also who began to translate somethings out of the Divine law into the Greek tongue, was presently troubled in mind and spirit, whence afterward ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desiring God, wherefore this had happened to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an answer in a dream, because he had basely polluted Divine things, by setting them forth in publike. One <hi>Numenius</hi> also being very curious of hidden things, incurred the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Divine powers, because he interpreted the holy mysteries of the goddesse <hi>Eleusina</hi> and published them for he dreamed that the goddesses of <hi>Eleusis</hi> stood in a whores habit before the Brothell house, which when he wondred at, they wrathfully answered, that they were by him violently drawn from their modesty and prostituted everywhere to all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, by which he was admonished, that the Ceremonies of the gods ought not to be divulged. Therefore it hath alwaies been the great care of the Ancients to wrap up the mysteries of God and nature, and hide them with diverse Aenigmaes, which law the <hi>Indians, Brachmans, Aethiopians, Persians,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> also observed; hence <hi>Mercurius, Orpheus,</hi> and all the ancient Poets and Philosophers, <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato Aristoxenus, Ammonius,</hi> kept them inviolably. Hence <hi>Plotinus</hi>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:52070:190"/>
and <hi>Origenes</hi> and the other disciples of <hi>Ammonius</hi> (as <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry</hi> relates in his book of the education and Discipline of <hi>Flotinus)</hi> sware never to set forth the Decrees of their master. And because <hi>Plotinus,</hi> brake his oath made to <hi>Ammonius,</hi> and published his mysteries, for the punishment of his transgression, he was consumed (as they say) by the Horrible disease of Lice. Christ also himself, while he lived on earth, spoke after that manner and fashion that only the more intimate disciples should understand the mystery of the word of God, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should perceive the parables only: commanding more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that holy things should not be given to Dogs, nor pearles cast to Swine: Therefore the Prophet saith, I have hid thy words in my heart, that I might not sin against thee. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not fit that those secrets which are amongst a few wise men, and communicated by mouth only, should be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likly written. Wherefore you will pardon me, If I pass over in silence many and the chiefest secret mysteries of Ceremonial Magick. I suppose I shal do enough, if I open those things which are necessary to be known, and you by the reading of this book go not away altogether empty of these mysteries; but on that condition let these things be communicated to you, on which <hi>Dionysius</hi> bound <hi>Timothy,</hi> that they which perceive these Secrets, would not expose them to the unworthy, but gather them together amongst wise men, and keep them with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence that is due to them. Furthermore I would also warne you in this beginning, that even as the divine powers detest publike things and profane, and love secrecy: So every Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical experiment fleeth the publike, seeks to be hid, is strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by silence, but is destroyed by publication, neither doth any compleate effect follow after; all these things suffer losse, when they are poured into prating and incredulous minds; therefore it behoveth a Magicall operator, if he would get fruit from this art, to be secret, and to manifest to none, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his work nor place, nor time, neither his desire nor will, unless either to a master, or partner, or companion, who also ought to be faithfull, believing, silent, and dignified by nature and education: Seeing that even the prating of a companion,

               </head>
               <p>ABout the beginning of the first book of this work, we have spoken what manner of person a Magician ought to be; but now we will declare a mysticall and secret matter, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for every one who desireth to practize this art, which is both the beginning, perfection and key of all Magicall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and it is the dignifying of men to this so sublime vertue and power; for this faculty requireth in man a wonderfull dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, for that the understanding which is in us the highest faculty of the soul, is the only worker of wonders, which when it is overwhelmed by too much commerce with the flesh, and busied about the sensible soul of the body, is not worthy of the command of Divine substances; therefore many prosecute this art in vain; Therefore it is meet that we who endeavor to attain to so great a height should especially meditate of two things; first how we should leave carnall affections, fraile sense, and materiall passions. Secondly, by what way and means we may ascend to an intellect pure &amp; conjoyned with the powers of the gods, without which we shall never happily ascend to the scrutiny of secret things, and to the power of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workings, or miracles; for in these dignification consists wholly, which, nature, desert, and a certain religious art do make up; naturall dignity is the best disposition of the body and its Organs, not obscuring the soul with any grosseness, and being without al distemper, and this proceedeth from the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, motion, light, and influence of the Celestiall bodies and spirits which are conversant in the generation of every one, as are those whose ninth house is fortunate by <hi>Saturn, Sol,</hi> and <hi>Mercury; Mars</hi> also in the ninth house commandeth the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:52070:191"/>
spirits; but concerning these things we have largely treated in the books of the Stars: But who so is not such a one, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that he recompense the defect of nature by education, and the best ordering and prosperous use of naturall things untill he become compleat in all intrinsecall and extrinsecall perfections. Hence so great care is taken in the law of <hi>Moses</hi> concerning the priest, that he be not polluted by a dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case, or by a woman a widow, or menstruous, that he be free from leprosie, flux of blood, burstness, and be perfect in all his members, not blind, nor lame, nor crook-backed, or with an illfavored nose. And <hi>Apuleius</hi> saith in his Apology, that the youth to be initiated to divination by magick spels, ought to be chosen, sound without sickness, ingenious, comely, perfect in his members, of a quick spirit, eloquent in speech, that in him the divine power might be conversant as in the good houses; That the mind of the youth having quickly attained experience, may be restored to its divinity. But the meritorious dignity is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by two things; namely learning and practice. The end of learning is to know the truth; it is meet therefore, as is spoken in the beginning of the first book, that he be learned and skilful in those three faculties; then all impediments being removed, wholly to apply his soul to contemplation &amp; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it self into it self; for there is even in our own selves the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension and power of all things; but we are prohibited, so as that we little enjoy these things, by passions opposing us even from our birth, and vain imaginations and immoderate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which being expelled, the divine knowledge and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er presently takes place; but the Religious operation obtains no less efficacy which ofttimes of it self alone is sufficiently powerfull for us to obtain this deifying vertue, so great is the vertue of holy duties rightly exhibited and performed, that though they be not understood, yet piously and perfectly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and with a firm faith believed, they have no less effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy then to adorn us with a divine power; But what dignity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s acquired by the art of Religion, is perfected by certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Ceremonies, expiations, consecrations, and holy rites,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:52070:192"/>
proceeding from him whose spirit the publike Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath consecrated, who hath power of imposition of hands, and of initiating with Sacramentall power, by which the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the divine vertue and power is stampt on us which they call the divine consent, by which a man supported with the divine nature, and made as it were a companion of the Angels beareth the ingrafted power of God; &amp; this rite is referred to the Ecclesiastical mysteries: If therefore now thou shalt be a man perfect in the sacred understanding of Religion, and piously and most constantly meditatest on it, and without doubting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest, and art such an one on whom the authority of holy rites and nature hath conferred dignity above others, and one, whom the divine powers contemn not, thou shalt be able by praying, consecrating, sacrificeing, invocating, to attract spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Celestial powers, and to imprint them on those things thou pleasest, and by it to vivifie every magicall work; But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever beyond the authority of his office, without the merit of Sanctity and Learning, beyond the dignity of nature and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, shall presume to work any thing in Magick, shall work in vain, and deceive both himself and those that believe on him, and with danger incur the displeasure of the Divine powers.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THere are two things, which rule every operation of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Magick, namely Religion and Superstition. This Religion is a continuall contemplation of Divine things, and by good works an uniting ones self with God and the Divine powers, by which in a reverent family, a service, and a sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of worship worthy of them is performed, and also the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Divine worship are rightly exercised; Religion therefore is a certain discipline of externall holy things and
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:52070:192"/>
Ceremonies by the which as it were by certain signs we are admonished of internall and spirituall things, which is so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implanted in us by nature, that we more differ from other creatures by this then Rationality; whosoever therefore neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects Religion (as we have spoken before) and confides only in the strength of naturall things, are very often deceived by the evil spirits; therefore they who are more religiously and holily instructed, neither set a tree nor plant their vineyard, nor undertake any mean work without divine invocation, as the Doctor of the Nations commands the <hi>Colossians,</hi> saying, whatsoever you shall do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks to him, and to God the Father by him. Therefore to superadde the powers of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Physical and Mathematicall vertues is so far from a fault, that not to joyn them, is an hainous sin. Hence in <hi>libro senato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> saith <hi>Rabbi Hemina,</hi> he that enjoyeth any of the creatures without Divine benediction, is supposed both by God and the Church to have used it as taken by theft and robbery, of whom it is written by <hi>Salomon,</hi> he that takes away any things violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from father and mother, is a destroyer; But God is our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Church our mother, as it is written, Is not he thy father who possesseth thee? and elsewhere, Hear my son the discipline of thy father, and despise not the law of thy mother; nothing more displeaseth God, then to be neglected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned; nothing pleaseth him more, then to be renowned and adored. Hence he hath permitted no creature of the world to be without Religion. All do worship God, pray (as <hi>Proclus</hi> saith) frame hymnes to the leaders of their order; but some things truly after a naturall, others after a sensible, others a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, others an intellectuall manner, and all things in their manner, according to the song of the three children, bless the Lord: But the rites and Ceremonies of Religion, in respect of the diversity of times and places, are diverse. Every Religion hath something of good, because it is directed to God his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; and although God allows the Christian Religion only, yet other worships which are undertaken for his sake, he doth not altogether reject, and leaveth them not unrewarded, if
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:52070:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not with an eternal, yet with a temporal reward, or at least doth punish them less; but he hateth, thundereth against and utterly destroys prophane persons and altogether irreligious as his enemies, for their impiety is greater then the others who follow a false and erroneous Religion: For there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (saith <hi>Lactantius)</hi> so erroneous, which hath not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of wisdom in it, by which they may obtain pardon, who have kept the chiefest duty of man, if not indeed, yet in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But no man can of himself attain to the true Religion, unless he be taught it of God. All worship therefore, which is different from the true Religion, is superstition; In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner also that which giveth Divine worship, either to whom it ought not, or in that manner which it ought not. Therefore we must especially take heed least at any time, by some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse worship of superstition, we be envious to the Almighty God, and to the holy powers under him; for this would be not only wicked, but an act most unworthy of Philosophers; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition therefore although it be far different from the true Religion, yet it is not all and wholly rejected, because in many things it is even tolerated, and observed by the chief rulers of Religion; But I call that superstition especially, which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain resemblance of Religion, which for as much as it imitates whatsoever is in Religion, as miracles, Sacraments, rites, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations and such like, from whence it gets no small power, and also obtains no less strength by the credulity of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator; for how much a constant credulity can do, we have spoken in the first book, and is manifestly known to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Therefore superstition requireth credulity, as Religion faith, seeing constant credulity can do so great things, as even to work miracles in opinions and false operations; whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore in his Religion, though false, yet beleeveth most strongly that it is true, and elevates his spirit by reason of this his credulity, untill it be assimilated to those spirits who are the chief leaders of that Religion, may work those things which nature and reason discern not; but incredulity and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence doth weaken every work not only in superstition, but also in true Religion, and enervates the desired effect even of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:52070:193"/>
the most strong experiments. But how superstition imitateth Religion, these examples declare; namely when worms and locusts are excommunicated, that they hurt not the fruits; when bels and Images are baptised and such like; but because the old Magicians and those who were the authors of this art amongst the ancients, have been <hi>Caldeans, Egyptians, Assyrians, Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> all whose Religion was perverse and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted idolatry, we must very much take heed, least we should permit their errors to war against the grounds of the Catholick Religion; for this were blasphemous, and subject to the curse; and I also should be a blasphemer, if I should not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish you of these things, in this science; wheresoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you shall finde these things written by us, know that those things are only related out of other Authors, and not put down by us for truth, but for a probable conjecture which is allyed to truth and an Instruction for imitation in those things which are true; Therefore we ought from their Errors to collect the Truth, which work truly requireth a profound Vnderstanding, perfect Piety, and painfull and laborious Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and also Wisdom which knoweth out of every Evill to extract Good, and to fit oblique things unto the right use of those things which it governeth, as concerning this <hi>Augustine</hi> gives us an Example of a Carpenter to whom Oblique and Complicate things are no less necessary and convenient then the Straight.</p>

               </head>
               <p>There are three Guides which bring us even to the paths of truth and which rule all our Religion, in which it wholly consisteth, namely Love, Hope and Fayth: for Love is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of the Soul, the most excellent of all things, descending from the Intelligences above even to the most inferior things.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:52070:194"/>
It congregates and converts our mind into the Divine beauty, preserves us also in all our works, gives us Events according to our wishes, administreth power to our supplications: as we read in <hi>Homer, Apollo</hi> heard <hi>Chrysons</hi> prayers because he was his very great friend: and some read of <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> in the Gospell, many sins were forgiven her, because she loved much; But hope immoveably hanging on those things it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth, when it is certain and not wavering, nourisheth the mind and perfecteth it; But Faith the superior vertue of all not grounded on humane fictions, but Divine revelations wholly, peirceth all things through the whole world, for seeing it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends from above from the first light, and remains neerest to it, is far more noble and excellent than the arts, sciences and beliefes arising from inferior things: this being darted into our intellect by reflexion from the first light. To conclude, by saith man is made somewhat the same with the superior pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and enjoyeth the same power with them: Hence <hi>Proclus</hi> saith, As belief which is a credulity, is below science: so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief which is a true faith, is supersubstantially above all science and understanding conjoyning us immediately to God; for Faith is the root of all miracles, by which alone (as the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists</hi> testifie) we approach to God, and obtain the Divine power and protection. So we read that <hi>Daniel</hi> escaped the mouths of the Lyons, because he believed on his God. So to the woman with the bloody issue saith Christ, thy Faith hath made thee whole; and of the blind man desiring sight, he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red faith, saying, Do ye believe, that I can open your eyes? so <hi>Pallas</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi> comforteth <hi>Achilles</hi> with these words, I am come to pacifie your wrath, if you will believe. Therefore <hi>Linus</hi> the Poet sings all things are to be beleeved, because all things are easie to God; nothing is impossible to him, therefore nothing incredible; therefore we believing those things which belong to Religion, do obtain the vertue of them; but when we shall faile in our Faith, we shall do nothing worthy admiration, but of punishment; As we have an example o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THerefore Our mind being pure and divine, inflamed with a religious love, adorned with hope, directed by faith, placed in the hight and top of the humane soul, doth attract the truth, and sudainly comprehend it &amp; beholdeth all the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, grounds, causes and sciences of things both natural and immortal in the divine truth it self as it were in a certain glass of Eternity. Hence it comes to pass that we, though Natural, know those things which are above nature, and understand all things below, and as it were by divine Oracles receive the knowledg not only of those things which are, but also of those that are past and to come, presently, and many years hence; Moreover not only in Sciences, Arts and Oracles the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing challengeth to it self this divine vertue, but also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth this miraculous power in certain things by command to be changed: Hence it comes to pass that though we are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a natural body, yet we sometimes praedominate over na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and cause such wonderfull, sodain and difficult operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as that the evil spirits obey us, the stars are disordered, the heavenly powers compelled, the Elements made obedient; so levout men and those elevated by these Theologicall vertues, command the Elements, drive away Fogs, raise the winds, cause rain, cure diseases, raise the dead, all which things to have been done amongst diverse Nations, Poets and Historians do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and relate: and that these things may be done, all the

famousest Philosophers, and Theologians do confirme; so the prophets, Apostles, and the rest, were famous by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power of God; therefore we must know, that as by the influx of the first agent, is produced oftentimes something without the cooperation of the middle causes, so also by the work of Religion alone, may something be done without the application of naturall and Celestiall vertues; but no man can work by pure Religion alone, unless he be made totally intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall; But whosoever, without the mixture of other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, worketh by Religion alone, if he shall persevere long in the work, is swallowed up by the Divine power and cannot live long: But whosoever shall attempt this and not be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, doth bring upon himself judgement, and is delivered to the evil spirit, to be devoured.</p>

He himself is the beginning middle and end, as the ancient Prophets have taught us, to whom God long since delivered these things in two tables; and he calleth him in the same verse the only great Creator, and immortall. <hi>Zoroastes</hi> likewise in
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:52070:196"/>
his sacred History of the Persians defineth God thus, God is the first of all those things which suffer neither decay nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, unbegot, never dying, without parts, and most like himself, The author and promoter of all good things, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all, most bountifull and wise, the sacred light of justice, the absolutest perfection of nature, the contriver, and wisedom thereof. <hi>Apuleius</hi> also describs him to be a King, the cause, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and original beginning of all nature, the supreme beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of spirits, eternal, the preserver of living creatures, a Father with propagation, not to be comprehended by time, place or any other circumstance, and therefore imaginable to a few, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable to none; from hence therefore <hi>Euripides</hi> commanded the highest God to be cal'd <hi>Jupiter,</hi> through whose head <hi>Orphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> sang all things came into this light, but the other powers he supposeth to be subservient, <hi>viz.</hi> which are without God, and separated from him, and are by the Philosophers called the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters or Angels of God, and separated intelligences; therefore they say Religious worship to be due to this most high <hi>Jupiter</hi> and to him only, but to the other Divine powers not to be due unless for his sake.</p>

                  <hi>Plotinus</hi> and <hi>Philo</hi> deliver, that the Son of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the first mind or Divine intellect floweth from God the Father, even as a word from the speaker or as light from light; from hence it is that he is called both the word and speech, and splendor of God the Father; for the Divine mind by it self, with one only and uninterrupted act understandeth the chiefest good without any vicissitude, or mediate knowledge; he generat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in himself an Issue and Son, who is the full Intelligence, compleat image of himself, and the perfect pattern of the world, whom our <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Mercurius</hi> name the word or speech; <hi>Plato</hi> the Son of God the Father; <hi>Orpheus, Pallas</hi> born from <hi>Jupiters</hi> brain, that is, wisdom: This is the most abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute image of God the Father, yet by a certain relation, or some intrinsecall absolute thing, as it were begot and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the Father, who saith in <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the mouth of the most high, I am the first begot before all creatures: <hi>Jamblichus</hi> testifieth this Son to be One and the same God with the Father in Essence, namely calling God, both the Father and Son of himself. Also <hi>Mercurius Trismegistus</hi> in <hi>Asclepius</hi> mentioneth the Son of God in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse places; for he saith my God and Father begat a Mind a work diverse from himself; And elsewhere, unity begets unity, and reflecteth his flagrant love on himself; and in <hi>Pimander</hi> (where he seemeth to prophesie of the Covenant of grace to come, and of the mystery of regeneration) saith, the author of Regeneration is the Son of God, the man by the will of the one only God, and also that God is most replenished with the fruitfulness of both sexes. In like manner the <hi>Indian</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers affirm, the World to be an Animal, partly <hi>Masculine,</hi> and partly <hi>Feminine;</hi> and <hi>Orpheus</hi> also calleth Nature or the <hi>Jove</hi> of this world, both the male and female thereof, and that the gods partake of both Sexes.

This is the Catholike faith, this is the Orthodox Religion, this is the Christian truth, that we worship one God in Trinity, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Unity, neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance The Father begat the Son from all eternity and gave him his substance, and nevertheless retained it himself. The Son also by being begot, received the substance of the Father, but assumed not the proper Person of the Father; for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther translated it not into the Son; for they are both of one and the same substance, but of diverse persons. This Son also although he be coeternall with the Father, and begot of the substance of the Father before the world, yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was born into the world out of the substance of a Virgin, and his name was called <hi>Jesus,</hi> perfect God, perfect man, of a reasonable soul and humane flesh, who in all things was man, sin excepted.

Whence <hi>Austin</hi> in his book of questions, saith, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very visible thing in this world, hath an Angelicall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er appointed for it: Hence <hi>Origen</hi> on the book of <hi>Numbers</hi> saith, the world hath need of Angels, that may rule the Armies of the earth, Kingdoms, provinces, men, beasts, the nativity, and progress of living creatures, shrubs, plants, and other things, giving them that vertue which is said to be in them, from an occult propriety; much more need is there of Angels

that may rule holy works, vertues and men, as they who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies see the face of the most high father, and can guide men in the right path, and also even the least thing to this place, as fit members of this world in which God as the chief pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, dwelleth, most sweetly disposing all things, not being contained, or circumscribed, but containing all things, as <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations</hi> describeth that heavenly City, whose twelve gates are guarded with twelve Angels, infusing on them what they receive from the Divine name, twelve times revolved; and in the foundations of that City the names of the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and the Lamb; for as in the Law, in the stones of the Ephod and foundations of the Holy City described by <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> were written the names of the tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the name of four letters did predominate over them; so in the Gospel, the names of the Apostles are written in the stones of the foundation of the heavenly City, which stones stand for the tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Church, over which the name of the Lamb hath influence, that is, the name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> in which is all the vertue of the four lettered name; seeing that <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Father hath given him all things: Therefore the Heavens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Angels, that which they dart down; but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels from the great name of God and <hi>Jesu,</hi> the vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is first in God, afterward diffused into these twelve and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Angels, by whom it is extended into the twelve signs, and into the seven planets, and consequently into all the other Ministers and instruments of God pour traiting even infinitely. Hence Christ saith, Whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you; and after his resurrection saith, In my name they shall cast out devils, and do as followeth; so that the name of four letters is no further necessary, the whole ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof being translated into the name <hi>Jesus,</hi> in which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miracles are done; neither is there any other (as <hi>Peter</hi> saith) under heaven given unto men, by which they can be saved, but that; but let us not think, that by naming <hi>Jesus</hi> prophanely, as the name of a certain man, we can do miracles by vertue of it: but we must invocate it in the holy Spirit, with a pure mind and a fervent spirit, that we may obtain those things

which are promised us in him; especially knowledge going before, without which there is no hearing of us, according to that of the Prophet, I will hear him because he hath known my name; Hence at this time no favor can be drawn from the heavens, unless the authority, favor and consent of the name <hi>Jesu</hi> intervene; Hence the Hebrews and Cabalists most skilfull in the Divine names, can work nothing after Christ by those old names, as their fathers have done long since; and now it is by experience confirmed, that no devil nor power of Hell, which vex and trouble men, can resist this name, but will they, nill they, bow the knee and obey, when the name <hi>Jesu</hi> by a due pronunciation is proposed to them to be worshipped, and they fear not only the name but also the Cross, the seal thereof; and not only the knees of earthly, heavenly, and hellish creatures are bowed, but also Insensible things do reverence it, and all tremble at his beck, when from a faithfull heart and a true mouth the name <hi>Jesus</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and pure hands imprint the salutiferous sign of the Cross: neither truly doth Christ say in vain to his Disciples, In my name they shall cast out Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unless there were a certain vertue expressed in that name over divels and sick folk, serpents, and persons, and tongues, and so forth, seeing the power which this name hath, is both from the vertue of God the institutor, and also from the vertue of him who is expressed by this name, and from a power implanetd in the very word. Hence is it that seeing every creature feareth and reverenceth the name of him who hath made it, sometimes even wicked and ungodly men, if so be they believe the invocation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine names of this kind, do bind devils, and operate certain other great things.</p>

               <p>WE read in diverse places of the holy Scripture, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse members of God, and ornaments; but by the members of God, are understood manifold powers, most sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply abiding in God himself, distinguished amongst themselves by the sacred names of God; but the garments of God and Ornaments, are as it were certain wayes and relations, or Emanations or conduit pipes, by the which he diffuseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; the hemmes of which as oft as our mind shall touch, so often the Divine power of some member goeth forth, even as <hi>Jesus</hi> cryed out, concerning the woman with the bloody Issue, Some body hath touched me, for I perceive vertue to go forth from me: These members therefore in God are like to ours; but the Idea's and exemplars of our members, to the which if we rightly conform our mmbers, then being translated into the same Image, we are made the true sons of God, &amp; like to God, doing and working the works of God: therefore concerning the members of God, many things are drawn forth out of the Scriptures; for we read of his head in the Canticles; Thy head as Carmel, and the locks of thy head as the purple of a King; but this Carmel signifieth not that mountain in the Sea coast of <hi>Syria,</hi> but a little creature, which ingendreth the purple. Also of his eyes, eyelids and ears, we read in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> the eyes of the Lord on the Just, and his ears to their prayers, his eyes look towards the poor, and his eyelids en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the sons of men: also of his mouth, tast, throat, lips, and teeth, we read in <hi>Esay,</hi> Thou hast not enquired at my mouth; and in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> Thy throat as the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak; there are also Nostrils, by the which (as we often find in the Law) he smelleth the sacrifices for a sweet odour: he hath shoulders, armes, hands, and fingers, of the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:52070:207"/>
which we read in <hi>Esay;</hi> the government is laid upon his shoulders; to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed? and the kingly Prophet singeth, thy hands O Lord have made me and fashioned me, and I will behold the heavens, the work of thy fingers; he hath also a right and left hand; hence the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, The Lord saith to my Lord, sit at my right hand: and of the left we read, in the Gospel, on which the damned shall be placed at the last day: further we read of the heart, breast, back, and back parts of God; as in the book of Kings, that God found <hi>David</hi> a man according to his own heart; we have also in the Gospel his breast upon which the Disciple sleeping conceived divine mysteries; and the <hi>Psalmist</hi> describeth his back, in the paleness of gold; and he himself saith in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> I will shew my back and not my face in the day of their perdition, and he saith to <hi>Moses,</hi> Thou shalt see my back parts; of his feet the <hi>Psalmist</hi> also saith, Darkness under his feet, and in <hi>Genesis</hi> he is said to walk to the South. In like manner also we read of the garments, and ornaments of God, as with the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> the Lord hath reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he hath put on beauty, cloathed with light as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and elswhere, Thou hast put on comliness and beauty; The Abysse as a garment and his cloathing; and in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the Lord speaketh, saying, I spread my garment over thee and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thy nakedness; moreover also we read of the rod, Staffe, Sword and Buckler of God, as in the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Thy rod and thy staffe, they have comforted me; his truth hath compassed thee about as with a shield; and in <hi>Deutreonomy</hi> we read of the sword of his glory; and very many of this sort the sacred word declares to us; from which members and Divine orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there is no doubt, but that our members and al things about us, and all our works, are both ruled directed, preserved, governed, and also censured, as the prophet saith. He hath put my foot upon a rock, and directed my goings; and elswhere he saith, Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hand to war, and my fingers to fight; and of his mouth he saith, the Lord hath put a new song into my mouth; and elsewhere our Saviour saith, I will give you a mouth and wisdom; and of the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:52070:208"/>
hair he saith, an hair of your head shall not perish; and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, the hairs of your head are numbred; for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God seeing he would have us to be his Images and like to himself, hath framed members, limbs, and figures after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes laid open in us, according to the similitude of his hidden vertues, as it were signs keeping the same order and proportion to them: whence the <hi>Mecubals</hi> of the Hebrews say, that if a man capable of the Divine influence do make any member of his body clean and free from filthiness, then it becometh <hi>Habitale</hi> and proper seat of the secret limb of God, and of the vertue to the which the same name is ascribed: so that if that member want any thing, the name being invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, whence it dependeth, it is presently heard effectually, according to that, I will hear him, because he hath known my name; and these are the great and hidden mysteries, concerning which it is not lawfull to publish more.</p>

               <p>THe Philosophers have maintained, as we have shewed before, that the Heavens and Stars are Divine Animals, and their souls intellectuall, participating of the Divine mind; and they averre, that some separated substances are superior, others inferior to them, as it were governing and serving, which they call intelligences and Angels; moreover <hi>Plato</hi> himself affirmed, that Celestiall souls are not confined to their bodies, as our souls to our bodies, but to be, where they will, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that they rejoyce in the vision of God, and without any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor or pains do rule and move their bodies, and together in moving them do easily govern these inferior things; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they often called the souls of this kind, Gods, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Divine honors for them, and dedicated prayers and

sacrifices to them, and did worship them with Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and these are the gods to the which all people are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, concerning which <hi>Moses</hi> commanded in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> saying, least perchance your eyes being lifted up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thou shouldest see the Sun, the Moon, and all the Stars of Heaven, and being turned back shouldest adore and worship them, to which all the Nations are subjected, which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Heaven; but the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> hath taken and brought you forth from the furnace of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that thou shouldest be an Hereditary people to himself; and in the same book <hi>chap.</hi> 17. he calleth the Sun, Moon, &amp; Stars Gods; and the Doctors of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews upon that place of <hi>Genesis</hi> where it is said, that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave gifts to the sons of the concubines, <hi>viz.

               <p>THat the heavens and the heavenly bodies are animated with certain Divine souls, is not only the opinion of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and Philosophers, but also the assertion of the sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and of the Catholicks; for <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> also describeth the soul of heaven, and <hi>Jerom</hi> upon the same expresly confesseth it: In like manner <hi>Origen</hi> in his book of Principles, seemeth to think that Celestiall bodies are animated, because they are said to receive commands from God, which is only agreeable to a reasonable nature; for it is written, I have enjoyned a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on all the Stars; Moreover <hi>Job</hi> seemeth to have fully granted, that the Stars are not free from the stain of sin; for there we read, the Stars also are not clean in his sight; which cannot verily be referred to the brightness of their bodies; moreover that the Celestiall bodies are animated, even <hi>Eusebius</hi> the <hi>Pamphilian</hi> thought, and also <hi>Austin</hi> in his <hi>Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridion;</hi> but of the latter writers <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> in his book of four co-equals, and <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> in his book of Spiritual Creatures, and <hi>John Scot</hi> upon the second of the sentences; to these the most learned Cardinall <hi>Nich: Cusa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>us</hi> may be added; Moreover <hi>Aureolus</hi> himself in a strong disputation doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince these things; who moreover thinketh it not strange, that the Heavenly bodies are worshipped with the worship of <hi>Doulia,</hi> and that their suffrages and helps are implored; to whom also <hi>Thomas</hi> himself consenteth, unless the occasion of idolatry should hinder this rite; moreover <hi>Plotinus</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth that they know our wishes, and hear them; but if any one would contradict these, and account them sacrilegious tenents, let him hear <hi>Austin</hi> in his <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> and in his book of Retractations, and <hi>Thomas</hi> in the second book against the Gentiles, and in his <hi>Quodlibets,</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> upon the sentences, and <hi>Gulielmus Parisiensis</hi> in his sum of the universe, who unanimously answer, that to say the heavenly bodies are

animated or inanimated, nothing belongeth to the Catholick faith. Therefore although it seemeth to many ridiculous, that the souls themselves be placed in the spheres and Stars, and as it were the Gods of the Nations, every one doth govern his Regions, Cities, Tribes, People, Nations and Tongues, yet it will not seem strange to those who rightly understand it.</p>

distribute these into more orders, so as some are fiery, some watery, some aerial, some terrestial; which four species of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are computed according to the four powers of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall souls, <hi>viz.</hi> the mind, reason, imagination, and the vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and moving nature; Hence the fiery follow the mind of the Celestiall souls, whence they concur to the contemplation of more sublime things, but the Aeriall follow the reason, and favor the rationall faculty, and after a certain manner separate it from the sensitive and vegetative; therefore it serveth for an active life, as the fiery for a contemplative, but the watery following the imagination, serve for a voluptuous life; The earthly following nature, favor vegetable nature; moreover they distinguish also this kind of Angels into <hi>Saturnine</hi> and <hi>Joviall,</hi> according to the names of the Stars, and the Heavens; further some are Orientall, some Occidentall, some Meridio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, some Septentrionall; Moreover there is no part of the world destitute of the proper assistance of these Angels, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> also and <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Philosopher, and <hi>Aemilianus</hi> the Rhetoritian affirm the same; Therefore of these spirits of the third kind, as the opinion of the Platonists is; they report that there are so many Legions, as there are Stars in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and so many spirits in every Legion, as in heaven it self Stars, but there are (as <hi>Athanasius</hi> delivereth) who think, that the true number of the good spirits, is according to the number of men ninety nine parts, according to the parable of the hundred sheep; others think only nine parts, according to the parable of the ten groats; others suppose the number of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels equal with men, because it is written, He hath appointed the bounds of the people according to the number of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God; and concerning their number many have written many things, but the latter Theologians following the master of the sentences, <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> easily resolve themselves, saying, that the number of the good Angels transcendeth hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane capacity; to the which on the contrary, innumerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean spirits do correspond, there being so many in the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or world, as pure spirits in the superior, and some Divines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that they have received this by revelations; under these they place a kind of spirits, subterrany or obscure, which the Platonists call Angels that failed, revengers of wickedness,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:52070:213"/>
and ungodliness, according to the decree of the Divine justice, and they call them evill Angels and wicked spirits, because they oft annoy and hurt even of their own accords; of these also they reckon more legions, and in like manner distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them according to the names of the Stars and Elements, and parts of the world, they do place over them Kings, Princes and Rulers and the names of them; of these, four most mischeivous Kings do rule over the other, according to the four parts of the world; under these many more Princes of Legions govern, and also many of private offices.

               <p>BUt our Theologians, together with <hi>Dionysius,</hi> maintain the three distinctions of Angels; every one of which they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into three orders, they call these Hierarchies, those quires, whom <hi>Proclus</hi> also distinguisheth by the number nine. They place therefore in the superior Hierarchies, Seraphim, Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim, and Thrones, as it were supercelestiall Angels contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the order of the Divine providence; the first in the goodness of God; the second in the Essence of God, as the form; the third in the wisdom. In the middle Hierarchy they place the Dominations, Vertues, and Powers, as it were worldly Angels concurring to the government of the world; the first of these command that which the other execute; the second are Ministers to the Heavens and sometimes conspire to the working of miracles; the third drive away those things which seem to be able to disturbe the Divine Law; but in the inferiour Hierarchy they place the Principalities, Archangels, whom also <hi>Jamblicus</hi> reckoneth up, these as ministring spirits descend to take care of inferior things; the first of these take care of publike things, princes and magistrates, provinces and kingdoms, every one those that belong to themselves; when we read in <hi>Daniel,</hi> But the prince of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia</hi> withstood me twenty one dayes; and <hi>Jesus</hi> the son of <hi>Syrach</hi> testifieth, that for every Nation a ruling Angel is appointed; which also <hi>Moses</hi> by his song in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> seemeth to shew forth, saying, when the most High divided the Nations, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them bounds according to the number of the Angels of God.

The third dispose eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry smaller matter, and to each thing each one is a preserver. There are also of these, who afford vertue to the least plants and stones and to all inferior things; to whom many things
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:52070:214"/>
are common with God, many with men, and they are media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ministers; but <hi>Athanasius,</hi> besides Thrones, Cherubins, and Seraphins, who are next to God, and magnifie him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly with hymns and continuall praises, praying for our salvation, nameth the other orders, which by a common name he calleth the <hi>militia</hi> of heaven. The first of these is the Doctrinall order, of the which he was, who spake to <hi>Daniel,</hi> saying, Come, that I may teach thee what shall come to thy people in the last dayes; Then there is the tutelar order, of the which we read also in <hi>Daniel.</hi> Behold, <hi>Michael</hi> one of the Princes cometh to my help; and there, In that time shall rise up <hi>Michael</hi> a great Prince, who standeth for the sons of thy people; of this order was that <hi>Raphael</hi> also, who carryed forth and brought back <hi>Tobiah</hi> the younger; after this is the Procuratory Order, of the which mention is made in <hi>Job,</hi> where we read, if the Angel shall speak for him, he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the Lord, and the Lord will be pleased with him; and of the same order is expounded also that which is written in the sixteenth Chapter of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> about the end. The works of the Lord have been made by his appointment from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and he hath distributed their portions from the time they have been made, he hath adorned their works for ever, they have not hungred, nor been wearied, and have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted from their works, none of them shall oppress his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor even for ever. The Ministeriall order followeth, of the which <hi>Paul</hi> to the Hebrews saith, Are they not all Ministring spirits, sent forth for them who shall be heirs of salvation. After these is the Auxiliary order, of the which we read in <hi>Esay,</hi> The Angels of the Lord went forth and slew in the tent of the Assyrians 185. thousands. The Receptory order of souls followeth this, of the which we read in <hi>Luke,</hi> the soul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carryed by Angels into the boso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>THere are some of the School of the Theologians, who distribute the evill spirits into nine degrees, as contrary to the nine orders of the Angels; Therefore the first of these are those which are called false gods, who usurping the name of God, would be worshipped for gods, and require sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and adorations, as that Devil, who saith to Christ, if thou wilt fal down and worship me, I will give thee all these things, shewing him all the kingdoms of the world; and the Prince of these is he who said, I will ascend above the height of the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:52070:215"/>
clouds, and will be like to the most High; who is therefore called Beelzebub, that is, an old god. In the second place fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the spirits of lies, of which sort was he who went forth, and was a lying spirit in the mouth of the Prophets of <hi>Achab;</hi> and the Prince of these is the Serpent <hi>Pytho;</hi> from whence <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> is called <hi>Pythius,</hi> and that woman a witch in <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the other in the Gospel, who had <hi>Pytho</hi> in their belly. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this kind of Devils joyneth himself to the Oracles, and deludeth men by divinations, and predictions, so that he may deceive. In the third order are the vessels of iniquity, which are also called the vessels of wrath, these are the inventors of evil things and of all wicked arts, as in <hi>Plato,</hi> that devill <hi>Theutus</hi> who taught Cards and Dice; for all wickedness, malice and deformity proceedeth from these; of the which in <hi>Genesis,</hi> in the Benedictions of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi, Jacob</hi> saith, vessels of iniquity are in their habitations; into their counsel let not my soul come; whom the <hi>Psalmist</hi> calleth vessels of death, <hi>Esay</hi> vessels of fury, and <hi>Jeremy</hi> vessels of wrath, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of destroying and slaying, and their prince is <hi>Belial,</hi> which is interpreted without a yoak or disobedient, a prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator and an Apostate, of whom <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> saith, what agreement hath Christ with <hi>Beliall?</hi> Fourthly follow the revengers of evil, and their Prince is <hi>Asmodeus, viz.</hi> causing judgement; After these in the fifth place come the deluders, who Imitate miracles, and serve wicked conjurers and witches, and seduce the people by their miracles, as the serpent seduced <hi>Eve,</hi> and their Prince is Satan, of whom is written in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, that he seduceth the whole world, doing great signs, and causing fire to descend from heaven in the sight of men, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the inhabitants of the earth, by reason of the signs, which are given him to do. Sixthly the Aeriall powers offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; they joyn themselves to thundering and lightnings, corrupting the aire, causing pestilences and other evils; in the number of which, are the four Angels, of whom the Revelation speaketh, to whom it is given to hurt the Earth and Sea, holding the four windes, from the four corners of the earth; and their prince is called <hi>Meririm;</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:52070:215"/>
he is the <hi>Meridian</hi> Devill, a boyling spirit, a devill raging in the South, whom <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> calleth the Prince of the power of this air, and the spirit which worketh in the children of disobedience. The seventh mansion the furies possess, which are powers of evil, discords, war and devasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whose Prince in the Revelations is called in Greek <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollyon,</hi> in Hebrew <hi>Abaddon,</hi> that is destroying and wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In the eighth place are the accusers, or the inquisitors, whose Prince is <hi>Astarath,</hi> that is, a searcher out: in the Greek language he is called <hi>Diabolos,</hi> that is an accuser, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator, which in the Revelations is called the accuser, of the brethren, accusing them night &amp; day before the face of our God. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is the common opinion of Divines, that all evil spirits are of that nature, that they hate God as well as men; therefore Divine providence hath set over us more pure spirits, with whom he hath entrusted us, as with Shepheards, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, that they should daily help us, and drive away evil spirits from us, and curb, and restrain them, that they should not hurt us as much as they would; as is read in <hi>Tobia,</hi> that <hi>Raphael</hi> did apprehend the <hi>Demon</hi> called <hi>Asmodeus,</hi> and bound him in the wilderness of the upper <hi>Egypt.</hi> Of these <hi>Hesiod</hi> saith, there are 30000 of <hi>Jupiters</hi> immortall spirits li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on the earth, which are the keepers of mortall men, who that they might observe justice and mercifull deeds, having clothed themselves with air, go every where on the earth. For there is no Prince, nor potentate could be safe, nor any woman continue uncorrupted, no man in this valley of ignorance could come to the end appointed to him by God, if good spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits did not secure us; Or if evill spirits should be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to satisfie the wils of men; As therefore amongst the good spirits there is a proper keeper or protector deputed to every one, corroborating the spirit of the man to good; so of evil spirits there is sent forth an enemy ruling over the flesh, and desire thereof; and the good spirit fights for us as a preserver against the enemie, and flesh; Now man betwixt these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:52070:219"/>
he is made his servant, and being overcome, cannot fight any more with another, as a wasp that hath lost his sting: to which opinion <hi>Origen</hi> assents in his book <hi>Periarchon,</hi> concluding, that the Saints fighting against evil spirits, and overcoming, do lessen their armie, neither can he that is overcome by any, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest any more; As therefore there is given to every man a good spirit, so also there is given to every man an evil <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall</hi> spirit, whereof each seeks an union with our spirit, and endeavours to attract it to it self, and to be mixed with it, as wine with water; the good indeed, through all good works conformable to it self, change us into Angels, by uniting us, as it is writ of <hi>John Baptist</hi> in <hi>Malachie:</hi> Behold I send mine Angel before thy face: of which transmutation, and union it is writ elsewhere; He which adheres to God is made one spirit with him. An evil spirit also by evil works, studies to make us conformable to it self, and to unite as <hi>Christ</hi> saith of <hi>Judas,</hi> Have not I chosen twelve, &amp; one of you is a devil? And this is that which <hi>Hermes</hi> saith, when a spirit hath influence upon the soul of man, he scatters the seed of his own notion, whence such a soul being sowen with seeds, and full of fury, brings forth thence wonderfull things, and whatsoever are the offices of spirits: for when a good spirit hath influence upon a holy soul, it doth exalt it to the light of wisdom; but an evil spirit being transfused into a wicked soul, doth stir it up to theft, to man slaughter, to lusts, and whatsoever are the offices of evil spirits. Good spirits (as saith <hi>Jamblicus)</hi> purge the souls most perfectly; and some bestow upon us other good things; they being present do give health to the body, vertue to the soul, security to the soul, what is mortall in us they take away, cherish heat, and make it more efficacious to life, and by an Harmonie do alwayes infuse light into an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible mind. But whether there be many keepers of a man, or one alone, <hi>Theologians</hi> differ amongst themselves; we think there are more, the Prophet saying, he hath given his Angels a charge concerning thee, that they should keep thee in all thy wayes: which as saith <hi>Hierome,</hi> is to be understood of any man, as well as of Christ. All men therefore are governed by
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:52070:219"/>
the ministery of divers Angels, and are brought to any degree of vertue, deserts, and dignity, who behave themselves worthy of them; but they which carry themselves unworthy of them are deposed, and thrust down, as well by evil spirits, as good spirits, unto the lowest degree of misery, as their evil merits shall require: but they that are attributed to the sublimer Angels, are preferred before other men, for Angels having the care of them, exalt them, and subject others to them by a certain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult power; which although neither of them perceive, yet he that is subjected, feels a certain yoke of presidency, of which he cannot easily acquit himself, yea he fears and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renceth that power, which the superiour Angels make to flow upon superiours, and with a certain terrour bring the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours into a fear of presidency. This did <hi>Homer</hi> seem to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of, when he saith, that the <hi>Muses</hi> begot of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> did alwayes as inseparable companions assist the <hi>Kings</hi> begot of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who by them were made venerable, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent. So we read that M. <hi>Antonius</hi> being formerly joyned in singular friendship with <hi>Octavus Augustus,</hi> were wont al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to play together. But when as alwayes <hi>Augustus</hi> went away conquerour, that a certain <hi>Magician</hi> Counselled M. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> thus. <hi>O Antony,</hi> what dost thou do with that yong man? shun, and avoid him, for although thou art elder then he, and art more skilfull then he, and art better descended then he, and hast endured the Wars of more Emperours, yet thy <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> doth much dread the <hi>Genius</hi> of this yong man, and thy Fortune flatter his Fortune; unless thou shalt shun him, it seemeth wholly to decline to him. Is not the Prince like other men, how should other men fear, and reverence him, unless a Divine terrour should exalt him, and striking a fear into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, depress them, that they should reverence him as a Prince? Wherefore we must endeavour, that being purified by doing well, and following sublime things, and choosing opportune times, and seasons, we be entrusted or committed to a degree of sublimer, and more potent Angels, who taking care of us, we may deservedly be preserred before others.</p>

               <p>AS every Region in the Celestials hath a certain Star, and Celestiall image which hath influence upon it before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: so also in supercelestials doth it obtain a certain Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence set over it, and guarding it, with infinite other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string spirits of its order, all which are called by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon name, the Sons of <hi>Elohim Sabaoth</hi>

               <p>Nevertheless seeing there be in every region spirits of all sorts, yet they are more powerfull there which are of the same order with the president of that region. So in the <hi>Solary</hi> region, the <hi>Solary</hi> spirits are most potent; in the <hi>Lunary,</hi>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:52070:220"/>
                  <hi>Lunany,</hi> and so of the rest. And hence it is that various events of our affairs offer themselves, &amp; follow us in places and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, being more Fortunate in one place more then another, where <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Demon</hi> our <hi>Genius</hi> shall receive more power, or we shall there obtain a more powerfull <hi>Demon</hi> of the same order. So <hi>Solary</hi> men, if they shall travell into a <hi>Solary</hi> region, or province, shall be made there far more fortunate, because there they shall have more powerfull, and more advantagious conducters or <hi>Genii,</hi> by the present aid of whom they shall be brought beyond expectation, and their own power, to happy events. Hence it is that the choice of a place, region, or time doth much conduce to the happiness of life where any one shall dwell, &amp; frequent, according to the nature &amp; instinct of his own <hi>Genius.</hi> Sometimes also the change of the name doth conduce to the same, for whereas the properties of names being the significators of things themselves, do as it were in a glass declare the conditions of their forms; thence it comes to pass, that names being changed, the things oftentimes are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Hence the sacred writ doth not without cause bring in God, whilest he was blessing <hi>Abram,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> changing their names, calling the one <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the other <hi>Israel.</hi> Now the ancient Phylosophers teach us to know the nature of the <hi>Genius</hi> of every man, by Stars, their influx, and aspects, which are potent in the Nativity of any one; but with instructions so divers, and differing amongst themselves, that it is much difficult to understand the mysteries of the heavens by their directions. For <hi>Porphyrie</hi> seeks the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Star, which is the Lady of the Nativity: but <hi>Maternus</hi> either from thence, or from the Planets, which had then most dignities, or from that into whose house the Moon was to enter after that, which at the birth of the man it doth retain. But the <hi>Caldeans</hi> enquire after the <hi>Genius,</hi> either from the Sun above, or from the Moon. But others, and many <hi>Hebrews</hi> think it is to be enquired after from some corner of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or from all of them. Others seek a good <hi>Genius</hi> from the eleventh house, which therefore they call a good <hi>Demon;</hi> but an evil <hi>Genius</hi> from the sixth, which therefore they call an evil
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:52070:221"/>
                  <hi>Demon.</hi> But seeing the inquisition of these is laborious, &amp; most occult, we shallfar more easily enquire into the nature of our <hi>Genius</hi> from our selves, observing those things which the instinct of nature doth dictate to, and the heaven inclines us to from our infancy, being distracted with no contagion, or those things which the minde, the soul being freed from vain cares, and sinister affections, and impediments being removed, doth suggest to us: These without all doubt are the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of a <hi>Genius</hi> which is given to every one from their birth, leading, and perswading us to that whither the Star thereof inclines us to.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>That there is a threefold keeper of man, and from whence each of them proceed.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>EVery man hath a threefold good Demon, as a proper keeper, or preserver, the one whereof is holy, another of the nativity, and the other of profession. The holy Demon is one, according to the Doctrine of the Aegyptians, assigned to the rationall soul, not from the Stars or Planets, but from a supernaturall cause, from God himself, the president of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, being universall, above nature: This doth direct the life of the soul, &amp; doth alwaies put good thoughts into the minde, being alwaies active in illuminating of us, although we do not alwaies take notice of it; but when we are purified, and live peaceably, then it is perceived by us, then it doth as it were speak with us, and communicates its voyce to us, being before silent, and studyeth daily to bring us to a sacred perfection. Also by the ayd of this Demon we may avoid the malignity of a Fate; which being religiously worshipped by us in honesty, and sanctity, as we know was done by <hi>Socrates;</hi> the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> think we may be much helped by it, as by dreams, and signs, by diverting evill things, and carefully procuring good things. Wherefore the <hi>Pythagorians</hi> were wont with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:52070:221"/>
to pray to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that he would either preserve them from evill, or shew them by what Demon it should be done. Now the Demon of nativity, which is called the Genius, doth here descend from the disposition of the world, and from the circuits of the Stars, which were powerfull in his nativity. Hence there be some that think, when the soul is coming down into the body, it doth out of the quire of the Demons naturally choose a preserver to it self, nor only choose this guide to it self, but hath that willing to defend it. This being the executor, and keeper of the life, doth help it to the body, and takes care of it, being Communicated to the body, and helps a man to that very office, to which the Celestials have deputed him, being born. Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have received a fortunate <hi>Genius,</hi> are made thereby ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in their works, efficacious, strong, and prosperous. Wherefore they are called by the <hi>Phylosophers</hi> fortunate, or luckily born. Now the Demon of profession is given by the Stars, to which such a profession, or sect, which any man hath professed, is subjected, which the soul, when it began to make choyce in this body, and to take upon it self dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, doth secretly desire. This Demon is changed, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession being changed; then according to the dignity of the profession, we have Demons of our profession more excellent and sublime, which successively take care of man, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a keeper of profession, as he proceeds from vertue to vertue. When therefore a profession agrees with our nature, there is present with us a Demon of our profession like unto us, and sutable to our <hi>Genius,</hi> and our life is made more peaceable, happy, and prosperous: but when we undertake a profession unlike, or contrary to our <hi>Genius,</hi> our life is made laborious, and troubled with disagreeing patrons. So it falls out that some profit more in any science, or art, or office, in a little time, and with little pains, when another takes much pains, and studies hard, and all in vain: and although no science, art, or vertue be to be contemned, yet that thou maist live prosperously, carry on thy affairs happily; in the first place know thy good <hi>Genius,</hi> and thy nature, and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:52070:222"/>
what good the celestiall disposition promiseth thee, and God the distributor of all these, who distributes to each as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and follow the beginnings of these, profess these, be conversant in that vertue to which the most high distributor doth elevate, and lead thee, who made <hi>Abraham</hi> excell in justice, and clemency, <hi>Isaac</hi> with fear, <hi>Jacob</hi> with strength, <hi>Moses</hi> with meekness, and Miracles, <hi>Joshua</hi> in war, <hi>Phinias</hi> in zeal, <hi>David</hi> in religion, and victory, <hi>Solomon</hi> in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and fame, <hi>Peter</hi> in faith, <hi>John</hi> in charity, <hi>Jacob</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, <hi>Thomas</hi> in prudence, <hi>Magdalen</hi> in contemplation, <hi>Martha</hi> in officiousness. Therefore in what vertue thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou canst most easily be a proficient in, use diligence to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the height thereof; that thou maist excell in one, when in many thou canst not: but in the rest endeavour to be as great a proficient as thou canst: but if thou shalt have the overseers of nature, and religion agreeable, thou shalt finde a double progress of thy nature, and profession: but if they shall be disagreeing, follow the better, for thou shalt better perceive at some time a preserver of an excellent profession, then of nativity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. <hi>Of the tongue of Angels, and of their speaking amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and with us.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE might doubt whether Angels, or Demons, since they be pure spirits, use any vocal speech, or tongue amongst themselves, or to us; but that <hi>Paul</hi> in some place saith, If I speak with the tongue of men, or angels: but what their speech or tongue is, is much doubted by many. For many think that if they use any Idiome, it is Hebrew, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that was the first of all, and came from heaven, and was before the confusion of languages in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in which the Law was given by God the Father, and the Gospell was preached by Christ the Son, and so many Oracles were given
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:52070:222"/>
to the Prophets by the Holy Ghost: and seeing all tongues have, and do undergo various mutations, and corruptions, this alone doth alwaies continue inviolated. Moreover an evident sign of this opinion is, that though each Demon, and Intelligence do use the speech of those nations, with whom they do inhabit, yet to them that understand it, they never speak in any Idiome, but in this alone. But now how Angels speak it is hid from us, as they themselves are. Now to us that we may speak, a tongue is necessary with other instruments, as are the jaws, palate, lips, teeth, throat, lungs, the aspera arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and muscles of the breast, which have the beginning of motion from the soul. But if any speak at a distance to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, he must use a louder voice; but if neer, he whispers in his ear: and if he could be coupled to the hearer, a softer breath would suffice; for he would slide into the hearer without any noise, as an image in the eye, or glass. So souls going out of the body, so Angels, so Demons speak: and what man doth with a sensible voyce, they do by impressing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the speech in those to whom they speak, after a better manner then if they should express it by an audible voyce. So the <hi>Platonists</hi> say that <hi>Socrates</hi> perceived his Demon by sense indeed, but not of this body, but by the sense of the etheriall body concealed in this: after which manner <hi>Avicen</hi> believes the Angels were wont to be seen, and heard by the Prophets: That instrument, whatsoever the vertue be, by which one spirit makes known to another spirit what things are in his minde, is called by the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> the tongue of Angels. Yet oftentimes also they send forth an audible voyce, as they that cryed at the ascention of the Lord, Ye men of <hi>Galile,</hi> why stand ye here gazing into the heaven? And in the old law they spake with divers of the Fathers with a sensible voyce, but this never but when they assumed bodies. But with what senses those spirits and Demons hear our invocations, and prayes, and see our ceremonies, we are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant.</p>
               <p>For there is a spirituall body of Demons everywhere sensible by nature, so that it toucheth, seeth, heareth, without any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:52070:223"/>
and nothing can be an impediment to it: Yet neither do they perceive after that manner as we do with different organs, but haply as sponges drink in water, so do they all sensible things with their body, or some other way unknown to us; neither are all animals endowed with those organs; for we know that many want ears, yet we know they perceive a sound, but after what manner we know not.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MAny and divers are the names of good spirits, and bad: but their proper, and true names, as those of the Stars, are known to God alone, who only numbers the multitude of Stars, and calls them all by their names, whereof none can be known by us but by divine revelation, and very few are expressed to us in the sacred. writ. But the masters of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews think that the names of Angels were imposed upon them by <hi>Adam,</hi> according to that which is written, The Lord brought all things which he had made unto <hi>Adam,</hi> that he should name them, and as he called any thing, so the name of it was. Hence the Hebrew <hi>Mecubals</hi> think, together with <hi>Magicians,</hi> that it is in the power of man to impose names upon Spirits, but of such a man only who is dignified, and elevated to this vertue by some divine gift, or sacred authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but because a name that may express the nature of divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the whole vertue of angelical essences cannot be made by any humane voyce, therefore names for the most part are put upon them from their works, signifying some certain office, or effect, which is required by the quire of Spirits: which names then no otherwise then oblations, and sacrifices offered to the Gods, obtain efficacy and vertue to draw any spirituall substance from above or beneath, for to make any
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:52070:223"/>
desired effect. I have seen, and known some writing on vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin parchment the name and seal of some spirit in the hour of the Moon: which when afterward he gave to be devoured by a water-frog, and had muttered over some verse, the frog being let go into the water, rains, and shours presently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. I saw also the same man inscribing the name of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit with the seal thereof in the hour of <hi>Mars,</hi> which was given to a Crow, who being let go, after a verse mutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over, presently there followed from that corner of the heaven, whither he flew, lightnings, shakings, and horrible thunders, with thick clouds: Neither were those names of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of an unknown tongue, neither did they signifie any thing else but their offices. Of this kinde are the names of those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Raziel, Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, Haniel,</hi> which is as much as the vision of God, the vertue of God, the strength of God, the medicine of God, the glory of God. In like manner in the offices of evill Demons are read their names, a player, deceiver, a dreamer, fornicator, and many such like. So we recieve from many of the ancient Fathers of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews the names of Angels set over the planets, and signs; over <hi>Saturn Zaphiel:</hi> over <hi>Jupiter Zadkiel:</hi> over <hi>Mars Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael:</hi> over the <hi>Sun Raphael:</hi> over <hi>Venus Haniel:</hi> over <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury Michael:</hi> over the <hi>Moon Gabriel.</hi> These are those seven Spirits which alwaies stand before the face of God, to whom is entrusted the disposing of the whole celestial, and terrene Kingdoms, which is under the Moon. For these (as say the more curious Theologians) govern all things by a certain vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitude of hours, daies, and years, as the Astrologers teach concerning the planets which they are set over; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Mercurius Trismegistus</hi> calls the seven governers of the world, who by the heavens, as by instruments, distribute the influences of all the Stars and signs upon these inferiours. Now there are some that do ascribe them to the Stars, by names somewhat differing, saying, that over Saturn is set an intelligence called <hi>Oriphiel;</hi> over Jupiter <hi>Zachariel;</hi> over Mars <hi>Zamael;</hi> over the Sun <hi>Michael;</hi> over Venus <hi>Anael;</hi> over Mercury <hi>Raphael;</hi> over the Moon <hi>Gabriel.</hi> And every
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:52070:224"/>
one of these governs the world 354 years, and four months; and the government begins from the Intelligence of <hi>Saturn;</hi> afterward in order, the Intelligences of <hi>Venus, Jupiter, Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Mars,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> raign, and then the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment returns to the Spirit of <hi>Saturn. Abbas Tritemius</hi> writ to <hi>Maximilian Caesar</hi> a speciall Treatise concerning these, which he that will throughly examine, may from thence draw great knowledge of future times. Over the twelve Signs are set these, <hi>viz.</hi> over <hi>Aries Malchidael;</hi> over <hi>Taurus As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>model;</hi> over <hi>Gemini Ambriel;</hi> over <hi>Cancer Muriel;</hi> over <hi>Leo Verchiel;</hi> over <hi>Virgo Hamaliel;</hi> over <hi>Libra Zuriel;</hi> over <hi>Scorpio Barchiel;</hi> over <hi>Sagittarius Advachiel;</hi> over <hi>Capricorn Hanael;</hi> over <hi>Aquarius Cambiel;</hi> over <hi>Pisces Barchiel.</hi> Of these Spirits set over the planets, and Signs, <hi>John</hi> made mention in the Revelation, speaking of the former in the beginning; And of the seven Spirits which are in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of ths Throne of God, which I finde are set over the seven planets, in the end of the book, where he describes the platform of the heavenly City, saying that in the twelve gates thereof were twelve Angels. There are again twenty eight Angels, which rule in the twenty eight mansions of the Moon, whose names in order are those, <hi>Geniel, Enediel, Amixiel, Azariel, Gabiel, Dirachiel, Seheliel, Amnediel, Barbiel, Arde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiel, Neciel, Abdizuel, Jazeriel, Ergediel, Ataliel, Azeruel, Adriel, Egibiel, Amutiel, Kyriel, Bethnael, Geliel, Requiel, Abrinael, Aziel, Tagriel, Alheniel, Amnixiel.</hi> There are also four Princes of the Angels, which are set over the four winds, and over the four parts of the world, whereof <hi>Michael</hi> is set over the Eastern wind; <hi>Raphael</hi> over the Western; <hi>Gabriel</hi> over the Northern; <hi>Nariel,</hi> who by some is called <hi>Uriel,</hi> is over the Southern. There are also assigned to the Elements these, <hi>viz.</hi> to the air <hi>Cherub;</hi> to the water <hi>Tharsis;</hi> to the Earth <hi>Ariel;</hi> to the Fire <hi>Seruph,</hi> or according to <hi>Philon, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel.</hi> Now every one of these Spirits is a great Prince, and hath much power and freedome in the dominion of his own planets, and signs, and in their times, years, months, daies, and hours, and in their Elements, and parts of the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:52070:224"/>
world, and winds. And every one of them rules over many legions; and after the same manner amongst evil spirits, there are four which as most potent Kings are set over the rest, according to the four parts of the world, whose names are these, <hi>viz. Urieus,</hi> King of the East; <hi>Amaymon,</hi> King of the South; <hi>Paymon,</hi> King of the West; <hi>Egin,</hi> King of the North, which the Hebrew Doctors perhaps call more rightly thus, <hi>Samuel, Azazel, Azael, Mahazuel,</hi> under whom ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other rule as princes of legions, and rulers; also there are innumerable Demons of private offices. Moreover the ancient <hi>Theologians</hi> of the Greeks reckon up six Demons, which they call Telchines, others Alastores; which bearing ill will to men, taking up water out of the river <hi>Styx</hi> with their hand, sprinkle it upon the earth, whence follow Calamities, plagues, and famines; and these are said to be <hi>Acteus, Megalezius, Ormenus, Lycus, Nicon, Mimon.</hi> But he which desires to know exactly the distinct names, offices, places, and times of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and evil Demons, let him enquire into the book of <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Simon</hi> of the Temples.

one carries the great name of God, as it is written: My An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel shall go before thee; observe him, for my name is in him. And these are those that are set over the seventy two Celestial quinaries, and so many Nations, and tongues, and joynts of mans body, and cooperate with the seventy two seniors of the Synagogue, and so many disciples of Christ: and their names according to the extraction which the Cabalists make, are manifest in this following table, according to one manner which we have spoke of. Now there are many other manner or waies of making <hi>Schemhamphorae</hi> out of those verses, as when all three are in a right order written one after the other from the right to the left, besides those which are extracted by the tables of <hi>Ziruph,</hi> and the tables of commutations, of which we made mention above. And because these tables serve for all names, as well divine, as angelical, we shall therefore subjoyn them to this Chapter.</p>
               <p>These are the seventy two Angels, bearing the name of God, <hi>Schemhamphorae.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. <hi>Of finding out of the names of spirits, and</hi> Genius's <hi>from the disposition of Celestiall bodies.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe ancient Magicians did teach an art of finding out the name of a spirit to any desired effect, drawing it from the disposition of the heaven; as for example, any Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall Harmonie being proposed to thee for the making an image or ring, or any other work to be done under a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain constellation; if thou will finde out the spirit that is the ruler of that work; the figure of the heaven being erected, cast forth letters in their number and order from the degree of the ascendent, according to the succession of signes through each degree by filling the whole circle of the heaven: then those letters which fall into the places of the Stars the aid whereof thou wouldest use, being according to the number, and powers of those Stars, marked without into number, and order, make the name of a good spirit: but if thou shalt do so from the beginning of a degree falling against the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse of the signes, the resulting spirit shall be evil. By this art some of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Caldean</hi> masters teach that the nature, and name of any <hi>Genius</hi> may be found out; as for example, the degree of the ascendent of any ones, nativity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known, and the other corners of the heaven being Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equated, then let that which had the more dignities of Planets in those four corners which the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Almutez,</hi> be first observed amongst the rest: and according to that in the second place, that which shall be next to it in the number of dignities, and so by order the rest of them, which obtain any dignitie in the foresaid corners: this order being used, thou maist know the true place, &amp; degree of them in the heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the degree of the ascendent through each degree according to the order of signs to cast 22. of the letters of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> Then what letters shall fall into the places of the aforesaid Stars, being marked, and disposed according to the order found out above in the Stars, &amp; rightly joyned together
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:52070:230"/>
according to the rules of the Hebrew tongue, make the name of a <hi>Genius:</hi> to which, according to the custome, some <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syllable</hi> name of Divine omnipotency, <hi>viz. El, or Iah</hi> is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. But if the casting of the letters be made from an angle of the falling, and against the succession of signs, and the letters which shall fall in the <hi>Nadir</hi> (that is the opposite point) of the aforesaid Stars, be after that order as we said, joyned together, shall make the name of an evil <hi>Genius.</hi> But the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> proceed another way; for they take not the <hi>Almutez</hi> of the corners, but the <hi>Almutez</hi> of the eleventh house, and do in all things as hath been said. Now they finde out an evil <hi>Genius</hi> from the <hi>Almutez</hi> of the angle of the twelfth house, which they call an evil spirit, casting from the degree of the falling against the progress of the signs. There are also the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and many others, and some Hebrews, who finde out the name of a <hi>Genius</hi> by the places of the five <hi>Hylegians,</hi> and making projection alwayes from the beginning of Aries, and the letters being found out according to the order of <hi>Hylegians</hi> with the <hi>Astrologers,</hi> being reduced into a known order, and being joyned together, make the name of a good <hi>Genius:</hi> but they draw the name of an evil <hi>Genius</hi> From the opposite <hi>Hylegian</hi> places, projection being made from the last degree of <hi>Pisces</hi> against the order of signs. But other-some do not take the places of <hi>Hylegians,</hi> but the places of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutez</hi> upon the five <hi>Hylegians</hi> making, projection from an <hi>Horoscope,</hi> as abovesaid: and these names being thus distribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the proportioned numbers to the Starry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coant, compacted of joyned and changed letters, although unknown in sound, and significative, we must of necessity confess may do more by the secret of the chiefest Philosophy in a magick work, then significative names, whilest the mind being astonished at the obscurity of them, and deeply intent, firmly believing that something Divine is under it, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently pronounce these words, and names, although not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, to the glory of God, captivating himself with a spirituall affection of piety, in the obedience of him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVII. <hi>Of the calculating Art of such names by the tradition of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balists.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is yet another Art of these kinds of names, which they call calculatory, and it is made by the following ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, by entring with some sacred, Divine, or Angelicall name, in the column of letters descending; by taking those letters which thou shalt find in the common angles under their Stars, and Signs: which being reduced into order, the name of a good spirit is made of the nature of that Star, or Sign, under which thou didst enter: but if thou shalt enter in the column a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending, by taking the common angles above the Stars, and Signs marked in the lowest line, the name of an evil spirit is made. And these are the names of spirits of any order, or heaven ministring; as of good, so of bad, which thou maist after this manner multiply into nine names of so many orders, in as much as thou maist by entring with one name draw forth another of a spirit of a superior order out of the same, as well of a good, as bad one. Yet the beginning of this calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation depends upon the names of God; for every word hath a vertue in <hi>Magick,</hi> in as much as it depends on the word of God, and is thence framed. Therefore we must know that every Angelicall name must proceed from some primary name of God. Therefore Angels are said to bear the name of God, according to that which is written, <hi>because my name is in him.</hi> Therefore that the names of good Angels may be discerned from the names of bad, there is wont oftentimes to be added some name of Divine omnipotencie, as <hi>El,</hi> or <hi>On,</hi> or <hi>Jah, or Jod,</hi> and to be pronounced together with it: and because <hi>Jah</hi> is a name of beneficence, and <hi>Jod</hi> the name of a diety, therefore these two names are put only to the names of angels; But the name <hi>El,</hi> because it imports power, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is therefore added not only to good but bad spirits, for neither can evil spirits either subsist, or do any thing without
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:52070:231"/>
the vertue of <hi>El,</hi> God. But we must know that common angles of the same Star and Sign are to be taken, unless entrance be made with a mixt name, as are the names of <hi>Genii,</hi> and those of which it hath bin spoken in the preceding Ch. which are made of the dispositions of the heaven, according to the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of divers Stars. For as often as the table is to be entred with these, the common angle is to be taken under the Star, or Sign of him that enters. There are moreover some that do so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend those tables, that they think also if there be an entrance made with the name of a Star, or office, or any desired effect, a Demon whether good, or bad, serving to that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or effect, may be drawn out. Upon the same account they that enter with the proper name of any person, beleeve that they can extract the names of the <hi>Genii,</hi> under that Star which shall appear to be over such a person, as they shall by his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomy, or by the Passions and inclinations of his mind, and by his profession, and fortune, know him to be <hi>Martial,</hi> or <hi>Saturnine,</hi> or <hi>Solarie,</hi> or of the nature of any other Star. And although such kinde of primary names have none or little power by their signification, yet such kind of extracted names, and such as are derived from them, are of very great efficacy; as the rayes of the Sun collected in a hollow glass, do indeed most strongly burn, the Sun it self being scarce warm. Now there is an order of letters in those tables under the Stars, and Signs, almost like that which is with the Astrologers, of tens, elevens, twelves. Of this calculatory Art <hi>Alfonsus Cyprius</hi> once wrote, and I know who elss, and also fitted it to Latine Characters; But because the letters of every tongue, as we shewed in the first book, have in their number, order, and figure a Celestiall and Divine originall, I shall easily grant this calculation concerning the names of spirits to be made not only by Hebrew letters, but also <hi>Chaldean,</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, Aegyptian,</hi> Greek, Latine, and any other, the tables being tightly made after the imitation of the presidents. But here it is objected by many, that it falls out, that in these tables men of a differing nature, and Fortune, do oftentimes by reason of the sameness of name obtain the same <hi>Genius</hi> of the same
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:52070:232"/>
name. We must know therefore that it must not be thought absurd that the same Demon may be separated from any one soul, and the same be set over more. Besides, as divers men have many times the same name, so also spirits of divers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and natures may be noted or marked by one name, by one and the same seal, or Character, yet in a divers respect: for as the serpent doth sometimes typifie Christ, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the devill; so the same names, and the same seals may be applied sometimes to the order of a good Demon, sometimes of a bad. Lastly, the very ardent intension of the invocator, by which our intellect is joyned to the separated intelligencies, causeth that we have sometimes one spirit, sometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although called upon under the same name, made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequions to us.</p>
               <p>There follow the tables of the calculation of the names of spirits, good and bad, under the presidency of the 7. Planets, and under the order of the 12. Militant Signs.</p>

                  <hi>How Sometimes names of Spirits are taken from those things over which they are set.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Finde yet another kinde of names given to the spirits from those things, which they are set over, their names being as it were borrowed from the Stars, or men, or places, or times, or such like things, the divine name being added at the end, thus. The Spirit of <hi>Saturn</hi> is called <hi>Sabathiel:</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Jupiter, Zedekiel:</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Mars, Madimiel:</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the <hi>Sun, Semeliel,</hi> or <hi>Semeschia;</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Venus, Nogahel;</hi> the spirit of <hi>Mercury, Cochabiah,</hi> or <hi>Cochabiel;</hi> the Spirit of the <hi>Moon, Jareahel,</hi> or <hi>Levanael.</hi> In like manner also they call the Spirits which are set over the signes by the names of signes in order; from <hi>Aries Teletiel, Suriel, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mimiel, Sattamiel, Ariel, Betuliel, Masniel, Acrabiel, Chese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiel, Gediel, Deliel, Dagymiel.</hi> And if we call them from the latin words, <hi>Ariel, Tauriel, Geminiel, Cancrie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>l, Leoniel, Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Libriel, Scorpiel, Sagittariel, Capriel, Aquariel, Pisciel;</hi> and from the Planets, <hi>Saturniel, Ioviel, Martiel, Soliah, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriel, Mercuriel, Lunael,</hi> or <hi>Lunaiah.</hi> Now because (as we said before all spirits, as well good as bad, seek for a union with man, which oftentimes in some sort they obtain, we read that some men are called Gods, and angels, and Divels. So the names of them which are endowed with any singular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of vertue, or with some desperate wickedness have departed this life, have obtained a place amongst the names of good and bad Demons, and are reckoned amonst them, whether we shall think that the souls of those men or the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii</hi> whether good or bad are signified. So we readin <hi>Esdras</hi> that the name of the Archangel <hi>Ieremiel</hi> was from <hi>Ieremiah</hi> the Prophet. So <hi>Zachariel</hi> from <hi>Zacharia;</hi> and <hi>Uriel</hi> from <hi>Uriah</hi> the Prophet, whom <hi>Ioachim</hi> slue. In like manner <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> were the names of Angels as well as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:52070:234"/>
                  <hi>Phaniel</hi> is the name of an Angel, and of the place where <hi>Jacob</hi> wrestled all night. <hi>Ariel</hi> is the name of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and is the same as the Lion of God; sometimes also it is the name of an evil Demon, and of a City which is thence called <hi>Ariopolis,</hi> where the Idol <hi>Ariel</hi> was worshipped, We finde also in sacred writ that many names of evil Demons had their rise from most wicked men, or from the habitations of wicked men; as the name <hi>Astaroth</hi> which is the name of an evill Demon, was formerly the name of the City of <hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Basan,</hi> in which dwelt giants; in like manner <hi>Astaroth</hi> was formerly the City of the <hi>Amorrhei; Raphaim</hi> a valley, and <hi>Ieramiel</hi> the country of the <hi>Allophyli;</hi> and also they were the names of Idols, and evill Demons; as <hi>Remma</hi> was the statue of the Idol of <hi>Damascus; Chamos</hi> the Idol of <hi>Moab; Melchim</hi> the Idol of the <hi>Amonta; Bel</hi> the Idol of <hi>Babylonians; Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> the Idol of of the <hi>Assirians; Dagon</hi> the Idol of the <hi>Allophyli.</hi> And <hi>Philo</hi> makes mention of seven golden Statues which the <hi>Amorrhei</hi> had, which they called the holy <hi>Nymphs,</hi> which being, called upon did shew to the <hi>Amorthei</hi> every hour their works; and the names of them were the names of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which were the wives of seven wicked men, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated them after the floud, <hi>viz. Chanaan, Phut, Selath, Nebroth, Abirion, Elath, Desuat,</hi> and there were put upon them pretious stones, engraven, and consecrated, one of which had a vertue to restore sight to the blind; neither could any fire burn these stones; and the books were consecrated with stones, which in like manner could not be burnt with fire, nor cut with yron, nor obliterated with water, until the angel of the Lord took them, and buried them in the bottome of the sea. Moreover we know that <hi>Nimbroth, Chodorlaomor, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach, Amaloch,</hi> names of Kings, have obtained the order of evill spirits. Also giants are called with divels after a common name <hi>Enakim</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> because they did not partake of the image of God <hi>e i.</hi> they have not received the splendor of the spiritual intellect, but their reason hath multiplied evil kinds of frauds &amp; sins. Therefore they are not reckoned of the specjes of man (as saith <hi>Rabbi Moses</hi> the Egyptian) but of the species of beasts,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:52070:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and divels, only that they have the shape of a man, and such (he saith) were the sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> which were predecessors to <hi>Seth</hi> after <hi>Abel;</hi> of which the wise men of the Hebrews said, that <hi>Adam</hi> begat <hi>Tochot</hi>

                  <hi>i. e.</hi> divels. But after that he had found favor in the eyes of God, he begot <hi>Seth</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own image, and likness, <hi>i. e.</hi> who according to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God obtained a human perfection, which he that hath not, is not reckoned of the species of man, by reason of the pravities which are the cause of all evils and mischief. It is also (as saith <hi>Porphyry)</hi> the opinion of Magicians that evill souls are turned into the nature of Divels, and become as pernicious as they; which Christ confirmed, when he spake concerning <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das Iscariot:</hi> Have not I chosen twelve, and one of you is a divel? which divels therefore they call adventitious, because of mens souls, they are become Divels. Whence the names of wicked men and divels are the same, whether by these we call their souls, an evil <hi>Genii,</hi> which have taken upon them the names of wicked men, as if as were their persons. Also <hi>Bebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth,</hi> and the <hi>Leviathan</hi> signifie beasts, and divels. By these examples he that is inquisitive shall finde out the names of good, as well as of evil spirits.</p>

saith, that the Ancients were willing to conceal God, and divine vertues by sensible figures, and by those things which were visible, yet signifying invisible things, as being willing to deliver great mysteries in sacred letters, and explain them in certain Symbolical figures; as when they dedicated all round things to the World, the Sun, the Moon, hope, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, a circle to the heaven, and parts of a circle to the Moon, Pyranide and Obelisks to the fire, and Olympian Gods; a Cylindar to the Sun and Earth; a mans Yard to generation and Juno, to whom also by reason of the feminine sex the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular figure. Wherefore this kind of Characters hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther root beside the pleasure, and authority of the institutor, of him I say, who received power of instituting, and consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these kind of letters, such as were many Prelates amongst divers Nations, and Sects of Religions, whose institutions came not to us, by reason that few of them were delivered by the Authors scatteringly, and by fragments.

               </head>
               <p>AMongst the Hebrews I finde more fashions of Characters, whereof one is most ancient, <hi>viz.</hi> an Ancient writing which <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets used, the form of which is not rashly to be discovered to any; for those letters which they use at this day, were instituted by <hi>Esdras.</hi> There is also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them a writing which they call Celestiall, because they shew it placed and figured amongst the Stars, no otherwise then the other Astrologers produce images of signs from the lineaments of Stars. There is also a writing which they call <hi>Malachim,</hi> or <hi>Melachim i. e.</hi> of Angels, or Regal; there is also another, which they call the passing through the River, and the Characters and figures of all these are such.</p>
               <p>Celestiall writing.</p>

               <p>There is moreover another fashion amongst the Cabalists, formerly had in great esteem, but now it is so common, that it is placed amongst prophane things, ans it is this.

                  </gap> which are the seals or marks of simple numbers, and of intellectuall things, distributed into nine orders of Angels. The second hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the marks of tens, and of Celestial things, in the nine Orbs of the heavens. The third hath the other four letters, with the five final, by order, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which are marks of hundreds, and inferior things, <hi>viz.</hi> four simple Elements, and of five kinds of perfect compounds. They do now and then distribute
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:52070:237"/>
these three Classes into nine Chambers, whereof the first is of unites, <hi>viz.</hi> intellectual, celestial and elemental: The second is of Twos. The third of Threes, and so of the rest: These Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are framed by the interfection of four paralell lines, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersecting themselves into right angles, as is expressed in this following figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Out of which being dissected into parts, proceed nine particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar figures, <hi>viz.</hi>

shews the first letter of that Chamber; if of two, the second; if of three, the third letter; as if thou wouldest frame the Character <hi>Michael</hi>

               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>There is yet another fashion of Characters, common to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all letters, and tongues, and very easie, which is by the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:52070:238"/>
gathering together of letters; as if the name of the Angel <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> be given, the Characters thereof shall be framed thus.</p>

               <p>And this fashion amongst the Arabians is most received; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is there any writing, which is readily, and elegantly joyned to it self, as the Arabick. Now you must know that Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call spirits, seeing they are of a pure intellect, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incorporeall, are not marked with any marks or Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, and pingible figures, or any other humane signs; but we not knowing their essence, or quality, do from their names, or works, or otherwise, according to our fancies devote and consecrate to them figures, and marks, by which we cannot any way compel them to us, but by which we rise up to them; as not to be known by such Characters, and figures, and first of all we do set our senses both inward and outward, upon them; then by a certain admiration of our reason we are induced to a Religious veneration of them, and then are wrapt with our whole minde into an extaticall adoration, and then with a wonderfull belief, an undoubted hope, quickening love we calling upon them in spirit, and truth, by true names and Characters do obtain from them that vertue, or power which we desire.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXI. <hi>There is yet another fashion of Characters, and concerning marks of spirits which are received only by revelation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is another kind of Character received by Revelation only, which can be found out no other way: the vertue of which Characters is from the diety revealing, of whom there are some secret works, breathing out a harmony of some Divinity: or they are as it were some certain agreements or compacts of a league betwixt us and them. Of this kind there was a mark or sign shewed to <hi>Constantine,</hi> which many did call the Crosse write upon in Latin letters, <hi>In hoc vince i. e.</hi> in this overcome; and there was another revealed to <hi>Antiochus</hi> by Sirname <hi>Soteris</hi> in the figure of a pentangle, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies health; for being resolved into letters it speakes the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>i. e. Health:</hi> in the faith, and vertue of which signes both <hi>Kings</hi> obtain'd a great victorie against their enemies. So <hi>Judas,</hi> who by reason of that was afterward sirnamed <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus,</hi> being to fight with the <hi>Jews</hi> against <hi>Antiochus Eupator,</hi> received from an Angel that notable sign <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the vertue of which they first slew 14000 with an infinite number of Elephant; then again 35000. of their enemies: For that sign did represent the name <hi>Jehovah</hi> and was a memorable emblem of the name of 72. letters by the equality of number, and the exposition thereof is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> Who is there amongst the strong as <hi>Jehovah?</hi> The figures of these me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable signs are to be framed thus.</p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover of those signs and Characters <hi>Porphyrie</hi> speaks in his book <hi>De Responsis,</hi> saying that they did signifie the gods themselves, by whom they did enjoy things, and by which they were called forth, and which were to be offered to them: And did shew the figures of the images what they should be; and that he perceived these things concerning the Oracle of <hi>Proserpina.</hi> He saith moreover that <hi>Hecate</hi> commanded how images should be constituted to her, and that they were to be cirrounded with wormwood, and that domestick mice were to be painted; &amp; the finest ornaments such as were most pleasing to her, and so many mice as her forms were to be taken; then blood, myrrhe, storax, and other things were to be burnt: Which things if they were done, she would appear, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the worker thereof by dreams. But we shall here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>write the Oracle of <hi>Hecate;</hi> for thus she speaks,
<q>
                     <l>Marke I will teach What statue thou shalt make</l>
                     <l>For me; boughs of the wood, and wormwood take,</l>
                     <l>Then garnish it, on't paint domestick mice;</l>
                     <l>Let ornaments be fair, and of great price.</l>
                     <l>Then frankincense, myrrh, storax mix't with blood</l>
                     <l>Of mice; then sing thou words secret and good;</l>
                     <l>As thou seest shapes of mine, so on it lay,</l>
                     <l>As many reall mice; then take the bay,</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="447" facs="tcp:52070:239"/>
And out of th' trunk thereof a case prepare</l>
                     <l>To put it in; then see thou have a care,</l>
                     <l>That to the Statue thou devoutly pray,</l>
                     <l>Also thy debts, and vows take care thou pay;</l>
                     <l>If that these things that here required be,</l>
                     <l>Thou shalt perform, in dreams thou shalt me see.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Such were in old time the secret mysteries of the gods and Demons of the Gentils, by which they did perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be compelled, detained, and bound by men. Hence <hi>Jamblicus,</hi> and <hi>Porphyrie</hi> teach that he that cals upon sacred Demons must observe them, with their proper honour, and to distribute to each what is convenient to every one, as thanks, oblations, gifts, sacrifices, with words, Characters sutable to their conditions, and most like unto them; or elss he should never obtain the presence of the Dieties, and Demons, and the desired effect; Moreover if they were called upon, yet they shall be constrained to hurt them especially who did it neglegently.</p>

               <p>BY the efficacy of Religion the presence of spirits doth dispose the effect, neither can any work of wonderfull efficacy in Religion be done, unless some good spirit the ruler and finisher of the work be there present. Now good spirits, if they may be divers wayes called up, yet can by no bonds, or very hardly be allayed by us, but we must by some sacred things beseech them, as we read in <hi>Apuleius,</hi> by the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall Stars, by the infernall dieties, by the naturall elements, by the silence of the night, by the increase of the Country of <hi>Nilus,</hi> by the secrets of <hi>Memphis</hi> and elsewhere in <hi>Porphyrie:</hi> Thou who art risen out of the mud, who sittest in thy place, who sailest in ships, who every hour dost change thy shape, and

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> these, and such like Symbolicall orations and hymnes, because they are signes of Divine vertues, spirits did sometimes apply themselves to humane uses: not as being compelled by any kind of necessity, but of their own accord, and by a kind of custom did, being overcome by the prayers of them that called on them, more easily yeeld: whence in <hi>Porphyrie</hi> in his book <hi>De Responsis Hecate</hi> saith,
<q>
                     <l>I by thy prayers being overcome</l>
                     <l>Came thither—</l>
                  </q>
And in another place in the same book he saith,
<q>
                     <l>Conquer'd by pray'r the Dieties above</l>
                     <l>Come down on th' earth and future things foreshew.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Also the divining of sutable things works so with mans mind, that good spirits do assist us willingly, and communicate their power and vertue to us, dayly helping us with illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, inspirations, oracles, prophecyings, dreams, miracles, prodigies, divinations, and auguries, and working upon and acting upon our spirits, as images like to them, by framing them by their influences, and making them most like to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves even so far, as that oftentimes our spirit doth as surely work wonderfull things as the Celestiall spirits are wont to do. But evil spirits are overcome by us through the assistance of the good, especially when the petitioner is very pious and devout, and sings forth sacred words, and a horrible speech, as by conjuring the Divine power by the venerable names, and signs of supernaturall powers, by miracles, by Sacraments, by sacred mysteries, and such like; which conjurations, or adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in as much as they are done by the name and power of Religion, and Divine vertue, those evil spirits are afraid of; whence also oftentimes prophane men do bind or allay by such kinde of sacred conjurations, evil spirits, not enduring such things, whence <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his book, <hi>Quod Idola Dii non sint,</hi> saith; that spirits being adjured by the true God do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:52070:240"/>
yeeld to us, and confesse, and are forced to go out of possessed bodies, and either presently leap out, or by degrees vanish, according as the faith of the Patient is helping, or grace of the swearer aspires. And <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his book <hi>De Variis Questionibus</hi> saith that there is no word more terrible and more destructive to the power of Devils then the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 68. Psalm, <hi>Arise O God, and let thine enemies be scattered;</hi> For assoon as that word is spoken, the devill vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away howling. And <hi>Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus</hi> saith, that the naming the name <hi>Jesus</hi> hath oftentimes cast many devils as well out of the souls of men as their bodies, and hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised much power in them out of whom the devils were cast. Also we do oftentimes with threats and revilings bind or repell evil spirits, especially the lesser, as Haggs, <hi>Incubi,</hi> and such like, as we read in <hi>Lucan</hi> concerning that witch saying,
<q>
                     <l>I will now call you up by a true name,</l>
                     <l>The stygian dogs I in the light supreme</l>
                     <l>Will leave, and follow you also through grave,</l>
                     <l>From all the Urnes in death I will you save,</l>
                     <l>Thee O Hecate, unto the gods will shew,</l>
                     <l>(To whom t' addresse thy self in other hew,</l>
                     <l>Thou wast wont) in wan, form and without grace,</l>
                     <l>And thee forbid to change Erebus his face.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And in <hi>Philostratus</hi> we read, when <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and his companions were travelling in a bright Moon-shining night, that the <hi>Phantasme</hi> of a Hagge met them, and some times changed it self into this shape, &amp; some times intothat, and some times vanished out of their sight. Now assoon as <hi>Apollonius</hi> knew what it was, grievously reviling it advised his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to do the like: for he knew that that was the best remedy against such invasions. His companions did as he advised, and the <hi>Phantasme</hi> presently with a noise vanished away like a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: For so fearfull is this kind of spirits, that they are moved, tremble, and are compelled by a feigned terrour, and false and impossible threats. Whence <hi>Chereon</hi> the holy scribe saith
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:52070:241"/>
that these are those things by which especially the spirits are compelled. There is moreover as hath been above said, a certain kind of spirits not so noxious, but most neer to men, so that they are even affected with humane passions, and many of these delight in mans society, and willingly dwell with them: Some of them dote upon women, some upon children, some are delighted in the company of divers domestick and wild animals, some inhabit Woods and Parks, some dwell about fountains and meadows. So the Fairies, and hobgoblins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit Champian fields; the <hi>Naiades</hi> fountains: the <hi>Potamides</hi> Rivers; the <hi>Nymphs</hi> marshes, and ponds: the <hi>Oreades</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; the <hi>Humedes</hi> Meadows; the <hi>Dryades</hi> and <hi>Hamadry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi> the Woods, which also <hi>Satyrs</hi> and <hi>Sylvani</hi> inhabit, the same also take delight in trees and brakes, as do the <hi>Naptae,</hi> and <hi>Agaptae</hi> in flowers: the <hi>Dodonae</hi> in Acorns; the <hi>Paleae</hi> and <hi>Feniliae</hi> in fodder and the Country. He therefore that will call upon them, may easily doe it in the places where their abode is, by alluring them with sweet fumes, with pleasant sounds, and by such instruments as are made of the guts of certain animals and peculiar wood, adding songs, verses, inchantments sutable to it, and that which is especially to be observed in this, the singleness of the wit, innocency of the mind, a firm credulity, and constant silence; wherefore they do often meet children, women, and poor and mean men. They are afraid of and flie from men of a constant, bold, and undaunted mind, being no way offensive to good and pure men, but to wicked and impure, noxious. Of this kind are hobgoblins, familiars, and ghosts of dead men. Hence <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> saith, that the souls of men are sometimes made spirits: and of men well deserving are made familiars which the Greeks call Eudemons, <hi>i. e.</hi> blessed spirits: but of ill deserving men, hags, and hobgoblins, which the Greeks call Cacode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>i. e.</hi> Evil spirits; But they may be called ghosts when it is uncertain whether they have deserved well or ill. Of these apparitions there are divers examples; such was that which <hi>Pliny</hi> the Junior makes mention of concerning the house of <hi>Athenodorus</hi> the Philosopher of <hi>Tharsis</hi> in which there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

with a sudden horrible noise the ghost of an old man.

We must know this that whosoever shall intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectually work in evil spirits, shall by the power of good spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits bind them; but he that shall work only worldlily, shall work to himself judgement and damnation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXIII. <hi>Of the bonds of spirits, and of their adjurations, and castings out.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe bonds by which spirits are bound, besought, or cast out, are three; Some of them are taken from the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall world, as when we adjure a spirit by any inferiour and naturall things of affinity with or adverse to them, in as much as we would call upon or cast them out, as by flowers, and herbs, by animals, by snow, by ice, by hell, by fire, and such like, as these also are oftimes mixed with Divine praises, and blessings and consecrations, as appears in the song of the three Children, and in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> Praise ye the Lord from the heavens, and in the consecration and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the <hi>Paschal taper.</hi> This bond doth work upon the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by an apprehensive vertue under the account of love, or hatred, in as much as the spirits are present with or favour, or abhor any thing that is naturall or against nature, as these things themselves love or hate one the other. Hence that of <hi>Proclus,</hi> As the Lion fears a cock, especially a white cock: so doth a spirit appearing in the form of a lion vanish away at the sight of a cock. The second bond is taken from the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial world, <hi>viz:</hi> when we adjure them by the heaven, by Stars,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:52070:242"/>
by their motions, rayes, light, beauty, clearness, excellency, fortitude, influence, and wonders, and such like: and this bond works upon spirits by way of admonition, and example. It hath also some Command, especially upon the ministring spirits, and those who are of the lowest orders. The third bond is from the Intellectual and divine world, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by religion, that is to say, when we swear by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, by the miracles, by the divine names, by the sacred Seals and other mysteries of Religion; wherefore this bond is the highest of all and the strongest, working upon the spirits by Command and power; But this is to be observed, that as after the universal providence, there is a particular one; and after the universal soul, particular soules; so in the first place we Invocate by the superior bonds, and by the names and powers which rule the things, then by the inferior, and the things themselves; We must know further, that by these bonds not only Spirits, but also all creatures are bound, as Tempests, burnings, flouds, plagues, diseases, force of armes, and every animal, by assuming them, either by the manner of Adjuration, or by the way of deprecation or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, as in the charming of Serpents, besides the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and celestial, by rehearsing out of the mysteries and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the curse of the Serpent in terrestial Paradise, the lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Serpent in the wilderness; moreover by assuming that verse of the Psalm 91. Thou shalt walk upon the Aspe and the Basiliske, and shalt tread upon the Lion and Dragon: Superstition also very much prevaileth in these, by the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of some Sacramental rites to that which we Intend to bind or hinder, as, of Excommunication, burial or exequies for the driving away of diseases, Serpents, Mice or Wormes, which thing we read to have bin thus done in diverse places, and it is wont to be done even as yet.</p>

               <p>AFter the Quires of the blessed spirits, the Animastic al order is the next, which the Hebrew <hi>Theologians</hi> call <hi>Issim,</hi> that is, strong and mighty men; the Magicians of the Gentiles, call <hi>Heroes</hi> and <hi>Demi-gods,</hi> or gods half men: whom <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> an Author not to be contemned, supposeth were so called, either because that for the meanness of their desert they are not judged worthy of Heaven, nor yet are accounted Terrestrical for the reverence of Grace; of this kind in old time were <hi>Priapus, Hippo, Vertumnus;</hi> or because they being eminent in this life for divine vertues, and benefits for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, after this mortal man put off, are translated into the quire of the blessed gods; alwayes providing for mortal men the same vertues and benefits which they long since had in this life: or because they were procreated from the secret seed of the superiors, whom they think were begotten by the mixture of Gods or Angels with men, &amp; therefore obtaining a certain middle nature, so as they are neither Angels nor men: which opinion <hi>Lactantius</hi> also followeth; and there are even at this time who have commerce and conjugall mixture with spirits; and all now believe that <hi>Merline,</hi> a British Prophet, was the son of a Spirit, and born of a virgin: and also they imagined, that <hi>Plato</hi> the Prince of wisdome was born of a virgin, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated by a phantasme of <hi>Apollo.</hi> And it is delivered in Histories, that certain women of the <hi>Gothes</hi> (which they call <hi>Alrumnae)</hi> eminent both for beauty and ingenuity, long since at <hi>Filimire,</hi> or (as others say) at <hi>Idanthresie,</hi> going forth out of the tents of the King of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> wandred in the desarts of <hi>Scythia</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> beyond the Marshes of <hi>Meotis,</hi> and there being Impregnated by <hi>Fanni</hi> and <hi>Satyres,</hi> brought forth the first <hi>Hunni;</hi> more over <hi>Psellus</hi> is the Author, that Spirits sometimes cast forth seed, from the which certain little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

arise: Therefore these <hi>Heroes</hi> have no less, power in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing and ruling these inferior things, than the Gods and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and have both their offices and their dignities distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them: and therefore to them no otherwise than to the Gods themselves were <hi>Temples, Images, Altars, Sacrifices, Vows,</hi> and other mysteries of religion dedicated. And their names invocated had divine and magical vertues for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing of some miracles: which thing <hi>Eusebius</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that many tried by the invocation of the name of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> of <hi>Tyana;</hi> and more of this kinde we read of, both in the Poets, and also in the <hi>Historians</hi> and <hi>Philosophers,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Hercules, Atlas, Aesculapius</hi> and the other <hi>Heroes</hi> of the Gentiles; but these are the follies of the Gentiles; but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our holy <hi>Heroes</hi> we beleve that they excel in divine power, and that the soul of the <hi>Meschihae</hi> doth rule over them (as the <hi>Theologians</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> also testify) that is Jesus Christ, who by divers of his Saints, as it were by members fitted for this purpose, doth administer and distribute divers gifts of his grace in these inferior parts, and every one of the Saints do enjoy a peculiar gift of working. Whence they being implored by us with divers prayers and supplications accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manifold distribution of graces, every one doth most freely bestow their gifts, benefits, and graces on us much more readily, truly, &amp; also more abundantly than the Angelical powers, by how much they are nigher to us, and more allyed to our natures, as they who in times past were both men, and suffered humane affections and infirmities; and their names, degrees and offices are more known unto us; Therefore out of the number of these almost Infinite, there are twelve chief, <hi>viz.</hi> the twelve Apostles of <hi>Christ,</hi> who (as the evangelical truth saith (sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel, who in the Revelations are distributed upon twelve foundations, at the twelve gates of the heavenly City, who rule the twelve Signs, and are sealed in the twelve pretious Stones, and the whole world is distributed to them; but their true names are these; the first <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="456" facs="tcp:52070:244"/>
the counsels of the gods, but in the midst he Judgeth the gods; and a little after, I have said ye are all gods, and sons of the most high; moreover he hath commanded concerning the worshipping and reverencing of them, decreeing tithes and first fruits for them, and giving them the power of the sword, and forbidding any to curse them, and commanding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be yielded to them, though wicked. Hence all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity called their princes gods, and worshipped them as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine powers, as <hi>Janus</hi> testifieth in <hi>Ovid,</hi> in his first book of <hi>Fasti</hi> saying.,
<q>
                     <l>When th' earth of th' Gods was potent, I did raign</l>

               </p>
               <p>And Divine <hi>Plato</hi> in his third book <hi>de Republica</hi> appointed that princes both alive and dead should be celebrated with divine honors, which Institution hath ben received amongst all Nations, even from the first age, <hi>viz.</hi> to deify their princes with divine honours, and to consecrate them with eternall memory; Hence they did impose their never dying names on Cities, Provinces, Mountains, Rivers, Lakes, Ilands and Seas; And dedicated to them with great pomp, Piramides, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losses, triumphal Arches, Trophies, Statues, Temples, Plays, Feasts; and also called the Heavens, Stars, Dyaes and Months by their names. Hence <hi>January</hi> from <hi>Janus, July</hi> from <hi>Julius, August</hi> from <hi>Augustus;</hi> so <hi>dies Mercurii</hi> from <hi>Mercury Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megist Dies Jovis</hi> from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which custome we read was observed not only by the <hi>Aegyptians Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> but also by the extream barbarous people, as <hi>Gothes, Danes</hi> and <hi>Teutones.</hi> Hence <hi>Saxo Grammaticus</hi> being witness, what day the former call <hi>Dies Mercurii,</hi> these do call <hi>Othines</hi> day: what day the former name from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> these call <hi>Thors</hi> day, from <hi>Othin</hi> and <hi>Thor</hi> in times past Kings of <hi>Gotland</hi> and <hi>Denmark;</hi> neither are they for any other reason called <hi>Gothes,</hi> then that they callin their language their cheifest god <hi>Got.</hi> Hence also the Dutch are thus called, because they named the god <hi>Mars,</hi> whom they worshipped, <hi>Teutan;</hi> by which name the Gaules
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:52070:244"/>
also called <hi>Mercury.</hi> Therefore are Kings and Priests (if they be Just) companions of the gods, and endowed with the like power. Hence they cure diseases by their touch and word and sometimes command the times and the Heavens, as <hi>Virgil,</hi> sang of <hi>Augustus,</hi>
                  <q>

               <p>And the Scripture testifieth of <hi>Joshuah,</hi> who fighting in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> commanded the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> saying, <hi>Sun</hi> stand still in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and thou <hi>Moon</hi> in the Valley of <hi>Ajalon;</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> stood still at his command, neither did the <hi>Sun</hi> set in the space of one day, untill he had revenged himself of his Enemies, and the Lord obeyed the voyce of man; Also <hi>Moses</hi> divided the red Sea, and <hi>Joshua Jordan,</hi> and led the people over dry shod; The like did <hi>Alexander</hi> the Macedonian, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth his Army; Sometimes also they are endowed with a prophetick spirit, as we read of <hi>Chaiaphas</hi> in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he prophesied, for that he was High Priest that year: Seeing therefore it is so that the Lord of the Earth would that Kings and Priests be called gods by communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of name and power, surely we ought also to deserve well of them, and to prefer their Judgments before ours, and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to obey, supplicate and adore, and worship with all kinde of worship and reverence the most high God in them.</p>

               <p>THe most abundant God (as <hi>Trismegistus</hi> saith) hath framed two Images like himself, <hi>viz.</hi> the world and man, that in one of these he might sport himself with certain wonderfull operations: but in the other, that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his delights, who seeing he is one, hath created the world one, seeing that he is infinite, hath created the world round
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:52070:245"/>
seeing he is eternall, he hath created the world incorruptible and everlasting: seeing he is Immense, he hath created the world the greatest of all things; seeing he is the chiefest life, he hath adorned the world with vitall seeds, begetting all things out of himself; and seeing he is omnipotent, by his will alone, not by any necessity of nature, he hath created the world, not out of any foregoing matter, but out of nothing; and seeing he is the chief goodness, embracing his word, which is the first Idea of allthings, with his choisest will, and essentiall love, he hath fabricated this externall world after the example of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, <hi>viz.</hi> Ideall world, yet sending forth nothing of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the <hi>Idea,</hi> but created of nothing that which he had from eternity by the <hi>Idea:</hi> God also created man after his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; for as the world is the Image of God, so man is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the world. Hence some think that it is spoken, that man is not created simply the Image of God, but after the Image, or the Image of the Image; therefore he is called <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosme,</hi> that is the lesser world; The world is a Rationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Immortall'; man in like manner is rationall but mortal, that is, dissolvable; for (as <hi>Hermes</hi> saith) seeing the world it self is immortall, it is Impossible that any part of it can perish. Therefore to dye, is a vain name, and even as <hi>Vacuum</hi> is no where, so also Death; Therefore we say a man dieth, when his Soul and body are separated, not that any thing of them perisheth or is turned into nothing. Notwithstanding the true Image of God is his word. The wisdome, life, light and Truth existing by himself, of which Image mans soul is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, in regard of which we are said to be made after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, not after the Image of the world, or of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for as God cannot be touched, nor perceived by the ears, nor seen with the eyes; so the soul of man can neither bee seen, heard nor touched. And as God himself is infinite, and cannot be compelled by any, so also the minde of man is free, and cannot be enforced or bounded. Further, as God comprehendeth this whole world, and whatsoever is in it in his minde alone; so mans minde comprehendeth it even in thought; and that which is peculiar to him alone with God, as
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:52070:245"/>
God moveth and governeth all this world by his beck alone, so mans minde ruleth and governeth his body Therefore it was necessary, that the minde of man thus sealed by the word of God, should put on also the corporeall man, after the most compleat example of the world: Therefore man is called the other world, and the other Image of God, because he hath in himself All that is contained in the greater world, so that there remaineth nothing which is not found even truly and really in man himself, and all these things do perform the same duties in him, as in the great world: There are in him the four Elements, with the most true proprieties of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in him an ethereal body, the Chariot of the soul in proportion corresponding to the Heaven: There are in him the vegetative life of Plants, the senses of animals, of celestial spirits, the Angelical reason, and the Divine understanding, and the true conjunction, and divine possession of all these things flowing together into one. Hence in sacred Letters man is called every creature, and not onely man being made another world doth comprehend all the parts thereof in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self but also doth receive and contain even God himself. Hence <hi>Xystus</hi> the Pythagorian, saith, that the soul of man is the temple of God: which thing <hi>Paul</hi> also more clearly expressed, saying, ye are the Temple of God; &amp; the same the sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture testifieth in many places: Therefore man is the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Image of God, seing man conteineth in himself all things which are in God: but God by a certain eminency contemeth all things through his power, &amp; simply, as the cause and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all things; but he hath given this power to man that he should in like manner contein all things, but by a certain act &amp; composition, as the knot, tye, and bond of all things: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man only rejoyceth in this honor, that he hath a simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with all, operation with all and conversation with all: He Symbolizeth with the matter in a proper subject; with the Elements in a fourfold body; with Plants in a vegetative vertue; with animals in a sensitive faculty; with the Heavens in an Etherial spirit, and influx of the superior parts on the inferiour: with the Angels in understanding and wisdome;

with God, in conteining all things: He is preserved with God, and the Intelligences, by faith and wisdome: with the heavens and heavenly things, by reason and discourse: with all Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our things, by sense and Dominion: and acteth with all, and hath power on all, even on God himself, by knowing and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him; and as God knoweth all things, so also man can know all things Intelligible, seeing he hath for an adequate Object, <hi>Ens</hi> in general, or (as others say) Truth it self; neither is there any thing found in man, nor any disposition, in which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of divinity may not shine forth; neither is there any thing in God, which may not also be represented in man: Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore shall know himself, shall know all things in himself; especially he shall know God, according to whose Image he was made; he shall know the world, the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of which he beareth; he shall know all creatures, with which he Symbolizeth; and what comfort he can have and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, from Stones, Plants, Animals, Elements, Heavens, from Spirits, Angels, and every thing, and how all things may be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for all things, in their time, place, order, measure, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Harmony, and can draw and bring to himself, even as a Loadstone Iron; And <hi>Geber</hi> in his summ of <hi>Alchimy</hi> teacheth, that no man can come to the perfection of this art, who shall not know the principles of it in himself; but by how much the more every one shall know himself, by so much he obtaineth the greater power of attracting it, and by so much operateth greater and more wonderfull things, and will ascend to so great perfection, that he is made the Son of God, and is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into that Image which is God, and is united with him, which is not graunted to Angels, the world, or any creature, but to man only, <hi>viz.</hi> to have power to be made the Son of God, and to be united to him: but man being united to God, all things which are in man, are united, especially his minde, then his spirits and animal powers, and vegetative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and the Elements are to the matter, drawing with it self even the body, whose form it hath been, leading it forth into a better condition, and an heavenly nature, even untill it be glorified into Immortality. And this which we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:52070:246"/>
is the peculiar gift of man, to whom this dignity of the divine image is proper, and common to no other creature: But there are some <hi>Theologians,</hi> who make those powers of mans memory, understanding, will, the image of the Divine trinity; and there are who going further, do place this image not only in these three faculties which they call first acts, but also in the second acts; And as the memory representeth the father, the understanding the son, the will the Holy Ghost; So also the word produced from our understanding, and love flowing from our will, and the understanding it self having a present object and producing it, do set forth the son, spirit and father; and the more mysterious <hi>Theologians</hi> teach that moreover all our members do represent something in God whose image they bear; and that even in our passions we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present God, but by a certain Analogy: for in the holy word we read of the wrath, fury, repentance, complacency, love, hatred, pleasure, delectation, delight, indignation of God, and such like, and we have above spoken something of the members of God, which may be congruent here; Also <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Trismegistus</hi> confessing the divine Trinity, describeth it understanding, life and brightness, which elsewhere he calleth the word, the minde and the spirit, and saith that man made after the image of God, doth represent the same Trinity; for there is in him an understanding minde, a verifying word, and a spirit, as it were a Divine brightness diffusing it self on every side, replenishing all things, moving and knitting them together: but this is not to be understood of the naturall spirit which is the middle by the which the soul is united with the flesh and the body, by the which the body liveth and acteth, and one member worketh on another, of the which spirit we have spoken in the first book. But we here speak of the naturall spirit, which yet in some sort is also corporeall, notwithstanding it hath not agrosse body, tangible and visible, but a most subtile body and easie to be united with the mind <hi>viz.</hi> that superiour and Divine one which is in us; neither let any one wonder, if we say that the rationall soul is that spirit, and a corporeall thing,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:52070:247"/>
or that it either hath or savoureth something of corporiety while it is in the body and useth it as an instrument, if so be that ye shall understand, what, amongst the <hi>Platonists,</hi> that Etheriall body of the soul, and chariot of the same may be; therefore <hi>Plotine</hi> and all the <hi>Platonists,</hi> after <hi>Trismegist,</hi> in like manner, place three things in man, which they call the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, lowest and middle: The Supreme is that Divine thing which they call the mind, or superiour portion, or illuminated intellect. <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Genesis</hi> calleth it the breath of life, <hi>viz.</hi> breath from God or his spirit inspired into us; The lowest is the <hi>Sensitive</hi> soul which they also call an Image: <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle nameth it the Animall man. The middle is the reasonable spirit knitting and tying together both extreams, <hi>viz.</hi> the Animal soul with the mind savouring of the nature of both extreams: yet it differeth from that Supream which is called the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated intellect, the mind, light and supream portion; it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth also from the Animall soul, from the which, the <hi>Apostle</hi> teacheth us, that we ought to separate it, by the power of the word of God, saying, the word of God is lively and powerfull, more penetrating then a twoedged sword, peircing even to the dividing of the soul and spirit: for as that supream por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never sinneth, never consenteth to evil, and alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth errour and exhorteth to the best things; so that inferior portion and Animall soul is alwayes overwhelmed in evil, in sin and concupiscence, and draweth to the worst things, of the which <hi>Paul</hi> saith, I see another Law in my members, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me captive to the law of sin: The minde therefore the supream portion is never damned; but when its companions are to be punished, goeth away unhurt into its Originall: But the spirit, which by <hi>Plotinus</hi> is called the reasonable soul, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is by its nature, free, and can according to his pleasure adhere to either of them, if it constantly adhere to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour portion, is at length united and beautified with it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be assumed into God: if it adhere unto the inferior soul, it is depraved, and becomes vitious, untill it be made a wicked spirit. But thus much concerning the mind and spirit: now let us see concerning the speech or word. <hi>Mercurius</hi> thinketh this
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:52070:247"/>
of the same value for immortality: for speech or word is that without which nothing is done or can be done; for it is the expression of the expressor and of the thing expressed; and the speaking of the speaker, and that which speaketh, is speech or word: and the conception of the conceiver and that which conceiveth, is the word: and the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the writer and that which writeth, is the word: and the forming of the former and that which formeth, is the word; and the creation of the Creator, and that which createth is the word: and the doing of the doer, and that which is done is the word: and the knowledge of him that knoweth and the thing knowen is the word; and every thing that can be spoken is but a word, and its called equality: for it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth it self equally towards all; seeing that it is not one thing more then another, equally bestowing on all, that they may be, that which they are, neither more nor lesse; and it self being sensible, doth make it self and all things sensible, as light ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it self &amp; all things visible; therefore the word is called by <hi>Mercurius</hi> the bright son of the mind; for the conception by the which the mind conceiveth it self, is the intrinsecall word generated from the mind <hi>viz.</hi> the knowledge of it self: But the extrinsecall and vocall word, is the of-spring and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of that word, and a spirit proceeding out of the mouth with sound and voice, signifying something: but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry voice of ours, speech and word unlesse it be formed by the voice of God, is mingled with the air and vanisheth; but the spirit and word of the Lord remaineth, life and sense accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it. Therefore all our speech, words, spirit and voice have no power in Magick, unless they be formed by the divine word: &amp; <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself in his Meteors, and in the end of his Ethicks confesseth, that there is not any vertue either natural or morall, unless through God; &amp; in his secret tenents, he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that our understanding being good and sound can do very much on the secrets of nature if so be that the influence of the Divine power be present, otherwise nothing at all: So also our words can do very many miracles, if they be formed by the word of God, in which also our universall generation is
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:52070:248"/>
perfected, as <hi>Isay</hi> saith, by thy countenance O Lord we have conceived, as women rightly conceive by the countenance of their husbands, and have brought forth spirit. Hither in some sort belongeth that which is delivered by the <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> of the <hi>Indians, viz.</hi> that <hi>Budda</hi> a prince of this opinion, brought forth a virgin out of his side; and amongst the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans</hi> there is a constant opinion, that many, whom in their tongues they call <hi>Nefesohli,</hi> are born by a certain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult manner of Divine dispensation without carnall copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whose life is therefore wonderfull and impassible and as it were Angelical and all together supernaturall; but these triffles we leave; only the King <hi>Messias,</hi> the word of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, made flesh, Christ Jesus hath revealed this secret, and will further manifest it at a certain fulness of time: therefore a mind very like to himself (as <hi>Lazarillus</hi> sang in <hi>Crater</hi> of <hi>Hermes.)</hi>

               <p>THe soul of man is a certain divine Light, created after the image of the word, the cause of causes and first example, and the substance of God, figured by a seal whose Character is the eternall word; also the soul of man is a certain divine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, individuall and wholly present in every part of the body, so produced by an incorporeall Author, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth by the power of the Agent only, not by the bosome of the matter: The soul is a substantiall number, uniform, conversive unto it self, and rationall, very far excelling all bodies and materiall things; the partition of which is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the matter, nor proceeding from inferiour and grosser things, but from the efficient cause: For it is not a quantitative number, but removed from all corporeall Laws, whence it is not divided nor multiplyed by parts. Therefore the soul of man is a certain divine substance, flowing from a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine fountain, carrying along with it self number: not that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine one by the which the creator hath disposed all things, but a rational number by the which seeing it hath a proportion to all things, it can understand all things: Therefore mans soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such, according to the opinion of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeding from God, is joyned by competent means to this grosser body; whence first of all in its descent, it is involved in a Celestiall and aeriall body, which they call the celestiall vehicle of the soul, others the chariot of the soul: Through this middle thing, by the command of God who is the center of the world, it is first infused into the middle point of the heart, which is the center of mans body, and from thence it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fufed through all the parts and members of his body, when it joyneth his chariot to the naturall heat, being a spirit generat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the heart by heat; by this it plungeth it self into the humours, by the which it inhereth in all the members, and to all these is made equally the nighest, although it be diffused
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:52070:249"/>
through one to another; even as the heat of fire adhereth most nigh to the air and water, although it be transferred by the air to the water; thus it is manifest, how the immortal soul, by an immortall body, <hi>viz.</hi> an Etheriall vehicle, is included in a grosse and mortall body, but when by a disease or some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, these midle things are dissolved or fail, then the soul it self by these middle things recollecteth it self, and floweth back into the heart which was the first receptacle of the soul: but the spirit of the heart failing, and heat being extinct, it leaveth him, and man dieth, and the soul flieth away with this Celestiall vehicle, and the <hi>Genius</hi> his keeper and the Demon follow it being gone forth, and carry it to the Judge, where sentence being pronounced, God quietly leadeth forth the good souls to glory: the evil the fierce devill draggeth to punishment.</p>

From the Thrones, we are knit together, and being collected into our selves, we fix our memory on those eternall visions: From the Cherubins, is light of mind, power of wisdom, very high plantasies and figures, by the which we are able to contemplate even the divine things; From the Seraphins, that by the perfect flame of love we may at length inhere in them: These are the degrees, these the ladders, by the which men easily ascend to all kinds of powers by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain naturall connexion and chariot, according to the diverse disposition of body and mind, and by the favour of the Stars, in the disposing of the body, and of the Intelligences ruling them, the nature of which the soul in its descense putteth on, even as light the colour of the glasse, through which it passeth; the supream power of the Creator favouring, from whom is all good, and without which no good nor perfect thing can be obtained; Therefore all those do labour in vain, who trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only on the course of nature, and the power and favour of inferiour things, do think to attain to divine things; and those who faining to have a foot in the heavens, do endeavour to receive those things from the favour of the heavens, which ought to be received from God alone; for these inferiours have, I mean animals, Herbs, stones, metals, their power subservient to the heaven; but the heaven from the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences; but these from God, in whom all things pre-exist in the greatest power; as in man the little world there is not a member which hath not correspondence with some element, plant, intelligence, and with some measure and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Archetype: as we have shewen before.</p>

lascivious loves and filthy lusts: <hi>Mercury</hi> deceits, cousenages, lyes, subtile desires of evill, propensity to sin; The <hi>Moon</hi> the inconstant progress of all things, and whatsoever is contrary to mans nature: and by this means man himself by reason of his unlikeness with the heavenly things receiveth hurt, whence he ought to reap benefit: by reason of the same dissonancy with the heavenly things (as <hi>Proclus</hi> saith) men also are subjected even to wicked spirits who as the officers of God do discharge themselves in punishing them: Then do they suffer grievances by evill spirits, even untill they are again expiated by due pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and man returneth to a divine nature: therefore an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Magitian can prohibite many mischifes about to fall on him from the disposition of the Stars, when he foreknoweth their nature by preventing, taking heed, and defending, least they should meet him, and least an ill disposed subject, as we have said, should receive hurt whence it ought to reap benefit.</p>

                  <hi>That on every man a divine Character is imprinted, by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which man can attain the working of miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BY no small experience it is found that a certain power of ruling and pred ominating is implanted in man by nature; for <hi>(Pliny</hi> testifieth) that an Elephant meeting a man wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in a desart, is reported to shew himself gentle and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and to shew the way to him; and the same creature also is said, before he seeth man, to tremble, to stand still, to look about, to quake at the steps of man, for fear of treachery: in like manner the Tiger the most fierce of all beasts, at the sight of man doth remove her yong ones; and more of this kinde we read in divers authors, who have writ great volumes of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but from whence do these animals know, that man is to be feared, whom they never saw: and if they have seen and known, whence do they fear him seeing they do excell-him in greatnes, force and swiftnes? what is this nature of man, striking this terror on wild beasts? all the Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:52070:252"/>
of animals do finde out and grant this, but have left to others to teach and prove it. Concerning this therefore <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Tyaneus</hi> (as we read in <hi>Philostartus)</hi> seeing a child lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge Elephant, answered <hi>Damus</hi> asking him, whence came that obedience of so huge a Creature to the little child: That it was from a certain active terror, implanted in man by his creator, which inferiour creatures and all animals percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving do fear and reverence man, which is as it were a terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character, and a seal of God imprinted on man, by the which every thing is subject to him, and acknowledges him superior, whither it be servant or animal. For otherwise nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could a child rule his herd and Elephants, neither could a King terrify his people, nor the Judge the guilty. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Character is imprinted on man from the divine <hi>Idea</hi> which the Cabalists of the Hebrew call <hi>Pahad</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and the left hand or sword of God: furthermore man hath not only a seal by the which he is feared, but also by the which he is be loved, the <hi>Idea</hi> of which in the divine numerations is called <hi>Hesed</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which signifieth Clemency, &amp; the right hand and Scepter of God: from these divine numerations, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences and Stars, Seals and Characters are imprinted on us to every one according to his capacity and purity: which signes the first man created, without doubt did possess in all integrity and fulness, when all creatures being attracted by secret gentlenes, and subjected by terror, came to him as to their lord, that he might give them names: but after the sin of prevarication he fell from that dignity with all his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; yet that Character is not all together extinct in us. But by how much every one is laden with sin, by so much he is farther off from these divine Characters and receiveth less of them; and whence he ought to receive frendship and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, he falleth into the slavery and terror of others, both of animals and also men and devils: which <hi>Cain</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving feared, saying to God, every one who findeth me, will kill me; for he feared beasts and devils, not only men, who were very few; but in the old times, many men who lived innocently, a very good life, as yet did enjoy that obedience

and power, as <hi>Sampson, David</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> over the Lions, <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha</hi> over the Bear, <hi>Paul</hi> over the Viper; and many <hi>Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> lived in the deserts, in Caves and Dens of wild beasts, not fearing, nor receiving any hurt; for as by sin that divine Character is obscured, so sin being purged and expiated, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain more and more shineth forth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLI. <hi>What concerning man after death, diverse Opinions.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN generall it is appointed for all men once to dye; death is fatall to all; but one is naturall, another violent, another voluntarily received, another inflicted by humane lawes for offences, or by God for sin, that they seem not to have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a due to nature, but a punishment for sins; which (as the Hebrew Masters saith) God remitteth to none; Whence the Assembly delivered to <hi>Ezechiah,</hi> that after the house of the Sanctuary was pulled down, although there remained not any order of judiciary execution, yet there should be a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold kind of punishment by the which they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that no man guilty of death should escape without retaliation; for he which had deserved to be stoned to death, was, God dispensing, either cast down headlong from the house, or trodden in peeces by wild beasts, or overwhelmed by ruine or fall; but he which had deserved to be burned, was either consumed by burnings, or finished his life either by venemous bitings, or stings of a serpent, or by poyson; but he which should dye by the sword, was killed either by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the jurisdiction, or by the tumult of the people or faction, or by the treachery of thieves; he that ought to be hanged, was suffocated either in the waters, or extinguished by some other strangling punishment; and by the ground of this doctrine, that great <hi>Origen</hi> supposed the Gospel of Christ to be declared, He who useth the sword shall perrish by sword. Moreover the Ethnick Philosophers pronounced that
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:52070:253"/>
retaliation of this kinde is <hi>Adrastia, viz.</hi> an inevitable power of divine laws, by the which in courses to come, is recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to every one according to the reason and merits of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life; so as he who uniustly ruled in the former life, in the other life should relapse into a servile state; he which hath pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted his hands with blood, should be compelled to undergo retaliation; he that lived a brutish life, should be precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and revolved into a brutish body; of these things <hi>Plotinus</hi> writeth in his book of the proper <hi>Genius</hi> of every one; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whosoever have kept humane propriety, do again arise men: but whosoever have used sense only, do return brute animals: yet so, as those who use sense especially together with wrath, do arise wild beasts; but whosoever use sense by concupiscence and pleasure, do return leacherous and glutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous beasts: but if they shall live, not by sense together with them, so much as by the degeneration of sense, plants grow up again with them; for the vitals only, or chiefly, are living; &amp; all their care was that they might be turned into plants. But they which have lived being too much allured by musick, not being depraved in other things, are born again musical animals; and they which have raigned without reason, become Eagles, unles they have been tainted with any wickedness. But he which hath lived civilly and vertuously, returnes a man. And <hi>Solomon</hi> himself in the Proverbs calls man sometimes a Lion, Tiger, Bear, a Boare. Sometimes a Hare, a hunting dog, a Cony; sometimes a Pismire, a Hedghog, a Serpent, a Spider; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an Eagle, a Stork, a Cock, or any other bird, and many such as these. But the <hi>Cabalists</hi> of the Hebrews do not admit that souls are turned into brutes: Yet they do not deny but that they that have wholly lost their reason, shall in an other life be left to a brutish affection and imagination: they assert also that souls are revolved hither thrice, and no more; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this number seems sufficiently to suffice for the purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins, according to that of <hi>Job,</hi> He hath delivered my soul that it should not proceed to death, but should live, and and see the light. Behold all these things doth God work three times through each, that he might reduce their souls from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:52070:253"/>
and illuminate them with the light of the living. But now let us see what the Ancients opinion is concerning the dead. When man dies, his body returnes into the earth, from which it was taken: the spirit returnes to the heavens, from whence, it descended, as saith the Preacher, The body returnes to the earth from whence it was, &amp; the spirit returnes to God that gave it; which <hi>Lucretius</hi> hath expressed in these verses;
<q>
                     <l>What came from earth to earth returnes again;</l>
                     <l>What came from God, returnes from whence it came.</l>
                  </q>
But <hi>Ovid</hi> expresseth it better in these verses.
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Four things of man there are; Spirit, Soul, Ghost, Flesh;</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>These four fowre places keep and do posess.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>The earth covers flesh, the Ghost hovers o're the grave.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Orcus <hi>hath the soul, Stars do the spirit crave;</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The flesh being forsaken, &amp; the body being defunct of life, is called a dead Carkass; Which as say the divines of the Hebrews, is left in the power of the Demon <hi>Zazel,</hi> of whom it is said in the Scripture, <hi>Thou shalt eat dust all thy daies;</hi> and els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>The dust of the earth is his bread.</hi> Now man was created of the dust of the earth, whence also that Demon is called the lord of flesh, and blood, whilest the body is not expiated and sanctified with due solemnities. Hence not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause the <hi>Ancients</hi> ordained expiations of Carkasses, that that which was unclean might be sprinkled with holy water, perfumed with incense, be conjured with sacred orations, have lights set by, as long as it was above ground, and then at length be buried in a holy place. Hence <hi>Elpenor</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> Ibeseech thee (saith he) <hi>Ulysses,</hi> be mindful of mee, and leave mee not unburied, lest being unburied I become an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Gods wrath. But the spirit of a man, which is of a sacred nature, and divine-offspring; because it is alwais fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, becomes uncapable of any punishment; But the soul if it hath done well, rejoyceth together with the spirit, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth with its Aerial Chariot, passeth freely to the quires
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:52070:254"/>
of the <hi>Heroes,</hi> or reacheth heaven, where it enjoys all its senses, and powers, a perpetuall blessed felicity, a perfect knowledge of all things, as also the divine vision, and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the kingdom of heaven, and being made partaker of the divine power bestows freely divers gifts upon these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors, as if it were an immortal God. But if it hath done ill, the spirit judgeth it, and leaves it to the pleasure of the divel, and the sad soul wanders about Hell without a spirit, like an image, as <hi>Dido</hi> complaines in <hi>Virgil;</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>And now the great image of mee shall go</l>
                     <l>Under the earth—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore then this soul being voyde of an intelligible es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and being left to the power of a furious phantasy, is ever subjected by the torment of corporeall qualities, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is by the just judgement of God, for ever deprived of the divine vision (to which it was created) for its sins: the absence of which divine vision, as the Scripture testifies, is the ground of all evils, and the most greivous punishment of all, which the Scripture calls the pouring down of the wrath of God. This image therefore of the soul enters into the ghost as an <hi>Aerial</hi> body, with which being covered doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times advise freinds, sometimes stir up enemies, as <hi>Dido</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens <hi>Aeneas</hi> in <hi>Virgil</hi> saying.
<q>I ll hunt thee, and thee tortures I will give.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For when the soul is separated from the body, the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of the memory and sense remain. The <hi>Platonists</hi> say, that the souls, especially of them that are slain, stir up ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, mans indignation not so much doing of it, as the divine <hi>Nemesis</hi> and Demon foreseeing, and permitting of it. So the spirit of <hi>Naboth</hi> (as the masters of the Hebrews interpret it) because in the end of its life it went forth with a desire of revenge, was made, to execute revenge, the spirit of a lye, and went forth, God permitting it, a lying spirit in the mouth of
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:52070:254"/>
all the prophets, untill it made <hi>Achab</hi> go up unto <hi>Ramoth-Gilead</hi> And <hi>Virgil</hi> himselfe together with the <hi>Pythagorians,</hi> and <hi>Platonists,</hi> to whom also our <hi>Austin</hi> assents, confesseth that separated souls retain the fresh memory of those things which they did in this life, and their will, whence he sings;
<q>
                     <l>What care they Living had of horses brave</l>
                     <l>And Arms, the same doth follow them to th' grave.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Agazel</hi> in his book <hi>De Scientia Divina,</hi> and other <hi>Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Mahumatists</hi> which were Philosophers, think that the operations of the soul, being common to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned body, impresse upon the soul a Character of use and exercise, which it being separated will use, being strongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to the like operations and passions which were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed in life time. And although the body and organ be corrupted, yet the operation will not cease, but like affections and dispositions will remain. And these souls the ancients call with a common name <hi>Manes,</hi> whereof those that were in this life innocent, and purifyed by morall vertues, were very happy; And of them as Virgil sings,
<q>
                     <l>—That did for their country die,</l>
                     <l>With priests who in their lives vow'd chastity,</l>
                     <l>And sacred Poets, who pleas'd Phoebus best,</l>
                     <l>Or by invented arts mans life assist,</l>
                     <l>And others in their memories renowned,—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Although they departed this life without the justification of faith, and grace, as may Divines think, yet their souls were carryed without any suffering into happy pleasant fields; and as saith Virgil,
<q>
                     <l>They went to places and to pleasant greens,</l>
                     <l>And pleasant seats the pleasant groves between.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Where they enjoy certain wonderfull pleasures, as also
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:52070:255"/>
sensitive, intellectuall and revealed knowledge; also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they may be indoctrinated concerning faith, and justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as those spirits long since to whom Christ preached the Gospel in prison. For as it is certain that none can be saved without the faith of Christ, so it is probable that this faith is preached to many Pagans and Saracens after this life, in those receptacles of souls unto salvation, and that they are kept in those receptacles, as in a common prison, untill the time comes when the great Judge shall examine our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To which opinion <hi>Lactantius, Ireneus, Clemens, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Austin, Ambrose,</hi> and many more Christian writers do assent. But those souls which are impure, incontinent, depart wicked, do not enjoy such happy dreams, but wander full of most hideous Phantasmes, and in worser places, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying no free knowledge but what is obtained by conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or manifestation, and with a continuall fleshly desire are subjected by reason of their corporeall corruption to the sense of pain, and fear swords, and knives. These without doubt <hi>Homer</hi> seemed to be sensible of, when in the eleventh book of his <hi>Odysses</hi> he brings in the mother of <hi>Ulysses</hi> being dead, standing neer to him offering sacrifice, but neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, or speaking to him, whilst he with his sword drawn did keep off ghosts from the blood of the sacrifice. But after that <hi>Tyresia</hi> the prophetess advising of her, she had tasted of the sacrifice, and had drunk the blood, she presently knew her son, and crying spake to him. But the soul of <hi>Tyresia</hi> the prophetesse, notwithstanding the drawn sword, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she tasted the bloud, knew <hi>Ulysses,</hi> and spake to him, and shewed him the ghost of his mother standing neer to him. Whatsoever vices therefore souls have committed in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies unexpiated in this life, they are constrained carrying the habits of them along with them, to purge themselves of them in hell, and to undergo punishment for them; which the Poet explains in these verses;
<q>
                     <pb n="479" facs="tcp:52070:255"/>
                     <l>—When they die,</l>
                     <l>Then doth not leave them all their misery.</l>
                     <l>They having not repented of their crimes,</l>
                     <l>Must now be punish d for their mispent times.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For as the manners and habits of men are in this life, such affections for the most part follow the soul after death, which then calls to mind those things which it did formerly do in its life, and then more intently thinks on them, for as much as then the divers offices of life cease, as those of nourishing, growing, generating, and various occupations of senses, and humane affairs and comforts, and obstacles of a grosser body. Then are represented to the plantastick reason those species, which are so much the more turbulent and furious, by how much in such souls there lies hid an intellectuall spark more or lesse covered, or altogether extinct into which are then by evil spirits conveyed species either most false, or terrible: whence now it is tormented in the concupiscile faculty, by the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence of an imaginary good, or of those things which it did formerly affect in its life time, being deprived of the power of enjoying them, although it may seem to it self some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times almost to obtain its delights, but to be driven from them by the evil spirits into bitter torments, as in the Poets, <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus</hi> from a banquet, <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> from embraces, <hi>Midas</hi> from gold, <hi>Sisyphus</hi> from power; and they called these souls hobgoblins, whereof if any taking care of houshold affairs lives and inhabits quietly in the house, it is called a houshold god, or familiar. But they are most cruelly tortured in the irascible saculty with the hatred of an imaginary evil, into the perturbations whereof, as also false suspitions, and most horrible Phantasmes they then fall, and there are represented to them sad representations; sometimes of the heaven falling upon their head, sometimes of being consumed by the violence of flames, sometimes of being drowned in a gulfe, sometimes of being swallowed up into the earth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of being changed into divers kinds of beasts sometimes of being torn and devoured by ugly monsters, sometimes of
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:52070:256"/>
being carried abroad, through woods seas, fire, air, and through fearfull infernall places, and sometimes of being taken, and tormented by devils. All which we conceive happens to them after death no otherwise then in this life to those who are taken with a phrensie, and some other melancholy distemper, or to those who are affrighted with horrible things seen in dreams, and are thereby tormented, as if these things did really happen to them, which truely are not reall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> but only species of them apprehended in imagination: even so do hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible representations of sins terrifie those souls after death as if they were in a dream and the guilt of wickedness drives them headlong through divers places; which therefore <hi>Orpheus</hi> calls the people of dreams, saying, the gates of Pluto cannot be unlocked; within is a people of dreams; such wicked souls therefore enjoying no good places, when wandring in an Aeriall body, they represent any form to our sight, are called hags, and goblins, inoffensive to them that are good, but hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the wicked, appearing one while in thinner bodies ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time in grosser, in the shape of divers animals, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, whose conditions they had in their life time, as sings the Poet,
<q>
                     <l>Then divers forms and shapes of brutes appear;</l>
                     <l>For he becomes a tyger, swine, and bear,</l>
                     <l>A skalie dragon, and a lionesse,</l>
                     <l>Or doth from fire a dreadfull noise expresse;</l>
                     <l>He doth transmute himself to divers looks,</l>
                     <l>To fire, wild beasts, and into running brooks.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For the impure soul of a man, who in this life contracted too great a habit to its body, doth by a certain inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the elementall body frame another body to it self of the vapours of the elements, refreshing as it were from an easie matter as it were with a suck, that body which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vanishing; to which being moreover enslaved as to a prison, and sensible instrument by a certain divine Law, doth in it suffer cold, and heat, and whatsoever annoys the body,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:52070:256"/>
spirit, and sense, as stinks, howlings, wailings, gnashing of the teeth, stripes, tearings, and bonds, as <hi>Virgil</hi> sang;
<q>
                     <l>—And therefore for their crimes</l>
                     <l>They must be punish'd, and for mispent times</l>

               <p>These souls sometimes do inhabit not these kinds of bodies only, but by a too great affection of flesh and bloud trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute themselves into other animals, and seise upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of creeping things, and brutes, entering into them, what kind soever they be of, possessing them like Demons. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> is of the same opinion, and before him <hi>Trisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus,</hi> asserting that wicked souls do oftentimes go into creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, and into brutes, neither do they as essentiall forms vivifie and inform those bodies, but as an inmate dwell there as in a prison, or stand neer them by a locall indistance as an internall mover to the thing moved; or being tyed to them are tormented, as Ixion to the wheels of serpents, Sysiphus to a stone; neither do they enter into brutes only, but sometimes into men, as we have spoken concerning the soul of <hi>Nabaoth</hi> which went forth a lying spirit in the mouth of the Prophets. Hence some have asserted that the lives, or spirits of wicked men going into the bodies of some men, have disturbed them, and sometimes slew them. Which is more fortunately granted unto blessed souls that like good Angels they should dwell in us, and enlighten us, as we read of <hi>Elias,</hi> that he being taken
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:52070:257"/>
from men his spirit fell upon <hi>Elisha:</hi> and elsswhere we read that God took of the spirit which was in <hi>Moses,</hi> and gave it to 70. men. Here lies a great secret, and not rashly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. Sometimes also (which yet is very rare) souls are driven with such a madness that they do enter the bodies not only of the living, but also by a certain hellish power wander into dead Carkasses, and being as it were revived commit horrid wickednesses, as we read in <hi>Saxo Grammaticus,</hi> that <hi>Asuitus</hi> and <hi>Asmundus</hi> two cerrain men vowed one to the other, that he that should live longest should be buried with him that was first dead: at length <hi>Asuitus</hi> being first dead, is buried in a great vault with his dog, and horse, with whom also <hi>Asmundus</hi> by reason of his oath of friendship, suffered himself to be buried alive, (meat which he should for a long time eat, being brought to him;) in processe of time <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> King of <hi>Suecia</hi> passing by that place with an army, breaking up the tomb of <hi>Asuitus</hi> (supposing that there was treasure) the vault being opened, brought forth <hi>Asmundus:</hi> whom, when he saw having a hideous look, being smeared over with filthy corrupt blood which flowed from a green wound (for <hi>Asuitus</hi> being revived, in the nights, took off with often strugling his right ear) he commanded him to tell him the cause of that wound: which he declares in these verses;

                  <hi>Pausanias</hi> tels a story not unlike to this, taken out of the interpreters of the Delphi; <hi>viz.</hi> that there was a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall Demon, which they called <hi>Eurinomus,</hi> who would eat the flesh of dead men, and devour it so that the bones would scarce be left. We read also in the Chronicles of the <hi>Creten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> that the ghosts which they call <hi>Catechanae</hi> were wont to return back into their bodies, and go in to their wives, and lie with them; for the avoyding of which, and that they might annoy their wives no more, it was provided in the common lawes that the heart of them that did arise should be thrust thorow with a nail, and their whole carcasse be burnt. These without doubt are wonderfull things, and scarce credible, but that those lawes, and ancient Histories make them credible. Neither is it altogether strange in Christian Religion that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny souls were restored to their bodies, before the universall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. Moreover we beleeve that many by the singular favour of God are together with their bodies received to glory, and that many went down alive to hell. And we have heard that oftentimes the bodies of the dead were by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils taken from the graves, without doubt for no other use then to be imprisoned, and tormented in their hands. And to these prisons and bonds of their bodies there are added also the possessions of most filthy and abominable places, where are <hi>Aetnean</hi> fires, gulfes of water, the shakings of thunder, and lightening, gapings of the earth, and where the region is void of light, and receives not the rayes of the Sun, and knows not the light of the Stars, but is alwayes dark.

There is also in <hi>Novergia</hi> a certain mountain most dreadfull of all, cirrounded by the sea, which commonly is called <hi>Hethelbergius,</hi> representing Hell, whence there are heard great bewailings, howlings, and scritchings a mile round about, and over which great vulters and most

black.

There is also in the same country toward the Southern corner thereof a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory called <hi>Nadhegrin,</hi> where the Demons of the place are seen by all, in an aeriall body. There is also in <hi>Scotland</hi> the Mountain <hi>Dolorosus,</hi> from whence are heard dreadfull lamentations: and in <hi>Thuringia</hi> there is a mountain called <hi>Horrisonus,</hi> where dwelt <hi>Sylvani,</hi> and <hi>Satyrs,</hi> as fame and experience teacheth, and faithfull writers testifie. There are in divers Countries and Provinces such like miracles as these. I will not relate here those things which I have seen with mine eyes, and felt with mine hands, least by the wonderfull admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablenes &amp; strangeness of them I should by the incredulous be accounted a lyar. Neither do I think it fit to pass by what many of our age think concerning the receptacles of souls, not much differing from these which we have now spoken of: of which <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his fourth book against the heresies of <hi>Marcion</hi> saith, It is apparent to evey wise man, which hath ever heard of the <hi>Elysian</hi> fields that there is some locall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, (which is called <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome) for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the souls of his sons, and that that region is not ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial, yet higher then hell, where the souls of the just rest, untill the consummation of things restore the resurrection of all things with fulnes of reward. Also <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle saith to <hi>Clemens</hi> asking him of these things, thou dost constrain mee O <hi>Clemens</hi> to publish something concerning things unutterable: Yet as far as I may, I will. Christ, who from the beginning &amp; alwaies was, was alwaies through each generation, though secretly, present with the godly, with those especially by whom he was desired and to whom he did most often appear. But it was not time, that the bodies then being resolved, there should be a resurrection: but this rather seemed a remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from God, that he that was found just, should remain longer in a body, or that the Lord should translate him (as we see clearly related in the scripture of some certain iust
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:52070:259"/>
men.) After the like example God dealt with others, who pleased him well, and fullfilling his will were being translated to Paradise reserved for a kingdome. But of those who could not fullfill the rule of justice, but had some relique of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in their flesh, the bodyes indeed areresolved, but souls are kept in good and pleasant regions, that in the resurrection of the dead, when they shall receive their bodies, being now purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by resolution, they may enjoy an eternall inheritance for those things which they have done well. <hi>Ireneus</hi> also in the end of his book which he wrot against the Heresies of the <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> saith: Whereas the Lord went in the middle of the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, where the souls of the dead were, and after rose again corporeally, and after resurrection was taken up, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that the souls of his disciples (for whom he worked these things) should go to some invisible place, appoynted by God, and there tarry untill the resurrection, afterwards receiving their bodyes, and rising again perfectly, <hi>i e.</hi> corporeally, as the Lord arose, so shall they come into the presence of God; for no disciple is above his master; But every one shall be perfect as his Master. Therefore even as our Master did not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fly and go away, but expected the time of his resurrection determined by the father; which is also manifested by <hi>Jonas,</hi> after three daies arising he is taken up; So also ought we to expect the time of our resurrection determined by God, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets; and so rising again we shall be taken up, as many as the Lord shall account worthy of this honor; <hi>Lactantius Firmianus</hi> also agreeth to this, in that book of Divine institutions, whose title is of Divine reward; Saying, let no man think, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="487" facs="tcp:52070:259"/>
is interposed betwixt the death of man and the last resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, containeth the soul in secret receptacles; as every one is worthy of rest or sorrow, according to that which it obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whilst it lived in the flesh; but <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the benefits of death, saith; The writing of <hi>Esdras</hi> calleth the habitations of the souls, store houses; which he meting with the complaints of man (because that the Just who have gone before, may seem, even to the day of Judgement <hi>viz.</hi> for a long time, to be wonderfully defrauded of their just recompense of reward) doth liken the day of judgment to a garland; for the day of reward is expected of all, that in the mean time both the conquered may be ashamed, and the conquerors may attain the palme of victory; therefore while the fulnes of times is expected, the souls expect their due recompense; punishment remaining for some, glory for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and in the same place he calleth Hell a place which is not seen, which the souls go to being separated from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; And in his second book of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> he saith, the soul is loosed from the body, and after the end of this life, is even as yet in suspence, being doubtfull of the judgement to come; To these assenteth that evangelical saying, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the last iudgment, Christ saying in <hi>Matthew, Many shall say to mee in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast out Devils? And then I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to them, that I never knew them;</hi> by which speech it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be clear, that even untill this day they were uncertain concerning their sentence, and by the confidence of miracles which they had performed in the name of Jesus, whilst they lived, to have bin in some hope of salvation; Therefore because the judgement of souls is deferred untill the last day, many Theologians think that satisfactory intercessions may help not only the Justified, but also the damned, before the appoynted day of iudgment. So <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor was delivered from Hell by Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> and Justified to salvation, though some think that he was not freed from the guilt of punishment, but the Justice of punishment was prorogued untill the day of iudgment; But <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> saith it seemeth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:52070:260"/>
that by the intercessions of S. <hi>Gregory, Traian</hi> lived again, and obtained a gracious power by the which he was freed from the punishment and guilt of sin; and there are some <hi>Theologians</hi> who think, that by the Diriges for the dead nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the punishment nor the guilt is taken away or detracted, but that only some ease and asswagement of the pains is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; and this by the similitude of a sweating porter, who by the sprinkling of some water seemeth to be eased of the weight of his burthen, or helped to carry it more easily, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though nothing of the burthen be taken off: Yet the common opinion of <hi>Theologians</hi> denyeth that prayers or funerall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riges do cause any favour for the guilty within the gates of <hi>Pluto:</hi> but seeing all these things are of an incomprehensible obscurity, many have vainly whet their wits in them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we holding to the opinion of <hi>Austine,</hi> as he saith in the tenth book on <hi>Genesis,</hi> do affirm, That it is better do doubt concerning occult things, then to contend about uncertain things; for I doubt not but that that rich man is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the flames of pains, and that poor man in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment of joyes; but how that flame of hell, that bosom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that tongue of the rich man, that torment of thirst, that drop of cooling, are to be understood, it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found out by the modest searcher, but by the contentious never; but these things being for this present omitted, we hasten to further matters and will dispute concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of souls.</p>

spirits, alluring them into the carkasses of the dead, by certain hellish charms, and infernall invocations, and by deadly sacrifices, and wicked oblations; such we read in <hi>Lucan</hi> of <hi>Erichthone</hi> the witch, who called up the dead, who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told to <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> all the event of the <hi>Pharsalian</hi> War: There were also in <hi>Phigalia</hi> a city of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> certain magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, priests most skilful in sacred rites, &amp; raisers up of the souls of the dead: and the holy scriptures testifie, that a certain wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a witch called up <hi>Samuels</hi> soul: Even so truely the souls of the saints do love their bodies, and hear more readily there, where the pledges of their reliques are preserved: but there are two kinds of Necromancy, the one called <hi>Necyomancy,</hi> raising the carkasses, which is not done without blood. The other <hi>Sciomancy,</hi> in which the calling up of the shadow only sufficeth: to conclude, it worketh all its experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the carkases of the slain, and their bones and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and what is from them, because there is in these things a spirituall power friendly to them. Therefore they easily allure the flowing down of wicked spirits, being by reason of the similitude and propriety very familiar: by whom the <hi>Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer</hi> strengthened by their help can do very much in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and terrestriall things, and kindle unlawfull lusts, cause dreams, diseases, hatred and such like passions, to the which also they can confer the powers of these souls, which as yet being involved in a moist and turbide spirit, and wandering about their cast bodies, can do the same things that the wicked spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits commit; seeing therfore they experimentally find, that the wicked and impure souls violently plucked from their bodies, and of men not expiated, and wanting buriall, do stay about their carcases, and are drawn to them by affinity, the witches easily abuse them for the effecting of their witchcrafts, alluring these unhappy souls by the apposition of their body or by the taking of some part thereof, and compelling them by their devillish charmes, by entreating them by the deformed car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kases dispersed through the wide fields, and the wandering shadowes of those that want burials, and by the ghosts sent back from <hi>Acheron,</hi> and the guests of hell, whom untimely
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:52070:261"/>
death hath precipitated into Hell; and by the horrible desires of the damned, and proud devils revengers of wickednesses. But he which would restore the souls truely to their bodies, must first know what is the proper nature of the soul from whence it went forth, with how many and how great degrees of perfection it is replenished, with what intelligence it is strengthened, by what means diffused into the body, by what harmony it shall be compacted with it; what affinity it hath with God, with the intelligences, with the heavens, elements and all other things whose image and resemblance it holdeth. To conclude, by what influences the body may be knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again for the raising of the dead, requireth all these things which belong not to men but to God only, and to whom he will communicate them, as to <hi>Elishai</hi> who raised up the son of the <hi>Shunamite;</hi> so also <hi>Alcestis</hi> it reported to have been raised by <hi>Hercules,</hi> and to have lived long after; and <hi>Apollonius Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anensis</hi> restored a dead maid to life. And here is to be noted that sometimes it happeneth to men, that their vivifying spirit is retracted in them, and they appear as dead and without sense, when as yet the intellectual nature remaineth united to the body, and it hath the same form, and remaineth the same body, although the power of vivifying extendeth not it self into it actually, but remaineth retracted in the union with the intellectual nature; yet it ceaseth not to be; and although that man may truly be said to be dead, inasmuch as death is a want of a vivifying spirit, yet is it not truly separated; and that body can be wakened again and live; and thus many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles appear in these; and of this kind many have been seen amongst the Gentiles and Jewes in former ages; in the number of which is that which <hi>Plato</hi> reciteth in his tenth book <hi>de Republ. viz.</hi> that one <hi>Phereus</hi> of <hi>Pamphilia</hi> lay ten dayes amongst the slain in battle, and after that he had been taken away and laid to the fire two dayes, he revived and told many wonderfull things which he had seen in the time of his death; and concerning these things we have spoken partly in the first book, and shall yet speak further anon where we shall speak of Oracles which come forth in a Rapture, Extasie, and in the Agony of dying men.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MAns soul consisteth of a mind, reason and imagination; the mind illuminates reason, reason floweth into the imagination: All is one soul. Reason unless it be illuminated by the mind, is not free from errour: but the mind giveth not light to reason, unless God enlighten, <hi>viz.</hi> the first light; for the first light is in God very far exceeding all understanding: wherefore it cannot be called an intelligible light; but this when it is infused into the mind, is made intellectuall, and can be understood: then when it is infused by the mind to the reason, it is made rationall, and cannot only be understood but also considered: then when it is infused by the reason into the phantasie of the soul, it is made not only cogitable, but also imaginable; yet it is not as yet corporeall; but when from hence it goeth into the Celestiall vehicle of the soul; it is first made corporeall, yet not manifestly sensible till it hath passed into the elementall body, either simple and Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, or compound in the which the light is made manifestly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the eye; The <hi>Chaldean</hi> Philosophers considering this progresse of light, declare a certain wonderfull power of our mind: <hi>viz.</hi> that it may come to passe, that our mind being firmly fixed on God, may be filled with the divine power; and being so replenished with light, its beams being diffused through all the <hi>media,</hi> even to this grosse, dark, heavy, mortall body, it may endow it with abundance of light, and make it like the Stars, and equally shining, and also by the plenty of its beams and lightness lift it on high, as straw lifted up by the flame of fire, and can presently carry the body as a spirit into remote parts. So we read of <hi>Philip</hi> in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, who baptizing the <hi>Eunuch</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> was presently found, in <hi>Azotus.</hi> The like we read of <hi>Habacuc</hi> in <hi>Daniel:</hi> so others going through the doors being shut, escaped both their
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:52070:262"/>
keepers and imprisonment; as we read of <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle and of <hi>Peter</hi> the Exorcist: He may the lesse wonder at this, who hath seen those famous melancholick men, who walk in their sleepes and passe through places even unpassible, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend even unaccessible places, and exercise the works of those that are awake, which they themselves being awake could not do; of the which things there is no other reason in nature, than a strong and exalted imagination: but this power is in every man, &amp; it is in the soul of man from the root of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it is varied in diverse men, in strength and weakness, and is encreased and diminished according to his exercise and use, by the which it is drawn forth from power into act, which thing he that rightly knoweth, can ascend by his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, even untill his imaginative faculty doth transcend and is joyned with the universall power, which <hi>Alchindus, Bacon,</hi> and <hi>Gulielmus Parisiensis</hi> do call the sense of nature; <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> the Etheriall sense, and <hi>Plato</hi> the sense of the vehicle: and his imagination is made most strong, when that Etheriall and Celestiall power is poured out upon it, by whose bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness it is comforted, untill it apprehend the species, notions and knowledge of true things, so that that which he thought in his mind, cometh to passe even as he thought, and it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth so great power, that it can plunge, joyn and insinuate it self into the minds of men, and make them certain of his thoughts, and of his will and desire, even thorow large and remote spaces, as if they perceived a present object by their senses; and it can in little time do many things, as if they were done without time; yet these things are not granted to all, but to those whose imaginative and cogitative power is most strong and hath arrived to the end of speculation; and he is fitted to apprehend and manifest all things, by the splendour of the universall power, or intelligence and spirituall apprehension which is above him: and this is that necessary power, which every one ought to follow and obey, who followeth the truth; if therefore now the power of the imagination is so great, that it can insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate it self unto whom it pleaseth, being neither hindred nor
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:52070:263"/>
let by any distance of time or place, and can sometimes draw its heavy body along with it, whither it imagineth and dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: There is no doubt but that the power of the mind is greater, if at any time it shall obtain its proper nature, and being no way oppressed by the allurements of the senses, shall persevere both incorrupted and like it self; but now for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that the souls abound with so plentifull Light of the Celestiall Stars, and hence, a very great a bundance of light redoundeth into their bodies; so <hi>Moses</hi> face did shine, that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> could not behold him by reason of the brightness of his countenance; thus <hi>Socrates</hi> was transfigured, as we read, that in light he overcame the luciferous wheels of the Sun; So <hi>Zoroastes</hi> being transfigured, his body was takenup. So <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> ascended to heaven in a certain fiery cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, so <hi>Paul</hi> was rapt up into the third heaven: So our bodies after the judgement of the world, shall be called Glorified, and in like manner be rapt up, and we may say by this means, shall shine as the Sun and Moon; which thing that it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and hath formerly been done, <hi>Avicebron</hi> the Moore, and <hi>Avicen</hi> the <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> of <hi>Cous,</hi> and all the school of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> do acknowledge and confirm: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is reported in Histories, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumvented and in great danger in <hi>India,</hi> did so burn in mind, that he seemed to the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to cast forth light; the father of <hi>Theodoricus</hi> also is reported to have cast forth sparks of fire through his whole body; the same thing a wise man also delivered concerning himself, so that sparkling flames did break forth here and there even with a noise; neither is this power of the soul found in men only, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even in beasts, as in the horse of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who seemed to send forth flames out of his mouth. But the mind is above fate in providence, therefore is not affected either with the influences of the heavenly bodies, or the qualities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things; Religion therefore can only cure it; but the sensitiveness of the soul is in fate, above nature, which is in a certain manner the knot of the body and soul, and under fate, above the body; therefore it is changed by the influences of
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:52070:263"/>
the heavenly bodies, and affected by the qualities of naturall and corporeall things: now I call the sensitiveness of the soul, that vivifying and rectifying power of the body, the originall of the senses; the soul it self doth manifest in this body its sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers and perceiveth corporeall things by the body, and locally moveth the body, and governeth it in his place, and nourisheth it in a body. In this sensitiveness two most princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal powers predominate; <hi>viz.</hi> one which is called the Phantasy, or imaginative or cogitative faculty, of whose power we have already spoken, where we have handled the passions of the soul: the other which is called the sense of nature, of the which also we have spoken, where we made mention of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft. Man therefore by the nature of his body is under fate; the soul of man, by the sensitiveness moveth nature in Fate, but by the mind is above fate, in the order of providence; yet reason is free at its own choice; therefore the soul by reason ascendeth into the mind, where it is replenished with divine light; sometimes it descendeth into sensitiveness and is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the influences of the heavenly bodies, and qualities of naturall things, and is distracted by the passions and the encountring of sensible objects: sometimes the soul revolveth it selfe wholly into reason, searching out other things either by discourse, or by contemplating it self: for it is possible, that that part of the reason, which the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> call the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Intellect may be brought to this, that it may freely discourse and operate without conversion to his Phantasmes: for so great is the command of this reason, that as often as any thing incurreth either into the mind, or into the sensitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or into nature, or into the body, it cannot passe into the soul, unless reason apply it self to it; by this means the soul perceiveth it self neither to see, nor hear, nor feel, not that it suffereth any things by the externall senses, untill cogitative reason first apprehend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

affections, nor sensations, nor passions either of the mind or body, nor any sensible thing whatsoever, can work or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into the soul unless by the Judgement of reason it self. Therefore by its act, not by any extrinsecall violence, can the soul be either affected or disturbed, which thing even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable <hi>Martyrs</hi> have proved by their Martyrdom: So <hi>Anasarchus</hi> a Philosopher of <hi>Abdera,</hi> who, who by the the command of <hi>Nicocreontes</hi> a tyrant of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> being cast into a concave stone neglecting the pains of his body, while he was pounded with iron pestils, is reported to have said: pound, pound the shell of <hi>Anasarchus,</hi> thou nothing hurtest <hi>Anasarchus</hi> himself: The tyrant commanded his tongue to be cut off, but he with his own teeth did bite it off, and did spit it in the face of the Tyrant.</p>

               <p>THe minde, because it is from God or from the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible world, is therefore immortal and eternal; but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is long-lived by the benefit of its celestial original from the Heaven; but the sensitive because it is from the bosome of the matter and dependeth on sublunary nature, is subject to destruction and corruption: therefore the soul by its minde is immortall, by its Reason long lived in its etherial vehicle, but resolvable unless it be restored in the circuit of its new body; therefore it is not immortal, unless it be united to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal mind therefore the sensitivenes of the soul or the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or animal soul, because it is produced out of the bosome of a corporeal matter, the body being resolved, perisheth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it, or the shadow thereof remaineth not long in the vapours of its resolved body, partaking nothing of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, unless it be also united to a more sublimed power; therefore the soul which is united to the minde, is called the Soul standing not falling; but all men obtain not this minde,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:52070:264"/>
because (as <hi>Hermes</hi> saith) God would propound it as it were a prize and reward of the souls, which they that shall neglect, being without minde, spotted with corporeall senses, and made like to irrational creatures, are allotted to the same destruction with them, as <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> saith: there is the same destruction of man and beasts, and the condition of both is equall; as man dieth, so also they dye, yea they have all one breath, so that man hath no preheminence over a beast; thus far he. Hence many Theologians think, that the souls of men of this kinde have no immortality after they have left their body, but an hope of the resurrection only, when all men shall be restored. <hi>Austin</hi> relateth that this was the heresie of the Arabians, who affirmed that the souls perished toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their bodies; and in the day of judgement did arise again with them; whosoever therefore being upheld by the divine grace have obtained a mind, these according to the proportion of their works become immortal (as <hi>Hermes</hi> saith) having comprehended all things by their understanding, which are in the earth, and in the sea, and in the Heavens, and if there be any thing besides these above heaven, so that they behold even goodness it self: but they who have lived a middle life, though they have not obtained the divine intelligence, but a certain rationall intelligence of it; these mens souls, when they shall depart from their bodies, are bound over to certain se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret receptacles, where they are affected with sensitive powers, and are exercised in a certain kind of act; and by imagination, and the irascible &amp; concupiscible vertues, do either extreamly rejoyce, or greivously lament. Of which opinion Saint <hi>Austin</hi> also was, in his book which he wrote of the spirit and soul; The wise men of the <hi>Indians, Persians, Aegyptians</hi> &amp; <hi>Chaldeans</hi> have delivered, that this soul superviveth much longer then its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet that it is not made altogether immortal, unless by Transmigration. But our <hi>Theologians</hi> do philosophize far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise concerning these things, that although there be the same common originall and beginning of all souls, yet they are distinguished by the creator with divers degrees, not only accidentall, but also intrinsecall, founded in their very
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:52070:265"/>
essence, by the which one soul differeth from another, by that which is proper to it self; which opinion <hi>John Scotus</hi> also holdeth, and the Parisian <hi>Theologians</hi> have so decreed in their articles; Hence the wise man saith, I was an ingenuous child, and obtained a good soul, <hi>viz.</hi> a better then many others; and according to this inequality of souls, every one is capable in their degree, of their charge; which gift is freely given by God, as we read in the Gospel, that he gave to one five Talents, to another two, to another one, to every one according to his vertue, and the Apostle saith, he hath given, some to be Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists and Doctors, for the consummation of the Saints in the work of the Ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ; for there are (saith <hi>Origen)</hi> certain invisible perfections, to the which are committed those things which are dispensed here upon earth, in which there is no small difference, as also is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the men; wherefore some one attaineth the highest degree of wisdome and dignity; another little differeth from beasts &amp; seeding beasts is made half a beast; another aboundeth in vertues and in wealth; another hath even little or nothing, &amp; oftentimes that little which he hath is taken away from him, &amp; given to him that hath; and this is the divine justice in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of gifts, that they may correspond to the vertues of every receiver, to whom also rewards are given according to their works: that what proportion there is, of gifts to gifts, and of deserts to deserts, there may be the same proportion of rewards to rewards; to conclude, we must know this, that every noble soul hath a fourfold operation; First divine, by the Image of the divine propriety; the second intellectual, by formality of Participation with the intelligences; the third rational by the perfection of its proper essential essence; the fourth animal or natural, by communion with the body and these Inferior things; So that there is no work in this whole world so admirable, so excellent, so wonderfull, which the sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>PHrensie is an illustration of the soul coming from the Gods, or Demons. Whence this verse of <hi>Ovid,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>God is in us, Commerces of the throne</l>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> defines this by alienation, and binding; for he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts from those by which the corporeal senses are stirred up, and being estranged from an animal man, adheres to a diety from whom it receives those things which it cannot search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by its own power; for when the minde is free, and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, the reines of the body being loosed, and going forth as out of a close prison, transcends the bonds of the members, and nothing hindring of it, being stirred up by its own instigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and instigated by a divine spirit, comprehends all things, and foretells future things. Now there are four kinds of divine phrensie proceeding from several dieties, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> from <hi>Dionysius,</hi> from <hi>Apollo,</hi> and from <hi>Venus.</hi> The first phrensie therefore proceeding from the Muses, stirs up and tempers the mind, and makes it divine by drawing superior things to inferior things by things natural. Now Muses are the souls of the celestial spheres, according to which there are found several degrees, by which there is an attraction of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior things to inferior. The inferior of these resembling the sphear of the <hi>Moon,</hi> possesseth those things which are from vegetables, as plants, fruits of trees, roots, and those which are from harder matters, as Stones, Metals, their alligations, and suspensions. So it is said that the stone <hi>Selenites i. e. Moon-Stone,</hi> and the stone of the Civet-cat cause divination; also <hi>Vervain,</hi> and the Hearb <hi>Theangelis</hi> cause soothsaying, as hath been above said. The second degree resembling <hi>Mercury,</hi> possesseth those things which are from animals, and which are
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:52070:266"/>
compounded of the mixtion of divers natural things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Cups, and Meats; upon this account the heart of a <hi>Mole,</hi> if any one shall eat it whilest it is warm, and panting, conduceth, as it is said, to the foretelling of future events. And <hi>Rabbi Moses</hi> in his commentaries upon <hi>Leviticus</hi> tells, that there is an animal called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Jedua,</hi> having a humane shape, in the midle of whose navel comes forth a string, by which it is fastned to the ground like a gourd, and as far as the length of that string reacheth, it devours and consumes all that is green about it, and deceiving the sight, cannot be taken, unless that string be cut off by the stroke of a dart, which being cut off, it presently dies. Now the bones of this animal being after a certain manner laid upon the mouth, presently he whose mouth they are laid on, is taken with a phrensie, and sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying. The third degree answers to the sphear of <hi>Venus;</hi> This possesseth subtile powders, vapours, and odours, and oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and suffumigations, which are made of these of which we have spoke above. The fourth degree belongs to the sphear of the <hi>Sun;</hi> this possesseth voyces, words, singings, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical sounds, by the sweet consonancy whereof it drives forth of the minde any troublesomeness therein, and chears it up. Whence <hi>Hermes, Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> advise us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a discontented minde, and chear it up by singing and harmony. So <hi>Timotheus</hi> is said to have with sounds stirred up King <hi>Alexander</hi> to a phrensie: so the Priest <hi>Calame (Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Augustus</hi> being witness) was wont at his pleasure by a certain shrill harmony to call himself forth out of his body into a rapture, and extasie; of these also we have before spoken. The first degree is answerable to <hi>Mars:</hi> this pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth vehement imaginations, and affections of the minde, conceits also, and motions thereof, of all which before. The sixth degree answers to <hi>Jupiter:</hi> this possesseth the discourses of reason, deliberations, consultations, and moral purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: of these we have spoken in part above, and further we shall speak afterwards; It possesseth also admirations, and venerations, at the astonishment of which, the phantasie, and reason are sometimes so restrained, that they suddenly let
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:52070:267"/>
pass all their own actions: whence then the minde it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free, and exposed to a diety only, whether to any God, or Demon doth receive supernal, and divine influencies, <hi>viz.</hi> those concerning which it did deliberate before. So we read that the Sybils, and the Priests of <hi>Pythia</hi> were wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive oracles in the caves of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Apollo.</hi> The seventh degree resembles <hi>Saturn:</hi> this possesseth the more secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencies, and quiet contemplations of the minde. I call here, the contemplation, the free perspicacity of the minde, suspended with admiration upon the beholding of wisdom. For that excogitation which is made by riddles, and images, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind of speculation, or discourse belonging to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and not a contemplation. The eighth degree resembles the starry heaven; this observes the situation, motion, raies, and light of the celestial bodies: it possesseth also images, rings, and such like, which are made after the rule of celestials, as we have above spoken. The ninth degree answers to the <hi>primum mobile, viz.</hi> the ninth sphear, as the very universe: this pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth things more formal, as Numbers, Figures, Characters, and observes the occult influencies of the intelligences of the heaven, and other mysteries, which because they bear the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of celestial dieties, and invocated spirits, easily allures them, and compelleth them being forced by a certain necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conformity to come to one, and detains them, that they shall not easily go back, of which we read in the Oracles in <hi>Porphyrie.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XLVIII. <hi>Of the third kind of phrensie from</hi> Apollo.</head>
               <p>NOw the third kind of phrensie proceeds from <hi>Apollo, viz.</hi> from the mind of the world. This doth by certain sacred mysteries, vows, sacrifices, adorations, invocations, &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sacred arts, or certain secret confections, by which the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of their God did infuse vertue, make the soul rise above the mind, by joyning it with dieties, and Demons: so we read concerning the Ephod, which being applied, they did presently prophecie: so we read in the books of the Senats in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> that <hi>Rabbi Israel</hi> made certain cakes, writ upon with certain divine and angel call names, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, which they that did eat with faith, hope, and charitie, did presently break forth with a spirit of prophecie. We read in the same place that <hi>Rabbi Johena</hi> the son of <hi>Jochahaed</hi> did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner enlighten a certain rude countryman, called <hi>Eleazar,</hi> being altogether illiterate, that being compassed about with a sudden brightness, did unexpectedly preach such high mysteries of the Law to an assembly of wise men, that he did even astonish all that were neer him. And it is reported of a certain man called <hi>Herviscus</hi> an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> that he was endowed with such a divine nature, that at the very sight of images that had any diety in them, he was forthwith stirred
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:52070:268"/>
up with a kind of a divine phrensie. We read also in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that when <hi>Saul</hi> was amongst the Prophets, the spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he prophecied, and when he went forth from the assembly of the Prophets, he ceased to prophesie; the same happened to those officers which <hi>Saul</hi> sent to catch <hi>David:</hi> who when they saw the company of the Prophets, and <hi>Samuel</hi> standing in the midst of them, received the spirit of the Lord on them, and prophesied also. So great is the abounding of divine light oftentimes in the prophets, taken with a divine phrensie, that it also seiseth on them that are neer them, and makes them have the same spirit of phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: It is not therefore incredible, that an ignorant man should presently be made wise, and again that a wise man become ignorant: for there is a certain art (known but to few) of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, adorning, &amp; illustrating a pure mind, so that it should presently be recovered out of the darkness of ignorance, and brought to the light of wisdom: and on the contrary, there is a way by certain hid secrets, to make them that have unclean, and unbelieving minds to become ignorant again, although for the present they are learned and wise. Mans mind also, especially that which is simple, and pure, may <hi>(Apuleius</hi> being witness) by some sacred, and mysterious recreation, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing, be so brought into a sleep, and astonied, that it may forget things present so utterly, as to be brought into its divine nature, and so be enlightned with the divine light, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with a divine phrensie that it may foretell things to come, and withall receive the vertue of some wonderfull effects. Whence <hi>Jamblicus</hi> saith, when the prophets are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with a diety, they fear nothing, for they go through wayes unpassable, and are carried into the fire without any hurt, and passe over rivers. So we read of certain caves as of <hi>Apollo, Trophonius,</hi> the three footed stools, dens, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, lakes, and such like, that were consecrated to the gods after this manner, or made by that mysterie, that from thence the priests might draw the spirit of prophecying, as <hi>Jamblicus</hi> in <hi>Porphyrie:</hi> The <hi>Sybill</hi> (saith he) in <hi>Delphi</hi> was wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive God after two wayes: either by a subtill spirit, and fire,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:52070:269"/>
which did break forth somewhere out of the mouth of the cave, where she sitting in the entrance upon a brazen three footed stool dedicated to a diety, was divinely inspired, and did utter prophecyings; or a great fire flying out of the cave did cirround this prophetess, stirring her up, being filled with a diety, to prohhesie, which inspiration also she received as she sate upon a consecrated seat, breaking forth presently into predictions. Moreover there was a prophetess in <hi>Branchi</hi> which sate upon an extree, and either held a wand in her hand given to her by some diety, or washed her feet, and sometimes the hem of her garment in the waters, or drew the vapour of fire from the waters. By all these she was filled with divine splendour, and did unfold many Oracles. We also read that in the country of <hi>Thracia</hi> there was a certain passage consecrated to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> from whence predictions, and Oracles were wont to be given: the Priors of whose temples having drank wine abundantly did do strange things. Amongst the <hi>Clarians</hi> also, where the temple of <hi>Clarius Apollo</hi> was, to whom it was given to utter divine things, they having drank much wine did strange things. There was also a propheticall fountain of Father <hi>Achaia,</hi> constituted before the temple of <hi>Ceres,</hi> where they that did enquire of the event of the sick did let down a glass by degrees tied to a small cord, to the top of the water, and certain supplications and fumes being made, the event of the thing did appear in the glass. There was also not far from <hi>Epidaurus</hi> a City of <hi>Laconia</hi> a deep Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which was called the water of <hi>Juno,</hi> into which cakes of corn being cast, answers were given, fortunate, if the waters did quietly retain what was cast in; but unhappy, if they did as it were, scorning of them, cast them back. The like they say do the caves of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>age of good or ill, by being retained, or rejected. The like things reports <hi>Dion</hi> in his Romane History, in a place which they call the <hi>Nymphs:</hi> where Frankincense being cast into the flames, Oracles were received concerning all those things which he did desire to know, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning death, and those things which belonged to marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:52070:269"/>
Wonderfull also is that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> relates of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fountain of the <hi>Paliscans</hi> of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> to which they that did take an oath did go, and whatsoever they did affirm upon oath writ it upon tables, which they cast into the fountain. If those things were true, the tables would swim; if false, sink; then fire coming suddenly forth burned him that was perjured into ashes. There was also in the City <hi>Dodona</hi> an Oak, which assoon as any one entered in to receive an answer, did forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with move, and make a sound; there was also a statue holding a wand, which did strike a bason, whereby the bason made answer by moderated strokes. Whence it is read in the Epistle of <hi>Ausinus</hi> to <hi>Paulinus,</hi>

               <p>NOw the fourth kind of Phrensie proceeds from <hi>Venus,</hi> and it doth by a servent love convert, and transmute the mind to God, and makes it altogether like to God, as it were the proper image of God; Whence <hi>Hermes</hi> saith, O <hi>Aselepius!</hi> Man is a great miracle, an animal to be honoured and adored; for he passeth into the nature of God, whereby he becomes God: He knows the rise of Demons, and he knows himself to have his originall with them, despising the part of his humane nature in himself, having a sure confidence of the divinity of the other; The soul therefore being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and made like to God, is so formed of God, that it doth above all intellect, know all things by a certain essential contract of Divinity: therefore <hi>Orpheus</hi> describes love to be without eyes, because it is above the intellect. Now then the soul being so converted into God by love, and sublimated above the intellectuall spear, doth beside that it hath by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity obtain'd the spirit of prophecie, sometimes work
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:52070:270"/>
wonderfull things, and greater then the nature of the world can do, which works are called miracles. For as the heaven by its image, light, and heat, doth those things, which the force of the fire cannot do by its naturall quality (which in <hi>Alchymie</hi> is most known by experience) so also doth God by the image and light of himself do those things, which the world cannot do by its innate vertue. Now the image of God is man, at least such a man that by a phrensie from <hi>Venus</hi> is made like to God, and lives by the mind only, and receives God into himself. Yet the soul of man according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors and Cabalists, is defined to be the light of God, and Created after the image of the word, the cause of causes, the first example, and the substance of God, figured by a seal whose Character is the eternall word. Which <hi>Mercurius Trismegistus</hi> considering, saith, that such a man is more excellent then they that are in heaven, or at least equall to them.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ARapture is an abstraction, and alienation, and an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the soul proceeding from God, by which God doth again retract the soul being fallen from above to hell, from hell to heaven. The cause of this is in us a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall contemplation of sublime things, which as far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns with a most profound intension of the mind, the soul to incorporeal wisdom, doth so far recall it self with its vehement agitations from things sensible and the body, and (as <hi>Plato</hi> saith) in such a manner sometimes, that it even flieth out of the body, and seemeth as it were dissolved: even as <hi>Aurelius Austin</hi> reporteth concerning a Priest of <hi>Calamia;</hi> (of whom we have made mention before) he lay (saith he) most like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:52070:270"/>
a dead man, without breath; and when he was burnt with fire and wounded, he felt it not; so great therefore is the command of the soul: <hi>viz.</hi> when it hath obtained its own nature, and is not oppressed by the allurements of the senses, that by its own power it suddenly ascendeth, not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the body, but even sometimes loosed from its fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and flyeth forth of the body to the supercelestiall habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where now it being most nigh, and most like to God, and made the receptable of divine things, it is filled with the divine Light and Oracles. Whence <hi>Zoroastes</hi> saith, thou must ascend to the light it self, and to the beams of the Father, whence thy soul was sent thee, clothed with very much mind; and <hi>Trismegistus</hi> saith, it is necessary that thou ascend above the heavens, and be far from the quire of spirits: and <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> saith, if thou by leaving the body shalt pass into the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heavens, thou shalt be an immortall god. So we read that <hi>Hermes, Socrates, Xenocrates, Plato, Plotine, Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus, Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Zoroastes,</hi> were wont to abstract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by rapture, and so to learn the knowledge of many things: also we read in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that there was in <hi>Proconnesus</hi> a Philosopher of wonderfull knowledge, called <hi>Atheus,</hi> whose soul sometimes went out of the body, and after the visitation of places far remote, returned again into the body more learned: <hi>Pliny</hi> reporteth the same thing, that the soul of <hi>Harman Clazomenius</hi> was wont to wander abroad, his body being left, and to bring true tidings of things very far off; and there are even to this day in Norway and Lapland very many who can abstract themselves three whole dayes from their body, and being returned declare many things which are afar off; and in the mean time it is necessary to keep them, that not any living creature come upon them or touch them; otherwise they report that they cannot return into their body. Therefore we must know, that (according to the doctrine of the <hi>Aegyptians,)</hi> seeing the soul is a certain spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall light, when it is loosed from the body, it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth every place and time, in such a manner as a light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed in a Lanthern, which being open, diffuseth it self every
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:52070:271"/>
where, and faileth not any where, for it is every where, and continually; and <hi>Cicero</hi> in his book of Divination saith, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the soul of man at any time divine, when it is so loosed that it hath indeed little or nothing to do with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; when therefore it shall attain to that state, which is the supream degree of contemplative perfection, then it is rapt from all created species, and understandeth not by acquired species, but by the inspection of the <hi>Ideas,</hi> and it knoweth all things by the light of the <hi>Ideas:</hi> of which light <hi>Plato</hi> saith few men are partakers in this life; but in the hands of the gods, all: also they who are troubled with the syncope and falling sickness, do in some manner imitate a rapture, and in these sicknesses sometimes as in a rapture do bring forth prophesie, in which kind of prophesying we read that <hi>Hercules</hi> and many <hi>Arabians</hi> were very excellent, and there are certain kinds of soothsayings, which are a middle betwixt the confines of naturall predictions, and supernaturall Oracles, <hi>viz.</hi> which declare things to come from some excess of passion, as too much love, sorrow, or amongst frequent sights, or in the agony of death, as in <hi>Statius,</hi> of the mother of <hi>Achilles;</hi>
                  <q>

                  </q>

               <p>For there is in our minds a certain perspicuous power, and, capable of all things, but encumbred and hindred by the darkness of the body and mortality, but after death it having acquired immortality, and being freed from the body it hath a full and perfect knowledge. Hence it cometh to pass, that they who are nigh to death, and weakened by old age, have sometimes somewhat of an unaccustomed light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the soul being less hindred by the senses, understandeth very acutely, and being now as it were a little relaxed from its bands, is not altogether subject to the body, and being as it were nigher to the place, to the which it is about to go, it easily perceiveth revelations, which being mixed with its agonies, are then offered to it; whence <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his book of the belief of the resurrection, saith, Which being free
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:52070:271"/>
in the aerial motion, knoweth not whither it goeth, and whence it cometh; yet we know that it superviveth the body, and that it being freed, the chains of its senses being cast off, freely discerneth those things which it saw not before, being in the body, which we may estimate by the example of those who sleep, whose mind being quiet, their bodies being as it were buried, do elevate themselves to higher things, and do declare to the body the visions of things absent, yea even of celestial things.</p>

               <head>CHAP. LI. <hi>Of Prophetical Dreams.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw I call that a dream, which proceedeth either from the spirit of the phantasie and intellect united together, or by the illustration of the Agent intellect above our souls, or by the true revelation of some divine power in a quiet and purified mind; for by this our soul receiveth true oracles, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly yieldeth prophesies to us: for in dreams we seem both to Ask questions, and learn to read and find them out; also many doubtfull things, many Policies, many things unknown, and unwished for, nor ever attempted by our minds, are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to us in Dreams: also the representations of unknown places appear, and the Images of men both alive and dead, and of things to come are foretold; and also things which at any times have happened, are revealed, which we knew not by any report; and these dreams need not any art of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, as those of which we have spoken in the first book, which belong to divination, not fore-knowledge; and it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to pass that they who see these dreams, for the most part understand them not; for (as <hi>Abdala</hi> the Arabian saith) as to see dreams, is from the strength of imagination, so to understand them, is from the strength of understanding; whose intellect therefore, being overwhelmed by the too much commerce of the flesh, is in a dead sleep, or its imaginative or
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:52070:272"/>
phantastick spirit is too dull and unpolished, that it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the species and representations which flow from the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior intellect, and retain them when received, this man is altogether unfit for the scothsaying by dreams. Therefore it is necessary, that he who would receive true drams, should keep a pure, undisturbed, and an undisquieted imaginative spirit, and so compose it, that it may be made worthy of the knowledge and government by the mind and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: for such a spirit is most fit for prophesying, and (as <hi>Sinesius</hi> saith) is a most clear glass of all the Images which flow every where from all things: when therefore we are sound in body, not disturbed in mind, not dulled by meat or drink, nor sad through poverty, nor provoked by any vice of lust or wrath, but chastly going to bed, fall asleep, then our pure and divine soul being loosed from all hurtfull thoughts, and now freed by dreaming, is endowed with this divine spirit as an instrument, and doth receive those beams and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which are darted down, and shine forth from the divine minde into it self; and as it were in a deifving glass, it doth far more certainly, clearly, and efficaciously behold all things, then by the Vulgar enquiry of the intellect, and by the discourse of reason; the divine power instructing the soul, being invited to their society by the oportunity of the nocturnal so litariness; neither further will that deity be wanting to him when he is awaked, which ruleth all his actions: whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore doth, by quiet and religious meditation, and by a diet temperate and moderated according to nature, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his spirit pure, doth very much prepare himself, that by this means he may become divine, and knowing all things; but whosoever, on the contrary, doth languish with a phantastick spirit, receiveth not perspicuous and distinct visions, but even as the divine sight, by reason of its weakness, Judgeth confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly and indistinctly; and also when we are overcome with wine and drunkenness, then our spirit being oppressed with noxious vapours (as a troubled water is wont to appear in divers forms) is deceived, &amp; waxeth dull; for which cause <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiarus</hi> the Prophet (as we read in <hi>Philostratus)</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:52070:272"/>
those, who would receive Oracles, to abstain one whole day from meat, and three days from wine that the soul could not rightly prophefie unless it were free from wine, and meat; for to sober and religious minds, attending on the divine worship, the Gods are wont to give Oracles; whence <hi>Orpheus</hi> cryeth out,
<q>
                     <l>—Thou spirit great of prophecy</l>
                     <l>Dost go to souls that sleep full quietly,</l>
                     <l>And them inspire with knowledge of the Gods,</l>
                     <l>And makest them soothsay—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it was a custome amongst the ancients, that they who should receive Answers, certain sacred expiations and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices being first celebrated, and divine worship ended, did religiously ly down even in a consecrated chamber, or at least on the skins of the sacrifices; of which Ceremony <hi>Virgil</hi> makes mention in these verses,
<q>
                     <l>—Hence they sought</l>
                     <l>Answers to doubts; when gifts the priests had brought,</l>
                     <l>Here he reposed on skins of slaughtred sheep,</l>
                     <l>And under silent night prepares to sleep.</l>
                  </q>
And a little after he singeth,

               </p>
               <p>And the rulers of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> (as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith) were wont to lye down in the Temple at <hi>Pasiphae,</hi> that they might dream. The same was done in the Temple of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> from whom true dreams were thought to be sent forth. And the <hi>Calabrians</hi> consulting <hi>Podalyrius</hi> the son of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> did sleep neer his Sepulchre in lambes skins; for so doing they were told in their dreams whatsoever they desired to know; for the most usuall time for dreams is the night, when the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:52070:273"/>
are freed from wandring objects, and meridian errours, and vain affections; neither doth fear strike the minde, nor the thoughts tremble, and the minde being most quiet, doth stedfastly adhere to the Deity; for there are, (as <hi>Rabbi-Johenan</hi> in his book of Senatours saith) four kinds of true dreams: the first Matutine, which is made betwixt sleep and awaking: the second, which one seeth concerning another: the third, whose interpretation is shewen to the same dreamer in the nocturnall vision: the fourth, which is repeated to the same dreamer, according to that which <hi>Joseph</hi> saith to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> But that thou hast seen the dream belonging to the same thing the second time, it is a sign of confirmation; but that dream is most sure, which is concerning those things which one did meditate on, and revolve in his minde, when he goeth to bed, as it is written, Thou O King didst think upon thy bed, what should become of these things; but it is necessary, that he which interpreteth other mens dreams, hath the knowledge by the which he can distinguish and discern the similitude; of all things, and know the customes of all nations, according to the laws which they have received from God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; farther this must be known, that there is scarce any dream without some vanity, as no grain of corn without his chaffe, which thing even the dream of <hi>Joseph</hi> the <hi>Patriard</hi> manifesteth; which his father <hi>Jacob</hi> interpreted, saying; what meaneth this dream, that thou hast seen? what shall I, and thy mother, and thy brethren fall down and worship thee? which effect concerning his mother, who shortly after died, followed not. Also <hi>Rabbi Johenan</hi> in the forecited book, saith these things; and also <hi>Rabbi Levi</hi> affirmeth, that no prophetical dream can bee kept back from his effect longer than twenty two years; so <hi>Joseph</hi> dreamed in the seventeenth year of his age, which was accomplished in the thirty ninth year of his age; therefore whosoever would receive divine dreams, let him be well disposed in body, his brain free from vapours, and his mind from perturbations, and let him that day abstain from supper, neither let him drink that which will inebriate, let him have a clean and neat chamber, also exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized

and consecrated: in the which, a perfume being made, his temples anoynted, things causing dreams being put on his fingers, and the representation of the heavens being put under his head, and paper being consecrated, his prayers being said, let him go to bed, earnestly meditating or that thing he desireth to know: So he shall see most true and certain dreams with the true illumination of his intellect: whosoever therefore shall know to joyn together those things which here and there we have delivered concerning this matter in these books, he shall easily obtain the gift of oracles and dreams.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THere are also certain Lots having a divine power of Oracles, and as it were Indexes of divine judgement, being before sought for by earnest prayer, and sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God himself to be done, as is read in <hi>Leviticus</hi> concerning a goat to be offered to the Lord, and of the scape goat; and in the book of <hi>Numbers</hi> of the rods of the Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> Now both <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> did by Lots in the presence of the Lord divide the lands, and inheritances to the tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> according to the command of God. The Apostles of Christ, prayers going-before, did by lot choose <hi>Matthias</hi> into the place of <hi>Judas</hi> the traitor. <hi>Jonas</hi> the Prophet when he flying from the presence of God did sail to <hi>Tharsus,</hi> a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous storm being raised, was by lot found out by the Mariners to be the cause of the danger, and being cast into the sea, the tempest seased. <hi>Caesar</hi> reports of M. <hi>Valerius Procillus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken by his enemies, concerning whom it was consulted whether he should be presently burnt, or reserved to another time, that by lot he escaped safe. There was formerly at <hi>Bura,</hi> a Town of <hi>Achaia,</hi> an oracle of <hi>Hercules</hi> constituted by a chest bord, where he that went to consult of any thing, after he had prayed, cast four dice, the cast of which the Prophet observing,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:52070:274"/>
did find written in the chestboard what should come to pass: Now all such dice were made of the bones of sacrifices. Now this you must know, that the Ancients were not wont upon every slight cause to cast lots, but either upon necessity, or for some advantagious end, and that not but with great devotion, reverence, expiations, fasting, purity, prayers, invocations, vowes, sacrifices, consecrations, and such like sacred mysteries of religion. For these sacred ordinances were wont to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our works, especially to procure the divine good will, and pleasure, and the presence of the divine spirits, by whose dispensation the lot being directed, we may receive a true judgement of the things sought for. Every one therefore that works by lots, must go about it with a mind well disposed, not troubled, nor distracted, and with a strong desire, firm deliberation, and constant intention of knowing that which shall be desired. Moreover he must, being qualified with purity, chastity, and holiness towards God, and the celestials, with an undoubted hope, firm faith, and sacred orations, invocate them, that he may be made worthy of receiving the divine spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and knowing the divine pleasure; for if thou shalt be qualified, they will discover to thee most great secrets by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of lots, and thou shalt become a true Prophet, and able to speak truth concerning things past, present, and to come, of which thou shalt be demanded. Now what we have spoken here concerning lots, is also to be observed in the auguries of all discernings, <hi>viz</hi> when with fear, yet with a firm expectation we prefix to our souls for the sake of prophecying some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain works, or require a sign, as <hi>Eleasar Abrahams</hi> country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, &amp; <hi>Gideon</hi> Judge in <hi>Israel</hi> are read to have done. There was once at <hi>Pharis</hi> a City of <hi>Achaia</hi> in the midle of the market a statue of <hi>Mercury,</hi> where he that went to receive any omen, did, frankincense being fumed, and candles being lighted, which were set before it, and that country coin being offered on the right hand of the statue, whisper into the right ear of the statue whatsoever he would demand, and presently his ears being stopped with both his hands, did make hast away from the market place, which when he was past, did presently,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:52070:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his ears being opened, observe the first voice he did hear from any man for a certain Oracle given to him. Although there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these kinds of lots seem to the ignorant to be casuall, or fortuitous, and to have nothing of reason in them, yet they are disposed by God, and the higher vertues by certain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, neither they do fall beside the intention of him that moderates them. Was not the lot in choosing <hi>Saul</hi> to be King of <hi>Israel,</hi> thought to fall upon him casually, and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itously? Yet he was before appointed by the Lord to be King, and annointed by the Prophet <hi>Samuel.</hi> And God that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him King, disposed of the Lot that it should fall upon him. And thus much of these.</p>

               <p>WHosoever therefore being desirous to come to the Supream state of the soul, goeth to receive oracles, must go to them being chastly and devoutly disposed, being pure and clean go to them, so that his soul be polluted with no filthiness, and free from all guilt. He must also so purifie his mind and body as much as he may from all diseases, and passions, and all irrationall conditions, which adhere to it as rust to iron, by rightly composing and disposing those things which belong to the tranquillity of the mind; for by this means he shall receive the truer and more efficacious Oracles. Now by what things the mind is purged, and reduced into a divine purity, we must learn by Religion, and wisdom. For neither wisdom without Religion, nor Religion without wisdom is to be approved off. For wisdom (as saith <hi>Solomon)</hi> is the tree of life to them that lay hold on it. And <hi>Lucretius</hi> saith that it is the intention of God, or the breathings of God, where he sings.

               <p>He also understandeth that to be a divine illustration, whence <hi>Democritus</hi> thinketh that there are no men wise but they that are struck with some divine phrensie, as was <hi>Menos</hi> that Cretensian, whom they report learned all things of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> whence he had frequent converse with God in the mount <hi>Ida:</hi> so also the <hi>Athenians</hi> report that <hi>Melosagora Eleusinus</hi> was taught by the Nymphs; so also we read, that <hi>Hesiod</hi> when he was a Shepherd in <hi>Beotia,</hi> and kept his flock neer the mountain <hi>Helicon,</hi> had some pens given him by the <hi>Muses,</hi> which having received, he presently became a Poet, which to become so sodainly was not of man, but by a divine inspiration; for God conveying himself into holy souls, makes men Prophets, and workers of miracles, being powerfull in work and speech, as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Mercurius</hi> affirm, and also <hi>Xistus</hi> the <hi>Pythagorian,</hi> saying that such a man is the temple of God, and that God is his guest: to whom assents our <hi>Paul,</hi> calling man the temple of God; and in another place speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himself, I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me; for he is our power, without which (as he saith) we can do nothing; which also <hi>Aristotle</hi> confesseth in his <hi>Meteors</hi> and <hi>Ethicks,</hi> saying, that there is no vertue whether natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or morall but by God; and in his secrets he saith that a good and sound intellect can do nothing in the secrets of nature without the influence of divine vertue. Now we receive this influence then only, when we do acquit our selves from burdensome impediments, and from carnall and Terrene occupations, and from all externall agitation; neither can a blear or impure eye behold things too light, neither can he receive divine things who is ignorant of the purifying of his mind. Now we must come to this purity of mind by degrees,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:52070:275"/>
neither can any one that is initiated newly unto those myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries presently comprehend all cleer things, but his mind must be accustomed by degrees, untill the intellect becomes more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and applying it self to divine light be mixed with it. A humane soul therefore when it shall be rightly purged, and expiated, doth then, being loosed from all impurity, break forth with a liberall motion, and ascends upwards, receives divine things, instructs it self, when happily it seems to be instructed from elsswhere; neither doth it then need any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, or demonstration by reason of the industry of it self, as by its mind which is the head and the pilot of the soul, it doth, imitating by its own nature the angels, attain to what it desires, not by succession or time, but in a moment. For <hi>David</hi> when he had not learning, was of a Shepherd made a Prophet, and most expert of divine things. <hi>Solomon</hi> in the dream of one night, was filled with the knowledge of all things above and below. So <hi>Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> and the other Prophets, and Apostles were taught. For the soul (which is the common opinion of the <hi>Pythogorians,</hi> and <hi>Platonists)</hi> can by way of purification, without any other study, or searching only by an easie, and adventitious collating on these intelligibles received from above, acquire the perfect knowledge of all things knowable. It can also by an extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call expiation attain to this, as to understand all things In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibly by its substantiall form. For the mind is purged, and expiated by cleansing, by abstinence, by penitency, by almes: and then also do thereunto conduce certain sacred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, as shall afterward be discovered. For the soul is to be cured by the study of Religions, and indeed these which are commonly called occult, that being restored to its sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, confirmed by truth, and fortified by divine graces, may not fear any rising shakings.</p>

               </head>
               <p>VVE must therefore first observe cleanness in food, in works, in affections, and to put away all filthiness, and perturbations of the mind, and whatsoever sense or spirit that offends, and whatsoever things are in mind unlike to the heavens, not only if they be in mind and spirit, but also if they be in the body, or about the body: for such an externall cleanness is beleeved not to help a little to the purity of the mind. For this cause the <hi>Pythagorian</hi> Philosophers being taken with the desire of Oracles, divine praises being celebrated, did wash themselves in a river as in a bath, &amp; did put on white rayment and linen; for they did account wooll a prophane clothing being the excrements of beasts, and they did inhabit in a pure chamber, and altogether unspotted. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the <hi>Bragmanni</hi> the wise men of the <hi>Indians</hi> were wont to wash themselves naked in a fountain, which is called <hi>Dirce</hi> in <hi>Beotia,</hi> their heads being first annointed with amber drops, and odours fit for that purpose; then after they were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to custome sufficiently clean, they were to go forth about noon, clothed in white linen, with a white attire having rings on their fingers and staves in their hands. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner amongst the <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> it was a custom to wash them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thrice in a day, and twice in the night in cold water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they entred into the holy places. They did also every day use linen garments every day newly washed. We read also of the manner of this kind of washing in <hi>Hesiod</hi> in his books of works and dayes, where he sings,
<q>
                     <l>None dare with hands unwashed unto Jove</l>
                     <l>Wine pour forth, nor unto the gods above;</l>
                     <l>For then they do refuse for to be heard,</l>
                     <l>Though being pray'd unto—</l>

                     <l>When wicked men the rivers do passe by</l>
                     <l>With hands unwash'd, then are the gods angry</l>
                     <l>With them, and them afflict—</l>
                  </q>
Hence in <hi>Virgil, Aeneas</hi> thus speaks to his father,
<q>
                     <l>O Father, take the houshold gods, and hold</l>
                     <l>Them in thy sacred hands; to be so bold</l>
                     <l>As them to handle after so great fights</l>
                     <l>I dare not till that wash'd in streams most bright.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It was also a custome amongst the Gentiles, when they were wont to perform any holy services to the gods, to cleanse their bodies by washing; and when they were to contend with the infernall gods, sprinkling only did suffice. Hence in <hi>Virgil, Dido,</hi> when she did perform any solemnities to the gods, saith,
<q>
                     <l>Cause that my sister Ann (my nurse most dear:)</l>
                     <l>Come, and my body wash with water clear.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And in another place where <hi>Aeneas</hi> is brought in amongst the infernals bringing a bough to <hi>Proserpina,</hi> he sing thus,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>The passage doth</hi> Aeneas <hi>keep, and wash</hi>

Also when he relates of <hi>Misenus</hi> to be buried, he sings,

                     <l>His friends he thrice did wash with water new,</l>
                     <l>And with an Olive branch, wett in the dew,</l>

               <p>ABstinence also doth commonly fortifie, and defend the observers thereof against vices, and evil Demons, and makes the mind an unpolluted temple of God, uniting it to God. For nothing doth more conduce to health, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the complexion, then not to heap together super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, and not to exceed the bounds of necessary food. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is nutriment to be taken that is too strong for nature, but rather let nature be stronger then the meat, as some affirm of Christ, that he took meat in that proportoin that it should not breed any excrement of the third concoction. Many others also taking meat sparingly, enjoyed thereby health and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of body, as <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who fasted fortie dayes: whence his face shined, and he lifted up, could easily guide his body as if it were a spirit. For Magicians, and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers affirm that our spirit is not as a terrene thing, or body nourished by nutriment received through certain organs by the concoction of meat, and drink, but draws in their aliment like sponges through the whole body, <hi>viz.</hi> from the thin va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours penetrating the body on all sides. Therefore they that desire to have this spirit pure, and potent, let them use dryet meats, and extenuate this gross body with fastings, and they
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:52070:277"/>
make it easily penetrable, and least by the weight thereof, the spirit should either become thick, or be suffocated, let them preserve the body clean by lotions, frictions, exercises, and clothings, and corroborate their spirits by lights, and fumes, and bring it to a pure and thin finess. We must therefore in taking of meats be pure, and abstinent, as the <hi>Pythagorian</hi> Philosophers, who keeping a holy and sober table, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract their life in all temperance. The temperance therefore of life and complexion, because thereby no superfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is bred, which may dull the phantasie, makes, that our soul oftentimes dreaming, and sometimes watching, is alwayes subjected to the superiour influences. Moreover the <hi>Pythagori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> if any one doth by abstinence moderate prudently every motion of the mind, and body, promise perpetuall health of both, and long life. So the <hi>Bragmani</hi> did admit none to their colledge, but those that were abstinent from wine, from flesh, and vices, saying that none could understand God, but they that emulate him by a divine conversation: which also <hi>Phraotes</hi> in <hi>Philostrates</hi> taught the lower <hi>Indians.</hi> Moreover we must abstain from all those things which infect either the mind, or spirit, as from covetousness, and envy, which are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids to injustice (as <hi>Hermes</hi> saith) enforcing the mind and the hand to evil practices; also from idleness, and luxury; for the soul being suffocated with the body, and lust, cannot foresee any celestiall thing. Wherefore the priests of the <hi>Athenians</hi> who are called in Greek <hi>Hierophantae</hi> (as <hi>Hierom</hi> reports) that they might live more chastly in their sacred employments, and might follow their divine affairs without lust, were wont to castrate themselves by drinking of hemlock. Moreover the chastity of a mind devoted to God doth make our mind (as <hi>Orpheus</hi> teacheth <hi>Museus</hi> in the hymne of all the gods) a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall temple of God. Also we must abstain from all multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and variety of senses, affections, imaginations, opinions, and such like passions, which hurt the mind and pervert the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reason, as we manifestly see in the lascivious, the envious, and ambitious. Wherefore <hi>Cicero</hi> (in his <hi>Tusculans</hi> questions) cals these passions the sicknesses of the mind, and
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:52070:278"/>
the pestiferous diseases thereof. But <hi>Horace</hi> calls them furies or madness, where he sings,
<q>Girles have a thousand furies, so have boyes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The same also seems to be of opinion that all men are fools in something. Whence it is read in <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> there are an infinite number of fools. Therefore the <hi>Stoicks</hi> deny that passions are incident to a wise man; I say such passions, which follow the sensitive apprehension: for rational, and mental passions, they yeld a wise man may have. This opinion did <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> seem to be of, where he sings that some passions are to be laid aside in the inquisition of truth, in these verses,
<q>
                     <l>If truth thou wouldst discover with cleer sight,</l>
                     <l>And walk in the right path, then from thee quit</l>
                     <l>Joy, fear, grief, hope expell; for where these raign,</l>
                     <l>The mind is dark and bound—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We must therefore acquit and avert our minds from all multitudes, and such like passions, that we may attain to the simple truth; which indeed many Philosophers are said to have attained to in the solitude of a long time. For the mind by solitude being loosed from all care of humane affaires is at leasure, and prepared to receive the gifts of the celestial die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. So <hi>Moses</hi> the law-giver to the Hebrews, and the greatest of prophets, and learned in all the knowledge of the <hi>Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> when he would abstract himself from senses, went into the vast wildernesses of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> where all humane affaires being laid aside, he applied his mind to the sole contemplation of divine things, in which thing he so pleased the omnipotent God, that he suffered him to see him face to face, and also gave him a wondrous power of miracles, as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writ testifies of him. So <hi>Zoroastes</hi> the father and prince of the Magicians, is said to attain to the knowledge of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and divine things by the solitude of twenty years, when he wrot, and did very strange things concerning all the art of
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:52070:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
divining, and soothsaying. The like things do the writings of <hi>Orpheus</hi> to <hi>Museus</hi> declare him to have done in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts of <hi>Thracia.</hi> So we read that <hi>Epimenides</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> because learned by a very long sleep, for they say that he slept fifty years, <hi>i. e.</hi> to have lay hid so long; <hi>Fythagoras</hi> also in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to have layen hid ten years, and <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> and <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> for the same cause were delighted with solitariness. For by how much the more we have the animal and the humane life, by so much the more we live like angels, and God, to which being conjoyned, and brought into a better condition, we have power over all things, ruling over all. Now how our mind is to be separated from an animal life, and from all multitude, and to be erected, untill it ascend to that very one, good, true, and perfect, through each degree of things know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and knowledges, <hi>Proclus</hi> teacheth in his Commentaries upon <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> shewing how that first sensible things are to be shunned, that we may pass to an incorporeal essence, where we must exceed the order of souls yet multiplied by divers rules, habitudes, and various proportions, many bonds, and a manifold variety of forces, and to strive after an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and intelligible kingdome, and to contemplate how far better these are then souls. Moreover we must bear an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual multitude, although united, and individuall, and come to the superintellectual and essential unity, absolute from all multitude, and the very fountain of good, and truth. In like manner we must avoid all knowledge that doth any waies distract, and deceive, that we may obtain the most simple truth. The multitude therefore of affections, senses, imaginations, and opinions is to be left, which in it self is as different, as some things are contrary to others in any subject; and we must ascend to sciences, in which although there be a various maltitude, yet there is no contrariety. For all are knit one to the other, and do serve one the other, under one the other, untill they come to one, presupposed by all, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing none beyond it; to which all the rest must be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: yet that is not the highest top of knowledges, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it is a pure intellect. Therefore all composition, division,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:52070:279"/>
and various discourse being laid aside, let us, ascending to the intellectual life, and simple sight, behold the intelligible es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with individual and simple precepts, that we may attain to the highest being of the soul, by which we are one, and under which our multitude is united. Therefore let us attain to the first unity, from whom there is a union in all things, through that one which is as the flower of our essence: which then at length we attain to, when avoyding all multitude we do arise into our very unity, are made one, and act uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formely.</p>

               <p>NOw the greatest part of purgations is a voluntary peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency for faults for (as saith <hi>Seneca</hi> in <hi>Thyeste)</hi> he whom it grieves that he hath offended, is in a manner innocent. This brings to us the greatest expiation, whilest it opposeth afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to delights, and purgeth out of the soul a stupid joyfulness, and gives a certain peculiar power, reducing us to the things above. Penitency therefore is not only a mortification of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but a spiritual Martyrdome of the soul; which with the sword of the spirit is on all sides mortified; Now the sword of the spirit is the word of God; whence <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet saith, and also <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to the <hi>Ephesians, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is he that with-holdeth his sword from blood;</hi> and the Psalmist sings; <hi>A sword is in their lips.</hi> Therefore our cogitations, affections of our mind, and all evils that proceed from our heart and mouth, must be uttered to the priest in confession, that he may according to the word of God judge those things; and according to the power granted to him by God, penitency being joyned with it, may purifie, &amp; purge them, &amp; direct them to that which is good, neither is there found in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for the expiating hainous offences a stronger Sacrament. Hence the Gods themselves <hi>(Ovid</hi> in <hi>Pontus</hi> being witnes)
<q>

               </p>
               <p>There is as yet another Sacrament of expiation, <hi>viz.</hi> Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, of which as I remember I have read very little in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, but the very truth taught us that, saying, Give ye almes, and all things shall be clean to you; and in <hi>Eclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> it is read; as water extinguisheth fire, so almes doth sin; and <hi>Daniel</hi> taught the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that he should redeem his sin by almes; and the Angel <hi>Raphael</hi> testifieth to <hi>Tobias;</hi> because alms frees from death, and is that which purgeth sins, and make us find eternal life. Hence Christ commanded us to pray to the Father, Forgive as we forgive others, give us as we give to others; of which he said in another place, ye shall receive an hundred fold, and shall possess eternal life. He shall when he comes to judge the quick and the dead, upbraid the wicked above all things for their neglect of almes and works of mercy, when he shall say, I was hungry, and thirsty, and ye gave me neither meat, nor drink; and in another place he speaks of the poor; what ye have done to any one of them ye have done to me. Which <hi>Homer</hi> also seems to be sensible of, when he brings in a yong man wooing <hi>Antinoe,</hi> saying these words, <hi>Antinoe</hi> how plausibly hast thou slain a poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar! he shall destroy thee if God be in heaven, for the Gods themselves being likened to strangers, and guests, go out into the whole world, overturning Cities, and beholding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaries, and wickednesse of men.</p>

certain institutions, and sacraments ministred outwardly, as by sacrifices, baptismes, and adjurations, benedictions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations, sprinklings of holy water, by anoyntings, and fumes, not so much consecrated to this, as having a naturall power thus to do; upon this account sulphur hath a place in Religions, to expiate ill Demons with the fume thereof. An egge also was wont to be used in Purgations; hence eggs are called holy, whence <hi>Ovid,</hi>

                  <hi>Proclus</hi> also writes, that the priests in purifyings were wont to use sulphur, and bitumen, or the washing of sea water: For sulphur purifies by the sharpness of its odour, and sea water by reason of its fiery part; In like manner the hearb Cinquefoil: wherefore by reason of its purity the ancient priests did use it in purifications, also the boughs of Olives. For these are said to be of so great purity, that they report that an olive tree planted by an harlot is thereby for ever made unfruitfull, or else withers. In like manner, frankincense, myrrhe, vervain, valerian, and the hearb called Phu conduce to expiation. Also the blessed Clove flower; and the gall of a black dog being fumed is said to be very powerfull in these, as well for expiating of ill spirits, as any bewitchings: also the feathers of a lapwing being fumed, drives away <hi>Phantasmes.</hi> It is wonderfull, and scarce credible, but that that grave and worthy Author <hi>Josephus</hi> relates it in his history of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> of a root of <hi>Baaras,</hi> so called from a place neer <hi>Machernus</hi> a Town of <hi>Judea,</hi> being of a yellow colour, that in the night it did shine, and was hard to be taken, that it did oftentimes deceive the hands of them that went to take it, and go out of their sight, never stood still, till the urine of a menstrous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was sprinkled on it. Neither yet being thus retained, is it pulled up without danger, but suddain death fals upon him that drawes it up, unless he were fortified with an amulet of the said root; which they that want, sacrificing about the earth do bind

the root to a dog by a cord, and presently depart: at length the dog with a great deal of pains drawes up the root, and as it were supplying the place of his master presently dies, after which any one may handle the root without danger; the power of which is much excellent in expiations, as is manifest for the delivery of those that are vexed with unclean spirits; now that these kind of waters should act upon spirituall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances by putting them to flight, or by alluring them, or mitigating them, or by inciting them, they are of no other opinion then that the fire of <hi>Sicilia</hi> acts upon souls: which <hi>(William</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> being witness) not hurting the bodies, doth most intolerably torment the souls of them that are neer.

But often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that King and Prophet <hi>David</hi> perceives it, when he saith, I will hear what the Lord will speak in me. Adoration therefore being a long time continued, and often frequented, perfects the intellect, and makes the soul more large for the receiving of divine lights, inflaming divine love, producing faith, hope, and sacred manners, purifieth the soul from all contrariety, and what is any away adverse to it, and doth also repell divers evils, which would otherwise naturally fall out.

               </p>
               <p>Now man is returned to God by prayers, by which coming he (saith <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Phedrus)</hi> stops horses, and enters into the chambers of repose, where he feeds upon <hi>Ambrosia,</hi> and drinks <hi>Nectar.</hi> Therefore they that desire to enjoy any vertue, must pray, and supplicate often to him who hath all vertue in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Now that is the best prayer, which is not uttered in words, but that which with a Religious silence and sincere cogitation is offered to God, and that which with the voice of the mind and words of the intellectuall world is offered to him. Now a vow is an ardent affection of a chast mind given up to God, which by vowing wisheth that which seems good. This affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as <hi>Jamblicus,</hi> and <hi>Proclus</hi> testifie) doth so joyn the soul to God, that the operation of the mind and of God is one; <hi>viz.</hi> of God as an artificer, of the mind as a divine instrument: all antiquity testifies that by vowes sometimes miracles are done, diseases are cured, tempests are diverted, and such like. Hence we read that the most excellent, and wise in all nations, the <hi>Bragmanni</hi> of the <hi>Indians</hi> the Magicians of the <hi>Persians,</hi> the <hi>Gymnosopists</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> the divines of the Greeks, and <hi>Caldeans</hi> which did excell in divine secrets, did apply themselves to divine vowes, and prayers, and thereby did effect many wonderfull things. Now to the perfection of a vow, and adoration (for a vow cannot be perfect without an adoration, nor an adoration without a vow) there are two things especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally required, <hi>viz.</hi> First the knowledge of the thing to be ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to which we must vow, and in what manner, and order, and by what Mediums it must be worshipped; for there are various cooperators and instruments of God, <hi>viz</hi> The heavens, Stars, and ministring spirits, the celestiall souls, and Heroes, which we must implore as porters, interpreters, administrators, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, but first of all him, who goeth to the Archetype God, who only is the utmost term of adoration; the others dieties
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:52070:281"/>
are as it were passages to that very God. Know therefore that adorations and vowes must with a pure and pious mind be principally made to that one only God, the highest father, King and Lords of all the god. But when they shall come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the inferiour gods, let the intention of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration be terminated in them; therefore to adorations, and vowes, when they be directed to the inferiour dieties, <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roastes</hi> and <hi>Orpheus</hi> thought fitting that suffumigations and characters should be used; But when they are erected to the majesty of the supream God, they must not in any wise; which also <hi>Hermes,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> forbid to be done. Whence <hi>Hermes</hi> to <hi>Tatius;</hi> This (saith he) is like to sacriledge when thou prayest to God to be willing to kindle frankincense, and such like; For (saith <hi>Porphyrie)</hi> they are not agreeable to piety. For there is not any materiall thing can be found, which to the immateriall God is not unclean. Therefore neither is that prayer which is uttered by words agreeable to him, nor that prayer which is mentall, if the mind be polluted with vice; Secondly there is also required a certain assimilation of our life to the divine life, in purity, chastity and holiness, with a lawfull desire of that which we wish for; for by this means we especially obtain the divine benevolence, and are subjected to the divine bounty; for unlesse we, having our minds purged, be worthy to be heard; and also those things which we desire, be worthy to be done, it is manifest that the gods will not hearken to our prayers; whence divine <hi>Plato</hi> saith that God cannot be bound by our prayers or gifts to do unjust things; therefore let us desire nothing of God, which we think uncomely to wish fore for by this means only, we see that very many are frustrated of their prayers and vowes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that neither they themselves are Religiously disposed, nor are their desires and prayers made for those things which are well pleasing to God, neither do they know to discern in what order they ought to pray, and through what mediatours they ought to go to God; the ignorance of which doth very oft reduce our prayers and supplications to nothing, and causeth our desires and wishes to be denied.</p>

               <p>ASacrifice is an oblation which is both holy by offering, and sanctifieth and maketh Holy the offerer, unless either Irreverence or some other sin be an impediment to him; therefore these sacrifices and oblations do yeld us much hope, and make us of the family of God, and do repel from us many evils hanging over our heads, which the doctors of the Hebrews do especially confirm, saying by this that we kill our living creatures, and dissipate our wealth by sacrifice, we turn away mischiefes which do hang over us: for as this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall priest sacrificeth in this inferior world the soul of irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures to God, by the separating of the body from the soul: so <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel the priest of the higher world, sacrificeth the souls of men, and this by the separation of the soul from the body, and not of the body from the soul, unless perchance, as it happeneth in fury, Rapture, Extasie and sleep, and such like vacations of the soul, which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews call the death of the body. But sacrifices &amp; oblations are first of all and principally to be offered up to the most high God; but when they are to be directed to the secondary divine powers, this ought to be done even as we have spoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning prayers and vows: but there are many kinds of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: one kind is called a burnt offering, when the thing sacrificed was consumed by fire; another, is an offering for the effusion of blood; moreover there are salutiferous sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are made for the obtaining of health, others paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying for obtaining peace, others praising for the freeing from some evill, and for the bestowing of some good thing; others Gratulatory, for divine worship and thanksgiving; but some sacrifices are made neither for the honor of God, nor out of good will, of which sort was that amongst the Hebrews, called the sacrifice of Jealousie, which was made only for the detecting
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:52070:282"/>
of occult adultery. There was in times past amongst the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles the sacrifice of expiation, by the which cities were purged from famine, pestilence, or some horrible calamity; whose rites were to search out the most wicked man in that city, and to lead him to the place appointed carrying in his hands a cheese and wafers and dry figs; afterwards to whip him seven times with Rods, and then to burn him to ashes with the same rods, and to cast the ashes into the sea; of these <hi>Lycophron</hi> and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponax</hi> make mention; neither doth <hi>Philostratus</hi> relate things much different from these, concerning <hi>Apollonius</hi> of <hi>Tiana</hi> while he chased away the Pestilence from <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Moreover there were many kind of sacrifices and offeringsas <hi>Agonalia, Dapsa, Farreationes, Hecatombe, Hostia, Hyacinthia, Armilustra, Janualia, Lucalia, Lupercalia, Munychia, Novendinalia, Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiluca, Palatialia, Pastillaria, Popularia, Protervia, Scenope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, Solitaurilia, Stata, Rubigalia, Fontanalia, Ormia, Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia, Inferiae, Consualia, Lampteria, Amburbia, Ambarvalia, Vivalta, Thyia, Holocaustomata, Orgia, Latialia, Dianetaurica, Bacchanalia, Trieterica, Liberalia, Cocytia, Cerealia, Thesmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoria, Adonia, Teonia, Laurentalia, Opalia, Palilia, Quirina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, Vertumnalia, Gynaecia, Panathenea, Quinquatria, Diapalia, Diasia, Horma, Hormea, Nemea, Mytriaca, Palogygia.</hi> And the offerings of these were proper and diverse; for a Goat and an Ass were sacrificed to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> a Sow to <hi>Ceres,</hi> an horse to the <hi>Sun,</hi> an hart and dogs to <hi>Diana,</hi> an Ass to <hi>Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apus,</hi> a Goose to <hi>Isis,</hi> a dunghil-cock to the <hi>Night,</hi> a she-Goate to <hi>Faunus,</hi> a Bull to <hi>Neptune,</hi> a she-Goate to <hi>Minerva,</hi> a Bull to <hi>Hercules,</hi> a child to <hi>Saturn,</hi> a Sow with piggs to <hi>Maja,</hi> a Cock to <hi>Aesculapius:</hi> moreover they did sacrifice to <hi>Hercules Gnidius</hi> with scoulding and railings; there were also diverse orders of Priests, as high priests, <hi>Flamines, Archisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, Phylades, Salians, Hierophantes</hi> &amp; diverse names of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and superstitions, and sacrifices, ceremonies, feasts, consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, dedications, vowes, devotions, expiations, oathes, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, satisfactory works; by the which the seduced gentiles did sacrifice to false Gods and devils; but the true sacrifice, which purgeth any man, and uniteth him to God, is twofold; one
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:52070:283"/>
which the high priest Christ offered for the remission of sins, purifying all things by the blood of his cross; the other, by the which a man offereth up himself clean unspotted, for a living sacrifice to God, as Christ the high priest offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and taught us to be offered together with him, as he was offered, saying of the sacrament of his body, and blood, Do this in remembrance of me; <hi>viz.</hi> that we should offer our selves together, being mortified by the passion of his mortal body, and quickned in spirit; of the which <hi>Porphyry</hi> saith, Let us labor to offer up holines of life for a sacrifice; for no man can be a good priest of God, but he which bringeth forth himself for a sacrifice, and buildeth up his own soul, as it were for an Image, and doth constitute both his mind, and understanding for a Temple in the which he may receive the divine light; but eternal sacrifices (as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> saith) are certain cures of the soul, instituted by the most High Physitian; for the evill spirit possesseth a man (as <hi>Proclus</hi> saith) even untill he be expiated by sacrifices; therefore sacrifices are required to pacifie God and the Heavenly powers, and to expiate a man, who beareth the Image both of God and the world; But our Lord Jesus Christ the true high priest concluded all sacrifices in bread and wine only, as in the primary substance of mans meat, needing further the offering up of no animals, nor other things, or the effusion of blood, in which we may be cleansed, being perfectly cleansed in his blood. There were also amongst the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> sixhundred sixty six kinds of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; for they did appoynt divine honors, and holy sacrifices to each star, and planet, because they were divine animals partaking of an intellectual soul and a divine mind; whence they say that the stars being humbly prayed unto, do hear our prayer, and bestow celestial gifts, not so much by any natural agreement, as by their own free will. And this is that which <hi>Jamblicus</hi> saith, that celestial bodies, and the dieties of the world have certain divine and superior powers in themselves, as also natural and inferior, which <hi>Orpheus</hi> calls the keyes to open and shut; and that by those we are bound to the fatall influencies, but by these to loose us from fate. Whence
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:52070:283"/>
if any misfortune hang over any one from <hi>Saturn,</hi> or from <hi>Mars,</hi> the Magicians command that he must not forthwith fly to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> but to <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars</hi> themselves. So that <hi>Apuleian Psyche</hi> who was persecuted by <hi>Venus</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualling her in beauty, was forced to importune for favor, not from <hi>Ceres,</hi> or <hi>Juno,</hi> but from <hi>Venus</hi> her self. Now they did sacrifice to each star with things belonging to them; to the <hi>Sun</hi> with solary things, and its animals, as a Laurel tree, a Cock, a Swan, a Bull; to <hi>Venus</hi> with her animals, as a Dove, or turtle, and by her plants, as Vervain; as <hi>Virgil</hi> sings,
<q>
                     <l>—Water bring out</l>
                     <l>With garlands soft, the altar round about</l>
                     <l>Compass, and burn fat boughs and frankincense</l>
                     <l>Thats strong and pure—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover the Magicians when they made any confection either natural, or artificial, belonging to any star, this did they afterward religiously offer, and sacrifice to the same star, receiving not so much a natural vertue from the influence thereof being oppottunly received, as by that religious oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on receiving it divinely confirmed and stronger. For the oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any thing, when it is offered to God after aright manner, that thing is sanctified by God by the oblation as is a sacrifice, and is made part thereof. Moreover to the celestial and ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Gods white sacrifices were offered; but to the terrestial or infernal, black: but to the terrestial upon the altars, but to the infernal in ditches; to the aerial and watery flying things: But to these white, to these black. Finally, to all the Gods and Demons besides terrestial and infernal, flying things were offered, but to those only four-footed animals, for like rejoyceth in like. Of these only which were offered to the celestial, and etherial, it is lawfull to eat, the extream parts being reserved for God, but of the other not. Now all these the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> hath expressed in these verses,
<q>
                     <pb n="536" facs="tcp:52070:284"/>
                     <l>A threefold sacrifice to th' Gods above,</l>
                     <l>White must be slain for them; for them below</l>
                     <l>Threefold also, but black for them; withall</l>
                     <l>With open altars Gods celestiall</l>
                     <l>Are taken, when th' infernal Gods require</l>
                     <l>Pits embru'd with black blood, and fill'd with mire,</l>
                     <l>And are not pleas'd but with a sacrifice</l>
                     <l>That's buried; but of th' aire the dieties</l>
                     <l>Delight in honey, and in wines most clear,</l>
                     <l>And that on altars kindled be the fire,</l>
                     <l>Require, with flying sacrifice, and white:</l>
                     <l>But of the earth the dieties delight</l>
                     <l>That earthly bodies should with frankinsense</l>
                     <l>And wafers offered be in reverence.</l>
                     <l>But for the Gods that rule the sea thou must</l>
                     <l>Thy sacrifices lay on the sea coasts,</l>
                     <l>And on the waves cast the whole animal.</l>
                     <l>But to the dieties celestial</l>
                     <l>Give th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extream parts, and them consume with fire;</l>
                     <l>What then remains thou maist if thon desire</l>
                     <l>Eat up, and let the air with vapors thick</l>
                     <l>And sweet smelling drop—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>These doth <hi>Porphyry</hi> make mention of in his book of ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, to whom the rest assent. For they say that these sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are certain natural Mediums betwixt the Gods and men; which <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirming saith, that to sacrifice to God is in a man naturally. They are therefore they say, Mediums, which savor of the nature of both, and represent divine things ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically, and have with the diety to whom they are offered, certain convenient anlogies, but so occult that a mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing can scarce conceive of them, which God, and the Dieties require in particular for our expiation with which the celestial vertues are pleased, and withhold themselves from execution of the punishment which our sins deserve. And these are (as <hi>Orpheus</hi> calls them) keys which open the gate
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:52070:284"/>
of the elements and the heavens, that by them a man may ascend to the supercelestials; and the intelligences of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the demons of the elements may descend to him. Now men that are perfect, and truly Religious need them not, but only they, who (saith <hi>Trismegistus)</hi> being fallen into disorder, are made the servants of the heavens and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; who because they are subjected to the heavens, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think they may be corroborated by the favour of the celestiall vertue, untill they flying higher be acquitted from their presidency, and become more sublime then they.</p>

               </head>
               <p>NOw let us see what imprecations they did joyn to obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and sacrifices; For he that did offer any sacrifice to God, did say these, or the like things: I thy servant do offer and sacrifice these things to thee; I confesse that thou art the author of all sanctity, and I call upon thee to sanctifie this oblation, that thou wouldst pour upon it the vertue of thy high and excellent spirit, that by it we may obtain what we ask for. Moreover also as this thing present by any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations is made thine, as to live, or die to thee, so also let me be made thine who by this oblation, and communion, by this thing which I come to offer, and sacrifice to thee, profess to be one of thy family, and worshippers. Besides in offerings it was said, As that animal is in my power to be slain, if I pleased, or to be saved: so it is in thy power to take away in wrath, or to give in love that which we desire. Lastly, when for expiation, or the avoyding of any evil, any sacrifice was to be made, it was said, As that animall dies in my hand, so die all vice in me, also all uncleanness, or so let die and be annihilated such or such an evil, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity. Also, As the blood of this animal is poured forth
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:52070:285"/>
out of its body, so let all vice and uncleanness flow out from me. In sacrifices laid on the altarto be burnt, it was said, as this oblation is consumed by this present fire, so that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of it; so let all evil be consumed in me, or let such or such an evil which we would repell and avoyd be consumed. It was also a custom when imprecation was made, to touch the altar with the hands of all those for whom such a sacrifice was made, or of them who did desire to be partakers of it, because prayer only cannot prevail, unless he that prayes toucheth the altar with his hands; whence in <hi>Uirgil,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Those that in these words pray, and altar touch</l>

                     <l>I touch the altars, and the middle fires,</l>

               </head>
               <p>EVery Adoration therefore, oblation, or sacrifice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation, invocation, are differenced thus, <hi>viz.</hi> either because they are made to God only, or to inferiour dieties, as angels, Stars, Heroes. In these therefore such rules are to be observed, that when any prayer is to be offered to God alone for the obtaining of any effect, it must be done with the commemoration of some work, miracle, sacrament, or promise, taken somewhere out of scripture; as if there be a deprecation made for the destruction of enemies, let it be commemorated that God destroyed the Giants in the deluge of waters, and the builders of <hi>Babel</hi> in the confusion of tongues, <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> in raining of fire, the host of <hi>Pharoah</hi> in the Red-sea, and the like; adding to those
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:52070:285"/>
some malediction out of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> or such as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of other places of scripture. In like manner when we are to deprecate against dangers of waters, let us comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate the saving of <hi>Noah</hi> in the flood; the passing of the children of <hi>Israel</hi> through the Red-sea, and Christ walking dryshod upon the waters, and saving a ship from shipwrack, commanding the winds and waves, and lifting up <hi>Peter</hi> sinking in the waters of the sea, and such like. But if a prayer be necessary for obtaining Oracles, or dreames, whether it be to God, Angels, or Heroes, there are many places offer themselves out of the old testament, where God is said to talk with men, promising in very many places Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, and Revelations, besides the propheticall dreams of <hi>Jacob, Joseph, Pharoah, Daniel, Nebuchadnezzer,</hi> in the old Testament, and the Revelation of <hi>John, Paul,</hi> in the new; also of holy Magicians, as <hi>Helen, Constantine</hi> and <hi>Charles;</hi> also of later Prophets, as <hi>Methedius, Cyrillus, Joa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim, Merlin, Brigitta, Mechtindis, Hildegardis,</hi> the dieties of whom being piously invocated, render us oftentimes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of divine Revelations. Moreover we must invocate the sacred names of God, but those especially, which are significative of the thing desired, or any way applicable to it; as for the destruction of enemies we must invocate the name of Gods wrath, of the revenge of God, fear of God, justice of God, fortitude of God: but for the avoiding of any danger we must invocate the names of pity, defence, salvation, goodness, and the like. Moreover we must peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for and to the effecters of the thing desired, <hi>viz.</hi> such an Angel, Star or Heroe on whom that office lies; but observing that our invocation on them must be made with due number, weight, and measure, and according to the rules delivered concerning inchantments. For betwixt these there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but that inchantments are such as affect our mind, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Passions thereof into a conformity to certain die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but prayers are such as are exhibited to any diety by way of worship, and veneration; and from the same root also may the manner of consecrations be taken, of which we shall in the next place speak.</p>

               <head>CAAP. LXII. <hi>Of Consecrations, and their manner.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>COnsecration is a lifting up of experiments, by which a spirituall soul, being drawn by proportion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, is infused into the matter of our works according to the tradition of Magiciall art rightly and lawfully prepared, and our work is vivified by the spirit of understanding. The efficacy of consecrations is perfected by two things especially, <hi>viz</hi> the vertue of the person himself consecrating, and the vertue of the prayer it self. In the person himself is required holinesse of life, and a power to consecrate; the former, nature and desert perform; the latter is acquired by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and dignification, of which we have spoken elsewhere. Then it is necessary that he that sacrificeth must know this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power in himself, with a firm and undoubted faith. Now what things are required in prayer, are these. There is also a certain power of sanctifying placed in it by God, as if it be so ordained of God for this or that very thing (of which sort we read of many in the holy writ) or instituted to this or that thing, by the vertue of the holy ghost, according to the ordination of the Church, of which sort are many every where extant: or this holiness is in the prayer it selfe, not by vertue of institution, but of the commemoration of sacred things, as of sacred letters, histories, miracles, works, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, favours, promises, sacraments and such sacramentall things, which shall seem to cohere with the thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated, either properly, or improperly or analogically. And of these we shall now give some examples, by which a way easily may be laid open to the whole consideration of it. So in the consecrating of water there is this commemoration made, <hi>viz.</hi> because God placed the firmament in the midel: of waters; because in the middle of the earthly paradise he made a holy fountain, from which through four rivers the whole earth is watered: because he made the waters an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of his justice, in the destruction of the Giants, by
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:52070:286"/>
the generall deluge over the whole earth: and in the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Army of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the Red sea, and because he led the people dry-shod through the middle of the Red sea, and through the middle of Jordan, and because he brought water miraculously out of a rock of the wilderness, and brought forth a fountain of living water out of the jaw bone of an asse at the prayers of <hi>Sampson,</hi> and because he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the waters as an instrument of his pity, and of salvation for remission of sins: and because Christ being baptized in Jordan, purified and sanctified the waters; and the like also by invocating divine names sutable to these things, as when God is called a living fountain, living water, a living river. In like manner in consecration of fire, let there be a commemoration that God created the fire to be an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his justice for punishment, revenge, purgation of sins, and when he comes to judge the world he wil command burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go before; and he appeared to <hi>Moses</hi> in a burning bush, went before the children of <hi>Israel</hi> in a pillar of fire, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that inextinguishable fire should be kept in the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Covenant, &amp; kept fire unextinguished under the water. Also we must use such divine names as offer themselves, as because God is a consuming fire, and a melting fire: and such as are proper to these, as the shining of God, the light of God, the brightness of God, and such like. So in the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of oil such solemnities must be commemorated as belong to these, as in <hi>Exodus</hi> the oil of unction &amp; sweet perfumes and sacred names sutable to these, such as is the name <hi>Christ,</hi> which signifies annointed, and such as this, and that in the Apocalyps concerning the two olive trees distilling sanctified oil into lamps burning in the presence of God. So in the consecration of places let there be commemoration made of mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, of the <hi>sanctum sanctorum,</hi> the temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and of the sanctification of the hill <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha</hi> through the mystery of the passion of Christ, and of the field which was bought with the price of Christs blood; also of mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> where the transfiguration and ascent into heaven was. Sacred names also being used as of the place of God,
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:52070:287"/>
the throne of God, the chair of God, the tabernacle of God, the altar of God, the seat of God, and the habitation of God, and of such like. After the same manner we must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the benediction of other things, by enquiring into ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly write by divine names, and profession of Religion for such things which may seem to be after a manner sutable to this or that thing. As for example, if there be a paper, or a book having some of the mysteries which we should comemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as the tables of the ten commandments given to <hi>Moses</hi> on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and the sanctification of the law, and of the Prophets, and Scriptures promulgated by the holy spirit: and let the divine names of the testament of God, the book of God, the book of life, the knowledge of God, the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and of such like be commemorated. So if a sword be to be consecrated, we may remember out of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Maccabees</hi> there was a sword sent from God to <hi>Judas Macchabeus,</hi> that he should destroy the children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> enemies: also that in the prophets, Take unto you two edged swords; also in the Gospel, coats being sold, swords must be bought; and in the History of <hi>David</hi> an Angel was seen hiding a bloody sword; and many such like we shall find in the Prophets, and <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> as also the sacred names of the sword of God, the rod of God, the staff of God, the vengeance of God, and such like. And now let these things which have been exemplified concerning reall conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations, and benedictions suffice: by which personall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations, and benedictions may easily be understood. But there is yet another powerfull and efficacious rite of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating, and expiating, which is of the kinds of superstitious, <hi>viz:</hi> when the rite of any sacrament is transsumed to another thing, which is intended to be consecrated, or expiated, as the rite of baptisme, confirmation, funerall, and such like. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over we must know, that a vow, oblation, and sacrifice, have a certain power of consecration, as well reall as personall, as the things or persons are vowed or offered.</p>

               <p>NOw those things are called sacred, which are made holy by the gods themselves, or their Demons, being (as I may say) dedicated to us by the gods themselves. By this account we call Demons holy, because in them God dwels, whose name they are often said to bear. Whence it is read in <hi>Exodus:</hi> I will send my Angel who shall go before thee; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve him, neither think that he is to be despised, because my name is in him. So also mysteries are called sacred. For a mystery is that which hath a holy and an occult vertue, and favour given by the gods or Demons, or despensed by the most high God himself; such as are those sacred names and Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, which have been above spoken of. So the crosse is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led holy and mysterious, being made so by the passion of Jesus Christ. Hence also certain prayers are called holy, and mysticall which are not instituted by the devotion of man, but by divine Revelation, as we read in the Gospel that Christ instituted the Lords Prayer. In like manner certain confections are called holy, into which God hath put the especiall beam of his vertue, as we read in <hi>Exodus</hi> of the sweet perfume, and oil of anointing, and as with us there is a sacred fountain, and a sacred ointment; There is also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of holiness, whereby we call those things holy which are dedicated and consecrated by men to God, as vows, and sacrifices, of which we have spoken already: Whence <hi>Virgil,</hi>

               <p>In like manner the representations, resemblances, Idols, Statues, Images, Pictures, made after the similitudes of the Gods, or dedicated to them, are called sacred, even as <hi>Orpheus</hi> singeth in his hymn to <hi>Lycian Venus,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>The chieftains that the sacred things protect</l>

And <hi>Virgil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence divine <hi>Plato</hi> in his eleventh book of Lawes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the sacred Images and Statues of the Gods should be honoured, not for themselves, but because they represent the Gods to us, even as the ancients did worship that Image of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> thus interpreting it: for in that he bares the resemblance of a man, was signified that he is a mind which produceth all things by his seminary power; he is seign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to sit, that his immutable and constant power might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; he hath the upper parts bare and naked, because he is manifest to the intelligences and the superiors; but the lower parts are covered, because he is hid from the inferior creatures he holdeth a scepter in his left hand, because in these parts of the body the most spiritual habitation of life is found. For the Creator of the intellect is the King and the vivifying spirit of the world; but in his right hand he holdeth forth both an Eagle and victory; the one, because he is the Lord of
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:52070:288"/>
all the Gods, as the Eagle is of other birds; the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all things are subject to him; in like manner we also reverence the Image of a Lamb, because it representeth Christ, and the picture of a Dove, because it signifieth the holy Ghost, and the forms of a Lion, Oxe, Eagle, and a man, signifying the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and such like things, which we find expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Revelations of the Prophets; and in divers places of the holy Scripture: moreover those things confer to the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations and dreams, and therefore are called sacred pictures; there are also sacred rites and holy observations, which are made for the reverencing of the Gods, and religion, <hi>viz.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout gestures, genuflexions, uncoverings of the head, wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, sprinklings of Holy water, perfumes, exterior expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, humble processions, and exterior Ornaments for divine praises, as musical Harmony, burning of wax candles and lights, ringing of bells, the adorning of Temples, Altars and Images, in all which there is required a supream and special reverence and comeliness; wherefore there are used for these things, the most excellent, most beautifull and pretious things, as gold, silver, pretious stones, and such like: which reverences and exterior rites are as it were lessons and invitations to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual sacred things, for the obtaining the bounty of the Gods; concerning which <hi>Proserpina</hi> beareth witness in these verses.
<q>
                     <l>Who ever did the brazen statues slight,</l>
                     <l>The yellow gifts of gold, or silver white,</l>
                     <l>Who would not wonder, and not say that these</l>
                     <l>Are of the Gods?—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The priests also are called sacred, and the ministers of the divine powers, and Gods, and they themselves being consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted do both administer all the holy things, and also conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate them, whence <hi>Lucan.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>The consecrated priests, to whom great power</l>
                     <l>Is granted—</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:52070:289"/>
And <hi>Virgil</hi> saith of <hi>Helenus</hi> the priest of <hi>Apollo,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>He praies for peace of th' Gods, and doth unloose</l>
                     <l>The Garlands of his sacred head—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Those holy rites are as it were certain agreements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Gods and us, exhibited with praise, reverence or obedience, by the means of which we very oft obtain some wonderfull vertue from that divine power, on whom such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence is bestowed; so there are sacred Hymns, Sermons, Exorcismes, Incantations, and words, which are compounded and dedicated for the praises, and divine services of the Gods, whence, <hi>Orpheus</hi> in a verse composed for the stars, saith.
<q>With Holy words, now on the Gods I call.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And the primitive Church did use certain holy incantations against diseases and tempests, which we either pronounce, praying to some divine powers, or also sometimes carrying them along with us, written and hanged on our neck, or bound to us, we obtain very oft some power from such a Saint, which men very much admire; by this means also there are sacred names, figures, Characters, and seals, which contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive men, in purity of mind, for their secret vows, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted, dedicated and consecrated to the worship of God; which things truly, if any man afterward shall pronounce with the same purity of mind, with the which they were first instituted, he shall in like manner do miracles; further also, the manner and rules delivered by the first institutor must be observed, for they who are ignorant of these things, loose their labor, and work in vain; Thus not only by barbarous words, but also by <hi>Hebrew, Aegyptian, Greek, Latine,</hi> and the names of other languages, being devoted to God, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed and dedicated to his essence, power or operation, we sometimes do wonders; such names there are in <hi>Iambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus; viz Osyris, Jcton, Emeph, Ptha, Epies, Amun;</hi> so in

In like manner certain materiall things receive no little sanctity and vertue by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, especially if done by a priest, as we see those waxen seals, in which are imprinted the figure of Lambs, to receive vertue by the benediction of the Romane High priest, against lightnings and tempests, that they cannot hurt those who carry them, for a divine vertue is inspired into Images thus consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is contained in them, as it were in a certain sacred Letter, which hath the Image of God; the like vertue those holy waxed lights receive at <hi>Easter,</hi> and at the feast of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of the virgins; in like manner bells by consecration and benediction receive vertue, that they drive away and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain lightnings and tempests, that they hurt not in those places where their sounds are heard; in like manner salt and water, by their benedictions and exorcismes receive power to chase and drive away evill spirits; and thus in things of this kind, there are also sacred times alwaies observed by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every religion with very great reverence, which are either commanded that we should sanctify by the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or are dedicated to them by our fore-fathers and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for the commemoration of some benefit received of the Gods, and for a perpetual Thanksgiving. Thus the Hebrews have received their Sabbaths, and the Heathens their holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, and we the solemn dayes of our holy rites, alwaies to be reverenced with the Highest solemnity; there are also times contrary to these, which they call penitential, and we black dayes, because that in those daies the commonwealth hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered some notable blow, and calamity, of which sort amongst the Romans was the day before the fourth nones of <hi>August,</hi> because that on that day they suffered that extraordinary blow
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:52070:290"/>
at the Battle of <hi>Canna.</hi> In like manner all Postriduan daies are called black dayes, because that most commonly battles succeeded ill on these dayes: So amongst the Jews the black dayes are the seventeenth day of <hi>June,</hi> because on that day <hi>Moses</hi> brake the Tables, <hi>Manasses</hi> erected an Idol in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> &amp; the walls of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> are supposed to have been pulled down by their Enemies; likewise the ninth of <hi>July</hi> is a black day with them, because on that day the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of both the Temples happened, by this reason they are called <hi>Aegyptian</hi> dayes, in the old time observed by the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and every Nation by this way may easily make a like calculation of days fortunate or unfortunate to them, and the Magicians command that these holy and religious daies be observed no less then the planetary daies, and the celestial dispositions; for they affirm that they are far more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, especially to obtain spiritual and divine vertues, because that their vertue is not from the Elements and celestial bodies, but descendeth from the intelligible and supercelestial world, and being helped by the common suffrages of the Saints, is not infringed by any adverse disposition of the heavenly bodies, nor frustrated by the corruptible contagion of the Elements, if so be that firm belief and religious worship be not wanting, that is, joyned with fear and trembling, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion properly holdeth forth thus much; Hence those daies are called religious, which to violate is a sin, which if we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully observe, we fear not any great mischief, which we may do, if we do otherwise.</p>

Further, perfumes, sacrifice, and unction pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate all things, and open the gates of the Elements and of the Heavens, that through them a man can see the secrets of of God, Heavenly things, and those things which are above the Heavens, and also those which descend from the Heavens, as Angels, and spirits of deep pits, and profound places, appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of desart places, and doth make them to come to you, to appear visibly, and obey you; and they pacify all spirits, and attract them as the Loadstone Iron, and joyn them with the
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:52070:291"/>
elements, and cause the spirits to assume bodies: for truly the spirituall body is very much incrassated by them, and made more gross: for it liveth by vapours, perfumes and the odours of sacrifices: moreover whatsoever thou operatest, do it with an earnest affection and hearty desire; that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Heavens and heavenly bodies may favour thee, whose favour, that thou maist more easily obtain, the fitness of the place, time, profession, custome, diet, habite, exercise and name also do wonderfully conduce: for by these the power of nature is not only changed, but also overcome, for a fortunate place conduceth much to favour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> neither without cause did the Lord speak to <hi>Abraham</hi> that he should come into the land which he would shew him; and <hi>Abraham</hi> arose and journeyed towards the south: in like manner, <hi>Isaac</hi> went to <hi>Gerarath,</hi> where he sowed &amp; gathered an hundred fold, and waxed very rich: but what place is congruous to each one, must be found out by his nativity, which thing he that knoweth not, let him observe where his spirits are especially recreated, where his senses are more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where the health of his body and his strength is most vigorous, where his businesses succeed best, where most favour him, where his enemies are overthrown, let him know that this region, this place is preordained by God and his Angels for him; and is also well disposed, and prepared by the Heavens. Therefore reverence this place, and change it according to your time and business, but alwayes flie an unfortunate place: fortunate names also make things more fortunate; but unfortunate, unhahpy; Hence the Romans in listing their souldiers were wary, least that the first souldiers names should be in any measure unfortunate; and for paying tributaries, and mustrings of their Armies and Colonies, they did chuse <hi>Gensours</hi> with good names.

observe the motions and times of the Moon; and <hi>Euripus</hi> in <hi>Euboea,</hi> doth it not seven times with wonderfull swiftness ebbe and flow? and three dayes in every moneth, <hi>viz.</hi> the 7. 8. and 9. day of the Moon it standeth still; and amongst the the <hi>Troglotides</hi> there is a lake, which thrice in a day is made bitter and salt, and again sweet; moreover in the winter time, when all things wither, and dry, Penyroyall flourisheth: on the same day, they say, that blown bladders do break, and that the leaves of Sallows and Pomegranats are turned and forced about; and its known to all, that which I have seen both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and I know also the sowing thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> that a nut-tree, which seemeth dry all the year, on the Even of Saint <hi>Johns</hi> day doth produce both leaves, and flowres, and ripe fruits: and this miracle doth wholly consist in the observation of the time of its sowing; moreover that times can yield some wonderfull power to artificiall things, the Astrologers in their books of Elections and Images do constantly affirm; and by this means, we read in <hi>Plutarch.</hi> That there was an image amongst the <hi>Peleneans</hi> made with such art, that what way soever it did look, it did strike all things with terrour and very great perturbation, so that no man durst through fear behold it; and we read in the life of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius,</hi> that the Magicians of <hi>Babylon</hi> had tied to the roof of their house, four golden fowls, which they called the tongues of the gods; and that they had power to reconcile the minds of the multitude to the love and obedience of the King. In the Iland <hi>Chios</hi> there was the face of <hi>Diana</hi> placed on high whose countenance appeared sad to those which came in, but to those that went out, it appeared chearfull: In <hi>Troas,</hi> the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which were left about the Image of <hi>Minerva</hi> did not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie; In the temple of <hi>Venus</hi> at <hi>Paphos,</hi> it never rained in the court: If any thing was taken forth from the Tomb of <hi>Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> showers were powred down from heaven till that which was digged up, was restored into its place: In the tomb of King <hi>Bibria</hi> of <hi>Pontus,</hi> did arise a <hi>Laurell,</hi> from which if any one did break a branch and carry it on shipboard, quarrells would never cease untill it was thrown over.

               <p>THese are the things, which for an introduction into Magick we have collected out of the tradition of the ancients, and diversly compiled in this book, in short words, yet sufficient for those who are intelligent; some of these things are written in order, some without order, some things are delivered by fragments, some things are even hid, and left for the search of the intelligent, who more acutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating these things which are written, and diligently searching, may obtain the compleat rudiments of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Art, and also infallible experiments: for we have delivered this Art in such a manner, that it may not be hid from the prudent and intelligent, and yet may not admit wicked and incredulous men to the mysteries of these secrets, but leave them destitute and astonished, in the shade of ignorance and desperation: You therefore sons of wisdom and learning, search diligently in this book, gathering together our dispersed intentions, which in divers places we have propounded, and what is hid in one place, we make manifest in another, that it may appear to you wise men; for, for you only have we writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, whose mind is not corrupted, but regulated according to the right order of living, who in chastity, and honesty, and in found faith fear and reverence God: whose hands are free from sin and wickedness, whose manners are gentle, sober, and modest, you only shall find out this knowledge which is preserved for you, and the secrets which are hid by many Enigmaes cannot be perceived but by a profound intellect, which when you shall obtain, the whole science of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible magicall discipline will insinuate it self into you: and those vertues will appear to you, which in times past <hi>Hermes, Zoroastes, Apollonius,</hi> and the others, who wrought miracles, obtained. But ye, envious, caluminators, sons of base igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and foolish lewdness, come not nigh our writings, for
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:52070:294"/>
they are your enemies, and stand on a precipice, that ye may erre &amp; fall head-long into misery: if any therefore through his incredulity or dulness of intellect, doth not obtain his desire, let him not impute the fault of his ignorance to me, or say that I have erred, or purposely written falsly and lied, but let him accuse himself, who understandeth not our writings; for they are obscure, and covered with divers mysteries, by the which it will easily happen, that many may erre and loose their sense; therefore let no man be angry with me, if we have folded up the truth of this science with many Enigmaes, and despersed it in divers places, for we have not hidden it from the wise, but from the wicked and ungodly, and have delivered it in such words which necessarily blind the foolish, and easily may admit the wise to the understanding of them.</p>

               </gap> her can the great reading of books direct you here, since they are but as riddles. How great writings are there made of the irresistable power of the Magical Art, of the prodigious Images of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, of the monstrous transmutations of <hi>Alchymists.</hi> of that blessed stone, by which, <hi>Mydas</hi> like, all metals that were
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:52070:295"/>
touched are presently transmuted into Gold, or Silver, all which are found vain, fictitious, and false, as often as they are practised according to letter. Yet such things are delivered, and writ by great and grave Philosophers, and holy men, whose traditions, who dare say are false? Nay, it were impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to think that they were lyes. There is therefore another meaning then what is written in letters, and that is vailed with divers mysteries, and as yet clearly explained by none of the Masters, and which I believe no man can attain to by reading of books only, without a skilfull, and faithfull master, unless he be divinely illuminated, as very few are. Therefore it is a vanity for any man that searcheth into the secrets of nature, to give himself to bare reading. For they that thus do, are, being ensnared in the gins of the exterior spirits, to whom it is given to rule, made dangerous slaves, not knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and go back into the footsteps of their flocks, seeking without themselves, what they have in themselves. And this is that which I would have you know, because in us is the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of all wonderfull effects, who knows how to discern, and effect, and that without any sin or offence to God, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the monstrous <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> the prodigious <hi>Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the envious <hi>Alchymist,</hi> and bewitching <hi>Necromancers</hi> can do by spirits.

               <head>Unto the same Man.</head>
               <p>BY your courteous letters (most reverend Father!) I have seen, as in a glass, your whole mind, which I heartily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace &amp; I would have you know that you shall be welcome to me beyond expression, and that you are seated deeply in my affections, and that I am such an one (I write this out of the abundance of my heart) as am not wont upon any occasion to forsake my friends. Wherefore that you may obtain the desires, which are no less then mine, I will hasten to come to you. When we shall come face to face, hear and speak with one the other, I know our friendship will be indisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, and endure for ever. But now concerning that <hi>Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> which you require to know, I would have you know, that it is to know God himself, the worker of all things, and to pass into him by a whole image of likeness (as by an essential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and bond) whereby thou maist be transformed, and made as God, as the Lord spake concerning <hi>Moses,</hi> saying; Behold, I have made thee the God of <hi>Pharoah.</hi> This is that true, high <hi>Occult Phylosophy</hi> of wonderfull works. The key thereof is the intellect: for by how much higher things we understand, with so much the sublimer vertues are we endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and so much greater things do work, and that more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and efficaciously. But our intellect being included in the corruptible flesh, unless it shall exceed the way of the flesh, and obtain a proper nature, cannot be united to these vertues (for like to like) and is in searching into these occult secrets of God, and nature, altogether inefficacious; for it is no easy thing for us to ascend to the heavens. For how shall he that hath lost himself in mortal dust, and ashes, find God? How
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:52070:296"/>
shall he apprehend spiritual things that is swallowed up in flesh and blood? Can man see God, and live? What fruit shall a grain of corn bear if it be not first dead? For we must dye, I say dye to the world, and to the flesh, and all senses, and to the whole man animal, who would enter into these closets of secrets, not because the body is separated from the soul, but because the soul leaves the body: of which death <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the <hi>Collosians: Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ:</hi> And elswhere he speaks more clearly of himself. <hi>I know a man, whether in the body, or out of the body I cannot tell, God knows, caught up unto the third heaven,</hi> &amp;c. I say by this death, pretious in the sight of God, we must dye, which happens to few, and perhaps not alwaies. For very few whom God loves, and are vertuous, are made so happy. And first those that are born, not of flesh and blood, but of God. Secondly those that are dignified to it by the blessing of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the heavens at their birth. The rest endeavour by merits, and art, of which more fully when I see you. But this I will advise you, that you be not deceived concerning me, as if I at any time having received such divine things should boast of them to you, or should arrogate any such thing to my self, or could hope to have them granted to me, who hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to have been a souldier, consecrated with mans blood, having been almost alwaies belonging to the Kings Court, bound to a most dear wife by the bond of flesh, exposed to all the blast of inconstant fortune, and being crossed in my flesh, in the world, and worldly affairs, and therefore could not obtain the sublime gifts of the immortal God. But I would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a director, who waiting alwayes at the dores, shews to others which way they must go. But as for my love to you, you are indeed a little deceived: I do not see how you are my debtor, seeing I have bestowed nothing upon you, only I am ready when occasion serves to bestow all things. So farewell and prosper. From <hi>Lyons</hi> XI X. <hi>Novemb. Anno Dom.</hi> M. D. XXVII.</p>

               <p>THe Ancients were wont to brand notorious folly with this proverb, <hi>viz.</hi> To bring Owles to <hi>Athens:</hi> but it is not a part of less folly, but of most great impiety, to send divels to hell. You know what I call hell, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>School</hi> of wickednesses, which with much displeasure I have elswhere in its colours notoriously shewed the Court to be. But there was never so just an occasion of writing and of indignation given as now, if it were lawfull to treat of the whole business as I should, yet I cannot contein but give you an argument of it. Now therefore hear a thing both foolish and impious: There was sent for out of <hi>Germany</hi> with no small charges a certain master of Spirits, that is a Necromancer who possesseth a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over spirits, that as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> resisted <hi>Moses,</hi> so he should oppose <hi>Caesar;</hi> for they were perswaded by the father of lies, that he could foretel all things to come, and disclose all secret counsels, and manifest even the thoughts; moreover that he was endowed with so great power, that he could bring back the Kings children through the aire, even as we read that <hi>Habacuck</hi> with his pulle was carryed to the den of Lions, and that he could do as <hi>Elisha</hi> did being besieged in <hi>Dotham,</hi> shew mountains full of horsemen and fiery Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, and a very great Army; moreover that he could find out and fetch up the treasures of the earth, and compell what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and affections he pleased, to break them off, and cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="563" facs="tcp:52070:297"/>
to <hi>Ahab</hi> going up against <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> but <hi>Ahab</hi> fell, and <hi>Jezabel</hi> was thrown down headlong, and the dogs did eat her: <hi>Asa</hi> a King of <hi>Juda</hi> is reproved by the prophet of the Lord, because that in his sickness he sought not the Lord, but trusted to the skill of his physitian: have not they committed a greater sin, who leave God the saviour, and the wholesome vertues of nature, and seek for help of Satan? <hi>Ochozias</hi> did thus in times past, &amp; therefore heard from the prophet of the Lord, Thou shalt not descend from thy bed on which thou art, but shalt certainly dy: Let the series of the other unrighteous Kings be run over, and also the histories of the Gentiles. <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roastes, Diatharus, Croesus, Pompey, Pyrrhus, Crassus, Nero, Iulian,</hi> what have they gayned by their <hi>Magitians</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners,</hi> who falsly fained prosperity for them? were they not all reduced to nothing, and did they not wickedly perish in their sins? So are all these ungodly follyes wont to bring distruction to the admirers thereof, to the which truly, they who especially confide, are made the most unfortunate of all men. I deny not but that there are natural sciences, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical arts, Occult Ingenuities, which can, without offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God, or injuring faith or religion, preserve Kingdomes, dive into counsels, overcome Enemies, deliver captives, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease wealth, obtain the good will of men, expell diseases, conserve health, prolong life, and restore strength of youth: There are moreover sacred religious intercessions, publike supplications, private prayers of good men: by the which we may not only turn away the wrath of God, but also entreate him to be gratious unto us; besides if there be a certain art to foretell, and work miracles, which the Ancients call <hi>Calomagia</hi> or <hi>Theurgia,</hi> surely it is unknow unto these fooles and slaves of the Divel for to find out things to come, and to pronounce truth concerning those things which hang over our heads, &amp; are occult, and from heaven portended unto men; and to effect things which exceed the common course of nature, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only to a man of profound and perfect knowledge, and of a most pure life and faith, and not to men most vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. But every Creature serveth those who are Innocent;
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:52070:298"/>
and learned in the law of God, for their faiths sake; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they shall ask they shall receive: so the Ravens fed <hi>Eliah,</hi> and at his prayers the earth withheld her fruits, the Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed rain, and showred down fire upon the wicked: So the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens served <hi>Elisha,</hi> the Angels fought for him; rivers are pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed dry-foot; the Lions laying aside their fierceness, and not regarding their hunger, sawn on <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the hot fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace burneth not the children. These are not the works of Necromancers and Sorcerers, nor of Devils, but of faithfull and godly men; for not the Divels, but the spirit of God doth assist them: I confess there are some, (perhaps many) even at this time, who are very wise, and of wonderfull knowledge, vertue and power, and of a pure conversation, most prudent, and also disposed by age and strength, that they can very much profit the Commonwealth by their counsel and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but your courtiers contemn these men, as those who are very far from their purpose, who for wisdome have malice, guile and deceit; for counsel deceit, and craft for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; guile, and perfidiousness for prudence. Superstition is in the place of religion, and God is blasphemed in afflictions: and what faith (as saith the Apostle) is perfected in weakness is contemned: but they run to the invocations of evil spirits. Every good man is mocked at by them, bold hypocrisie is promoted, truth is accounted a crime; praise and rewards are reserved for foolishness and wickedness. O fools, and wicked, who by these arts would establish a kingdome, by which formerly most potent Empires have fallen, and have been utterly overthrown; Of whom it was truly spoken by <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> our Crown is fallen, wo to us because we have sinned: which I wish might not be so truly as fitly applyed to you. For truly that verse, the numeral letters being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together M. C. V. I. expresseth the year M. D. XXIV. wherein according to the account your King was taken at <hi>Papia:</hi> Did not ye see these things, and admire at them, which before they were done you judged impossible? And as yet you are proud, and obdurate in your affliction. You despise the prophets, and the threatnings of God are as tales to you.

Behold it is at hand, and as yet you shall see, and feel the great things of God upon the whole earth, and shall tremble because the misery which you know not shall come upon you suddenly; Whither then will ye fly?

                  <p>THis place doth require that we speak of Magick; for it is so neer joyned to, and of affinity with Astrologie, in so much that he that professeth Magick without Astrologie, doth nothing, but altogether is in an errour. <hi>Suidas</hi> is of the opinion that Magick had its name, and originall from the Maguseans. It is the common opinion, that it is a <hi>Persian</hi> name, to which <hi>Porphyry,</hi> and <hi>Apuleius</hi> assent, and that in that tongue it signifies a priest, wise man, or Philosopher. Magick therefore comprehending all Philosophy, naturall, and Mathematicall, joyns the powers of Religions to them. Hence also they contain in them Goetia, and Theurgia, for which cause many divide Magick into two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Naturall, and Ceremoniall.</p>

                  <head>Of Naturall Magick.</head>
                  <p>IT is thought that naturall Magick is nothing else but the highest power of naturall Sciences, which therefore is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the height of naturall Philosophy, and the most absolute consummation thereof, and that which is the active part of naturall Philosophy, which by the help of naturall vertues, from a mutuall, and opportune application of them, brings forth operations even to Admiration: which Magick the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> especially did use, where the vertue of herbs, and stones, and other things looking towards it was sufficient. It is said that <hi>Hierome</hi> made mention of it to <hi>Paulinus,</hi> where he saith that <hi>Apollonius the Tyanean</hi> was a Magician, or Philosopher, as also the <hi>Pythagorians;</hi> of this kind were those wise men which came to worship Christ with gifts when he was born, which the interpreters of the

                     <hi>Chaldeans</hi> expound the Philosophers of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> such as were <hi>Hiarchas</hi> amongst the <hi>Bragmanni, Tespion</hi> amongst the <hi>Gymnosophists, Budda</hi> amongst the <hi>Babylonians, Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius</hi> amongst the Romans, <hi>Zamolxides</hi> amongst the <hi>Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Abbaris</hi> amongst the <hi>Hyperboreans, Hermes</hi> amongst the <hi>Aegygtians, Zoroastes</hi> the son of <hi>Oromasus</hi> amongst the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi> For the <hi>Indians, Aethiopians, Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> chiefly did excell in this Magick. With which therefore (as <hi>Plato</hi> relates in <hi>Alcibiades)</hi> the sons of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings were instructed, that they might learn to administer, and distribute their image to the commonwealth of the world, and the commonwealth to it; and <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in his books of divination, that there was none amongst the <hi>Persians</hi> did enjoy the Kingdom, but he that first had learned Magick. Naturall Magick therefore is that which contemplates the powers of all naturall and celestiall things, and searching curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously into their Sympathy, doth produce occult powers in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into publique view, so coupling inferiour things as allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the gifts of superiour things, by their mutuall application, that from thence arise wonderfull miracles, not so much by art as by nature, to which art becomes an assistant whilest it works these things. For Magicians, as the most curious searchers of nature, making use of those things which are prepared by nature, by applying active things to passive, produce oftentimes effects before the time ordained by nature, which the vulgar think are miracles, which indeed are naturall works, the prevention of the time only coming betwixt: as if any one should produce Roses in the moneth of March, and ripe Grapes, or sowen Beans, or make Parsly to grow into a perfect plant within few hours, nay, and cause greater things, as clouds, rains, thunders, and animals of divers kinds, and very many transmutations of things, many of which fort <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> boasted that he did do by meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Magick.

                  <p>THere are moreover other most witty emulators of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and most bold inquisitors, which promise they can by the influences of the heavens, obtained without naturall vertues, but only by Mathematicall learning, produce works like to those of nature, as walking, or talking bodies, which have not animall vertues: such was the wooden dove of <hi>Architas</hi> which did flie, and the statue of <hi>Mercury</hi> which did speak; and the brazen head made by <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> which they say did speak. <hi>Boetius</hi> a man of a great wit and much learning, excelled in these things, to whom <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> writing concerning such like things, saith, to thee it is appointed to know hard things, and shew miracles: by the ingenuity of thy art metals speak, <hi>Diomedes</hi> in brass trumpets, the brazen Serpent hisseth, birds are feigned, and those which know no proper sound, are heard sending forth sweet melody; we relate small things of him, who hath power to imitate the heavens; concerning these arts I think that is spoken which we read in <hi>Plato</hi> in the eleventh book of Laws.

                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Pliny</hi> relates that a certain man, <hi>Demarchus Parrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situs,</hi> in a sacrifice which the <hi>Arcades</hi> made by a humane sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to <hi>Jupiter Lyceus</hi> tasted of the entrals of a boy that was sacrificed, and turned himself into a wolfe, by reason of which changing of men into a wolfe, <hi>Austin</hi> thinks that the name was put upon <hi>Pan Lyceus,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter Lyceus.</hi> The same <hi>Austin</hi> relates, that whilest he was in <hi>Italy,</hi> there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain women Magicians like <hi>Circe,</hi> who by giving cheese to travellers turned them into cattle; and when they had carried what burdens they pleased, restored them into men again; and that the same happened to a certain Father called <hi>Prestantine.</hi> But least any one should think these things to be but foolish toyes, and things impossible, let him call to mind what the Scripture mentions concerning <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> the King, how he was turned into an ox, and lived seven yeers with hay, and at length returned through the mercy of God into a man again, whose body after his death, his son <hi>Evilmerodac</hi> gave

as a prey to the Vulters, least he should again rise from the dead, who returned from a beast into a man: and more of this kind doth <hi>Exodus</hi> relate of the Magicians of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> But <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of the same, whether Magicians, or Sorcerers, when he saith, Thou hast terrified them O God! because they have done horrible deeds by inchantments. Moreover, this I would have you know, that these Magicians do not search into naturall things only, but also those things which do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany nature, and after a manner put it off, as motions, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, figures, sounds, voyces, concents, lights, affections of the mind, &amp; words. So the <hi>Psylli,</hi> and <hi>Marsi</hi> called together ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and others by other things depressing them, put them to flight. So <hi>Orpheus</hi> repressed the tempest of the <hi>Argonaute</hi> with a hymn; and <hi>Homer</hi> relates to <hi>Ulysses</hi> that his blood was restrained with words. And in the law of the twelve ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles punishment was ordained for them who enchanted the corn: that without all doubt the Magicians did produce wonderfull effects by words only, affections, and such like, not upon themselves, but also upon extraneous things; all which things are thought to put forth their innate vertue upon other things, draw them to them, or expell them from them, or any otherwise affecting of them, no otherwise then the Loadstone draws Iron, or Jeat Chaff, or a Diamond or Garlick bind them, so that by this graduall, and concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Sympathy of things, not only naturall, and celestiall gifts, but also intellectuall, and divine may, as <hi>Jamblicus, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus,</hi> and <hi>Synesius</hi> confirm by the opinion of Magicians, be received from above, which <hi>Proclus</hi> in his book of sacrifice, and Magick confesseth, <hi>viz:</hi> That by the consent of these kinds of things, the Magicians were wont to call up the dieties themselves. To such a height of madness some of them are grown, that from divers constellations of the Stars, through intervals of times, and a certain rule of proportions being observed, think that an image of the gods can with a beck receive the spirit of life, and intellect, and so give an answer to them that ask counsell of it, and reveal the secrets of occult truth.

                  <p>These therefore are they which call upon the souls of the dead, and those which the Ancients called <hi>Epodi,</hi> who enchant boys, and bring them out into the speech of the Oracle, and which carry about them familiar spirits, as we read of <hi>Socrates</hi> and such, as it is said, they fed in glasses, by which they feign themselves to prophecy. And all these proceed two waies. For some endeavour to call and compell evill spirits, adjured by a certain power, especially of divine names; for seeing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature fears, and reverenceth the name of him who made it, no marvel, if <hi>Goetians, Infidels, Pagans, Jews, Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,</hi> and men of every prophane sect and society do bind Divels by invocating the divine name. Now there are some that are most impiously wicked indeed, that submit themselves to Divels, sacrifice to, and adore them, and thereby become
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:52070:302"/>
guilty of Idolatry, and the basest abasement: to which crimes if the former are not obnoxious, yet they expose themselves to manifest dangers. For even compelled divels alwaies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us whithersoever we go. Now from the sect of the <hi>Goetians</hi> have proceeded all those books of darkness, which <hi>Vulpianus</hi> the Lawyer calls books disallowed to be read, and forthwith appointed them to be destroyed, of which sort the first is <hi>Zabulus</hi> reported to invent, who was given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull arts, then <hi>Barnabas</hi> a certain <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and now in these dayes there are carryed about books with feigned titles, under the names of <hi>Adam, Abel, Enoch, Abraham, Solomon,</hi> also <hi>Paul, Honorius, Cyprianus, Albertus, Thomas Hierome,</hi> and of a certain man of <hi>Yorke,</hi> whose toies <hi>Alphousus</hi> King of <hi>Castile, Robert</hi> an English man, <hi>Bacon,</hi> and <hi>Apponus,</hi> and many other men of a deplored wit have foolishly followed. Moreover they have not made men only and Saints, and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes, and the angels of God, the authors of such execrable opinions, but they boast also that those books were diliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Raziel.</hi> and <hi>Raphael</hi> the Angels of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Tobias;</hi> Which books openly betray themselves to him that looks nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into them, to be a rule, rite, and custome of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and a kind of words, and characters, an order of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction, an empty phrase, and to contain nothing but meer toyes, and impostures, and to be made in latter times by men ignorant of all ancient Magick, and forlorn artists of perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous art, of prophane observations mixed with the ceremonies of our religion, with many unknown names, and seals intermixed, that thereby they may terrifie and astonish the simple, and ignorant. Moreover it doth not yet appear that these arts are fables: for unless there were such indeed, and by them many wonderfull and hurtful things done, there would not be such strict, divine, and humane lawes made concerning them, for the utter exterminating of them. And why do the <hi>Goetians</hi> use those evill spirits only, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause good Angels will hardly appear, expecting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and come not but to men pure in heart, and holy in life: but the evill are easily called up, favouring
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:52070:303"/>
him that is false, and counterfeiting holiness are alwaies ready to deceive with their craft, that they may be worshipped, and adored: and because women are most desirous of secrets, and less cautious, and prone to superstition, they are the more easily deceived, and therefore give up themselves the more readily to them, and do great prodigies. The poets sing of <hi>Circe, Medea,</hi> and others of this sort; <hi>Cicero, Pliny, Seneca, Austin,</hi> and many others as well Philosophers as Catholike Doctors, and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, also the Scriptues testifie the like. For in the books of the Kings we read, that a woman who lived at <hi>Endor,</hi> called up the soul of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, although many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it not to be the soul of the Prophet, but an evil spirit, which took upon him his shape. Yet the Hebrew masters say that <hi>Austin</hi> to <hi>Simplicianus</hi> doth not deny but it might be the true spirit of <hi>Samuel,</hi> which might easily be called up from its body before a compleat year after his departure, as also the <hi>Goetians</hi> teach. Also <hi>Magician Necromancers</hi> suppose that might be done by certain natural powers and bonds, as we have said in our books of <hi>Occult Philosophy.</hi> Therefore the ancient Fathers, skilfull of spiritual things, did not without cause ordain that the bodies of the dead should be buried in a holy place, and be accompanied with lights, and sprinkled with holy water, and be perfumed with frankincense, and incense, and be expiated by prayers as long as they continued above ground. For as the Masters of the Hebrews say, All our body and carnal Animal, and whatsoever in us depends upon the matter of the flesh being ill disposed is left for meat to the Serpent, and as they called it, to <hi>Azazel,</hi> who is the Lord of the flesh and blood, and the Prince of this world, and is called in <hi>Leviticus</hi> the Prince of deserts, to whom it is said in <hi>Genesis, Thou shalt eat dust all the daies of thy life.</hi> And in <hi>Isaiah, Dust thy bread i. e.</hi> our body created of the dust of the earth, so long as it shall not be sanctified, and turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to better, that it be no longer an effect of the serpent, but of God, <hi>viz.</hi> a spiritual made of carnal, according to the word of <hi>Paul,</hi> saying, that which is sowed a carnal, shall arise a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; and els where, All indeed shall rise, but all shall not
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:52070:303"/>
be changed, because many shall remain for ever as meat of the Serpent. This filthy and horrid matter of the flesh and meat of the Serpent we therefore cast off by death, changing it for a better and spirituall, which shall be in the resurrection of the dead; and is already done in those, who have tasted of the first fruits of the resurrection, and many have already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to, by the vertue of the divine spirit in this life, as <hi>Enoch, Eliah,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> whose bodies were changed into a spirituall nature, and have not seen corruption; neither are their carkasses left to the power of the Serpent. And this was that dispute of the devill with <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel, concerning the body of <hi>Moses,</hi> of which <hi>Jude</hi> makes mention in his Epistle. But of <hi>Goetia,</hi> and <hi>Necromany</hi> let these suffice.</p>

                  <p>NOw many think that Theurgia is not unlawfull, as if this be governed by good Angels, and a divine diety, when as yet oftentimes it is under the names of God, and the fallacies of evil Angels obstringed by the wicked fallacies of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. For we do procure, and attract not by naturall powers only, but also by certain rites, and ceremonies, celestials, and by them divine vertues to our selves; Of which together with many rules the ancient Magicians did treat in many volumes. But the greatest part of all ceremonies consists in observing cleanness, and purity, first of the mind, then of the body, and of those things which are about the body, as in the skin, in garments, in habitations, in vessels, utensils, oblations, sacrifices, the purity of which disposeth to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with and beholding of divine things, and is very much required in sacred things, according to the word of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Be ye washed, and made clean, and take away the evil of your thoughts. Now impurity, because if oftentimes infects the air, and man, disturbes that most pure influence of Celestiall and divine things, and chafeth away the pure spirits of God. But sometimes impure spirits, and deceiving powers,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:52070:304"/>
that they be worshipped, and adored for gods, require also this purity. Therefore here is great need of caution, as we have lately discoursed at large in our books of Occult Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy. But of this Theurgia, or Magick of divine things <hi>Porphyrie</hi> disputing at large, at length concludes that by Theurgicall consecrations the soul of man may be sitted to receive spirits, and Angels, and to see God: but he altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denies that we can by this art return to God. Of his School therefore is the Art <hi>Almadel,</hi> the Notary art, the <hi>Pauline</hi> Art, the art of Revelations, and many such like su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions, which are so much the more pernicious, by how much they seem the more divine to the ignorant.</p>

                  <head>Of Cabalie.</head>
                  <p>HEre the words of <hi>Pliny</hi> come into my mind, who saith the faction of Magick depends upon <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Lutopea,</hi> being Jews; which words put me in mind of the Cabalie of the Jews, which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are of opinion was delivered to <hi>Moses</hi> by God himself on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and then by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of succession without the monuments of letters was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the times of <hi>Esara</hi> delivered to others by word of mouth only as the <hi>Pythagorian</hi> opinions were formerly delivered by <hi>Archippus,</hi> and <hi>Lysiaus,</hi> who had chools at <hi>Thebes</hi> in Greece, in which the Scholers keeping the precepts of their masters in their memorie, did use their wit, and memorie in stead of books: So certain Jews despising literature, placed this in memorie, and observations, and vocall traditions, whence Cabalie was by the <hi>Hebrews</hi> called as it were the reception of any thing from another only by hearing. That art (as it is reported) is very ancient, but the name was known but of late times amongst Christians: They deliver a double science therefore, the one of <hi>Bresith,</hi> which they call Cosmologie, <hi>viz</hi> explaining the powers of things created naturall, and Celestiall and expounding the secrets of the Law and Bible by Philosophicall reasons: which truly upon this account differs
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:52070:304"/>
nothing at all from naturall Magick, in which we believe K. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> excelled. For it is read in the sacred Histories of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> that he was skilled in all things, even from the Cedar of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> to the Hyssop that grows upon the wal: also in cattle, birds, creeping things, and fishes; all which shew that he knew the Magicall vertues of nature. <hi>Moses</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> amongst the later writers followed after this in his exposition upon the <hi>Pentacles;</hi> also many more <hi>Talmudists.</hi> They call the other Science thereof of <hi>Mercara,</hi> which is concerning the more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime contemplations of divine &amp; Angelick vertues, &amp; of sacred names, and seals, being a certain Symbolical divinity, in which letters, numbers, figures, things, &amp; names, and tops of elements, and lines, points, and accents, are all significative of most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found things, &amp; great secrets. This again they divide into <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy, viz.</hi> that which is called <hi>Notariacon,</hi> treating of Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal vertues, names, &amp; seals, also of the conditions of spirits, and souls, and into <hi>Theomancy,</hi> which searcheth into the mysteries of divine majesty, as the emanations thereof, &amp; sacred names, and Pentacles, which he that knows may excell with wonderful ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; as that when he pleaseth, he may fore-know all future things, &amp; command whole nature, have power over devils, and Angels, and do miracles. By this they suppose, that <hi>Moses</hi> did shew so many signs, and turned the rod into a Serpent, and the waters into blood, and that he sent Frogs, Flies, Lice, Locusts, Caterpillars, fire with hail, botches and boyls on the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and slew every first born of man and beast; and that he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Seas, and carryed his thorow, and brought fountains out of the rock, and quails from Heaven, that he sent before his, clouds and lightnings by day, a pillar of fire by night, and called down from Heaven the voice of the living God to the people, and did strike the haughty with fire, and those that murmured with the Leprosie; and on the ill deserving brought suddain destruction; the earth gaping and swallowing them up; further he fed the people with heavenly food; pacified Serpents, cured the envenomed, preserved the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous multitude from infirmity, &amp; their garments from wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, &amp; made them victors over their enemies. To conclude, by this art of miracles <hi>Joshua</hi> commanded the Sun to stand
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:52070:305"/>
still, <hi>Eliah</hi> called down fire from Heaven upon his enemies, restored a dead childe to life; <hi>Daniel</hi> stopt the mouths of the Lyons; The three children sang songs in the fiery Oven; moreover by this art the incerdulous Jews affirm, that even Christ did do so many miracles; <hi>Solomon</hi> also very well knew this art, and delivered charms against devils, and their bonds, and the manner of conjurations, and against diseases, as <hi>Joseph</hi> reporteth, but as I doubt not but that God revealed to <hi>Moses</hi> many secrets, contained under the bark of the words of the Law, which were not to be revealed to the prophane vulgar. So I acknowledge that this Cabalisticall art, which the Hebrews brag of, and I sometimes diligently and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously sought after, is nothing else than a meer rapsody of superstition, and a certain Theurgicall Magick, but if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from God (as the Jews boast) and conduceth to the perfection of life, health of men, to the worship of God, and to the truth of understanding; truly that spirit of truth, which hath left this Synagogue, and come to teach us all truth, would not have concealed it from his Church even untill these last times, which indeed knoweth all things that are of God, whose benediction, baptism, and other mysteries of salvation are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and perfected in every tongue, for every tongue hath the same equall power, if so be that there be the same equall piety, neither is there any name, either in heaven or earth, by the which we must be saved, and by which we work miracles, besides this one name <hi>Jesus,</hi> in which all things are recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and contained. Hence it is, that the Jews, who are most skilful in using the names of God, can operate little or nothing after Christ, as their ancient fathers did; but that we by experience find, and see, that by the revolution of this art (as they call them) oftentimes wonderful sentences, full of great mysteries, are wrested from the holy Scriptures, this is nothing else then a certain playing upon Allegories, which idle men busying themselves with all the points, letters, and numbers, which this tongue and the custome of writing do easily suffer, do fain and disguise at their pleasures; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though sometimes they hold forth great mysteries, yet they
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:52070:305"/>
can neither prove nor evince any thing; but we may (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the words of <hi>Gregory)</hi> with the same facility contemn them, as they are affirmed. <hi>Rabanus</hi> the Monk, by the same artifice hath fained many things, but in Latin Characters and verses, with certain pictures inserted, which being read any way by the delineations of the superficies and pictures, do declare some sacred mysterie, representing the Histories of the things painted; which also may without doubt be wrested from prophane writings, as every one may know, who hath read the <hi>Cantones</hi> of <hi>Valeria Proba,</hi> composed out of the verses of <hi>Virgil,</hi> concerning Christ; All things of this kind are the speculations of idle brains, but what belongeth to the working of miracles, there is none of you, I suppose, of so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish an understanding, who believeth that they have any art or science of them; therefore this <hi>Cabala</hi> of the Jews is nothing else than a most pernitious superstition, by the which they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at their pleasure, divide, transfer words, names and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, scatteringly put in the holy Scriptures, and by making one thing out of another, they dissolve the connections of the truth, the speeches, inductions and parables, and here and there construing them by their own fictions, would bring the words of God to their follies, defaming the Scriptures, and saying that their fictions have foundation on them. They calumniate the Law of God, and by the supputations of words, syllables, letters, numbers impudently extorted, they assay to bring violent and blasphemous proofs for their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Besides, they being puft up by these trifles, do boast that they finde and search out the unspeakable mysteries of God, and secrets, which are above the Scriptures, by the which also they impudently affirm, and without blushing, that they can even prophecy, and do miracles and wonders; but it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to them, as to <hi>Aesops</hi> Dog, who leaving his bread, and gaping after the shadow, lost his food; so this perfidious and stiff necked people, being always busied in the shadows of the Scriptures, and about their own vanities, and doing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence by their artificiall, but superstitious Cabala, do loose the bread of eternall life, and being fed with vain words, do
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:52070:306"/>
destroy the word of truth; from this Judaicall ferment o Cabalisticall superstition proceeded (as I suppose) the Ophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, Gnostican, and Valentinian Hereticks, who together with their disciples, fained a certain Greek Cabala, perverting all the mysteries of the Christian faith, and by their hereticall corruption wresting them to the Greek letters and numbers, by the which they constituted a body of truth (as they call it) and taught, that without these mysteries of letters &amp; numbers the truth could not be found in the Gospel, because that the writings thereof are various, and sometimes repugnant to themselves, and full of parables; that they who see, might not see, and that they who hear, might not hear, and that they who understand, might not understand, and that they are propounded to the blind and erroneous, according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of their blindness and error; But that the sincere truth lying hid under these things, is committed to the perfect only, not by writings, but by word of mouth, and that this is that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebetary and Arithmetical Theology which Christ in private manifested to his Apostles; and which <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh to the perfect only; for seeing that these are the highest myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, therefore they are not written, nor ought so to be, but to be kept in secret amongst wise men; but no man is a wise man amongst them, who knoweth not to refrain the greatest mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Heresie.</p>

                  <head>Of Juggling or Legerdemain.</head>
                  <p>BUt let us return to that Magick, part of which is an art of jugglings <hi>(e. i.)</hi> delusions, which are made according to appearance only, by which Magicians shew phantasmes, and play many miracles by circulatory frauds, and cause dreams, which they do not so much by Geotick inchantments, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations, and deceits of devils, as by certain vapors, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, lights, love-medicines, collyries, alligations, and suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, also by rings, images, glasses, and such like drugs, and instruments of Magicall art, and a naturall and Celestiall power. Also many things are done daily by slieght of hand, of which sort we see some are done daily by stage players, and sporters which we call <hi>Chirosophers (e. i.)</hi> skilful in sleight of hand. There are extant concerning this art, books of the Legerdemain of <hi>Hermes,</hi> and some others. We read also of a certain man called <hi>Paseton,</hi> a most notable juglar, that was wont to shew a banquet to guests, and when he pleased, to make it vanish away again, all rising with hunger, and thirst, being deluded. We read that <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> did use these kinds of jugglings, and also that most learned <hi>Pythagoras</hi> did sometimes do this toy, that what things he pleased, he would write in a glass, which being set against the full Moon, he would shew to any one that stood behind it, those things represented in the Globe of the Moon; Hither belongs whatsoever Poets sing of the transmutations of men, which also is delivered by Historians, and by some Christian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and also is recorded in the Scripture. So men may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like Asses, or horses, or other Animals with fascinated eyes, or a troubled medium, and that by a naturall art. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times these are done by good and evil spirits, or by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at the request of some good men, as in the Scripture we read of <hi>Elisha</hi> the Prophet beset by an Army of the King for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying <hi>Dotham.</hi> But to pure eyes, and such as be opened by God, those cannot deceive; so that woman which was judged to be a kind of cattle, did seem to <hi>Hilario</hi> to be not any such thing,
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:52070:307"/>
but a woman. These things therefore which are done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appearance only, are called jugglers.</p>
                  <p>But those things which are done by the Art of transmuting, or translating, as of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> or of Corn carryed to another field, we have spoke of before; but of this art of juggling, thus saith <hi>Jamblicus,</hi> These things which are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be juggled or bewitched, besides imagination, have no truth of action or essence. The end of these is but to hold forth things to the imagination according to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, of which there presently remains no footsteps or signs. Now by what hath been said, it is manifest that Magick is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a collection of Idolatry, Astrology, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious medicines; And now there is by Magicians raised a great company of hereticks in the Church, who as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> resisted <hi>Moses,</hi> do in the like manner resist the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall truth. The chief of these was <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> on whom by reason of this art was bestowed at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Claudius Cesars</hi> time, a Statue, with this Inscription, <hi>To</hi> Simon <hi>the holy God.</hi> Of his blasphemies <hi>Clemens Eusebius,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> make mention. From this <hi>Simon,</hi> as from a Seminary of all Heresies proceeded by successions the monstrous Ophites, the filthy Gnosticks, the impious Valentinians, Cerdonians, Marcionists, Montanians, and many other Hereticks, lying against God for gain and vain glory, doing no good to men, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them, and drawing them into destruction and error, to whom they that give credit shall be confounded in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. But of Magick I wrote whilest I was very yong three large books, which I called <hi>Of Occult Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> in which what was then through the curiosity of my youth erroneous, I now being more advised, am willing to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, by this recantation; I formerly spent much time and costs in these vanities. At last I grew so wise as to be able to disswade others from this destruction; For whosoever do not in the truth, nor in the power of God, but in the deceits of divels, according to the operation of wicked spirits presume to divine and prophecy, and practising through Magicall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, exorcismes, incantions and other demoniacall works
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:52070:307"/>
and deceits of Idolatry, boasting of delusions, and phantasmes presently ceasing, brag that they can do miracles, I say all these shall with <hi>Jannes,</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> be desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to the torments of eternall Fire.</p>
