            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WEll overtook Neighbour, I ſee you are not a man of your word; did not you promiſe me when we laſt met, that you would Vote for our old Members that ſat in the laſt Parliament, to be Knights of the Shire, to ſit in the <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Oxford?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I thought to do ſo, but by my brown Cow, I have been over-perſwaded to the contrary by my Landlord and his Chaplin Mr.</hi> Tantivie, <hi>and a peſtilent fine man, I think they ſaid he was a Courtier, that lay at my Landlords houſe, and what with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Wine, they drew aſide my heart, and made me Vote againſt my Conſcience.</hi>

               <p>'T was ill done neighbour <hi>Numps,</hi> but all their Artifices would not do, we have carried it by ſome hundreds, for our old Members, that ſtood ſo bravely for their Country.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I am glad on't with all my heart, for to tell you truly, tho' my Landlord had my voice, the old Members had my heart, and i'le never do ſo again.</hi>

               <p>I hear moſt of the Counties in <hi>England</hi> are of the ſame mind, and all the Burgeſs-Towns, Cities, and Corporations; but what arguments could they uſe to alter thy mind?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt I ſay, They made me continually drunk, and then my Landlord uſed me ſo very civilly, and gave me ſo many good words, and fine promiſes, what a kind Landlord he would be, that I forgot all your Inſtructions; and methought he had invincible Arguments to perſwade me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Nay, I have forgot them, but I thought no Counſellour at Law nor any Biſhop, could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted them: I now remember one Argument that took with me; you know I was ever for the King, and he told me the King did not love the Old Parliament-men, and therefore I ſhould not Vote for them: But I being bold, asked him how he knew that?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Why he laid me as flat as a Flounder, that is, he fully convinc'd me, for, ſaid he, if the King had lov'd them, he would not ſo ſoon have Diſſolv'd them; I think that was demonſtrable.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>'Tis no matter tho' the King did not love them, they lov'd you and your Country, and you ſhould ſo far have lov'd your ſelf, as not to have betray'd your own Intereſt. What ſaid the Courtier?</p>

                  <hi>Nay, I was forward enough to ſpeak I'le aſſure you; And I told them, I was ſure our old Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers would be for the rooting up of Popery, and would ſtand ſtiffly againſt</hi> Arbitrary <hi>Government.</hi>

                  <hi>I confeſs I deſerve to be half-hang'd; but good Neighbour, what is this Arbitrary Government ſo often ſpoke of? my Landlord ask'd me what it was, and in good faith I could not anſwer him, but Mr.</hi> Tantivy <hi>ſaid, it was the Government of a proud, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipert, Arbitrary, Presbyterian Clergy-Man in every Pariſh, and that the people are ſetting up again.</hi>

               <p>So all the <hi>Tantivies</hi> in <hi>England</hi> interpret it, but Neighbour, I'le tell you what I mean by it in a Word, It is a Government of the Prince or Monarch, by his own will, without circumſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Laws, &amp; then God-buye to all the peoples priviledges and properties, and our long-kept Liberties, ſo dear to all true <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> &amp; then you may be made the princes ſlaves, to bear the burthens of his <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and not dare to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, not ſuffer'd to call any thing your own, to pay Taxes, Impoſitions, Gabells, Exciſe, at your Princes pleaſure, and not by your own conſent: The Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> very lively deſcribes ſuch an Arbitrary King, to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the <hi>8th. Cha.</hi> of the firſt Book of <hi>Samuel.</hi> He is ſuch a one that will take your Sons to be his Servants, to attend on his Chariots and his Coaches, and to be his Foot-men and Lacquies, whether you will or no; your daughters to be his Cooks and Drudges. He will take your Fields, your Corn, your Houſes, and all you have at his pleaſure; and to ſatisfie the rapacious humour of his Courtiers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines: He will ſeed his Servants with your bread, and cloath them by your labour and toyl, what you ſweat for they ſhall enjoy. He will rule you with an Army, with Captains of thouſands, of hundred and fifties, and you ſhall not dare to complain of Oppreſſion, and this Neighbour, is the true Character of <hi>Arbitrary Government.</hi>

                  <hi>O Neighbour, my heart trembles! what a Rogue was I to Vote at Random, when our</hi> all <hi>lies at ſtake: I did not think we had put ſuch a Truſt into the hands of our Parliament-men; I thought, alas! as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do, that we choſe only for Form-ſake, and that they were only called to Parliament to give the King money, and to do what he would have them; and we have paid ſo many Taxes already, and given ſo much money, that I wiſhed in my heart there would be no more Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in my days.</hi>
