            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

None, beſides theſe <hi>Helmontians,</hi> did ever think of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, upon Reading them: Thus far, however we both agree in the meaning of this Paſſage, as to believe, That hereby Chriſt doth threaten to puniſh Offenders in a way ſuitable to their Crimes; and beſides, that this Puniſhment is ſometimes inflicted in this Life. But here's the Point at which we part; he concludes, That if God ſhould

fail to puniſh an Offender, before he cometh to his Grave, he muſt be born into the World again, to ſuffer in like manner as he hath offended; whereas I conclude, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a one that ſo dies unpuniſh'd, that his Doom is deferr'd till the great Day of our Accounts, in order to which he ſhall riſe again, and <hi>then ſhall God reward every</hi>

Now I will ſhew the Impoſſibility of the Reunion of theſe parts, in the time that this Philoſopher hath aſſign'd for it; and the Reaſon I do it by is obvious. <hi>viz.</hi> The teſtimony of our Senſes, That the Bodies of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Souls are not reaſſum'd by them in a much longer ſpace. 'Tis ſo intolerably ignorant to think that our Bodies do, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of 28 years, corrupt ſmall enough to be drawn into the Womb at every new imaginary Birth, that the Plea of Dotage, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attends old Age, will not be ſufficient to excuſe it. For whoſe Faculties can be ſo much impair'd as not to know, That ordinarily in dry Graves the Bones will appear entire, and in ſome Vaults the Fleſh will not be all conſum'd in that time. Many Perſons now living, who ſaw Biſhop <hi>Braybrook</hi>'s Body taken up out of a Vault in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, about 20 Years ſince, (in which he was laid about 200 Years before) can teſtify, That there remain'd not only a firm Connection between the Bones, but that alſo the outward Skin that cover'd them, and ſome Entrails within, tho' dry'd like Parchment, were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd. The Romaniſts do ſhew abundance of Bones, as Relicks, which tho' moſt of them did never belong to thoſe ancient Perſons they are aſcrib'd to; yet they have, amongſt them, Loads of ſuch as are about 1000 Years Old. Theſe are not, can not be attracted into the Womb, and yet the Men, in whoſe Contexture they once were, cannot make their Revolutions without them; unleſs the <hi>Helmontians</hi> believe that a Man may be made up like a Collar of Brawn, all Fleſh and no Bone. But if you deſire Inſtances that are more General, I would carry your Thoughts as far as <hi>Egypt, Judea,</hi> and indeed to all the Eaſt, where anciently that curious way of <hi>Embalming</hi> dead Bodies prevailed, or to old <hi>Rome</hi> and many other Nations, who burnt their dead Bodies, and by an Artful way they had, ſeparated the Aſhes of the Body from that of the Fuel, and then put them into Pots. Now were I an <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montian,</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:102864:11"/>
there is nothing I ſhould hate more than theſe ways of pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerving Bodies; for they are ſo ordered, that the Magnetiſm of the Soul hath afterward no power to draw them towards a Revolution: I will ſend theſe curious Inquirers no farther than the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where they may ſee Inſtances of both theſe Sorts of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: <hi>There</hi> is a Body Embalm'd, of which there are undeniable To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, that it muſt be 2000 Years old, and their Urns are but little under that Age: but 'tis not to be doubted but if the Veſſels which contain this Humane Duſt could laſt ſo long, but that they would remain till the laſt Trump ſhall call them to Reunion. Well then, if the Souls to which theſe Bodies did belong, have not fetch'd them away in all this time, there is then no Ground for this Unphiloſophical Poſition: <q>That the Soul, after a few Years ſpent in a ſtate of Separation from the Body, ſhould joyn with its old Companion again.</q>

                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This Doctrine,</hi> if believ'd, would lead Men into <hi>Security:</hi> For if they cannot recollect, that they ever had any <hi>Life</hi> beſides the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> they muſt conclude that they have XI more behind, and on that Account would defer the trouble of living well till their <hi>Laſt Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</hi> That Men, if they had liv'd at all before, would remember it, I prove 1.

                     <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who poſitively affirms it. Now his Teſtimony in this Caſe ought to be deciding, becauſe <hi>He firſt</hi> taught this Doctrine to all the Eaſtern Nations, and therefore muſt better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his own Opinion than his late <hi>Diſciples</hi> the <hi>Helmontians.</hi> 2. Becauſe the Body decay'd by Age would be repair'd at every new Birth, and therefore the Soul would exerciſe <hi>memory,</hi> and all its other Functions, in it better than before. 3. The <hi>Rich Man</hi> in the Goſpel <hi>(Luk.</hi> 16. 25, 27.) is repreſented as remembring his <hi>Family.</hi> 4.

And if Men are apt now to delay their Repentance, whilſt they are under the Perſwaſion that <hi>this Life</hi> is the only time of Tryal; how wicked will they be, when they

come to believe, (as ſo great a probability muſt make them do,) that they ſhall live again, at leaſt one Age more, on the Earth.</p>

                        <hi>Now if any Man will put Pen to Paper to deny the Return of Souls, I would put my Hand to Paper to prove that That Man does deny there is any God but what he hath fondly conceiv'd. But if Men will only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt, and call it</hi> Damnable Doctrine <hi>(as I hear ſome do) I would thereupon ask this Queſtion, Whether it be not a Duty incumbent on Teachers to refute this Damnable Doctrine (if they are able) that Men might not run into it? But ſeeing many Books containing this Doctrin, have been Printed in divers Languages and divers Countries, and no Man, that we can hear of, hath hitherto written against it, therefore I think it altogether impoſſible for them to confute it. If any One will undertake to Anſwer theſe Queſtions (I mean</hi> any Teacher of one of the divers Congregations) <hi>and ſend his</hi> Anſwer <hi>to me, it ſhall be kindly receiv'd. I have offer'd my</hi> Queries <hi>to ſome of the</hi> Clergy of the Church of England, <hi>and I could not find that they were willing to medle in the Matter. I have alſo ſent them to the Learned amongſt the</hi> Presbytereans; <hi>but if I receive no Anſwer from them, nor any other of the</hi> divers Congregations, <hi>to whom they are propos'd, I ſhall conclude that they are altogether unable to Anſwer what I have Written.</hi>
