            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

were amongſt vs, ſome zealous Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that bookes of ſo great vanitie might
<pb facs="tcp:7855:4"/>
be burned vp: Acts. 19, 29. Yea, there are
many verie excellent Bookes, Treatiſes,

wanted any, there are many, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their abilitie, and leaſure, farre fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to employ themſelues this way then
my ſelfe. Thirdly, I feared, both the graue
and wiſe cenſure of the godly learned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines,
to whom my ſpirit is ſubiect. And
alſo the curious reprehenſions of thoſe
Momi, and malignant ſiniſter ſpirits, who
ſay they would haue nothing printed, (if
diuinitie,) but that which wadeth into the
depth thereof, and containeth the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and quinteſſence of learning, ſuch as
doe profoundly handle deepe poynts, and
ſubtill quiddities of controuerſies, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
that which was neuer heard or
knowne before. And (if humanitie) then
nothing, but that which is excellent, for
wit; ſingular for learning; rare for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and polliſhed with all the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of eloquence; but in truth there
can be nothing ſo well, learnedly, or god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done in either, but theſe men (as it were
pining away with enuie at other mens
good) doe either bitterly backebite, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully
ſlaunder, vndeſeruedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue,
<pb facs="tcp:7855:5"/>
or maliciouſly defame. What is it
then to publiſh any thing in print, but for
a man to make himſelfe a common by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word,
a But for euery man to ſhoot his
arrow at, euen bitter words, yea to offer
himſelfe to bee ſtung and torne, with
the ſharpe and venemous teeth and

            <p>Laſtly, it is no ſmall diſcouragement,
to conſider the vanitie of Readers in theſe

all the thankes, which many receyue

farre greater conſideration, whereby
theſe former are deuoured, and darkened
as the light of a Candle by the Sunne at

bookes are there, which had periſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Mothes and Wormes, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

the greateſt comfort that many a poore

are many who for their age, ſickeneſſe,
ſoulneſſe of weather, or other vrgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
cannot alwayes heare the word,
where, and when they would, who yet
hauing ſome godly mens labours, may by
the reading of the Scriptures, and them,
in ſome meaſure, ſupplie the want of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Againe, though there be mo books, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

taſte of another, the doctrine of godlines
beeing as a large field, wherein manie
thouſands may labour, and yet all haue
elbow roome; and like a great fountaine
or Well, whereout euery man may draw
his Bucket-full, and yet neuer ſee bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.
Laſtly, ſome men, through ſome
reſpect of kindred, friendſhip, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
or others, may bee drawne to reade
ſome booke, whereas they would not
haue regarded any other (though farre to
be preferred) on the ſame argument. The
conſideration whereof, hauing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
profite of many, and the eternall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of God (as the propounded ſcope and
end of all my labours) before mine eies,
togither with the importunate perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of my deare and Chriſtian friendes
in the Lord, haue drawne mee into the
violent current of this time, to caſt my
mite into the Lords treaſurie, in publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb facs="tcp:7855:7"/>
theſe my poore trauelles,<note place="margin">At nunc e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam cilius vereor, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> henc.</note> which
long ſince had come abroad, if I could
haue beene ſooner thereunto perſwaded.
I haue not altered any thing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which was deliuered; or of the method
which I obſerued therein, onely I haue
added the teſtimonies of certaine godly
and reuerend men, whoſe wordes and
ſentences in teaching I reported (in our
owne naturall mothers tongue) but
concealed both names and places, and the
rather I now ſet them downe, becauſe
many (either ſimple deceiued, or mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
froward) condemne all ſuch for
meerely ignorant and vnlearned, whoſe
Sermons are not ſtuffed full with ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a ſtrange and vnknowne language,
alas, who knoweth not that any man but
merely qualified with gifts, and taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
commendable paines in his ſtudy, may
plentifully alledge the teſtimonies of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
if they ſaw the ſame warrantable, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
(and not rather hurtful) to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Church of God? But I haue
placed them in the margent, as alſo the
teſtimonies of Scripture, becauſe I would
not haue the ſimple reader any way inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
he may at his pleaſure, hauing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:7855:7"/>
the matter, make a pawſe for the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of any thing auerred by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies alledged.</p>
            <p>As for the matter, to commend it, I need
not, for if it be the pure<note n="*" place="margin">Pſ. 12. 6. Reu. 3. 18. Pſa. 19. 10.</note> word of GOD,
(as I perſwade my ſelfe it is) then it is
more precious, than fined gold, ſweeter
than honie, and cleerer than the light, if it
bee as comfortable in reading, as thoſe
who haue enforced me to publiſh it, (as
they ſaid) found it in preaching, I doubt
not, but God thereby ſhall bee glorified,
his Saints comforted, and my ſoule reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
in the day of the Lord Ieſus; but as
for the manner; the ſtile may ſeem harſh
and vnpleaſant, handling a Shepheards
ſong, after a Shepheardly and rude man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
for (as your Worſhips know) my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is not at any time, to ſtudie for words,
but for matter, which ſo I deliuer in ſuch
words, as I may be vnderſtood of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt
hearer, I care for no more; mine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſire, being to inſtruct Gods people,
with the plaine euidencie of the ſpirit, and
of power. And therefore as in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering;
ſo alſo in the penning and ſetting
downe thereof, I haue neither vſed curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
of words; eloquence of ſpeech; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:7855:8"/>
of ſtile, nor of obſcuritie, and
darkeneſſe of matter, to declare a deepe
profoundneſſe, but haue endeauoured in
all ſimplicitie of ſpirit, ſinceritie of heart,
plaineſſe of phraſe, and ſenſible maner, to
deliuer the only truth, to the Saints of god.</p>
            <p>It is the firſt thing of mine, that euer
paſſed the Preſſe, and therefore great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that I ſhould dedicate it, to the firſt
friends, that euer I had in this Countrey,
who firſt wonne mine affection by cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,

of the people from the ſlauerie of

of the Philiſtims, the women met
<hi>Saule</hi> the King, and <hi>Dauid</hi> his ſeruant,

God had looked vpon the humilitie of the

veſſell of Chriſt his conception, ſhee
gaue glorie vnto God in a ſong, and ſaid,

My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord, and my

<hi>Zacharie,</hi> after the birth of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> his
Sonne, when his mouth was opened, and
tongue looſed, he ſpake, and praiſed God,
prophecying, and ſaying: Bleſſed bee the

and redeemed his people<note n="g" place="margin">Lu. 1. 68</note>. Old Father <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi>

ſweet ſwan-like ſong. Lord now letteſt
thou thy ſeruant depart in peace, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to thy word<note n="h" place="margin">Lu. 2. 28.</note>. And not onely haue
theſe and many others, the Saints of God,
in their proſperitie and flouriſhing eſtate,
hauing receiued many good things; offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in their ſongs a ſacrifice of praiſe, Euen
the fruits of their lips, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſing his name<note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 13. 15.</note>:
But alſo in their aduerſitie &amp; dolefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
haue they poured out their ſoules,
in ſongs vnto God; for though S. <hi>Iames</hi>
ſeeme to oppoſe prayer and ſinging, as ſo
diametrally contrarie, that no man can
pray, ſinging; nor ſing, praying, where he
ſayeth: Is any amongſt you afflicted? let
him pray: is any merrie? let him ſing<note n="k" place="margin">Ia. 5. 13.</note> Yet
ſurely it is moſt euident, that the Apoſtle
<pb facs="tcp:7855:18"/>
therein requireth, firſt that in afflictions,
when we are in diſtreſſe, and extreame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
we flye vnto God by prayer, and of
him onely ſeeke releaſe, and comfort; and
when we are in proſperitie, and enioy the
bleſſings of God at our wils, that then we
giue thanks and praiſe vnto God: in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
praying, and not deſpairing, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming,
and ſeeking vnlawfull meanes
of deliuerance with the wicked; and in
our proſperitie, ſinging ſonges of praiſe,
and not vain, light, and fooliſh ballads as
the worldlings doe, and herein conſiſteth
the oppoſition, and not in the former; for
as in proſperity it is lawfull, in feruent prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to mourne, ſigh, ſob, and lament: ſo alſo
in aduerſitie lamentably, and ſorrowfully
to ſing, as the Apoſtle councelleth, ſaying:
My brethren count it exceeding ioy, when
ye fall into diuers temptations<note n="l" place="margin">Iames 1. 2</note>. So the
Apoſtles being beaten and ſcourged, went
out of the Councell reioycing<note n="m" place="margin">Act. 5. 41.</note>, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſore beaten, caſt into the inner priſon,
and their feete made faſt in the ſtocks, yet
at midnight they prayed, &amp; ſung Pſalmes
vnto God<note n="n" place="margin">Act. 16. 25.</note>. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſung many pſalmes,
and played thereunto with ſundrie inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and yet oftentimes vnder a ſweet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7855:18"/>
ſound had a wofull and heauie heart; as
when he lamented the deaths of <hi>Saul</hi> and
<hi>Ionathan</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">2. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the want of the feeling and aſſurance of
Gods fauour, and remiſſion of ſinnes, and
moſt earneſtly intreateth to haue thoſe
graces renewed again<note n="p" place="margin">Pſa. 4. 6. 51. 120.</note>. And who findeth
not great vſe of ſinging, both in proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and aduerſitie? In proſperitie by ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Pſalmes, our zeale is quickned; fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencie
in prayer, increaſed; and our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe
to perfourme all laudable ſeruice
vnto God, notably ſtirred vp, wherevnto
the example of <hi>Eliſha</hi> may bee referred,
who yeelding to the requeſt of <hi>Iehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi>
called for a minſtrell, who by his
ſongs to Gods glorie, ſtirred vp the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
heart to prophecie<note n="q" place="margin">2. Kin. 3. 15.</note>. Alſo in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
by ſinging of ſome holy and godly
Pſalme, our heauie and penſiue hearts are
refreſhed, for this cauſe the holy Prophet
<hi>Dauid</hi> (in the ſorrow and heauineſſe of
his heart) would rebuke his ſoule, ſaying:
Why art thou ſo heauie, oh my ſoule? and
why art thou ſo diſquieted within me<note n="r" place="margin">Pſ. 42. 5.</note>?
And would ſtirre vp himſelfe, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
to play and ſing ſome ioyfull
ſong, awake my tongue, awake violl, and
<pb facs="tcp:7855:19"/>
harpe, I my ſelfe will awake right early<note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſ. 57. 8.</note>.
But I wil paſſe ouer theſe things, and come
to intreat only of the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
whoſe penners, were many; Arguments,
diuers: and vſes, manifold.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Penners.</note> for the penners, (as I ſayd) they
were many as <hi>Aſaphe</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Pſ. 50. 73. 74. 75. 76. 78. &amp;c.</note>, for ſo ſome godly
learned, will rather that he was a writer,
than onely a ſinger, to whom they were
committed; and the rather becauſe elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
it may bee gathered, that he made
ſome pſalmes<note n="u" place="margin">2. Cron. 29. 30.</note>: Some alſo were penned
by <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <note n="v" place="margin">Pſa. 90.</note>. But moſt of them by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
that princely Prophet, and ſweet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Iſrael, and thereuppon called the
Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid:</hi> but whoſoeuer was the
penner, they are all to be receiued with the
like reuerent eſtimation, they being all led
by one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit, ſo that the
holy Ghoſt may well be ſaid, to be Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the whole Booke, for theſe holy
men of God did ſpeake and write, as they
were mooued by the holy Ghoſt<note n="x" place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 21.</note>; and
ſpecially <hi>Dauid</hi> witneſſeth of himſelfe, that
the ſpirit of the Lord ſpake by him, and
that his word was in his tongue<note n="z" place="margin">2. Sa. 23. 2.</note>. And
therefore S. <hi>Peter</hi> alleaging the teſtimony
of <hi>Dauid,</hi> vſeth this maner of preface, Thus
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7855:19"/>
hath the holy Ghoſt ſpoken (by the mouth
of <hi>Dauid</hi>) concerning <hi>Iudas,</hi> who was
guide vnto then that tooke Ieſus<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 1. 16</note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Argument.</note> for the argument of this Book
(as I ſayd) it is diuers, ſome containe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of ſinnes, and humiliation before
the Lord, with earneſt and heartie prayer
vnto God, both for repentance, and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſinnes<note n="b" place="margin">Pſ. 25. 51</note>. Some are wholly ſpent in
commendation of Gods law, with many
intermixt praiers for ſtrength to obſerue
the ſame<note n="c" place="margin">Pſ. 119.</note>. Some deſcribe the wonderfull
power, wiſedome, majeſty, and prouidence
of God, ſhinning in the creation and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of all the world, for which all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are exhorted to praiſe the name of
the Lord<note n="d" place="margin">Pſa. 8. 18. 104. 147.</note>.) Some are penned for a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to ſtir vp the people with feare and
reuerence, to preſent themſelues before
the Lord in their holy conuocations and
aſſemblies, as the Pſalme which beginneth
thus: Oh come let vs ſing vnto the Lord<note n="e" place="margin">Pſa. 95.</note>.
Some of them lay open the miſeries of
Gods people in their captituitie, and how
hardly they were vſed of their enemies<note n="f" place="margin">Pſa. 137.</note>.
Some of them containe particuler praiers,
for ſupply of ſome particuler wants, either
of bodie or ſoule<note n="g" place="margin">Pſ. 6. 86.</note>. Some containe prayers
<pb facs="tcp:7855:20"/>
of the whole Church for the confuſion of
the enemies thereof<note n="h" place="margin">Pſa. 83.</note>. In a word, many of
them are hiſtoricall, as briefly laying open
Gods dealing towards his people, &amp; their
enemies, both in Egypt, in the wilderneſſe,
and in the land of Canaan<note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 78. 105. 106. &amp;c.</note>: moſt of them
propheticall, and all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> didacticall, full
of inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both as concerning our faith
in the maine grounds, and Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
&amp; concerning our obedience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of pietie towards god, as hearing, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
praying and praiſing; or of loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our neighbour, whether we regard
the inward affections, or outward actions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſes.</note> &amp; laſtly, the vſes of this Booke
are manifold, for all the holy Scriptures
are written for our learning, that wee
through patience, and comfort thereof,
might haue hope<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 15 4.</note>: and as elſewhere he
ſaith; the whole Scripture, is giuen by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
of God, &amp; is profitable to teach,
to conuince, to correct, &amp; inſtruct in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
<note n="l" place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 16.</note> Yet hath this Booke of the
Pſalmes, a certaine ſingular and excellent
difference from the reſt of the Scriptures,
for which the Apoſtle requireth, and there
hath alwaies been ioyned together, a day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exerciſe of the word &amp; Pſalmes, ſaying:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7855:20"/>
Let the word of God dwell plentifully in
you, in all wiſedome, teaching, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
your owne ſelues in pſalmes and
hymnes, and ſpiritual ſongs<note n="m" place="margin">Coloſſ. 3. 16</note>. And ſurely
no maruel that it ſhould be eſteemed at ſo
great price, for it is as a Chriſtians ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
and treaſurie of all good things, it
recordeth the memorable hiſtories of
things paſt, prophecieth and foretelleth
things to come, vnfoldeth hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> myſteries
vnder pleaſant and familiar Allegories;
herein vertue is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended; vice condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and moſt wholeſome rules and lawes
of a Chriſtian life preſcribed: if any man
be preſſed with the burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes, ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in conſcience with the flaſhes of hel,
thorough the kindling of Gods wrath; if
poſſeſſed with feare of warres, famine, or
death, if loadned with ſickneſſe, want and
penurie, heere is a ſoueraigne ſalue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
maladie; heere may the king learne
what he is, and how he ought to gouerne
his people religiouſly; and heere may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
learne to obey their Rulers peaceably;
the rich man may learne the vanitie of all
things, and the true vſe of his riches; and
heere may the poore man learne conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with his eſtate; the heauie hearted
<pb facs="tcp:7855:21"/>
ſhall hence learne where true comfort is to
be found; he that is tempted to euill, the
remedie; and he that is merrie, the true
ioy &amp; the meaſure thereof; yea hence may
the godly man reape great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
being aſſured that he ſhall find true
peace at the laſt: and heere may the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ones find diſcoragement, and ſpeedily
turne vnto God, knowing that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
for a while he may flouriſh like the
greene bay-tree, yet hath god ſet him but
in a ſlipperie place, and he ſhall ſodenly
periſh, &amp; come to a fearefull end. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
no man will denie but the Greeke &amp;
Latine poems of <hi>Homer, Heſiode, Pinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
and others deſerue great praiſe, and
want not their ſinguler vſe: yet for any to
preferre or equall them with this Booke,
were intollerable dotage, and contumelie;
for therein nothing is to be found concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the good pleaſure of God towards
his elect in Chriſt, they acknowledge not
his diuinitie, nor eſteeme of his benefits,
without which we are no better than veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of wrath, and firebrands of hell; they
intreat not of faith or iuſtification before
God, wherein a Chriſtians comfort chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſiſteth; indeed of the duties of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7855:21"/>
ſecond table, and honeſt manners they
ſpeake much; but for the firſt table, it is
farre aboue their reach, and therfore there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are altogether mute and ſilent, or
groſly erre and bewray their ignorance;
much time they ſpend, &amp; the greateſt part
of their verſes, in decyphering and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the manifold miſeries and calamities
whereunto this life is ſubiect, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
hereof they know not: howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
therefore there are ſome things profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to bee found in them, and their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
being garniſhed with eloquency of
words and ſentences, &amp; running in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
tune, may much delight and affect
the reader; yet vnto theſe pſalmes onely,
muſt we giue eare and attention, as vnto
the voice of God, as <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe hath
ſaid: <hi>Hodie ſi vocem domini audiueritis,</hi> To

theſe two parts. The firſt containeth a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
diſcription of Gods great care and
prouidence, and of his manifold ſweet
mercies beſtowed on <hi>Dauid</hi> and all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
in the fiue firſt verſes: In the ſecond
part, the Prophet ſheweth what vſe he
made thereof, and in his perſon teacheth
all Gods people, what vſe to make of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
receiued mercies, viz, Fully to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that God will continue the courſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7855:23"/>
of his fauour, &amp; louing kindneſſe towards
them, vnto the end in the laſt verſe in theſe
words: Doubtleſſe, kindneſſe and mercie
ſhall follow me.</p>
            <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">Subdiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> he maketh no large Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
or rehearſall, neither vſeth any long
and perticular ennumeration or recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vp of Gods benefits beſtowed vpon
him, as elſewhere<note n="q" place="margin">Pſ. 18, &amp; 66.</note>: but by a few ſhort fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
&amp; pleaſant parables, he doth moſt
elegantly point out, and ſignificantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the ſame, the verie Metaphors them
ſelues (as folded vp) offering much more to
our conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than by a long diſcourſe
or oration, could poſſibly haue been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p>The Allegories here vſed for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
are twaine: The firſt is taken from a
faithfull Shepheard, carefully attending
vppon his ſtraying ſheepe, and plentifully
prouiding al good things for their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and ſecuritie; and this containeth the
foure firſt verſes of the Pſalme. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is taken from an hoſt, or courteous
friend, moſt liberally entertaining his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited
gueſts with all delicats, both for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
and delight, and that is laid downe
in the 5. verſe: (Thou doeſt prepare a table
<pb facs="tcp:7855:24"/>
before me in the ſight of mine Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For the firſt Allegorie or paſtoral Idyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
it conſiſteth of two parts: Firſt the
Allegorie it ſelfe, in the firſt, ſecond, and
third verſes: Secondly the vſe therof, in the
fourth verſe, (Though I ſhould walke
through the valley, &amp;c.) for the Allegorie
it ſelfe, it is firſt briefely and ſummarily
laid down in the firſt verſe, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
and illuſtrated by the parts thereof,
in the ſecond and third verſes. The firſt
verſe containing the ſumme of the Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
conſiſteth of two parts, viz: A propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in theſe words, (<hi>The Lord is my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</hi>)
Secondly, the inference thereon,
(<hi>therefore I ſhall not want.</hi>) And thus you
haue the logicall reſolution and Analyſis
of this methodicall Pſalme, into his parts
and members; by obſeruation whereof,
our memories may bee greatly helped in
the handling of it: it now followeth, that
hauing laid the foundation, wee begin to
build, &amp; more narrowly to view the parts
of this holy ſcripture, for our further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and comfort, and firſt to beginne
with the propoſition in theſe wordes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord is my Shepheard.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Summe, of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> Although
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7855:24"/>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> had now paſſed through the ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
waues, &amp; was ſafely arriued vpon the
ſhore, and maugre the beards of all his
mightie and ſubtil enemies, obtained the
kingdome, that now he might triumph in
the Lord, and ſay as elſewhere he doth,
<hi>The ſtone vvhich the builders refuſed, is
made the cheefe ſtone in the corner, this is
the Lords doing</hi> &amp;c.<note n="r" place="margin">Pſa. 118. 22.</note>. Yet being not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
with what manifold cares a crown
is beſet, and ſeeing many dangers immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
he had ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat or conflict with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
himſelfe, but hauing had ſuch great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of Gods fauour, in former deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerances,
and protections, his faith get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
victorie ouer naturall diſtruſtfulneſſe,
and he burſteth out into theſe words of
Chriſtian reſolution and aſſurance, (<hi>The
Lord is my Shepheard, I ſhall not want.</hi>) q. d.
Oh my ſoule be not diſcouraged nor caſt
downe within me, dangers obiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to thy view, but let not troubleſome
thoughts diſmay thee, caſt thy care vpon
the Lord, he that ſo promoted thee from
following the Ewes great with young, to
be gouernour of his people, will alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
thee, the almightie, wiſe, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing
God is thy Shepheard, and therfore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7855:25"/>
contemne whatſoeuer may aſtoniſh thee,
and ſing thy former ſong; <hi>I truſt in God,
how ſay yee then to my ſoule; flye to your
mountaine, as a bird</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſ. 11. 1.</note> And againe, <hi>I will

that ſhould beſet mee round about</hi>

            <p>Q. But vvhat? was God <hi>Dauids</hi> ſheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
onely?</p>
            <p>A. No ſurely, though it be the propertie
of faith to make application, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
promiſes to vſe the firſt perſon, as
wee are taught by diuers examples<note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 13. 7.</note>: Yet
Chriſt Ieſus the great ſheapheard himſelfe
hath ſaid,<note place="margin">1. Ti. 1. 15.</note> 
               <hi>They that heare his voice and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
are his ſheepe</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Ioh. 10 26.</note>: So that <hi>Dauid</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
this in the perſon of the whole
church, &amp; all the members thereof, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if wee heare Gods voice and beleeue,
we are fold-mates with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and I, and
you, haue as great intereſt in the Lord, as
he had, and may boldly, and as freely, ſay
as he did, The Lord is my Shepheard, The
Lord is our Shepheard, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1 No man,<note place="margin">Sence of the words.</note> but meanly exerciſed in the
ſcriptures, can be ignorant, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor
of a Shepheard, is not more plaine
and familiar, than frequent, and commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7855:25"/>
vſed, ſometimes the great care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of God, ouer his humble ſheepe,
&amp; lowly lambes, is hereby ſhadowed out,
as in this place, and elſewhere. <hi>Say vnto
the Cities of</hi> Iudah <hi>behold your God, hee
ſhall feede his flocke like a Shepheard, hee
ſhall gather the lambes with his arme, and
carrie them in his boſome, and ſhall guide
them vvith young</hi> &amp;c.<note n="a" place="margin">Eſay 40. 11.</note> Againe, thus ſayth
the Lord God: Behold, <hi>I vvill ſearch my
ſheepe, and ſeeke them out, and I vvill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
them out of all places, vvhere they haue
beene ſcattered, in the cloudie, and darke
day,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="b" place="margin">Ezec. 34. 11, 12. &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt himſelfe hath plainely ſaid,
<hi>I am that good Shepheard</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 11, 14.</note>. And S. <hi>Peter</hi>
ſpeaking of the faithfull, ſaith: ye were as
ſheepe going aſtray, but are now returned
to the Shepheard, &amp; Biſhop of your ſoules,
&amp;c.<note n="d" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 25.</note>: and elſe-where calleth Chriſt the
<hi>cheefe Shepheard</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">1. Pet. 54</note>
            </p>
            <p>2 Sometimes alſo Kings, and Princes,
are compared to Sheapheards, whereby
their care and vigilancy, for the good of
their people and ſubiects are expreſſed, ſo
<hi>Aſaph</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſaith: He choſe
<hi>Dauid</hi> his ſeruant, and <hi>tooke him from
the Sheep-fold, euen from behinde the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7855:26"/>
Evves great vvith young, brought hee him,
to feede his people in Iacob, and his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in Iſrael</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Pſ. 78. 70.</note>. So the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying
of that notable deliuerance of
Gods people out of captiuitie, to aſſure
them thereof, he nameth the perſon, by
whom it ſhould be, more than an hundred
yeeres before he was borne, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he ſaith to <hi>Cyrus, Thou art my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Eſay 44. 28.</note>. By which title the Lord giueth
all Kings and Princes of the earth to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that it is their dutie, diſcharge it
aſwell as they wil, to prouide faithfully, for
the good of the ſoules, and bodies of their
people, to guide them by counſaile, and
to defend them by power.</p>
            <p>3 Thirdly, and moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly, good mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the word, are compared to good
Shepheards, and therby the great diligence
and care that they ought to haue, to feed
the flocke committed to their charge, with
the green &amp; wholeſome paſture of Gods
vvord, and to goe before them in all holy
example of life: are ſhadowed out; ſo the
Lord promiſeth, <hi>I vvill bring you pastors
according to mine heart, vvhich ſhall feede
you vvith knovvledge, and vnderſtanding</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Iere. 3. 15</note>.
And again, <hi>I vvill bring them to their folds.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7855:26"/>
and they ſhall growe and increaſe, and I
will ſet vp Shepheards ouer them, which
ſhall feede them, neither ſhall any of them
be lacking</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Iere. 23. 4</note>. Vnder this metaphor Chriſt
gaue <hi>Symon Peter</hi> his charge, <hi>Peter</hi> loueſt
thou me? feed my lambes &amp;c.<note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 21. 15.</note>. And S.
<hi>Peter</hi> accordingly, all miniſters, <hi>feed the
flocke of God, which dependeth vppon you,</hi>
&amp;c.<note n="l" place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 2</note>.</p>
            <p>4 Fourthly &amp; laſtly, the ignorance, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
couetouſneſſe, and diſſolute propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of bad miniſters, or (as the Church cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them) companions<note n="m" place="margin">Can. 1. 6</note>, are notably ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
out, by comparing them to idle,
greedie, and careleſſe Shepheards; and
theſe Sheapheards cannot vnderſtand, for
they all looke to their ovvne vvaies, <hi>euerie
one for his aduantage, and for his owne
purpoſe</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Eſay 56. 11.</note>. Againe, <hi>the Shepheards are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
beaſts, and haue not ſought the Lord,
therefore haue they none vnderſtanding,
and all the flockes of their paſtures are
ſcattered</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Ie. 10. 21</note>: but moſt notably &amp; largely is
their idleneſſe and ſeueritie taxed, by the
Prophet <hi>Exechiel</hi> in theſe vvords: <hi>vvoe
be to the Shepheards of Iſraell, that feed
themſelues, yea eating the fat, killing them
that are fed, and cloathing themſelues with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7855:27"/>
the wooll, but yee feede not the ſheepe, the
weake haue yee not strengthned, the ſicke
haue yee not healed, neither haue yee bound
vp the broken, nor brought againe, that
which was driuen away, neither haue yee
ſought that which was loſt, but with cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie
and rigour haue ye ruled them, and
they vvere ſcattered without a Shepheard,
and when they were disperſed, they vvere
deuoured of all the beaſtes of the field</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Ezech. 34 2, 3, 4, 5.</note>.
But becauſe in this place it is moſt plaine,
that by <hi>Shepheard</hi> the Prophet vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the Lord, of that we will only ſpeake,
and paſſe by the reſt: which metaphor will
be much the more ſweet and profitable, if
we breake it open, by conſidering the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of a good Shepheard (wherby the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God towards his people are notably
reſembled) and alſo the nature and duties
of ſheepe,<note place="margin">Illuſtration</note> (whereby are ſhadowed out
thoſe good thinges, which either are or
ought to be in all Gods people againe.)</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</note> a good Shepheard doth know his
ſheepe, and to that end will giue them
his marke, that if any of them goe aſtray,
he may ſeek them againe, and bring them
home to the Sheep-fold. So Chriſt Ieſus
the good Shepheard <hi>knovveth his ſheepe,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:7855:27"/>
and <hi>calleth them by their names</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 3. 14.</note>: and as
the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>the foundation of God
remaineth ſure, and is ſealed with this ſeale,</hi>
the Lord knoweth who are his<note n="r" place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 19.</note>. Yea, this
great Shepheard, hath a Booke wherein all
the names of his elect ſheepe are written,
called the <hi>Booke of life</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Exod. 32. 32. Phil. 4. 3. Reu. 3. 5. 20. 12. 21. 27.</note>: yea the Lord
marketh <hi>his in their foreheads with the
ſeale of the liuing God</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Reu. 7. 3.</note>: which, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſaith, is the <hi>holy spirit of promiſe</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note>,
which doth ſhew it ſelfe by the fruits ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in the outward behauiour, profeſſion,
and conuerſation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2 Secondly, a good Shepheard will haue
care to feed his ſheepe, not in rotten ſoyle,
and waſting graſſe, but in good, wholſome
&amp; green paſtures, for thereon is he called
Paſtor, <hi>a Paſcendo;</hi> So Chriſt is that good
Sheapheard, <hi>who feedeth euerie liuing
thing</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">Pſ. 145. 16.</note>. Hee fed his people in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
40. yeeres, with <hi>mannah and feathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
fowles from heauen</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Exo. 16. 13.</note>, <hi>and with waters
out of the ſtonie rocke</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Exo. 17. 6</note>. And <hi>Moſes</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
for 40. daies, during which time,
he <hi>neither did eate bread, nor drinke water</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Exo. 34. 28.</note>.
All men with naturall foode, cauſing the
<hi>raine to fall, and Sunne to ſhine both on
iuſt and iniust</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5. 45</note>, but ſpecially, hee feedeth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7855:28"/>
the ſoules of his choſen ſheep, in the green
paſtures that grow on <hi>the mountaines of
Iſraell</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ezec. 34. 14.</note>, with the bread of life Chriſt Ieſus
himſelfe, in his word and Sacraments, his
glorious Goſpell, being our heauenly food,
his ſpirit and life, our coeleſtiall drinke, for
we may not maruell, that in diuers ſences
Chriſt Ieſus ſhould be the <hi>Shepheard that
feedeth</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 14</note>, <hi>the dore whereby wee enter</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 9</note>, and
<hi>the foode, wherewith our ſoules are fedde,</hi>
and fatted vp vnto eternall life<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 35.</note>.</p>
            <p>3 A good Shepheard, knowing both the
ſtraying nature of his ſheep, and alſo their
timerouſneſſe, weakneſſe, and ſimplicitie,
either to flie from, reſiſt, or defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
from their manifold, cruell, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
enemies, will haue great care to keepe
them together, and defend them, as <hi>Iacob</hi>
declaring his fidelitie to <hi>Laban,</hi> in keeping
his flocke, ſaid thus: <hi>This twentie yeares
I haue beene with thee, thine Ewes and
Goates haue not caſt their young, and the
Rams of thy flocke haue I not eaten, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
was torne of beastes, I brought it
not vnto thee, but made it good my ſelfe,
of mine hand didst thou require it, were it
stollen by day, or ſtollen by night, I was in
the day conſumed with heate, and with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7855:28"/>
froſt in the night, and my ſleepe departed
from mine eies,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="f" place="margin">Ge. 31. 38. 39, 40.</note>. So Chriſt Ieſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a moſt faithfull Shepheard hath great
care ouer his ſheepe, both by the miniſtrie
of his word and ſpirit, to keepe them from
going aſtray, that they can no ſooner turne
aſide to the right hand, or the left, but they
ſhall heare a voice behind them, ſaying:
<hi>This is the way, walke ye in it</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Eſay 30. 21.</note>, and alſo to
defend them from the tooth of the Lion,
woolfe, and dog, that they doe not catch
or ſcatter them, being <hi>a wall of fire round
about them,</hi> as ſpeaketh the Prophet<note n="h" place="margin">Zac. 2. 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>4 Fourthly, and laſtly, (that I may not be
tedious, by inſiſting vpon euerie particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar)
a louing and carefull Shepheard, if any
of his flock be gone aſtray into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
he will take paines to ſeeke it, and
exceedingly reioyce in the <hi>finding</hi> thereof,
as Chriſt noted in the parable of the loſt
ſheep<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 18. 12.</note>, if any be <hi>diſeaſed,</hi> to ſet to his hand
&amp; dreſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if their diſeaſe be contagious,
to remooue them from the fold &amp; flock, til
they be cured, leaſt others bee infected: if
any be weake and feeble, to carrie them in
his armes. Euen ſo our Lord that louing
and carefull Shepheard, is come into the
wilderneſſe of this world, <hi>to ſeeke and to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7855:29"/>
ſaue that which was lost</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 19. 10.</note>. If he find any
faultie, he will launce them with the ſword
of his ſpirit, and addreſſe himſelfe to their
amendment, annointing their ſoares with
the ſoueraigne ſalue of his mercie, but if
their liues be laſciuious, and the diſeaſe
grow infectious, then by diſcipline and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
hee will ſeparate them
from the flocke, remooue them from the
fold, and <hi>deliuer them vnto Sathan for the
deſtruction of the fleſh</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 5</note>. Laſtly, his yong
and weake ones, his tender lambes, he will
<hi>nouriſh and cheriſh in his boſome</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Eſay 40. 11</note>, as
ſpeaketh the Prophet, not breaking the
<hi>bruſed reede, nor quenching the ſmoaking
flaxe</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 12. 20.</note>; nor <hi>ſuffering them to bee tempted
aboue that they are able, but will euen giue
the iſſue with the temptation,</hi> as ſayth the
Apoſtle<note n="o" place="margin">1. Cor. 10 13.</note> And thus vnder the duties of a
good Shepheard, we haue noted the great
care and mercifull prouidence of God,
towards his Church and Saints: now on
the other ſide, let vs briefely looke into the
nature, properties and condition of the
ſheepe, that thence we may alſo learne to
know our ſelues, and our duties towards
Chriſt againe.</p>
            <p>1 For the nature of the ſheepe,<note place="margin">The ſheepes nature.</note> it is firſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7855:29"/>
recorded by all thoſe that haue written
thereof, and by experience we find it true,
ſhe is fooliſh and ſimple, proane to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray,
euen when there is plentie of paſture
at home, yea, being once gone aſide, ſhe
hath not the wit to returne, but the further
ſhe goeth, the further from her fold: and
wheras other beaſts can ſhelter themſelues
in dens, caues, and calme places, againſt
ſtormie and tempeſtuous weather, yet will
ſhe expoſe her ſelfe to dangers remedileſſe,
vnleſſe ſhe be preuented by the care, and
prouident foreſight of her Shepheard:
And ſurely, ſo we are naturally fooliſh, and
vnwiſe, not perceiuing the thinges of the
ſpirit, but running with greedineſſe, in the
wandring pathes of death, as the Prophet
confeſſeth, <hi>all vve like ſheepe haue gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray,

               <note n="p" place="margin">Eſay. 53. 6.</note>. So Chriſt witneſſeth of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall

            <p>3 She is patient, &amp; contented quietly to

the admirable patience of Chriſt than this,

Wherefore (to ſtand no longer on this

may trie and examime our ſelues, whether

in vs, in any true meaſure, we may boldly

            <p>The ſheepe,<note place="margin">The ſheepes condition.</note> though ſhe be a creature ſo

            <p>Q. But vnto whom is the Lord a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard?</p>

to conclude this point, when once God

            <p>
               <hi>I ſhall not want.</hi> The ſheepe of her ſelfe
is ſubiect to many wants, and of herſelfe
not able in any meaſure to ſupplie them:
euen ſo euery Chriſtian is compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
and preſſed downe, with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

            <p>But it may ſeeme that <hi>Dauid</hi> vttered

ſay, that none of Gods ſheepe ſhall
want?</p>
            <p>The Anſwere hereunto is two-fold;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> firſt
there is a want of things ſuperfluous, and
another of things needfull, without which
(ſo great is the weaknes of fleſh &amp; bloud)
we can hardly ſerue God ſo chearfully as
we ought for the firſt, as we haue no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to luſt after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Chriſt hauing taught
vs to pray <hi>for dayly bread</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 6. 11</note>: and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
bid vs be content <hi>vvith foode and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">1. Ti. 6. 8</note> ſo alſo is it great mercy in God,
(knowing how proane wee are to abuſe
proſperitie, to pride and ſecurity) to croſſe
thoſe our ſinful deſires; as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth:
<hi>Ye aske and receyue not, becauſe yee
aske amiſſe, that ye might lay the ſame out
in your pleaſures</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Iam. 4. 3.</note>. And therefore as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this ſort of wantes, neither had
<hi>Dauid</hi> or any other the Lords ſheepe, any
warrant to ſay the Lord being their ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
they ſhould not want them; but as
concerning the other, viz. things needfull,
the promiſe is made by him <hi>that is heyre
of all things</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note>. <hi>First ſeeke the Kingdome
of GOD, and the righteouſneſſe thereof,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7855:35"/>
and all theſe things ſhall bee caſt vpon you</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 6. 33</note>.
<hi>The Lyons lacke, and are hungerbit</hi> (ſaieth
<hi>Dauid) but they that feare the Lord ſhall
vvant nothing that is good</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſa. 34. 10</note>. They ſhall not
want health, wealth, peace, &amp;c. if God ſee
them to be good for them, if they do want
them, they may boldly ſay, they are not
good for them, &amp;c. Seeing then godlineſſe
hath a promiſe euen of the things of this
life, all needfull wants ſhall ſeaſonably be
ſupplied, ſo that Gods people (caſting
their care vpon the Lord, and doing their
honeſt endeuours) may boldly ſay, <hi>The
Lord is my ſhepheard, I ſhall not want.</hi> And
ſurely, it is both maruellous and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider and obſerue, Gods great
prouidence towardes his poore ſaints in
this reſpect, wherein <hi>Dauids</hi> experience
is verfied, <hi>Nunquam vidi iustum derelic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
I haue beene young and now am olde,
yet neuer ſavve I the righteous forſaken,
or his ſeede begging breade</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Pſa. 37. 25</note>. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
anſwere is this, there are two other
ſorts of wantes. The firſt is in regarde of
outward condition, and the ſecond, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of inwarde affection. There is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a rich man poor, ſwimming in wealth,
and yet pining away with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall wants
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7855:35"/>
like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> whom the Poets faigne to
die for thirſt, ſtanding in waters to the
chinn: ſuch a one the wiſe man ſpeaketh
of, <hi>VVho is alone and hath neither ſonne
nor brother, yet there is none ende of all his
trauell, neyther can his eye be ſatisfied vvith
riches</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Eccles. 4 8</note>. And there is many a poore man,
exceeding rich, becauſe though he ſuſtain
ſome want in regarde of his outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
yet God hath enlarged his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp; giuen him true contentation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
more chearfully to praiſe God for a
dinner of greene hearbes, then the wicked
do for the feaſt of a ſtalled Oxe, hauing
learned with the Apoſtle, <hi>to bee full, and
to be hungrie, to abounde, and to haue vvant,

            <p>2 The ſecond leſſon which from hence
we learne,<note place="margin">Doctrine. 2</note> is, that the condition of Gods

the naturall man perceiue it not, for
of them (as one verie well obſerueth) theſe
contraries (in diuerſe ſenſes) may truly be
affirmed.</p>
            <p>1 They are the richeſt &amp; the pooreſt: the
richeſt, becauſe as our Prophet ſaith, <hi>they
want nothing:</hi> and as the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>they
poſſeſſe all things</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">2. Cor. 6 10</note>, for <hi>beeing Christes

ſpoyle of their goods, and loſſe of liues for
Chriſt his ſake.</p>
            <p>2 They are the wiſeſt, and the fooli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheſt:
The wiſeſt, becauſe <hi>they build vppon

            <p>

treaſures, then the riches of the world<note n="ſ" place="margin">Heb. 11. 25</note>.</p>
            <p>3 They are the higheſt and the loweſt,

               <note n="t" place="margin">Phil. 3. 20</note>, and they are the loweſt, <hi>as being tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

yea, as a But, where againſt euery man ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

            <p>4 <hi>They are the fayreſt and the fowleſt.
The fayreſt, becauſe they are</hi> members of
the Church, the ſpouſe of Christ, for which
he gaue himſelf, that he might ſanctifie it &amp;
clenſe it, by the waſhing of water through the

to the</hi> Sunne &amp; Moone<note n="y" place="margin">Cant. 6. 9</note>: <hi>and they are
the fouleſt, both in their owne eies, and the

of Kedar, the Sunne hauing looked vppon
them<note n="z" place="margin">Cant. 1. 4</note>.</p>
            <p>5 They are the merrieſt and the ſaddeſt;
The merrieſt, becauſe they haue the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the remiſſion of ſins, and of Gods
fauour in Chriſt, which maketh them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<hi>to reioyce in the Lord</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 4. 4</note>: and for that
they haue the peace of a good conſcience,
<hi>which is as a continuall feaſt</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Prou. 25. 15</note>, and do know
<hi>that all things worke togither for the beſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 28</note>. And they are the ſaddeſt, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
continuall occaſion to weepe, both
for the ſinnes of others, as did <hi>Dauid</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 119 136</note>, &amp;
for their owne ſinnes, as did <hi>Ioſiah, whoſe
heart did melt, and hee wept before the
Lord</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">2. Chr. 34 27</note>. And ſurely the conſideration of
their often offending of the Maieſtie
of thier moſt mercifull and louing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
maketh them many times to
faint in their mourning, yea their beds to
ſwimme, <hi>and to water their Couches with
teares</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 6. 6</note>. And whereas others ſpend their
daies in brutiſh delights, <hi>they ſow in tears</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Pſ. 126. 5</note>.
But this is their comfort, that <hi>God reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
their teares in a bottle</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 56. 8</note>, and will one
day <hi>wipe them away from their eies, with
euerlasting comfort</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Eſay. 25. 8</note>, whereas the other
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7855:38"/>
               <hi>ſhal haue their portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the lake burning with
fire &amp; brimstone, where ſhall be weeping, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
&amp; gnaſhing of teeth</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 8. 12</note>. In regard wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
our Sauiour hath pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, <hi>Bleſſed are
they that weepe, for they ſhall laugh, but wo be
to you that nowe laugh, for you ſhall vvaile

               <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 6. 21</note>.</p>
            <p>6 Laſtly, they are the ſtrongeſt, &amp; the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt.
The ſtrongeſt, for that they are able to
preuaile with God, as did <hi>Iacob,</hi> who <hi>wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with God, &amp; obtained the bleſſing</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 32 28</note>, as <hi>Lot</hi>

<hi>indignation vpon the heads of the wicked</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 19 22</note>,
and as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>ſtand in the gap to turne
away his fierce vvrath</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 106. 23</note>, yea, they are able
to doe all thinges by the power of Ieſus
Chriſt, ſtrengthning them, as ſpeaketh the
Apoſtle<note n="p" place="margin">Phil. 4. 13</note>. And they are the weakeſt, as
<hi>not able of themſelues to thinke a good
thought</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">2. Co. 3. 5</note>. For which, and many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
the members of the Church are not
vnfitly compared to the braunches of the
Vine, which of themſelues are the weakeſt
and tendereſt of al plants, not able of them
ſelues to grow vpright, vnleſſe they be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derpropped,
and faſtned vp.</p>
            <p>The vſe whereof is,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> that we be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
with the contempt of Gods
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7855:39"/>
children, in this wicked world, but rather
looke vnto their ſpiritual beautie, and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
comlineſſe, wherein, they <hi>are as faire as
the Curtaines of Salomon</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Cant. 1. 4</note>: <hi>And though they

               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſ. 68. 13.</note>.</p>
            <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Doctrine. 3</note> from hence we may learne, that
Gods deareſt ſeruants, in this life, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to many alterations &amp; changes: looke
vpon <hi>Iob,</hi> who ſomtimes fearefully curſed
himſelf, &amp; the day of his birth, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained
of gods rigorous dealing towards him, as
though he had ſet him as a But to ſhoot at,
&amp; would not ſuffer him to take his breath,
nor ſwallow his ſpittle, ſomtimes again ſo

him, yet vvould he trust in him</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Iob 13. 25</note>. But what
need we other example the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
who was ſomtimes ſo greatly caſt downe,
that the earth rang againe with his wofull

               <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 22. 1</note>? <hi>vvhat,

and vvilt thou no more be intreated? &amp;c.</hi>
Sometimes againe ſo comfortable, in the

aſſurance of Gods fauour, and ſo ſtrong in

               <note n="w" place="margin">Pſal. 3. 6</note>. <hi>Yea,
though mountanes did remoue, and hils vvere
hurled into the midst of the ſea, for the Lord
is my ſtrong rocke, caſtell, &amp; defence, he hath
made my feete like Hindes, I ſhall breake a

is nothing but mourning like the Doue,

Well, the Lord, hee knoweth what is beſt

            <p>The firſt and cheefeſt care of a good
Shepheard,<note place="margin">The firſt dutie of a good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, is to prouide good and wholeſome paſture for his ſheepe.</note> is to prouide freſh and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
paſture for his ſheepe, for though
they haue all other things neuer ſo aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
yet if they want this, they periſh;
and ſo it is with Gods ſheep, which made
our Sauiour Chriſt, that <hi>great Shepheard
and Biſhop of our ſoules,</hi> as the Apoſtle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
him<note n="c" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 25</note>, ſo earneſtly to require <hi>Peter,</hi>
and in him all the Apoſtles, and their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Succeſſors: <hi>Feed, feed, feed, my ſheep</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Io. 21. 17</note>, &amp;
and <hi>Peter</hi> with no leſſe earneſtnes, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

               <note n="e" place="margin">1. Pe. 5. 2</note>.
1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. Yea, how great care the Lord
hath, that his ſheepe doe want no food, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
moſt notably from the prophecie
of <hi>Ezechiel, becauſe the Shepheards of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7855:42"/>
feed themſelues, and feede not my flocke,
I will my ſelfe feed my ſheepe in good and fat
pasture, vpon the mountaines of Iſraell</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ezec. 34. 14.</note>. And
Chriſt that good Shepheard hath ſayd; <hi>I
am that dore, by mee if any man enter in, hee
ſhall be ſaued, and ſhall goe in and out, and
find paſture</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Io. 10. 9.</note> But that I may not confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
handle this point, let vs briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
theſe few things: firſt, what is this
paſture or food; 2. What manner of paſture
it is. 3. where it groweth, &amp; is to be found.
4. laſtly, how Gods Sheepe ought to feed
thereon.</p>
            <p>1 For the firſt,<note place="margin">VVhat is the paſture of Gods ſheepe.</note> This good Shepheard,
feedeth the bodies of his ſheep, with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and corporall food, <hi>for it is hee that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
all good thinges aboundantly to enioy</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">1. Tim. 6 17.</note>.
Yea there is not a morſell of bread, that
we eat, but it is the gift of God, begged
at his handes, <hi>Giue vs this day, our dayly
bread,</hi> &amp;c<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 6. 11.</note>. And is ſanctified to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
by <hi>the word and prayer</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">1. Ti. 4. 5</note>. Secondly, he
feedeth the ſoules of his ſheepe, with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and heauenly food, euen <hi>the hidden
mannah, and bread of life, which is come
downe from heauen, Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, of
which bread whoſoeuer eateth by a true faith,
ſhall liue for euer</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 33.</note>: and this is called <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7855:42"/>
Mannah</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Reu. 2. 17.</note>. That mannah which the
fathers did eat in the wilderneſſe, was ſeen,
taſted, and eaten of all; but this bread of
life the Lord Ieſus, whereof that was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
or figure, is a hidden mannah,
none can come nigh it, none can ſee it, none
can taſt of it, but ſuch as haue a true and
liuely faith; they all indeede which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
ſhall receiue ſomewhat of it, euen
as it were ſome morſels therof in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
life, (which ſhalbe ſufficient to make
them liue, yea to make them fat and well
liking) and in the life come, they ſhall bee
moſt plentiouſly filled, and feede thereof
with continuall delight; for it is not as our
daintie meats wherwith we fill the belly,
which (though they be neuer ſo ſweet and
delicate) when we are full, wee loath, but
the ſweet taſt hereof continueth ſtill, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſacietie for euermore: bleſſed are
they which hunger for this heauenly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,
as they cannot but long for it, which
once doe truely taſt it, nay the more wee
feed, the more we ſhall hunger, for all the
ſweete dainties of the world, are but as
draffe vnto it.</p>
            <p>2 Secondly,<note place="margin">VVhat ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, Gods ſheepe feede vpon.</note> if you would knowe what
manner of paſture this is, it is not barren,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7855:43"/>
rotten, or ſoyled graſſe: but the Prophet
ſaith, it is greene or flouriſhing paſture,
and that principally in theſe two reſpects:
Firſt, becauſe though all Gods ſheepe, who
euer liued heretofore, though thouſand
thouſands haue fed therein; yet it waſteth
not, but is ſtill as greene, and ſufficient to
feed euerie beleeuer, as euer it was, for <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt yesterday, &amp; to day, the ſame is for
euer</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 13. 8</note>, <hi>the Lambe ſlaine from the beginning
of the world</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Reu. 13. 8</note>, and that <hi>Lambe of God which
for euer taketh away the ſinnes of the world</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29</note>.
Secondly, becauſe the longer we feed, the
fatter we ſhall be, we neede no change, as
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith: <hi>Such as be planted in the houſe
of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our
God, they ſhall bring forth more fruit in their
age, and ſhall be fat and well liking</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Pſ. 92. 13</note>, and as
it is greene, and flouriſhing, ſo alſo ſweet
and nouriſhable, compared <hi>to wine and
milke</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Eſa. 55. 1.</note>. Yea, by the ſame Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi>
in another place, compared <hi>to wines fined
and purified,</hi> and <hi>to fat thinges full of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Eſa. 25. 9.</note>.</p>
            <p>3 Thirdly, where doth this greene and
flouriſhing paſture grow?<note place="margin">VVhere this good paſture groweth.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A. Surely, not on euery mountaine, nor
in waſt wilderneſſes, and vntilled forreſts,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7855:43"/>
but as God himſelfe ſaith, thrice in one
Chapter, alreadie cyted, <hi>it only groweth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the high mountains of Iſrael</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Ezec. 34. 13, 14.</note>. And what
are theſe high mountaines of Iſrael, but
the <hi>high and holy Oracles of God committed
vnto Iſrael</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 3. 2</note>. The woord of God is that
<hi>ſweet and ſincere milke wherewith he feedeth
his lambes</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 2.</note>, and the ſacred Scriptures,
are thoſe pleaſant paſture fields, wherein
grow thoſe liuing hearbs, wherof whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
eateth by faith, ſhall be fed vp to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life: in compariſon whereof, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
writings of men, are but as barrein
and drie mountaines, which thing Gods
ſheepe doe well know, and therefore will
not follow, but rather flie from thoſe ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
that would lead them into other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
<hi>and feed them with other food</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 5</note>. Here
then is a good Caueat for all ſuch as are
deputed Paſtors, by the great Shepheard,
that (if they deſire to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d faithful vnto
the flocke, and to render an account with
ioy) they make conſcience to feede Gods
ſheep with the right paſture, according to
the councell of S. <hi>Peter: If any man ſpeak,
let him speake as the wordes of God</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 11</note>, and
not follow the example of thoſe treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Paſtors in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7855:44"/>
ſuffer the ſoules of Gods people to famiſh
and pine away, hauing nothing to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, but Schoole-mens toyes, mens
traditions, and vnwritten verities, as they
call them, tying their conſciences to a
ſtrickt obſeruation of daies, whereof ſome
are blaſphemous, many fabulous, and all
of them idolatrous; and alſo enioyning
them a preciſe difference of meats, as <hi>taſt
not, touch not, handle not</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 21.</note>, and that for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
pietie and religion ſake, wherein they
come no whit ſhort of the old heretickes,
<hi>the Tatianes, and Manichies, in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of this doctrine of Diuels,</hi> as the holy
Apoſtle calleth it<note n="a" place="margin">1. Ti. 4. 1.</note>.</p>
            <p>4 Now that wee haue ſeene what it is,<note place="margin">How Gods ſheepe muſt come to feed in his paſture.</note>
the manner of it, and where this paſture
groweth, let vs in the laſt place, conſider
how Gods ſheep muſt come to feed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that doth <hi>Marie</hi> tell vs in her

and ſendeth away the rich emptie</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 1. 53.</note>. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
was made by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,
for all them that thirsted, to come to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of life</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Eſay 55. 1</note>. yea, and by Chriſt himſelfe,
who in the laſt and great day of the feaſt,
ſtood and cryed, <hi>He that thirsteth, let him

               <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 7. 37.</note>, and pronounceth them

               <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 5. 6</note>: whereby we
are giuen to vnderſtand, that they are no
marchants for Gods market, to buy wine
and milke, that doe not thirſt; nor ſheepe
to feed in his greene paſtures, that haue
full ſtomacks, for ſuch is the qualitie of
this graſſe, ſo ſweet, pleaſant, and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
that the more we taſt, and feed on
it, the more ſhall wee hunger after it: the
more we read, heare, meditate, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
our ſelues in the holy Scriptures, the
greater will bee our deſire, and delight
therein.</p>
            <p>Here then commeth to be bewailed,<note place="margin">The feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the word in euerie place very lamentable.</note> the
lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table eſtate of many thouſands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners
of the word of God, who make
no conſcience to repaire to thoſe places of
Gods worſhip, where the bread of life is
broken, but ſpend the beſt houres of the
beſt daies, in carding and dicing, piping
and dauncing, chambering and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ryot and drunkenneſſe, ſpeaking e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
of them, that will not run with them,
in their damnable waies; Oh, what will
not men doe to ſatisfie their hunger? and
what careth hee for delicates that is full
gorged? Euen this one thing doth witnes
to the faces of many thouſands in this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7855:45"/>
land, that they haue neuer yet truly taſted
of this heauenly food. When Mannah firſt
fell, the people of Iſrael were ſo exceeding
greedie and deſirous of it, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
God was mercifull to preuent
ſinne, by taking away the occaſion, not
ſuffering any to fal vpon the Saboath day,
yet notwithſtanding ſome of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie

               <note n="f" place="margin">Ex. 16. 25.</note>. But they had not long eaten
of it their bellies full, but they beganne
to loath it, ſaying: <hi>Our ſoules are dried vp,
we can ſee nothing but this Mannah</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Num. 11 6.</note> Euen
ſo, when it pleaſed God, that by the

began firſt to be preached in this land,
oh how forward and zealous men were,
ſparing for no labor or coſt, ſo they might

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7855:45"/>
the Goſpel hath beene preached, but euen

from vs, as he threatned the
Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Reu. 2. 5.</note>. It woulde make a
mans heart to bleede, that hath in it any
ſparke of remorſe, and is not harder then
Flint, or Adamant, to paſſe by the priſons
and grates in London and elſe-where, to
ſee their gaſtly countenances, and heare
their rewful complaints, for want of food:
but ſurely if euery ſoule had but a grate to
looke through, &amp; crie for her ſelfe, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times more wofull and lamentable,
would their crie be in all places and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
and yet is this the miſerable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7855:46"/>
the hunger of the bodie is felt and
perceyued, whereby all good meanes
are vſed for comfort, but the want of the

prouide wholſome foode for his ſheepe,
which thing our heauely ſhepheard, doth

that we may ſay with <hi>Dauid, The Lorde

               </note> The 2.
dutie of a good ſhepheard is to prouide,

Countryes and Regions, and therefore we

<hi>behold there was a Well in the field, and loe,
three flockes of ſheepe lay thereby, for at that

               <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 29. 2. 3</note>: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
wee reade of the Prieſt of <hi>Midians</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7855:47"/>
the Prophet ſignifieth, the ſweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
graces of Gods ſpirit, conueyd by
the conduit pypes of his worde and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for the refreſhing of the drie and
thirſtie ſoules of his people, which Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor
is very common in the Scriptures, ſo
the Lord telleth his Church, <hi>that he waſhed

               <note n="o" place="margin">Eze. 16. 9</note>, and promiſeth that <hi>hee

her from al her filthineſſe</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Eze. 36. 25</note>. Yea, Chriſt hath
ſaid, <hi>Except a man bee borne of this vvater,

of heauen</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Iohn. 3. 5</note>. And vnto the woman of

ſhall thirst againe, but vvhoſoeuer ſhall
drinke of the vvater that I ſhall giue him,
ſhall neuer thirſt any more, but the water that

               <note n="r" place="margin">Ioh. 4. 13 14</note>.
And yet moſt plainely elſewhere in the

as ſaith the Scripture, out of is bellie ſhall

               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ioh. 7. 37 38</note>) And ſurely this Metaphor
is not ſo frequent and common, as fit and
ſignificant: for as there is nothing more
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7855:47"/>
acceptable to a wearie, thirſtie traueller,
then a cup of cold water (ſo that wiſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>

            <p>If wee would know the excellencie of
theſe graces, the Church by two worthie
Metaphors, declareth the ſame: firſt ſayth
ſhe: <hi>Thy name is like the ſauour of a good

oyntment powred out</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Cant. 1. 2</note>. What doth more
delight the ſenſe of ſmelling, then the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of ſome precious oyntment, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
the ſame powred out. We read in the
Goſpel, of a woman, which had a box of
verie coſtly oyntment of Spiknard, &amp; ſhee
brake the boxe, <hi>and povvred the oyntment
vpon the head of Ieſus as he ſate at the table,
and the houſe was filled vvith the ſwet ſauour
thereof</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mar. 14. 3. Iohn. 12. 3</note>. But theſe graces which do runne
from Chriſt as the head, into all the partes
of his myſticall bodie, are farre, ſweeter,
then any ſpikenard, or that <hi>moſt precious
oyntment, vvhich vvas povvred vppon the
head of Aaron, and ran dovvne to the ſkirts
of his cloathing</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Pſa. 133. 2</note> Secondly, thy loue is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

bleſſing, giuen <hi>to make glad the heart</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 104 15</note>.
And therefore the wiſe man would haue
wine giuen to him that hath grief of hart,
that he may forget his pouertie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
his his miſerie no more<note n="f" place="margin">Pro. 31. 6</note> yea, what
more pleaſant to the taſte then wine, in ſo
much that many make it their greateſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie,
to fill and ſtuffe themſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
but yet in compariſon hereof, the
ſweeteſt wines are as bitter as gall and
wormewood. For what can wine, or any
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7855:48"/>
worldly delights, giue comfort to him
that is vexed with Gods ſtormes, affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with terrors of an euil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, or on
whoſe ſoul the horrors of hel haue ſeazed.
No, no, it is onely the aſſurance of Gods
loue, and comfortable graces of his ſpirit,
that maketh ſuch an ones heart reioyce
with ioy vnſpeakable and glorious; witnes
the Apoſtles, who hauing taſted hereof,
they forgot their preſent miſery and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

ſweete waters of <hi>Shiloah,</hi> flowing from
the ſanctuarie of God, and running ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Once to touch them with their lips,
which indeede is a fearefull argument,
that moſt haue neuer yet truely taſted of
them, for (as we heard before) the nature
of Gods paſture is ſuch, that the more
his ſheepe do feed therein, the more they
hunger after it: ſo the nature of his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is ſuch, that the more his ſheepe doe
drinke thereof, the more they may, yea,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7855:49"/>
the more inſaciably doe they thirſt after
them, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that
none are more importunate ſutors vnto
God, to haue his graces increaſed in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
nor more diligent and zealous in the vſe
of the ſanctified meanes, then ſuch as by
his mercie haue obtained the greateſt

haue the Church herſelfe, who beeing
brought into Chriſtes wine-celler, and
hauing taſted how ſweet it was vnto her

flagons of wine, <hi>being verie ſicke of loue</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Can. 2. 4, 5</note>.
The meaning is this, that Chriſt giuing
to his Saints the earneſt and firſt fruits of
the ſpirit, and as it were through little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes
diſtilling into their ſoules, a drop or
twaine of his mercies and loue, they are
ſo rauiſhed with the ſweeteneſſe thereof,
that they become not onely loue-ſicke,
but euen readie to faint, and to ſwound

are two things therein to be conſidered.
Firſt, the <hi>Conuerter</hi> (the Lord:) ſecondly,
the thing <hi>conuerted</hi> (the ſoule:) for the

            <p>He reſtoreth <hi>reſtituit animam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> the words
are plaine, our leſſon for inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this,
viz. That it is not our action, or in our
power, in part, or in all, to become the
ſheepe of Chriſt, but it is wholy the work
of God in vs, according to that of Chriſt,
in the Goſpell of ſaint <hi>Iohn,</hi>

And againe in the ſame Goſpel, <hi>Other

               <note n="g" place="margin">Io. 10. 26</note>. For although in this

as that he (<hi>must</hi>) conuert the ſoul,
nor yet any exception, or excluſion, as
though (<hi>none other</hi>) could do it, but he:

            <p>The vſe of which doctrine ſerueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to reforme our iudgement, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a very groſſe and daungerous he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
maintained by the Church of Rome,
about the free will of man, in his pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7855:57"/>
I will not in way of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon place
enter into the handling of this large,<note place="margin">VVherein the Papiſtes and wee doe differ about free-will.</note> and
great controuerſie, with obiections, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres,
and replies, but onely by the way,
as I am occaſioned by my text, briefly lay
open the ſtate of the queſtion, and then
ſhew wherein they doe ſwarue both from
vs, and the deliuered and approued truth.
for the firſt, we may note, that the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of man is foure-fold. 1 Of creation,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2 Of corruption, 3 Of regeneration,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Of glorification: ſecondly, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that the obiects of will are diuerſe,
and ſpecially of three ſorts. 1 Naturall
actions, which are common to men with
beaſts, as to eate, drinke, ſleepe, heare, ſee,
ſmell, &amp;c. 2 Humane actions, as practiſe
of Mechanicall and liberall artes, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of morall vertues. 3 Actions ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
&amp; diuine, &amp;c. Now the queſtion of
free-will betwixt them and vs, is to bee
vnderſtoode, of mans free-will, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſpirituall actions, in the ſtate of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
for in the other, though we alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
agree not, yet is not the difference
ſo great,<note place="margin">3.</note> and materiall. Laſtly, wee are to
note, that ſpirituall actions, are two-fold,
either ſuch as concerne the kingdome of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7855:57"/>
darkeneſſe, or ſuch as corcerne the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God: for ſuch actions as concerne
the kingdom of darknes, and are properly
ſins, we ioyne with them, and teach, that
in theſe man hath freedome of will ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
neceſſarily, but not conſtraynedly<note n="p" place="margin">Neceſſarie ſed non co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acte. &amp;c. In primae gratiae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptione; homines non ſeſe habent mere <gap reason="foreign">

But the maine difference betwixt them
and vs, is about free-wil in mans naturals,
as it is exerciſed, concerning actions ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and good, as repentaunce, faith, the
conuerſion of a ſinner, new obedience, &amp;
ſuch like: yet not as concerning the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
it ſelfe; for we ioyne with them and
ſay, that in the firſt conuerſion of a ſinner,
mans free-will doth concurre, with Gods
grace, as a fellow-worker in ſome ſort, for
God doth not worke vpon man as a ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
block or ſtone. <hi>Non ſicut lapidibus aut

worde, or ſpirit; for no man was euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
againſt his wil, neither is will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained,
any will. But in this they and we
do exceedingly differ, as concerning the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7855:58"/>
cauſe of this libertie of will, in theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
matters concerning Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
for they ſay, mans free will is not
wholly extinguiſhed, but attenuated and
abated, as the man that fell amongſt
theeues, and was left halfe dead: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being aided and aſſiſted of grace, it is
able to will any thing appertaining vnto
ſaluation, and of it ſelfe to worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with grace, and ſo they giue not all
the glorie of their conuerſion vnto God,
but attribute <hi>part vnto grace, and part vnto
free will, working by a naturall power</hi>

when it is ſtarke naught, and to think with

let vs (as in the ſight of God) examine our

it is therefore the dutie of a verie good
Shepheard, not onely to prouide paſture,
water, ſhadow, and to cheriſh the weake,
but alſo to guide and lead them in the
plaine way, from the fold to the paſture,
and from paſture, to paſture, according to
that of our Sauiour Chriſt, in the Goſpell
of S. <hi>Iohn, A good Shepheard calleth his

when hee hath ſent forth his owne ſheepe, hee
goeth before them, and the ſheep follow him</hi>

That it might therefore appeare, that God

is not wanting in the perfourmance of

and quickneth them by his ſpirit from

and leadeth them in the path of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
finiſhing the good worke, which he
hath begunne in them, to his owne glory

            <p>The generall doctrine from this ſtraine,<note place="margin">The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine from this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</note>
is this, viz: That as in God is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion
of our ſoules, ſo from him is the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of our vpright walking before him;
if euer he leaue vs to our ſelues, we feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſtart aſide, as we haue an example in
that faithfull and zealous King <hi>Ezekiah,
who being left of God, to trie him; in ſtead of
thankefulneſſe,</hi> (both for his gracious deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance
out of the hands of his enemies,

<hi>he bewrayed great pride of heart, in ſhewing

            </p>
            <p>Q. If this be our weaknes, what is then
the ground of our aſſurance, that being
once conuerted, and brought into the
ſtate of grace, we ſhall continue therein?</p>
            <p>A. Euen here it is laid down, <hi>The Lord
will lead vs in the pathes of righteouſneſſe
this grace hath Chriſt prayed for, who was
heard in all thinges</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 11. 42</note>

vs ouer long, but ſo order our goings
and lead vs forth, in the right way, that
for the beginning, continuance, and end of
our ſaluation, his name may haue all the
praiſe.</p>
            <p>The vſe whereof is,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> that no man glory

So much for the doctrine and vſe of this

as if it were inough for Gods people to

but the Lord doth lead &amp; conduct them
ſhewing them the way and giuing them

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7855:64"/>
good virgin, her onely ioy and deſire is to
runne after Chriſt, in whom ſhe knoweth

will not ſerue, her knees are ſo feeble, that
ſhe fainteth in the race, ſhe is ſo fettered
<hi>and hampred with the remnants of ſinne, and

               <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 12. 1 Gal. 5. 17.</note>, <hi>that ſhee cannot doe that which ſhee

               <note n="f" place="margin">Ro. 7. 15</note>, She loueth Chriſt, and yet is not

            <p>The vſe wherof ſerueth to condemne

But the true Church hauing receyued
grace; yea, after ſhe had run, and doth run:
yet ſhe craueth his graces, whereby ſhee
may bee enabled to runne faſter, and to
runne to the end; and <hi>Dauid</hi> here, though
he acknowledge hee hath receiued grace,
and God hath conuerted his ſoule; yet
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7855:64"/>
ſtandeth he in need,<note n="h" place="margin">Certum eſt nos velle cum volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ſed ille facit vt, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim us bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ratum eſt nos facere, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> facimus, ſed ille fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, vt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciamus, de bono perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verat. ca. 16.</note> ſtill by his grace, to

it being certaine, that it is man
that willeth, whatſoeuer is willed, but god
is the cauſe that hee willeth that which is
good, man worketh whatſoeuer is
wrought, but God is the cauſe that we do
that which is good.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee may note, that <hi>Dauid,</hi>
ſayth not, he (<hi>compelleth</hi>) but (<hi>leadeth</hi>) for
though the Shepheard doe ſtand in neede
of a rod to correct his wandring ſheepe,<note place="margin">2. Note.</note>
and make the ſlouthfull plodders, to paſe
it better, (as wee ſhall heare from the
next verſe) yet doeth God ſo inwardly
frame the affections of his Saints, that they
doe chearefully run in the wayes, of Gods
commandements, and after a holy maner,
doe ſtriue vnto perfection; ſo ſaith <hi>Dauid,
I will run the wayes of thy commandements,

            <p>Oh good Lord, if this bee our eſtate,

a reaſon of your faith, and maintaine the

meaſure of zeale, that rather then you
would ioyne with Idolaters, and offend
God, and your conſciences, you would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
father, mother, yea, and your owne

to take this or that paines to go to heare

alas, there is a fearefull backſliding, you
doe account them but hotte ſpirited fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
that take that courſe, or if you doe

righteouſneſſe is ſo excellent, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle

ſayeth in the next words.</p>
            <p>(For his names ſake;)<note place="margin">Sence of the words.</note> 
               <hi>concerning the

the</hi> (name) <hi>of God hath diuers ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the ſcriptures; as firſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>by</hi> name
<hi>are meant thoſe titles, whereby God is
named and knowne, as</hi> Iehouah, Elohim,
Shaddai, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Deus, <hi>God. &amp;c. As God ſaid

the children of Iſrael, the Lord God of your
Fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of

vnto you; this is my name for euer, and this
is my memoriall vnto all ages<note n="i" place="margin">Exo. 3. 14 15. &amp;c.</note>. <hi>And</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<hi>in his ſong giueth him this title,</hi> The
Lord is a man of war, his name is Iehouah<note n="k" place="margin">Exo. 15. 3</note>;
<hi>And concerning Chriſt, it is ſayd:</hi> This
is his name, whereby hee ſhall be called; the
Lord, our righteouſneſſe<note n="l" place="margin">Ierem. 23 6. 33. 16. 1. Cor. 1. 30</note>. <hi>And this is one
of thoſe ſences, according to which the
commaund is giuen,</hi> Thou ſhalt not take
the name of the Lord thy God in vaine<note n="m" place="margin">Exo. 20. 7</note>.</p>
            <p>2 Secondly, ſomtimes by the (<hi>name</hi>) of
<hi>God,</hi> is meant the perſon of God, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by the name or title, as the name of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7855:73"/>
the <hi>mightie God of Iacob defend thee</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">

Where is not meant any title of God, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah,
Tetragrammaton,</hi> or ſuch like, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Hebrew, or Greeke, this tongue
or that, (as they are of many ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
abuſed) but God himſelfe, <hi>by his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
power defend thee.</hi> So the people
are commanded to offer their ſacrifices,
in the place, which <hi>the Lord ſhall chooſe to
cauſe his name to dwell</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Deu. 16. 2</note>: and the Pſalmiſt
prayeth; <hi>Let them that loue thy (name) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce

               <note n="p" place="margin">Pſ. 5. 11.</note>. Againe, <hi>I will take the cup

               <note n="q" place="margin">Pſ. 116. 13.</note>, and the promiſe is made, <hi>whoſoeuer
ſhall call vpon the name of the Lord, ſhall be
ſaued</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Ioel 2. 32</note>. In all which and many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
by (name) is meant, the perſon of
God, it being vſuall in the ſcriptures, by
name, to vnderſtand, the thing ſignified
thereby, as where it is ſaid, <hi>there is no other
name vnder heauen, whereby we must be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Act. 4. 12.</note>, and to the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> the
Lord ſayeth, <hi>Thou haſt a few names, which
haue not defiled their garments</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Reu. 3. 4.</note>.</p>
            <p>3 Thirdly,<note place="margin">Quicquid de Deo, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re dici po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, Deus eſt.</note> by name are meant ſomtimes
the eſſentiall attributes of God, becauſe
thereby God is knowne, yea, God is the
ſame, for whatſoeuer may truely be ſayd
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7855:73"/>
of God, that God is, as he is true, he is the
trueth, God is wiſe, hee is wiſedome it
ſelfe. So the Lord thus proclaimed his
great &amp; glorious name vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nomen Dei dicitur, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne id, quod de illo prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatur.</note> 
               <hi>The
Lord, the Lord, strong, mercifull, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
ſlow to anger, and aboundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and trueth, reſeruing mercie for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
forgiuing iniquitie, tranſgreſſion, and
ſinne, and not making the wicked innocent,
viſiting the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the
children, vnto the third and fourth generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Exo. 34. 6</note>. So it is ſayd, <hi>that in the name of Chriſt
the Apostle caſt out Diuels</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">Mar. 16. 17.</note>. Not by the
repetition of the name (Ieſus) for the ſons
of <hi>Sceua,</hi> doing ſo, the euill ſpirit anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<hi>Ieſus I acknowledg, &amp; Paule I know, but
who are ye? and the man in whom the euill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
was, ran vpon them, and ouer came them,
and preuailed againſt them, that they fledde
out of the houſe, naked and wounded, as S.
Luke witneſſeth, in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Act. 19. 15. 16.</note>. But by name is meant the power,
ſtrength, and vertue of Chriſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth
in the Acts, where (declaring
the meanes, how the Cripple was healed)
he ſaith, <hi>It was not their power and godlines
that had made the man goe</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Act. 3. 12 16.</note>. So S. <hi>Paule</hi>
ſayth: <hi>at the name of Ieſus euerie knee ſhall

               <note n="z" place="margin">Phi. 2. 10</note>, that is, not when the word is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
we ſhall make a curteſie, but we

            <p>4 Somtimes alſo by (<hi>name</hi>) his works,<note place="margin">Nomine (Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus) domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio &amp; poteſtas; (genu flec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis) vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabulo, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primitur ſubiectio.</note>
creatures, and iudgements, are meant, as
where <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith; <hi>O Lord our God, how
excellent is thy name in all the world, which
haſt ſet thy glorie aboue the heauens</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pſ. 8. 1.</note>. q. d.
How greatly doth thy glorie, power, and
maieſtie ſhine in thy creatures.</p>
            <p>5 By (<hi>name</hi>) is meant many times the
doctrine of Gods word, inuocation, praiſe,
and profeſſion thereof; So it is ſayd of
Chriſt in the Pſalmes: <hi>I will declare thy
name vnto my brethren</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pſ. 22. 22</note>. And the people
of God ſay, <hi>We will walke in the name of the
Lord our God for euer and euer</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Mich. 4. 5</note>: ſo <hi>Paule</hi>
is called <hi>a choſen veſſell, to carie Gods name,
before Gentiles, Kings, and children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 9. 25</note>: and ſayth of himſelfe, <hi>That hee is
not onely readie to be bound at Ieruſalem, but
alſo to die for the name of the Lord Ieſus</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 21. 13</note>.
Now I take it, by (<hi>name</hi>) in this place the
Prophet vnderſtandeth the truth, mercie,
and goodneſſe of God, according to the
third annotation laid down, and then the
ſence is thus much in effect: <hi>q. d.</hi> This good
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7855:74"/>
Shepheard feedeth me, giueth me drinke,
prouideth reſt, and is exceeding bountiful
towards me, aboue all that I am able to
aske or think, not for any goodnes in me,
but onely for his owne meere mercie, and
goodneſſe ſake, that for euer he may bee
praiſed, for the ſame: this being the ſence,
let vs now ſee the doctrine, which is this,
viz:</p>
            <p>That,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> what good thing ſoeuer God hath
done or doth for his children, as in their
election, vocation, preſeruation: he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was, nor is therevnto mooued, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in them, or proceeding from
them, as not for their righteouſneſſe:
<hi>which is but vncleaneſſe</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Eſay 64. 6</note>: or for their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
<hi>which is but vanitie</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Prou. 31 30. Eſay. 40. 6.</note>: or for their

               <note n="h" place="margin">Iob. 17. 14.</note>, or for
their gold and ſiluer: <hi>which are no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe
with him</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Mic. 6. 7. 8 Pſal. 50. 10. 11. 12.</note>: but onely what hee
doth, hee doth for his owne name, and
mercie ſake, to the end, that for all, his
name may for euer bee praiſed, as the
Saints of God doe confeſſe, ſaying: <hi>Not
vnto vs, ô Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy
name giue the glorie, for thy louing mercie,
and truths ſake</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Pſ. 115. 1.</note>. This is agreeable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other places of Scripture: the Apoſtle
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7855:75"/>
               <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſayth, <hi>we were choſen in Chriſt before

               <note n="l" place="margin">Eph. 1. 4. 5</note>. The Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
proteſteth vnto Iſrael: <hi>For my names

cut thee not off; for mine owne ſake, for mine

               <note n="m" place="margin">Eſay 48. 9. 11.</note>: and againe, <hi>I will

               <note n="n" place="margin">Ezec. 20. 44</note>: and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
telleth them, what it was that moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him, to deliuer and redeeme his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
out of captiuitie, <hi>I doe not this for your

heathen whether ye went</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Ezec. 36. 22</note>. Yea, euerie
where the Scriptures confirme this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
viz: That in man there is no digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
or meanes whereby to deſerue any
thing at Gods hands, but the whole work
of our ſaluation, and all his bleſſings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
vpon vs, are wholly to bee refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto God, and that onely, for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of his holy name.</p>
            <p>And yet notwithſtanding the euidence
of this truth,<note place="margin">Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> they of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
are not aſhamed to maintain the doctrine

to the ſame, God did ſo order the decree
of predeſtination<note n="p" place="margin">Rhem. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. on Rom. 9. ſect. 2.</note>: yea and doe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

2 The ſecond Argument to this purpoſe,
may be, the ſence of our owne infirmities,
there being no man or woman ſo ſtronge

with euerie little ſhower of ſickneſſe,

we then liue as though wee ſhould neuer

            <p>3 The third Argument, may be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the dayly deaths of others,
which we either ſee with our eies, or heare
of with our eares; how many graue and
ſage Councellors, noble Peeres, worthy
men at armes, luſty gallants of the world,
yea neere neighbours, and deere freends
haue we knowne, whoſe heads now lye
full low, the pit, hauing ſhut her mouth
vpon them; how hath death come neere
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7855:83"/>
vnto all of vs one way or other, as in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
from vs, our Parents, Kinſ folkes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
and freends, yea taking forth
of our boſomes, our husbands, or wiues;
and our children the fruit of our loynes,
&amp; our friends as deere as our own ſoules;
yea, how often haue we followed to the
Church, and do dayly paſſe by the graues
of many, who for age and ſtrength might
haue ſeen vs lead the way? and what, ſhall
we for all this neuer dream of death? Oh
remember, one generation paſſeth, and
another commeth, our Fathers haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
place vnto vs, and we muſt giue place
to a ſucceeding poſteritie, the enterlude is
the ſame, they haue played their parts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the Scaffold of this world, and wee
are acting ours. This being the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of euerie ſcene, <hi>The graue is readie for
me,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> ſayth<note n="*" place="margin">Dies mei extingun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</note>.</p>
            <p>4 The Fourth &amp; laſt Argument,<note n="*" place="margin">Solum mihi ſuper eſt ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrum.</note> may be
drawne from conſideration of the vanitie
of all things in the world;<note place="margin">Iob. 17. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Salomon,</hi> whom
God for his wiſedome choſe, as it were
to be the foreman of a great enqueſt, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panelled
to make enquirie, of the ſtate of
the world, and all thinges therein, hauing
ſeene and experienced the ſame, he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7855:84"/>
for all, and giueth vp this verdict,
<hi>vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie.</hi> Euen the
young Infant, is no ſooner borne, but by
his teares doth prophecie the ſame<note n="*" place="margin">Nondum loquitur, tamen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetat.</note>. He
that is in want, liueth in greefe; he that
hath plentie, in feare; he that is in high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
is enuied: in a word, the proſperity
of worldlings, is but a golden miſerie<note n="*" place="margin">Splendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, miſeria.</note>,
affording neither perfect reſt to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die;
nor true content to the minde; well
then, as the poore Apprentiſe, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring
that the yeeres of freedome are at hand,
more cheerefully endureth a greeuous
ſeruitude; and the wearied trauailer, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that his Inne is nigh, more nimbly
pluketh vp his leaden heeles; euen ſo, let
the remembrance of our paſſing through
the valley of the ſhadow of death, and
our comming to Mount Sion on the
other ſide, where we ſhall for euer be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from all wants; be our comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing
in this weariſome pilgrimage,
and hereunto tendeth all which hath been
ſayd, viz: That with <hi>Dauid</hi> we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for death, in our greateſt proſperitie
of life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſome man may ſay, theſe paines
might well haue beene ſpared, for what
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7855:84"/>
man ſo ſottiſh, as not to thinke, that hee
is mortall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Indeed, nothing more common
than theſe, and ſuch like ſpeaches, wee ſee
what we are, we muſt all die, when our
turne commeth. But alas, this is more of
cuſtome, and ſpecially, when ſome preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of mortalitie is before our eies, than
of any true feeling<note n="*" place="margin">Magis v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu, quam ſenſu.</note>: whereby they might
be prouoked, to keepe a good conſcience
<hi>before God, and all men</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 24. 16</note>. So that as S.
<hi>Paule</hi> chargeth ſome men, for profeſſing
that they knowe God, when as in their
workes, they denyed him, being <hi>abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
diſobedient, &amp; to euerie good work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Tit. 1. 16</note>; So may moſt be charged in theſe
daies, becauſe though they profeſſe in
words the remembrance of death, yet by
their workes, they doe denie it, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bewray, <hi>that they doe not remember their
laſt end</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Lam. 1. 9</note>, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> complained of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:<note place="margin">Non eſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordata fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note>
and therefore much more to haue
ſayd, had not been ſufficient, for the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of ſo neceſſarie a dutie: but I will now
proceed to handle this verſe more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
wherein theſe thinges are to bee
conſidered:<note place="margin">1. The diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this verſe.</note> firſt, a diſcription of death,
through which <hi>Dauid</hi> and all Gods ſheep
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7855:85"/>
muſt paſſe, (it is a darke, and ſhadowye
valley) of death. Secondly, <hi>Dauids</hi> and
euerie Chriſtians courage againſt death,
(<hi>I will feare no euill.</hi>) Thirdly, the ground
or reaſon of this true courage or forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
viz: Gods preſence (<hi>for thou art with
me.</hi>) Laſtly, the benefits of Gods preſence
vnto his Saints, (<hi>Thy rodde and ſtaffe doe
comfort me) &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Subdiuiſion of the firſt part, of this verſe.</note> For the firſt, viz: the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
of death, it affoordeth vs theſe
points to be conſidered: Firſt, what death
is: Secondly, what are the kinds of death,
&amp; of which <hi>Dauid</hi> here ſpeaketh: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the difference betwixt the death of a
Chiriſtian, and of a bruit beaſt: Laſtly,
the titles, tending to the deſcription of
death here vſed. For the firſt:</p>
            <p>Death is the diſſolution of nature,<note place="margin">1. VVhat Death is.</note> and
depriuation of that bleſſed life, which he
vouchſafed vnto man, by his creation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inflicted vpon him, as a puniſhment
for his ſinne; thus God threatned <hi>Adam,
The day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt
die the death</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Ge. 2. 17.</note>. But <hi>Adam did eate of the
forbidden fruit</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">1 Gen. 3. 6.</note>. And thereupon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith, <hi>By one man ſinne entred into the
world, and death by ſinne</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ro. 5. 12.</note>, which death is
<hi>the puniſhment, and wage of ſinne,</hi> as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7855:85"/>
the ſame Apoſtle affirmeth<note n="t" place="margin">Ro. 6. 23.</note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. VVhat are the kinds of death.</note> as concerning the kindes
of death, there is mention made of a
foure-fold death in the Scripture, viz: firſt
a death in ſinne: 2. A death vnto ſinne:
3. The death of the bodie: Laſtly, the
death both of bodie and ſoule. For the
firſt, the man or woman is ſaid to be dead
in ſinne, in whome, <hi>ſinne raigneth</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 6. 12.</note>, and
who <hi>ſauoureth altogether the things of the
fleſh</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">Ro. 8. 5.</note>, and <hi>perceiue not the thinges of the
ſpirit</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 14.</note>: and this is the death of euery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man, and the wretched eſtate and
condition of euerie mothers child, as wee
come from the wombe: ſo <hi>Dauid</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
<hi>Behold I was borne in iniquitie, and in
ſinne, hath my mother conceiued me</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Pſ. 51. 5.</note>. And
in generall; the Apoſtle hath pronounced
of vs all, that by nature, wee are dead in
<hi>treſpaſſes, and ſinne</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Eph. 2. 1.</note>. And in particular,
ſayth of the widdow liuing in pleaſure,
that <hi>ſhee is dead, whilſt ſhee liueth</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1. Ti. 5. 6.</note>. And
ſurely,<note place="margin">The reaſon why all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate perſons li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in ſin, are ſayd to be dead.</note> the reaſon why ſuch as are aliue in
the fleſh, and be neuer ſo actiue, agill, and
nimble; yet ſo long as they continue in
their naturall corrupt eſtate, may iuſtly be
ſaid to be dead, is very great; for what is
there elſe but death in ſuch as are not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7855:86"/>
vnto God, <hi>the Fountaine of life</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Pſ. 36. 9.</note>?
and therefore as the immortalitie of thoſe
that are damned, <hi>is called death</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Reu. 20. 6</note>: becauſe
they <hi>are ſeparated from God, and the glorie
of his power</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">2. Theſſ. 1. 9.</note>. So the knitting together of
the bodie and ſoule, is properly no life,
but rather death, in ſuch as are not ruled
by the ſpirit of God, <hi>which is the Fountain
of life</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">genus mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tis, ſine poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere. Aug.</note>.</p>
            <p>2 Secondly, concerning death vnto ſin,
it is this,<note place="margin">VVhat it is to be dead vnto ſinne.</note> when by the power and vertue
of <hi>Chriſt his reſurrection</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Phi. 3. 10</note>, conuayed from
Chriſt as the head, to all the faithfull, as
members of his myſticall bodie; the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of ſinne is deſtroyed, and all his Saints
quickned vnto newneſſe of life, whereof
the Apoſtle thus ſpeaketh: <hi>How ſhall wee
that are dead to ſinne, liue yet therein</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 6. 2</note>. And
againe in the ſame Chapter, hee ſaith like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
<hi>Thinke ye alſo, that ye are dead to ſin,
but are aliue to God in Ieſus Christ our
Lord</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Ro. 6. 11.</note>. And this is called by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in
the Reuelation, <hi>the firſt Reſurrection</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Re. 20. 6.</note>, and
is indeed the verie firſt degree of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
life.</p>
            <p>3 Thirdly,<note place="margin">VVhat bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death is.</note> concerning the death of the
bodie, this it is: when the ſoule (whoſe
preſence, is cauſe of bodily life) returneth
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7855:86"/>
vnto <hi>God, that gaue it</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Eccl. 12. 7.</note>, and the bodie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of ſence and motion, returneth <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
duſt, from whence it was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 2. 7. 3. 19.</note>: Of which
our Sauiour ſpeaketh vnto his diſciples,
<hi>Our friend Lazarus is dead</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Io. 11. 14.</note>; and this is
called <hi>the firſt death</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Re. 20. 6</note>: becauſe it goeth
before; and vnto all reprobate perſons, is
as the dore that openeth, &amp; the entrance
into eternall death.</p>
            <p>4 Laſtly,<note place="margin">VVhat is the death of body and ſoule.</note> concerning the death of the
bodie and ſoule, it is this: when both of
them ſhall be ſeparated from God, <hi>and the
glorie of his power</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">2. Theſſ. 1. 9.</note>, and haue their portion
<hi>giuen them in extreame darkeneſſe</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 8. 12</note>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all <hi>hope of mercie or fauour</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Lu. 16. 25 26.</note>, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>euerlaſting perdition</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">2. Theſſ. 1. 9.</note>, and the
<hi>ſecond death</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Reu. 2. 11</note>.</p>
            <p>Three of theſe, viz: The death in ſinne,
2. Death vnto ſinne. 3. The death of
the bodie: are in this life; The fourth, viz:
The death of the ſoule and bodie, is in the
world to come; to be dead in ſinne, is of
nature: 2. to be dead vnto ſin, is of grace:
3. the death of the bodie, (not changed
by Chriſt:) and 4. the death of bodie and
ſoule, are of iudgement; by being dead
vnto ſinne, we are freed, 1. from death in
ſinne, 2. from eternall death, and 3. haue
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7855:87"/>
the death of the bodie changed, from a
puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for ſin into a bleſſing, to make
an end of ſinne; it being heauens churliſh
porter to let vs in to the preſence of God;
three of them. 1. The death in ſin; 2. The
death of the body. 3. Eternall death, are
moſt fearfull: but the fourth to die vnto
ſin, is moſt comfortable and ioyfull.</p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">Of which kind of deaths Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid here ſpeaketh.</note> of which of theſe kinds of deaths
<hi>Dauid</hi> here ſpeaketh, may eaſily be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
not of death in ſin, for with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
God is not; neither doth he ſpeake
of death vnto ſinne, for therin no euill is
to be feared; much leſſe doth he meane
the death of ſoule and bodie, which is a
perpetuall ſeparation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preſence of
God, and all euill in full meaſure powred
out: then by conſequent, he muſt needes
meane the death of the bodie, which to
nature is verie fearefull, but wherein the
Lord is graciouſly preſent with his, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
aſſurance wherof, the natural feare
of death is ſuppreſſed. And ſo much for
the kinds of death, and of which hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in this place.</p>
            <p>Concerning the third poynt,<note place="margin">3. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the death of man, and beaſt.</note> viz. the
difference betwixt the death of man and
beaſt; although in ſome ſenſe it bee
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7855:87"/>
moſt true, which the wiſe man, ſaith, viz.
<hi>that there is one condition of the children of
men, and of beaſtes: for as the one dieth ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the other, for they haue all one breath, and
there is no excellency of man aboue the beaſt,
for all is vanitie, all go to one place, and all
was of the duſt, &amp; al ſhal returne to the duſt,
who knoweth whether the ſpirit of man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
vpward, and the ſpirit of the beaſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
downeward to the earth</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ecclc. 3. 19 20, 21.</note>. q. d. No man
is able by his carnall reaſon and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">M. Perkins in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well.</note>
to put difference betwixt man and
beaſt, for the eie cannot iudge otherwiſe
of a man being dead, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a beaſt which
is dead: yet by the word of God, and eie
of faith wee learne and ſee, a wonderfull
difference, both in regard of the bodies
and ſoules<note n="*" place="margin">The great difference betwixt the bodies of man and beaſt, both being dead.</note>. For firſt in regard of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
though it returne vnto duſt and ſee
corruption, as the bodie of a bruit beaſt;
yet whereas the bodies of beaſts returne
into their firſt matter, and ſhall neuer bee
remembred, and ſo periſh in this valley,
and neuer go through it, yet the bodie of
man, and ſpecially of the elect, ſhall goe
through this valley, and be raiſed againe
the ſame for ſubſtance, but perfected in

            <p>Now let vs briefly view the titles which
<hi>Dauid</hi> here vſeth, and whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth
death; calling it (a darke or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowie

lightſome and comfortable vnto Gods
Saints, no doubt but in the verie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and inſtant of death, though the

himſelfe to deſcribe the terrors of
death (to the end that his Chriſtian cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

might more liuely appeare) ſpeaketh
of it as of a dark way, then which there is

Q. But did not Chriſt paſſe through
this valley and taſte of death for vs; why
then doth it yet remaine?</p>
            <p>A. It remaineth not, as it was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and is ſtill inflicted vpon the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
viz. a puniſhment for ſin, (for then
were God iniuſt to puniſh ſinne twice.)
But by Chriſt his death (though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
for triall and exerciſe of our faith,
courage, patience, &amp;c.) the nature of it
is changed to his elect, to become a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
freeing of them from ſinne, for the
ſting being taken away, it cannot hurt<note n="*" place="margin">Adeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſed non obeſt.</note>;
but is rather a bleſſing; that whereas ſinne
brought forth death, death will bee the
bane and deſtruction of ſinne, it was ſayd
to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Euah, If you ſinne, you ſhall
die</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 2. 17</note>: But now it is ſaid to all Gods elect,
<hi>You must die, that you may ceaſe to ſinne</hi>

gulf of deſpair, yet now are lifted vp again

            <p>Q. Againe, ſome for the infringing of
this doctrine, doe demaund, how we can
be perſwaded, that God is with them in
death, whoſe ſickneſſes, and death are ſo
comfortles, ful of idle &amp; rauing ſpeeches?</p>
            <p>A. Howſoeuer ſome, and eſpecially
the ſottiſh ignorant Papiſts, if a man die
quietly and patiently like a lamb, (though
there was neuer any faith, repentance, or
remorſe in his heart, at his death, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
and honeſtie in his life) doubtleſſe,
they thinke hee is ſaued; but if any that
profeſſe the truth of Ieſus Chriſt, doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any violent or extream paines, which
thorough weakeneſſe procure impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;
but ſpecially if they vtter any wordes
tending to diſtruſt or deſpaire, Oh then
whatſoeuer his life was, they crie out:
Oh, ſee the end of theſe men, and will
not ſpare to brand ſuch an one, with the
black marke of a reprobate: yea, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the whole profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
thereupon: Yet the truth is this, That
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7855:107"/>
Sathan as hee neuer ceaſeth in our whole
life, ſo much more is he buſie at our death
(taking the aduantage of ſickneſſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie
of nature) as knowing that hee
muſt then recouer, or for euer looſe his
Kingdome: and God may for a time (as it
were) ſtand aloofe, and leaue his children
in this great combate, that ſo hee might
bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to heauen, by the gates of hell<note n="*" place="margin">Cuncta dei opera, ſunt in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis.</note>.
Whereupon they may vtter harſh words,
according to their corrupt iudgement,
which are not to bee regarded, as before
we hard. Or elſe theſe things may proceed
from weaknes of nature, &amp; the violence of
the diſeaſe, the brain being diſtempered, as
in hot burning feauers, &amp;c. and then it is
not the man, but the diſeaſe, and they ſhal
die with the diſeaſe, and neuer preiudice
his ſaluation in Chriſt: nay, doubtleſſe
their ſpirituall comfort may abound not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
theſe things<note n="*" place="margin">Vera con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatio per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuo durat in electis, potiſſimum autem effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cax eſt circ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is a bleſſed life, which giueth comfortable
aſſurance of a bleſſed death, for ſurely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a prophane vnregenerate man, may
haue his memorie &amp; reaſon, and die moſt
meekely (as in conſumptions, and ſuch
like diſeaſes) and yet goe to hell; as thoſe
reprobates, of whome <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7855:108"/>
ſaying: <hi>they haue no bands in their death
like other men</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Pſ. 73. 4. 5</note>. Whereas many a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man, hauing led a ſanctified life; (by
violence of his diſeaſe) may be drawne to
great torment, idle ſpeeches, and ſtrange
behauiours, and yet goe to heauen: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let vs refourme our iudgement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and learne <hi>Salomons</hi> leſſon, not to iudge
of mans eſtate with God, by his outward
condition <hi>in life or death</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Eccl. 9. 2.</note>. And thus wee
haue heard the firſt braunch of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
confirmed, viz: That the Lord is
al waies with his elect, after a ſpeciall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
in due time to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, &amp; relieue them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond braunch of our doctrine
was this,<note place="margin">Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond branch of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</note> viz: That the aſſurance of Gods
preſence, is the ground of much patience,
and comfort vnto Gods Saints, paſſing
through any euill. So that in nothing
haue Gods Saints more reioyced, than in
this, and ſurely the Reaſons hereof are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and verie great, but eſpecially theſe
two.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt Reaſon, why the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, is a matter of ſuch great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Saints, is, becauſe he is able to helpe and deliuer them.</note> becauſe he onely is able to helpe
&amp; deliuer his Saints, which the greateſt &amp;
mightieſt Princes of the world, cannot do
though they vſed all their power, dignity,
and authoritie thereunto, no, they are not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7855:108"/>
able, in ſome caſes, for to help themſelues,
in regard whereof <hi>Dauid</hi> biddeth, <hi>That
we truſt not in Princes, nor in any child of
man, for there is no helpe in him, for when his
breath departeth, he returneth to the earth,
and all his thoughts periſh</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Pſ. 146. 3. 4.</note>, but <hi>if the Lord
be with vs, who can be against vs</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Ro. 8. 31.</note>? Which
thing the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> wel knew, whoſe
man being greatly diſcouraged, with the
ſight of the Syrian horſes, and chariots,
and mightie hoaſt: he cryed, <hi>Alas maſter,
what ſhall we doe?</hi> to whome he anſwered,
<hi>Feare not, for they bee moe that bee with vs,
than that bee with them, meaning that God
and all his Angels were on their ſide, for hee
prayed, and the Lord opened his ſeruants eies,
that he ſaw the mountaines full of horſes, and
chariots of fire</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">2. Ki. 6. 17.</note>. If therefore our enemies
be neuer ſo many, mightie, or politick, yet
the Lord being with vs, and on our ſide,
we need not to feare them, as <hi>Caleb</hi> and
<hi>Ioſhua</hi> ſayd to the people, whoſe hearts
did faint, when they heard by the other
ſpies, that the ſonnes of <hi>Anake</hi> dwelt in
the promiſed land: <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaid <hi>Caleb</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioſhua,
feare them not, they ſhall bee bread for vs,
their ſhield is departed from them, and the
Lord is with vs</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Num. 14. 9.</note>. Yea, if death be before
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7855:109"/>
our eies, we need not to feare Sathan, nor
hell, the Lord being with vs, as heere the
Prophet ſpeaketh, and this is the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why the Saints of God haue ſo hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
deſired, and ſo greatly gloried in Gods
preſence, becauſe with whome hee is, to
them is he a moſt ſure defence in all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
as being able to deliuer them out of
all aduerſities.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon, is this, becauſe
God is an inſeparable companion; wee
may haue friends that loue vs verie deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yea, as their ſoules, in proſperitie; and
yet will faile or forſake vs in aduerſitie, as
<hi>Dauid</hi> complaineth: <hi>My louers, and my
frends ſtand aſide from my plague, &amp; in kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſtood a farre off</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Pſ. 38. 11</note>. And yet <hi>Iob</hi> more
lamentably complaineth, ſaying: <hi>My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
are remooued farre from me, and mine
acquaintance are become ſtrangers vnto me,
my neighbours haue forſaken me, and my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars
haue forgotten mee, they that dwell
in mine houſe, and my maides tooke me for a
stranger, I called my ſeruant, but he would
not anſwere, though I prayed him with my

               <note n="z" place="margin">Iob. 19. 13, 14, 15. &amp;c.</note>. yea, Chriſt himſelfe

               <note n="k" place="margin">1. Cor. 10 13.</note>: And

So then the ſumme of it is thus much in

that our heauenly father dealeth after the

courſe to the diſhonor of God, ſlander of
the Goſpell, offence of the weake, harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the wicked, and to our own great
hazard, and perill of eternall deſtruction,
rather then hee will ſuffer vs to runne in

How ought wee then to reioyce in the
rodde, which is ſuch an infallible pledge,
and teſtimonie of Gods loue towards vs?</p>
            <p>2 The ſecond Argument of comfort,
is the conſideration of the manner,<note place="margin">To conſider the manner of Gods cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>recting his children, a ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> how

               <note n="y" place="margin">1. Cor. 11 32</note>, but it is with

               <note n="c" place="margin">Eſa. 10. 12</note>. Oh then ſhall wee refuſe the

<hi>Ieremie, Correct me oh Lord, but in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

            <p>3 The third conſideration,<note place="margin">To conſider the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold good fruits of Gods rod ſanctified; a ſinguler meanes of comfort, when we be whipped therewith.</note> which may
make vs reioyce in Gods rod, is, of the

whereof the Apoſtle thus generally
ſpeaketh, in the Epiſtle to the Romanes,

               <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note>. And that we may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>Firſt, afflictions are notable meanes to

in his proſperitie, demaunded <hi>who

            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:7855:116"/>
But in his aduerſitie, hee deſired <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>

               <note n="o" place="margin">Exo. 8. 8.</note>: <hi>Nabucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donozer,</hi>
in his proſperitie boaſted of

driuen from men, and did eate the graſſe
with the Oxen, and his bodie was wet
with the deaw of heauen; his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
being reſtored, hee could humble

               <note n="p" place="margin">Dan. 4. 34</note>:
And that we may not thinke, this is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

confeſſeth of himſelfe, <hi>In my prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,

               <note n="q" place="margin">Pſ. 30. 6, 7, 8.</note>. This
is then one ſpeciall benefite of Gods

            <p>Secondly, by Gods rod, men are brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to a more diligent examination of their
waies, and repentance for former ſinnes,
which thing God declareth himſelfe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>I will goe, and returne to my place, till

And this doth <hi>Dauid</hi> acknowledge to

in the former Allegorie, and whereof

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7855:123"/>
For the better conceiuing wherof, we are
to note, that this metaphor, hath a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſenſe; the firſt is literall, wherein <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
in way of thankefulneſſe publiſheth
to all the world, the great mercie and
goodneſſe of God, in aduancing him to
the crowne and Kingdome, with woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
peace and proſperitie, in deſpight
of all his enemies, who ſought his ruine

               <note n="o" place="margin">Pſ. 118. 22.</note>. And by conſequent alſo
here is ſhadowed out, the wonderfull

in the things of this life, giuing them all
good things, <hi>aboundantly to enioy</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 17.</note>, that

            <p>The ſecond is myſticall, as ſignifying
Gods wonderfull care, and prouidence to
miniſter all good things, which may bee
for the comfort, refreſhing, and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſoules of his people in Chriſt.
And the parts of this metaphor, or Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie,
(being a metaphor continued<note n="*" place="margin">Perpetua metaphora, dicta.</note>) are
principally theſe three, firſt this metaphor
is briefely and ſummarily layd downe in
theſe words,<note place="margin">Diuiſion of this verſe.</note> (<hi>Thou doest prepare a Table
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7855:123"/>

a ſpeciall circumſtance, in regard of his
Aduerſaries, as it were gnaſhing with
their teeth, at that his proſperitie, in theſe
words, (<hi>in the ſight of mine enemies.</hi>) Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and laſtly, he doth illuſtrate the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,
declaring the ſumptuouſneſſe and
plentie of this table, both for neceſſitie
and delight, and that by two particulers;
firſt (<hi>Thou doeſt annoint mine head with oyle</hi>)
Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this firſt part, of this verſe, according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> (<hi>my cup runneth ouer.</hi>) Of theſe
parts in order, and firſt according to the

in regard of corporall or outward things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou doeſt prepare a Table before me,</hi> by
table metanimically are meant, all ſuch
good things as for our nouriſhment and
comfort, are ſet vpon the table, and by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
alſo metaphorically, a proſperous, &amp;
flouriſhing eſtate is repreſented; ſo <hi>Dauid</hi>
in thoſe greeuous imprecations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall,
(according to the motion of the
holy ghoſt, with an holy zeale, and moſt
pure affections,) he curſed the enemies of
God, thus hee ſayth: <hi>Let their table bee
made a ſnare, and their prosperitie their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Pſ. 69. 22</note> Secondly, for this his proſperous
and flouriſhing eſtate, ſignified by (<hi>Table</hi>)
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7855:124"/>
he giueth thanks vnto God, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Lord (<hi>prepared it,</hi>) and that
it was not his own bowe, nor ſword, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the counſaile, power, and ayd of his
Nobles, &amp; Peeres, for theſe reiected him,
but (as elſewhere he confeſſeth) it was the
Lords owne doing, and moſt maruailous
in the eies of men. Thirdly, and laſtly,
he vſeth a word of continuall act, he ſaith
not thou haſt prepared, or wilt prepare,
but (<hi>doest</hi>) prepare, thereby ſignifying,
that hee that had aduaunced him, would
alſo preſerue him; So then the Summe of

whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue God thanks, for preparing his

if the Lord bee angrie, and will bring a
plague or puniſhment, vpon any people or

it? If his anger be once kindled, and his
wrath thoroughly fired, all the Riuers of
the ſouth cannot quench it, it encreaſeth
by going<note n="*" place="margin">Incandeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, eundo.</note>, and gathereth ſtrength, moſt
fearefull is it for ſinners, to conſider that
which God himſelfe, by ſolemne prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
hath deliuered, ſaying: <hi>I lift vp
mine hand to heauen, and ſay, if I whet my

it is eaſie with him, <hi>to ſaue by many or few</hi>

by little and litle her ieopardie decreaſed,
feare diminiſhed, hope of comfort, began
to appeare as out of a darke cloude; till

               <note n="o" place="margin">Pſ. 21. 3.</note> exalting her from thrall, to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie;

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7855:130"/>
made a Princeſſe; of a mourner, a Ruler;
to the glorie of God and endles comfort
of his Saints. Yea, and ſince, how many
great and fearefull dangers hath ſhe eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped?
The Pope, and his curſed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
neuer ceaſing by all diueliſh means
to worke our woe, and quench our light;
and yet how miraculouſly hath the Lord
from time to time deliuered, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
her through-out her long, and happie
raigne: and now alſo (a matter of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
comfort to all that loued her) taken
her ſoule to himſelf, to liue in perfect reſt,
and neuer ſuffered the Sonne of violence
to doe her hurt, or ſhorten her dayes; that
neuer might any King or Queene, more
truely apply the words of my Text, than
ſhe, and ſay; <hi>O Lord, thou haſt prepared my
Table, and in despight of all mine enemies,
maintained it to the end.</hi> Secondly, for our

to be the day of our bane and ruine,
the periode and end of our proſperitie,
for on the one ſide, the Papiſts, (whoſe
number God decreaſe, either by conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or confuſion, as hee ſeeth beſt) they
haue long wiſhed and ſought for it, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that then Chriſt ſhold die with her,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7855:130"/>
and the Goſpell bee buried in her Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre.
On the other-ſide, a great number
of inordinate walkers, verie idle Rogues,
who liue by ſtealing, robbing, and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſhifts, (who fooliſhly ſuppoſing, that
betwixt changing of Kinges, there is no

expected this day, when as like Vultures,
they might deuour the fruites of honeſt

But behold, and wonder at
the prouidence of God, who hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for vs, ſo religious, godly, and wiſe a
King (this day to be proclaimed vnto vs,
as elſewhere he hath beene) whoſe verie
name proclaimed, hath ſo daunted, both
the enemies of our Religion and peace,
that they ſtand amazed, in the beholding
of our peace and happineſſe, and rather
bethinke whither to flie and hide their
heads, than to commit any outrage. So
that neuer was there any people, might
more truely apply this Text of Scripture,
to themſelues, and ſay with <hi>Dauid,</hi> than
we: <hi>The Lord hath prepared a Table before

viz: To ſhew the great plentie of
precious and comfortable good things,
which God had prouided, aſwell for his
delight as neceſſitie, for though the Lord
condemne all prodigalitie and ſuperfluity,
whereunto Sathan ſpecially tempteth vs,
as one verie well obſerueth from the

I am to intreate thee (curteous Reader) to

referring vs by ſignes and markes to
diſplaced: wherein (peraduenture) wee
haue not rightly traced him, or diſcried

            <p>This I thought good to prefix in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb facs="tcp:7855:147"/>
of the <hi>forme:</hi> but as for the <hi>matter</hi>
of the Booke, it is able to ſpeake for it

not, will preuaile with ſuch as feare God,
and which can diſcerne betweene badde

ſound <hi>Sermons,</hi> or profitable <hi>Treatiſes</hi>
that carrie their waight with them, and
ſerue ſubſtantially for the building and
beautifying of the Lords houſe.</p>
            <p>As this Booke is thus able to vouch
teſtimonie for it ſelfe, out of God his
moſt holie Oracles: ſo I can beare this
witneſſe vnto it: that being in <hi>Kent</hi> when
the moſt of theſe Sermons were prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
I haue heard them commended, and
God thanked for the Authour, by ſuch,
as whoſe hearts, I perceyued, were tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
nay, much mooued at the hearing
of them.</p>
            <p>And further, touching the man; (ſith
I am indyting this Preface without his
priuitie, and writing not to claw him,
whereby nought can bee gained; nor to
giue <hi>Tytles</hi> to men, to whom belongs
nothing but ſhame; but to gaine glorie

this I may truly, and not to no purpoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port:
that hee comming from <hi>Emanuell
Colledge in Cambridge,</hi> (for want of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
(as I ſuppoſe) euen in his young

Dedicatorie going before) ſpending
ſome yeares (and thoſe not vnprofitably:)
as appeareth: when, after that, hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
himſelfe to the Miniſterie, and
was newly (young, as yet) entered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into,
and placed at <hi>Wie</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where
now he is: he ſeemed to haue the thoughts

               <note n="c" place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Who
is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
whereof, not onely mooued, but
euen enforced him to fall roundly to
his ſtudie, and hauing gotten good
Bookes about him; hee ſo laboured
therein, riſing earlie, and ſitting vp late,
adioyning alſo practiſe of continuall
preaching to his ſet order of reading:
as that in ſhort time hee ouer-tooke ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:7855:148"/>
as in thoſe parts had beene before him in
Chriſt, and had been accounted chiefe in
the labours of the Goſpell: yea, hee mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the proceedings of many, who ſtay
longer, &amp; take further degrees of ſchooles
in the Vniuerſities.</p>
            <p>And thus becomming a man well
knowne for ſufficiencie, was called vpon
to make one in the combination at <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
where for the ſpace of certaine years
he hath kept his courſe, as his turne came
about, with credite, and like a good ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
brought forth thoſe things <hi>both new
and old,</hi> where with hee had before furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
himſelfe in his priuate ſtudies, and
by his publike and painfull preaching in
his more priuate Congregation: ſo much
of the man.</p>
            <p>Concerning his manner of preaching
at the firſt: I haue then noted, and ſince
heard himſelfe acknowledge it, that it
was ſomewhat <hi>conceipted</hi> and <hi>fantaſticall,</hi>
ſauouring more of <hi>Wit</hi> then of <hi>Wiſedome,</hi>
ſtuft with humane learning, and borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(withall) ſome flowers of the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
out of <hi>Hibernicus,</hi> pleaſing alſo himſelfe
many times with wittie <hi>Alligories.</hi> And
(to be ſhort) taking a courſe more <hi>painfull</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:7855:148"/>
then <hi>profitable.</hi> Now, theſe his Sermons
ſhew what he hath read, and that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth
not either the <hi>Schoole-men,</hi> or
the old or new <hi>Writers,</hi> no, nor the
<hi>Humanitans</hi> themſelues, as hee hath
beene challenged: yet this I can ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
that hee ſhewes himſelfe more
plentifull (by making ſhew hereof) in
this his penned <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> then hee was
in the Pulpit, in preaching of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
The which no doubt he hath done
with aduiſed iudgement, conſidering that
a man may (by reading) at leyſure, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſentence and ſenſe of an <hi>Authour</hi>
alledged; which (in hearing) on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
(eſpecially if it be cited in a ſtrange
tongue) he can not doe, without finding
his attention therewithall much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
Againe, if a Preacher were bound
to cite authoritie for all that he ſpeakes;
hee ſhould neuer haue done; for, as the
Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>What is it, whereof man
may ſay, behold this is new:</hi> ſo alſo, we may
often ſay, <hi>Nihil iam dictum, quod non die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
prius.</hi> Yea further, I do not ſee (for
my part) any ſuch profite in the great cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie
of ſome (of late much practiſed)
in quoting chapter and verſe ſo thicke
<pb facs="tcp:7855:149"/>
and three-fold as they doe, no not out of
the holy Scriptures themſelues. For it
may be obſerued, that our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and his Apoſtles are oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to quoate at large, not citing ſo
much as the Pſalme or Chapter whence
they alledge (much leſſe the Verſe:) but
pointing as it were, to the place; they
preſently bend themſleues to make vſe
of it, according to the purpoſe they haue
in hand, as in Math. 4. 10. Iohn 7. 38. Ro.
9. 25. Rom. 10. 15. Rom. 11. 26. Heb.
2. 6. Iam. 4. 4. In many of which places
we may alſo obſerue, the ſence, rather
than the words, to be alleadged, yea, the
ſence alſo, ſometimes rather collected,
than expreſſed. And ſo alſo Maſter <hi>Caluin</hi>
(a man pregnant in the Text) verie
often in his writings, doth in ſuch ſort
quoat and cite the Scriptures. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Author of theſe Sermons, as he
hath changed his firſt kind of preaching
(as I ſaid) into a better method: ſo alſo
in his preſent manner of handling the
word, he is not ſo plentifull in alleadging
places, as in this his treatiſe hee hath ſet
downe. By which his courſe and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the labours of his miniſtrie, (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:7855:149"/>
his peoples good, not his glory) what
good hath been don in his charge, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into good <hi>compaſſe,</hi> that people, which
not many yeeres agoe were out of <hi>ſquare:</hi>
I had rather ye ſhould find it in M. <hi>Stough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
Treatiſe,</hi> of<note n="*" place="margin">Or the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie.</note> 
               <hi>the Goſpels prosperous
ſucceſſe,</hi> than read it reported by my pen.</p>
            <p>Onely this in this place I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that theſe paines in ſtudie and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ouerſight in teaching and gouerning
the people committed to his charge, hee
hath imployed in a place, where both
Parſonage and Vicaredge being impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate,
ſwallowed downe into the gulfe
of thoſe <hi>High places</hi> that ſometimes
ſtood in this land, (as this was into the
Abbey of <hi>Battell:</hi>) the ſtinted allowance
for this mans maintenance, after all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falcations
(the fat offerings for the prieſts
who in thoſe dayes liued, being now cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
is xvii. pound by the yeare, and no
more, the reſt is ſupplied by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,
wherein I cannot but commend
both Preacher and people; the one for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contented with ſuch allowance as is
made; the other for extending ſo farre as
they doe. But my hope is, that ere it be
long, ſome good order will bee taken
<pb facs="tcp:7855:150"/>
whereby Preacher and people, (both in
this place and many others) ſhall bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
prouided for; the one ſecured
with a certaine or ſtanding ſtipend, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
freed from a chargeable contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which comes the more vnwillingly
from them, by meanes they are neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whit
the more eaſed, from yeelding their
impropriate, both great and ſmall <hi>tythes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which regard, heere fitly commeth
to be had in thankefull and honourable
remembrance, the <hi>Royall bountie</hi> of our
late Soueraigne and gracious Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
who at the inſtance of that moſt
worthie, religious, and deepely prudent
Councellour, Sir <hi>Frauncis Walſingham,</hi>
Chauncelour of the Duchie of <hi>Lancaſter:</hi>
was pleaſed to impart a large portion of
thoſe her Reuenewes (certaine hundred
pounds) to yeeld ſtanding yerely ſtipends
of Fiftie pounds a peece, to ſome<note n="*" place="margin">Master Midglie. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp;c.</note> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
to labour in that ſhire, (before as it
may ſeeme, but ſlenderly prouided for in
that behalfe) which I thinke alſo to be the
cauſe that mooued this Authour (their
Countrey-man) to be ſo carefull of that
County, as appeareth before in his Epiſtle
to his friends and kinsfolks of Lancaſhire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7855:150"/>
But to returne (and ſo to draw to an
end:) after hee had preached many other
Sermons at <hi>Aſhford</hi> aforeſaid in his ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
turnes: at laſt, hauing begun, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
finiſhed the 23. Pſalme, in theſe ſeuen
Sermons: hee was much importuned by
many to put them in print, eſpecially by
Maſter <hi>H. H.</hi> who being the firſt man
that gaue him certaine and full informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our late <hi>Queenes</hi> departure, and of
the Proclaming of our preſent moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
King in London on the Thurſday
before: he did ſo ſtirre him vp to fit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to ſpeake the next Saturday (being
his courſe to preach, which fell out to bee
the laſt of theſe Sermons) that he in ſuch
ſort ſpake vpon thoſe two (the one dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
the other ioyfull) occaſions; as that
there was not an eie in that plentifull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of right worſhipfull and others,
(met about the ſaid Proclamation to bee
made alſo there;) but ſent out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
teſtimonies of that their ioyfull-ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Thus commending this booke to the
kind acceptance (the which I do the more
deſire, in regard of the timerous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherewith I haue perceiued the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb facs="tcp:7855:151"/>
to be much oppreſſed, euen ſince hee
committed his booke to the Preſſe: from
which his baſhfull feare, if he ſhall be by
the curteſie in ſome meaſure ſet free, hee
may be brought to impart mo of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
wherinto he hath alreadie made
ſome entrance:) And commending thy
ſelfe to the word of grace, which is able
to build thee further to an inheritance
among the Saints: I bid thee fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
