         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Dii faciant laudis summa fit ista suae.</hi> I pray God
he neuer haue better lands or liuing till he die. Shall I
discharge my conscience, being no more than (on my

as he wer the <hi>Homer</hi> of this age, for they say vnto him,

Euen for the printing of this logger-head Legend of

ran in debt with <hi>VVolfe</hi> the Printer 36. pound &amp; a blue
coate which he borrowed for his man, and yet <hi>VVolfe</hi>
did not so much as brush it when hee lent it him, or
presse out the print where the badge had been. The
Storie at large a leafe or two hence you shall heare.
The last refuge and sanctuarie for his exhibition (after
his lands, law &amp; poetrie are confiscated) is to presume
he hath some priuy benefactors or patrons that holde
him vp by the chin. What hee hath had of late, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
failes me, but for a number of yeares past, I
dare confidently depose, not a bit nor cue of anie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor
or patron he had, except the Butler or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple

the best wit craft I can turn him too to get three

and vnder <hi>benedicite</hi> here in priuate be it spoken, dealt
verie cunningly and couertly in the case, for with it he
made him a case or couer for a dublet, which hath ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and couerd his nakednes euer since, and to tell yee

<hi>Newgate</hi> with the same metamorphized costly vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

I was not at the cutting it out, nor will I binde
your consciences too strictly to embrace it for a truth,
but if my iudgement might stand for vp, it is rather like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be true than false, since it vanisht inuisible and was
neuer heard of: and besides, I cannot deuise how he
should behaue him to consume such an implement, if
he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fiscated it not to that vse, neither lending it away,
<pb facs="tcp:10621:46"/>
nor selling it; nor how hee should otherwise thrust
himselfe into such a moth-eaten weed, hauing neyther
money nor frends to procure it. Away, away, neuer
hauke nor pause vpon it, for without all par-anters it is
so; and let them tattle and prate till their tongues ake,
were there a thousand more of them, and they should
set their wit to his, he would make them set besides the
saddle, euen as he did the Gentleman. A man in hys
case hath no other <hi>shift,</hi> or apparaile which you will,
but he must thus shift other-while for his liuing, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

must beg patience of you, thogh I haue been somwhat
too tedious in brushing his veluet, but the Court is not
yet remou'd from <hi>Audley end,</hi> and we shall come time
enough thether to learne what rule he keepes.</p>
                  <p>There did this our <hi>Talatamtana</hi> or Doctour <hi>Hum,</hi>
thrust himselfe into the thickest rankes of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

of, he would not misse to catch hold of, or strike in at
the one end, and take the theame out of their mouths,
or it should goe hard. In selfe same order was hee at

a yeare there still comming to him, and a Library
worth 200. pound. <hi>Iohn VVolfe</hi> sayes nothing, and yet
hee beares with him asmuch as the best, and if hee had
borne a little longer, he would haue borne till his back
broke, though <hi>Gabriell</hi> lookes big vpon it, and protests
by no bugges, he owes him not a dandiprat, but that
<hi>VVolfe</hi> is rather in his debt than hee in his, all recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
iustly cast. In plaine truth and in verily, some
<pb facs="tcp:10621:54"/>
pleasurs he did <hi>VVolfe</hi> in my knowledge. For first and
formost he did for him that eloquent <hi>post-script</hi> for the
Plague Bills, where he talkes of the series the classes &amp;
the premisses, &amp; presenting them with an exacter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode
hereafter, if it please God the Plague continue.
By the style I tooke it napping, and smelt it to be a pig
of his <hi>Sus Mineruam</hi> the Sow his Muse as soone as euer
I read it, and since the Printer hath confest it to mee.
The vermilion <hi>VVrinckle de crinkledum</hi> hop'd (belike)
that the Plague would proceed, that he might haue an
occupation of it. The second thing wherein he made
<hi>VVolfe</hi> so much beholding to him, was, that if there
were euer a paltrie <hi>Scriuano,</hi> betwixt a Lawiers Clark
&amp; a Poet, or smattring pert Boy, whose buttocks were
not yet coole since he came from the grammer, or one
that houers betwixt two crutches of a Scholler and a

he would haue prest it vpon <hi>VVolfe</hi> whether he

cursing and tearing he could vtter it, for that he
hauing giu'n it his passe or good word, they obstinately

and would grumble and mutiny in his hearing of want
of money. Tut man, mony would he say, is that your
discontent? plucke vp your spirites and bee merry, I
cannot abide to heare anie man complaine for want of
money. Twice or thrice hee had set this magnificent

haue terrifide the table with a sound knock of a pursse
of angels, and sayd, There's for thee, paye mee when

for he put his hand in his pocket but to scrub his arme

<pb facs="tcp:10621:56"/>
to reckon vp, as how wee came to take knowledge of
one anothers being there, or what a stomacke I had to
haue scratcht with him, but that the nature of the place
hindred mee, where it is as ill as pettie treason, to look
but awry on the sacred person of a Doctour, and I had
plotted my reuenge otherwise; as also of a meeting or

worse than all the rest, what my armes, my defence,

conspired against, when you seek to bereaue me of the
instruments that should secure it. They ratled him vp,
soundly, and told him if he would be conformable to

bee forc't: Force him no forces, no such mechanicall

would in all humillity dispoyle himselfe of it. Shee so

Dinner being readie, he was cald downe, &amp;
there beeing a better man than hee present, who was
plac'd at the vpper end of the boord, for very spite that

How inuiolably hee kept it, I will not conceale
from you. About a two howres after, when he felt his
craw emptie, and his stomacke began to wamble, hee
writ a Supplication to his Hostesse, that he might speak
with her; to whome (at her approaching) hee recited

himselfe, being loth he should be damnd and go
to hell for a meales meate, hauing vowd, and through
famine readie to breake it, got her husband to go forth
with him out of dores, to some Cockes shop at <hi>Pye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corner</hi>

must goe for it. How he got out of this Castle dolorus,
if anie be with childe to know, let them enquire of the
