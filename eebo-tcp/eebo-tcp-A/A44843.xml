            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE RECORD OF SUFFERINGS <hi>FOR</hi> TYTHES IN <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sufferers are, <hi>The Seed of God,</hi> or, <hi>The assembly of his First-born,</hi> or, <hi>The First Fruits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in England, in this Age,</hi> who are called to be faithful, and have been found faithful; therefore have we suffered willingly the spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our Goods, for to us the Truth is more precious then our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, Lives, or outward Liberties, and therefore hath the Lord accounted us first worthy to suffer for his Name sake, and to be as Lights in this deceitful Generation.</p>
            <p>Those which our sufferings is a testimony against, is that Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood which is light and treacherous, which in all Ages the Lord raised up faithful witnesses against; for <hi>Isaiah</hi> said, <hi>That they were all blind and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and dumb dogs, and never had enough, Isa.</hi> 56. 10, 11. And <hi>Ieremiah</hi> said, <hi>That the Prophets prophesied falsly, and the Priests did bear rule by their means,</hi> Jer. 5. And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> said, <hi>They fed themselves, and not the flock, Ezek.</hi> 34. <hi>Mica</hi> said, <hi>They preached for hire, and divined for money,</hi> Mic. 2. 11. and <hi>Hosea</hi> said, <hi>That they were as a Troop of Robbers that did wait for a man, so the company of Priests did murther in the way by consent,</hi> Hos. 6. 9.</p>
            <p>And in these dayes we may say, that they are worse then any troop of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or any that preached for hire, that ever went before them, as wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this Book following, by their devouring VVidows Houses, spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens goods, and destroying mens persons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Given forth from those whom the Lord regards, who do tremble at his word, for which cause we are in scorn called Quakers, whom the Lord hath raised up as his army, before whom the Nations shall tremble, Ioel 2. and bow down their backs always before the truth.</hi>

            <head>To the READER</head>
            <p>GOD hath a great work to do in this generation, to pull down the abominations which hath long reigned, and many are straitned till it be accomplished; and onely such must be exercised in this work, who are called, chosen, and faithful; many have been called, but have not been faithful, but have destroyed in their works, that which they seemed to have established by words, and was not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to witness the life of their words by their works; so that by a true search we have found the words of righteousness in many, but we have found the works of righteousness but in few; and though God hath shined into the hearts of many by his light, yet there are but few children of it, in comparison of the disobedient: The eye of God hath looked into the world, and he sees men differ more in words then in life and conversation; and some in words do witnesse for God, but in their works deny him: As for example, How many of late yeers had a zeal stirred up in them by the spirit of the Lord against the abominations of the Priests, and the oppression of tythes, preaching both down, even as that which denyed Christ to be come in the flesh: So that if words had ben that which would have finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work, the Land had been clensed before this time of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination; but the Lord hath brought a tryal upon such spirits, whether they will own their testimony through the spoiling of their Goods, and imprisonment of their bodies and therefore hath God suffered an earthly power, and a Law to try them, and now they do rather deny their Testimony, then suffer by that Law which gives the Priests tythes; as for Witnesses, most of the baptized people in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have betrayed their testimony and profession in that thing: And how are you worthy to be called Saints which bear such a testimony? can this equally be compared with the testimony of the Saints of old? Did they cry down false worships and false teachers in words? and did they uphold them by giving them wages? Have you not herein sinned against light? Did you not once see that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sent of God? And will you now uphold them because you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not suffer for your testimony? Is not your paying them wages, and giving them tythes, a greater witness for them then your preaching them down in words is against them, and may they not herein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice over you? Christ is not herein your example, which for this end was born, and for this end came into the world, to bear witness
<pb facs="tcp:55429:3"/>
to the truth, and did finish the work which the Father had given him to do, and was made perfect through sufferings; but such never need suffer who preach down deceit in words, and hold it up in works. And the Apostles is not your example, for they were in works that which they declared in words: therefore hath God cast you by, as not fit to be Labourers in his Vineyard: But a people is the Lord raising up, whom he is giving his holy spirit unto, whose witness to him must stand as well in works, as in words, who love the truth more then their lives or liberties, goods or estates, and are valiant for it upon the earth, which cannot be subject to the powers of darkness, nor the Rulers of the darkness of this world, but believeth that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they deny for Christ in this life, they shall receive a hundred sold, &amp; in the world to come life everlasting. And these are they whom the Father will exercise with his holy spirit, in the gathering his seed from the ends of the earth, and for the turning of many to righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and such shall shine as the stars in the firmament of Heaven, when as the false and deceitful witnesses shall be turned into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, because their testimony is not able to endure the tryal; for the Lords House must be built with tryed stones, that the winds of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions cannot blow it down: and upon such wil his light arise, who when they are tryed, are found faithful, and who are counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bear a testimony in this work, though it be through sufferings, in this day, when the powers of the Earth have set themselves to wear out the Saints of the most High God, by changing times and Laws, whereby to restrain the liberty of the Lords people, whose worship stands in the spirit, and in the truth. Times they have changed by a Law, in making the first day of the week to be their Sabbath, but that day is more profaned then any of the seven. And Laws they have changed, to get a ground to stop the word of the Lord from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving free course and free utterance among the people.</p>
            <p>These seek to scatter the power of the holy people, and to cast the truth to the ground by their acts of cruelty, and decrees of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and by a tollerating cruelty and oppression among a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Priests, which are worse then those in <hi>Hosea's</hi> dayes, who then were, <hi>As a Troop of Robbers that wait for a man, even so the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Priests murther in the way by consent, Hos.</hi> 6. 9. and saith the Prophet, <hi>I have seen a horrible thing in the House of Israel;</hi> but now may we say, VVe have seen a more horrible thing in the Land of <hi>England,</hi> even a company of Priests taking mens Horses from their work, their Corn off their field, driving away their Oxen and Kine out of their pasture, taking their wool out of their Barns, taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Brasse and Pewter out of their Houses, taking away their Bedding off their Beds, even off the childrens Beds: Such a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing was never seen in <hi>Israel,</hi> for the Priests Robbery was not so
<pb facs="tcp:55429:3"/>
great then, as now; for they did never so spoile mens goods, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy mens Estates, nor imprison mens bodies, as now in <hi>England</hi> the priests have done; so that they do not onely exceed the false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of <hi>Israel,</hi> but also all the Robbers both in <hi>Israel</hi> and in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> hath not spoiled so much Goods and Cattel as they have done within these five yeers, some without any Law, or pretence of Laws and others by false oaths and false witnesses, and the Law not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a man to give in a true witnesse except he will swear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christs command, who saith, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> which swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is as great a sin as bearing of a false witness. And by these things do they seek to wear out the Saints of the Most High God, first take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away a mans Goods, and then casting him into prison; as Christ said to the Saints, so is it come to pass in these dayes also amongst us, <hi>The Devil shall cast some of you into prison, and you shall have tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ten dayes:</hi> If the Devil now, or his Ministers or Messengers of Satan, be permitted to cast some into prison, or bring tribulation upon others, do they therefore think that we will yeild to the devil, or to his Messengers, that we may be free from tribulation and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment? Nay, that is not the price of our redemption; nor way of deliverance; for that which was written before-time, was written for our learning, which through suffering, and patient continuing in wel doing, we have learned; without which we could never have learned nor known Christs words fulfilled as they are; therefore happy is that day wherein the everlasting love of God is broken forth unto us, in bringing us his children, prophets, &amp; holy apostles, to rejoice over the false prophets, and false teachers, though they spoil our Goods, and imprison our bodyes, yet we can rejoice over them, and suffer the spoiling of our Goods with joy, knowing that this is for a testimony against them, by which the reproach which the Lord will bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, will appear to all men. And this is so far from silencing our testimony against them, that it doth daylie renew it; so that if all that which is past were forgotten, their daylie abominations doth so increase, that a testimony must be continued against them; for of them the Scripture is true, which saith, <hi>Evil men and deceivers wax worse and worse;</hi> for the deceivers in former ages was never so bad, as by force to take away the goods of those that would not heare them, and take away their lives by imprisonment, as some have done, because they could not pay them tythes, as this Record of the unjust sufferings will make manifest.</p>
            <p>Our Brethren the prophets have given their testimony concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such prophets and priests which was profane, and that the Lord found folly amongst them, as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> saith, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. he had seen a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing amongst them, they strengthened the hand of evil-doers, that none did return from their inquity; and it is so now for these reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55429:4"/>
How can a drunkard return from his drunkenness when he sees his priest drunk? and how can a swearer return from his swearing when he sees his priest swear, and hire men to swear falsly, as many have done in this Nation?</p>
            <p>And how can a covetous man return from his covetousness when he sees his priest so covetous that he taketh away mens goods by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which he hath no right unto, but onely through covetousness makes merchandize of people? So how should any return from such things who are taught by them? and how can a proud man return from his pride, when he sees his teacher lead him into it by example? How can an envious man turn from his envie, seeing his teacher en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, and provoking others to wrath and envy?</p>
            <p>So these Reasons proves that the prophet's words are true, <hi>that none can return from their iniquity by following the practise of their Priest;</hi> and Christ's words are fulfilled also, <hi>Matth</hi> 23. which saith, <hi>they lay heavy burthens upon people, grievous to be born, and devoures Widowes Houses,</hi> as many in this Nation can witnesse, who have their Goods spoiled and taken from them, as this following Record doth make mention, abounding all the cruelty and wickedness which ever was heard of, or read of; exceeding all the false prophets in <hi>Israel;</hi> although they had a price, and preached for hire, yet they never did use such cruelty for their Hire, as these have done; and exceeding all the false teachers among the Gentiles, which never was known to sue any at the Law that would not hear them, muchlesse to take from them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times the value of what they demanded; but the Lord doth for a time let his children deeply suffer, to fulfil the testimony of truth in this thing, that it may be recorded for ages to come, the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their testimony, and the cruelty of their oppressors; and then will the Lord finish the testimony of their sufferings, and will give them an Inheritance among the Seed which he hath blessed; and all their persecutors shall be ashamed, for God will bring an everlasting reproach upon them, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, Jer. 23.</p>

            <head>More sufferings in <hi>Lancashire</hi> by <hi>Thomas Show</hi> Priest of the Parish of <hi>Aldingham.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>RIchard Myers</hi> for the value of three pounds tythe, demanded as due to Priest <hi>Show,</hi> was by a Writ cast into prison, &amp; there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prisoner two years and five months, and in that time of imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the same thing was sued up to <hi>London</hi> to answer it, and thereupon he had liberty from the Sheriff to go to make his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; &amp; after that he had made his appearance at <hi>London,</hi> &amp; was freed from his imprisonment by Order, he was again summoned to appear at the Assise at <hi>Lancaster,</hi> to answer to the same thing; &amp; the priest got a Judgement against him, and for the value of three pounds, took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him five Beasts worth fifteen pounds; and the Bailiff for six pence (which he demanded as due for warning him to the Sessions) took from him a pan worth ten shillings. So the Priests and Bailiffs, and all Covetous Oppressors agree in causing the harmless to suffer, who ows no man any thing but love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Ashburner</hi> for two pounds one shilling and three pence, had taken from him a Horse and a Cow worth six pounds eighteen shillings four pence; and when they had taken this, they said they wanted seven shillings three pence of their sum, and for that the priest <hi>Show</hi> caused the body of <hi>Richard Ashburner</hi> to be taken within ten dayes after, and to be put in close prison, and there to be kept until he dyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Fell</hi> for one pound four shillings, had taken from him two Horses worth four pounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iames Chambers</hi> for the value of one pound six shillings eight pence, had taken from him a Horse worth four pounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Simpson</hi> for the value of seventeen shillings, had taken from him a Mare worth four pounds, for the priests use.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>Thomas Fell</hi> by the same priest had his Corn taken away off his ground; for the priests servants carries peoples corn away up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their backs, and breaks down their Hedges and Walls like thieves, and yet is not punished; and when they had taken away his Corn off his ground, they took from him a young Oxe worth two pounds se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven shillings.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Tho. Fell</hi> had three Sheepe taken from him for the same priest, for the like things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:55429:27"/>
               <hi>Edm. Cleoeton</hi> (for three shillings six pence demanded as due for tythes) was summoned to answer at <hi>Lancaster,</hi> where he cast the priest; and the priest did again renew the suit, and by the Oath of a false Witness, one <hi>Symond Mount,</hi> who did swear to that which he did not see, as was confessed in the Court afterwards; upon which <hi>Evan Walls</hi> Steward of the County-Court, gave out a Iudgement for ten shillings six pence, for which they took a Mare worth six pounds. So here is six pounds taken for three shillings six pence tythe, which is thirty four times the value, and more.</p>

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr>) sued them again into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, and all, excepting <hi>Rich.

to swear for him, one of which was Priest <hi>Jacques,</hi> who was the first priest that swore against the truth, and the Ministers of it in its appearance in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and hath continued in swearing and lying against the truth ever since, and so (as the Scripture saith of evil men) is grown worse and worse and by his Oath, and the rest that joyned with him in the Devils work, <hi>viz.</hi> to swear, and that falsly, have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be taken from the said <hi>Thomas Leaper,</hi> four beasts worth four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pounds, and the value of the tythes was but four pounds four shillings.</p>

               <p>And again the said <hi>Tho.

The Priests and Teachers hath told people, and perswaded them, and made them believe they did not make it their end to teach for money and for tythes, for Easter-Reckonings and Midsummer-Dues; but now they have shewed themselves to all sorts of people, and made manifest themselves to the whole Nation that that is their end, for preaching for tythes, for money, for Easter-reckonings, Midsummer-dues, and Offerings; they have long laid covered under that cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and covered themselves with that, in saying that that was not their end; but now have they declared it in the Courts of the Nation in haling people before Magistrates, and summoning them up to their Courts a hundred or two hundred miles, and casting them into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for tythes and maintenance till death; yea, such as they do not preach to, and do no work for, which the like was never heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the false prophets and false apostles since the world began, driveing away poor mens Cattel, distraining their goods, taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Horses, and Oxen, and Plow-geere, with which they should plow the Land, and their Cows which should give their children milk, many having not a Cow left to give their poor children milk for sustenance; and some have had their barns broken open, and have had their Corn thresht out, and made spoil on at the Priests pleasure; and others that have had something to kill for the use of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which the priests have taken away also at their pleasure, and made havock of; and such as have a better Horse, Bullock or Cow then ordinary for their own use, such the priests makes choice of for their spoil, and take them from people whom they do no work for, at their pleasure, that the good savor is lost, and their profession and religion is become loath some to all the sober and moderate people that fears God; that the Teachers of the Nation are become the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test troublers of the people in the Courts of the Nation, and the greatest casters into prison in the Nation for their bellies and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, such as they do no work for, or for speaking to them; and there is but a few Magistrates in the Nation that truly fears God, that are brought to take notice of these things and doings; the Lord open their eyes and understandings that they may see it, and themselves; for the cry of the oppressed hath long been in our Land; so unlike the Prophets, Christ, and the Apostles, have the Teachers of this Nation been, that they have turned against them that have been sound in the life of the Prophets, Christ, and the Apostles Doctrine.</p>
