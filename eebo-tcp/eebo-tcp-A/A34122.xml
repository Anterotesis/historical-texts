         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE
OF THE
AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Small part of Gardening comes
here to light, being the Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of outlandiſh Trees, Loved by
many, but known by few; of which
ſome thing hath been Publiſhed by ſome
of our Country Writers, but by none
perfected as it ought: It is the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
Raiſing, and Ordering of the
Limon and Orange Tree, which comes
forth under the Name of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh
Heſperides,</hi> and is by the
Experience of many Years Arrived to
<pb facs="tcp:61076:4"/>
this, and through the ſparing of ſome
leiſure Hours committed to Paper. It
was never intended to be made common
by the Preſs, but that the frequent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of ſome worthy Friends did
promote it, and to overcome the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Difficulties which diſcovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in this Work; and the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this Practice here in this Country
is undertaken by many eminent Perſons,
who through ſelf-Ignorance truſt all to
their Gardiners, who themſelves are
but little acquainted therewith.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Heſperides</hi> is opened to every
one, and ſheweth it ſelf under a ſtrange
Name, having herein for Patterns the
excellent <hi>Jovianus Pontanus,</hi> and
the Learned Jeſuite <hi>Joannes Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta
Ferrarius,</hi> who both have effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and performed their Deſcriptions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Name of <hi>Heſperides;</hi> the
one in Verſes, the other in an high ſtiled
Proſe; yet only according to the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Countries, which differs
<pb facs="tcp:61076:4"/>
much from ours, ſo that theirs could
not ſerve us but in a few things, which
we have followed, and have found true
by Experience.</p>
            <p>Conſidering the Order, by us Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
we have borrowed from <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius,</hi>
being the ſame cannot be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended:
But we have further Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to bring and order the Work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch a Manner, as the Air and
Condition of theſe Northern Countries
doth require, which are ſubject to many
intemperate Summers and Winters. The
Report of many Fictions, with their
Circumſtances which belong to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of <hi>Heſperides,</hi> are upon good
reaſon paſſed by, and whiat is chief,
only touched upon in a few Words, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unneceſſary Narration is nothing
but uſeleſs Labour.</p>
            <p>Our only Aim was, chiefly the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Trees, and their Fruits,
in particular; and afterward the Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of them, with whatſoever belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:61076:5"/>
thereunto, as well of them that are
first brought out of <hi>Italy,</hi> as of them
that are here in theſe Countries raiſed
from Seeds.</p>
            <p>In all this we have Obſerved, and
most clearly Propoſed the ſimplest and
plaineſt Way, avoiding all Artificial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
which are Communicated to
the World for Wonders, and muſt juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be Rejected by a true Practitioner;
becauſe Experience hath often Taught,
that they who followed and uſed them,
have been much Deceived by them.</p>
            <p>The Miſchifs and Decayes which
ſometimes happen to theſe Trees, with
the Helps and Means againſt them, are
likewiſe duly Noted; and afterward
the Uſe of the Leaves, Bloſſoms, and
Fruits ſet down.</p>
            <p>This is briefly the Sum of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperides,</hi>
which doth not appear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
what others have already Written
thereof; but only to Impart to our Country
that which as yet it wanted, <hi>viz.</hi> The
<pb facs="tcp:61076:5"/>
true Knowledg of this Practiſe: It is
true indeed, the <hi>Netherland</hi> has ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
eminent Perſons which are Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and Skilled herein, but yet more who
take this Work in hand without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
            <p>We hope that this our Labour will not
be Unacceptable, tho perhaps it may ſeem
strange to ſome, that for ſuch ſmall
things ſo much Paper is blotted, as tho
it were of ſome Concern, being it ſeems
more the Work of an Husbandman
then of ſome conſiderable Perſons. Theſe
Men we ſend to the ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and the yet daily Experience,
which are both ſufficient Witneſſes, how
that Kings, Princes, and eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
have employed themſelves in <hi>Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening,</hi>
and whereof our Netherland
has not a few Examples.</p>
            <p>For which Reaſon then doth the
<hi>Belgick</hi> or <hi>Netherlandiſh Heſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi>
preſent her noble Fruits to every
one that ſhall not be afraid of the
<pb facs="tcp:61076:6"/>
Pains and Labour to undertake the
Practiſe, and duly Perform the ſame.</p>

that our Fore-Fathers an hundred

fit to ſhew here the Difference

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Limon Tree is
found leſs hardy to endure the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and Cold of our ſharp and
harſh Air, than the Orange Tree,
becauſe the Wood is ſofter, and
not ſo firm and cloſe by much:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61076:45"/>
There is alſo a Difference among
the ſorts of Limons.</p>
               <p>For there are none which can
better endure the Miſeries and
Hardſhips of our Climate, then
thoſe we have deſcribed by the
Name of common <hi>white Limons;</hi>
the <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Apple,</hi> called the <hi>black
Limon,</hi> wherefore they are moſt
beloved by our Affectors of this

more ſorts of Limon Trees may
be brought to Fertility, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
heretofore given doth
Demonſtrate. Further, The
Managing and Ordering is one
and the ſame; beſides that the
Trees which bear ſweet Fruits,
require a place which ſtands well
to the Sun, that the Apples may
thereby come to a better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61076:46"/>
which ſhall not be, if we do the

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is yet this, that we in
Propagating uſe none, but the
Seed of the Orange Tree, becauſe
it can better endure the Cold of
theſe Countries, as is ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Even in <hi>Italy</hi> are the Seeds of
Limons ſeldom Sown, becauſe of
their tenderneſs and weakneſs:

               <p>In ſhort, we may at all times

               <p>It is certain, that the purer the

a well dunged Earth, with white

               <p>For the preparation and fitting
of this Ground, all Earth or Sand

which we may try by letting the

               <p>THE Sowing of Orange
Kernels doth in theſe cold

great and fruitful Nurſeries,
and hereby excited others to the
ſame Inclination.</p>
               <p>To do this Sowing well, we
muſt make Choice for it of the
Seed of Oranges, not of Limons,
much leſs of Citrons, as being too
tender, according to the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Ferrarius;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heſp. Lib. 3. Cap. 29.</note> the Limons

               <p>He that will begin this, muſt
make Choice of the fulleſt, beſt,

ſame with Rain-water, and make
them clean from all Corruption
and Dirt, and afterwards dry the
ſame three or four Days in the
Shade, in the beginning of <hi>May;</hi>
and according to the ſaying of
<hi>Ferrarius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heſp. Lib. 2. Cap. 8.</note> we muſt ſow them two
Days before the full of the Moon,
after this manner, and fill to that
end a Pot with good fat and ſifted
Earth, put the Seed therein an
Inch deep, and two good Inches
breadth aſunder; ſet the Pot to
the South, in an open airy Warm,
and to the Sun ſtanding place, and
ſprinkle this you have ſown im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
with lukewarm Rain-water,
and alſo every third Day;
yet this Earth muſt not be too
wet, but only moderately kept
moiſt.</p>
               <p>To further the ſpringing out,
Glaſſes muſt be put upon the Pots,
which will exceedingly forward
the Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:61076:54"/>
In the ſpringing up of the Seed
it happens many times, that the
Shoots come forth double, <hi>viz.</hi> two
together; theſe Twins muſt we
part, pull out the weakeſt, that
it may not hinder and take away
the Nouriſhments of the other.</p>
               <p>Theſe young Seedlings are
frequently troubled with Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiggs,
Ants, Snails, Woodlice,
which eat the ſame off, and hinder
their Growth, wherefore there
muſt be Proviſion made againſt
them: At the third Year muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Seedling be tranſplanted
particularly and ſingly by itſelf in
a Pot, in good Earth, and put in
a place as before, where they may
be free and ſafe from all bad
Winds. Without any Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Hindrance they ſhall be at
five Years old a Finger thick, fit
for Inoculation; and in the

forth Fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:61076:54"/>
This is the Ordinary and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt
Way of ſowing, whereby
we may nurſe up and raiſe theſe

uſe them to the enduring of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

called Inoculating.</p>
               <p>To do this well, the Stock
which is to be Grafted or Ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
muſt be ſtrong and ſufficient
in Growth, that the Cyon put in
may not want Nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>To which end a fit Bough or
Branch is to be choſen to cut the
Cyon from, (whether it be a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or Orange Tree) which is
neither too Old nor too Young;
for the Old is unfit, and the
Young too tender.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Time.</note>That we may not miſs here,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61076:56"/>
we muſt chuſe Wood of two years
Growth, becauſe that of one year
is too tender; cut the Cyon in the
Month of <hi>May,</hi> to the length of
two Buds; part under the loweſt
Bud ſhall be cut with a ſharpe
Knife on both ſides ſomewhat flat,
yet ſo that the moſt outward part
of the Bark may not go off, being
it muſt again Unite with that of
the Stock.</p>
               <p>After the cutting of the Cyon,
the Stock muſt be ſawed off at a
convenient height; and obſerve
that the Bark be not bruiſed, but
be ſmooth and even: Then make
a Slit in the top of the Stock, with
a ſharp Chiſſel (and put therein
a Box-Tree-wood-Wedg, that the
opening may not ſhut again) put
then the Cyon in from the Top
downward to the loweſt Bud,
ſo that the ſame ſticks out a little
above the Stock; cloſe the Work
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61076:56"/>
together; ſo that the outmoſt
Bark of the Cyon doth exactly
anſwer to the outmoſt Bark of the
Stock; guard the Slit with good
grafting Wax againſt the Inwater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and other Inconveniences:
On this manner may we Graft
upon high Stocks, and upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Boughs, to make ſeveral
ſorts of Fruits, as well Limons as
Oranges to grow upon one Tree,
which may likewiſe be done by
Inoculating.</p>

by the Practitioners but little uſed.</p>

would Graft; then ſhall the Shoot
or Twig be cut on both ſides,
flatwiſe, under the ſecond or third
Bud, after the ſame manner as is
ſaid before of the Cyon: Beſides
it muſt not be parted from the
Bough, but left on, and joined
from behind in the opening of the
Stock, ſo that the outmoſt Bark of
the cut Graft doth rightly corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond

makes it ſelf ready to ſprout out,
we muſt Cut or Saw the Stock off
two Inches above the Oculation,
that all the Sapp and Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may come to the new Nurſe-Child,
and the Shoot the more
ſtrongly put forth: When the
ſame, the following Year, is
ſtrongly ſhot, then take the reſt
of the remaining Stock away to
a little above the Inoculation, and
cure the Wound with Grafting
Wax.</p>
               <p>If the Oculation be put upon
an high and ſtreight Stock, we ſet
two or three, or four Oculations
round it, to make a good and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Head: But if the Stock be
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61076:61"/>
maimed and ſlight, we put the
Oculation at the bottom of the
ſame, not far above the Ground;
for then by means of this Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
we may raiſe ſtreight and
fair Trees; as we ſee this among
the Practitioners in <hi>Brabant,</hi> who
chuſe for this thoſe that are flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing
and thrifty, which can ſhoot
in one Year three Foot high and
more.</p>
               <p>We muſt not pluck off the
Leaves which ſtand along the
new ſhot out Sprout, or Twigg,
but leave them on till they fall off
themſelves; for by the Leaves is
the Sapp kept in full Strength and
Vigour from the bottom to the
Top.</p>
               <p>Theſe tender Shoots may be
kept ſtreight, by putting a Stick
by them, and with binding ſo
ordered, that thereby the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
is laid for the bringing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61076:62"/>
forth of fair and ſtreight Trees.</p>
               <p>For according to the ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and fairneſs of the Stock, we
do here in this Country many
times eſteem the Tree, and this
is the means to bring them to it,
from their Youth while they are
tender.</p>
               <p>To Inoculate is none of the
leaſt Delights of this Practiſe, for
we do ſomething that ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
unconceiveable, that an
whole Tree is forced by means
of a thin little Shell, and a ſingle
Bud, to leave and change its own
Nature, and to bring forth other
ſtrange Fruits.</p>
               <p>It would be convenient here,
and ſuit well to ſhew how this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is made, and this great Work
performed in a ſmall Compaſs,
how a Tree is compoſed of little
Particles, which are like many
thin Fibres, or thin Strings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61076:62"/>
which, through inviſible Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
and Paſſages, the Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which partly conſiſts in
Moiſture, aſcends, where it ſpreads
itſelf through the Branches, and
by means of the outward Heat of
the Sun, and Innate, or natural
Warmth within, produces the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Leaves, Bloſſoms, and
Fruits.</p>
               <p>Theſe long thin ſtringlike Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
(whereof the Bark is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compoſed) being cut aſunder,
as they alſo of the Oculation,
whoſe openings coming then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
right upon one another, the
Moiſture and Nouriſhment of the
Stock is communicated to the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and through the growing
Virtue joyned and united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
We ſee the contrary comes
to paſs, when this Agreement and
Correſponding of the Paſſages
fails, by miſplacing of the ſame.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61076:63"/>
Yet it is not our Intention and
Deſign here to Reaſon and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of this Matter; but we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
this to the great Wits
of Naturaliſts, and keep our ſelves
to the ſimple Ordering.</p>
               <p>We may by Inoculating come
to much Variety of Fruits, if we
be but provided and furniſhed
with Stocks and Seedlings.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That an Orange Tree
doth ſeldom ſprout out at the

of their Wood, cannot well
be brought to Shoot and to take
Root;<note place="margin">Lib. 1. Cap. 2.</note> though ſome ſay that ſuch
may be done, and among others
the Sieur <hi>Munting</hi> in his true and
right Exerciſe of Planting. For
me, I could never attain to it.</p>
               <p>But this Propagation may
more fitly be done to the Limon
Tree, which is of a ſofter Wood,
and is more apt to ſhoot out at
the Roots, eſpecially when the
Oculation ſtands cloſe by the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61076:64"/>
Ground; whether it be then, that
the Inlaying be done above from
the Head, or from beneath near
the Ground, give the Bough a
Cut from the Bottom upward;
then take a Pot, in the Bottom or
Side whereof is an Hole, put the
Bough therethrough, and order
that the Cut or Inciſion may
come into the middle of the Pot;
lay between the cutted Opening,
or Slit, a little flat Stone, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, that it may not ſhut
too cloſe together, but keep open,
to further the Rooting ſooner.</p>
               <p>When this is conveniently pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and ſet, we muſt fill up the
Pot with good Earth, and keep it
moiſt with moderate Watering:
after the ſecond Year we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
find that it is rooted; which
when it is fit and ſtrong, cut off,

               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:61076:64"/>
Here is to be obſerved, when
the Pot, whether it ſtands to the

muſt be faſtned, for the leaſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Charges, which this Work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
to defend our tender Plants
againſt the Cold; being there is

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe the Grounds
are here in the winter-Seaſon very
Moiſt, and accordingly Cold,
which is very prejudicial to the

Trees and Fruits; Wherefore we,
to avoid all this, ſhall follow our
Predeceſſors, who have for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years found out Tubbs, Boxes,
and Potts for this, which are all
to be taken according to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Trees.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Tubbs.</note>The beſt and fitteſt Tubbs are
made of Rheniſh-wine-Fats, or
Casks, becauſe their Matter is
hard, thick, firm, and good Oaken
Wood; the Hoops muſt be Iron
Hoops, and have on each ſide a
ſtrong Iron Handle, to carry them,
or remove them conveniently
from one place to another; the
Depth and Width above is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
two Foot, but at the Bottom
one Foot and an half: ſo that the
Narrowneſs muſt go ſlenting
downward, and leſſen by little
and little, becauſe in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
of the Trees, the whole
Maſs of Earth may be the more
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61076:66"/>
conveniently taken out; and if
we deſire Tubbs for leſſer Trees,
let the Depth and Width above
be one Foot and a half, and the
Diameter or middle Line of the
Bottom, one Foot and a quarter:
and ſeveral Holes muſt be bored
or made in the Bottoms of the
Tubbs, and Pots, and Boxes, to
empty the ſuperfluous Moiſtneſs,
and to free the Roots of the Trees
from rotting.</p>
               <p>The Pots muſt be made of
good Earth, glazed within and
without, or not ſo, according as
every one pleaſeth and deſires;
the Form and Faſhion muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
like the Tubbs, wider at the
Top then at the Bottom, the Foot
broad, to prevent the falling
down.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſpuare Boxes,
they are not in all particulars held
ſo good, and are more chargeable,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61076:67"/>
wherefore we thought it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſay any thing touching
the ſame; nor of the other things
neceſſary to the Planting, as Spade,
Shovel, Trowel, and the like,
in regard they are ſufficiently
known to every one as to their
Form and Faſhion. Only this
muſt be added, that wooden
Tubbs are counted better then
earthen Potts, becauſe the Roots
ſhoot round againſt the Sides of
the Pots and Tubbs, alſo upon
the Bottoms of the ſame; and ſo
it is, that the Earth being much
colder then the Wood, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
hinder the Trees more,
eſpecially in the Winter.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>After the Tree is looſned
round about in the old Tub or
Pot, and taken out, then cut the
ſuperfluous Fibres off with a ſharp
Knife, and ſee whether there be
yet any other Defect or Fault to

may be removed. You muſt
keep the Roots from Bruiſes, for
thereby they are hurt, and are

whence many times a pining and

               <p>After this done, put the Tree

               <p>This Vermin, or Creature, if

Colour, upon the Back beſet with
long Hairs, but they periſh in few

Moiſture, which is of a ſweet

much about it, and like of the

               <p>This Wet or Moiſtneſs ſeems

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61076:84"/>

               <p>When now againſt the declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

begins to dye, and its Sap and

are Eggs, Nits, or Seed, whereby
it is Propagated again.</p>
               <p>We have Experienced, that
where this white Matter takes
place, yea even in Vines, Peach,
Laurel, and Myrtletree, that they
were the next Year tainted with
this Evil, and that inſtead of one,
hundreds came to light; ſo that
they by ſucking the natural Nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment
from the Trees, killed
them, as hath happened to ſeveral
Trees.</p>
               <p>This Vermine doth not dye
through Cold, but endures even
the coldeſt Winter; and what
Means ſoever have been uſed to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61076:84"/>
drive away this Diſtemper, the
only Means is found to be, the
making of the Trees clean from
their Filth and Foulneſs, with a
Spunge wetted in Rain-Water,
wherewith we cauſed the Leaves
and Boughs in the Spring to be
waſhed and wiped, before the

               <p>We being now freed of this,

               <p>A twofold Gathering is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

we gather, we muſt go very wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
about it; for to pluck them off
with the Hand, would not do well,
as being with Danger to ſpoil and
hurt the Trees, becauſe they ſtick
too faſt to the Boughs, and can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be parted from them without

danger of Renting; wherefore we
are Neceſſitated to cut them off with

to every Fruit is left a little Sprigg,
which is for its Ornament; and in
this cutting muſt be obſerved that
we hurt the Tree as little as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible:
When now this cutting off is

they have the Nouriſhment

               <p>There is nothing better for the

Some let the Fruits hang

but doubtleſs it is prejudicial to them,

               <p>The Benefits theſe Trees yield,

great Gain be made by them: They

whereof we ſhall Treat.</p>
               <p>Many things are prepared of the

Bloſſoms, which is of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Smell, and is uſeful for many
things in Phyſick; chiefly to cauſe
Sweating, to ſtrengthen the Heart,
and many Diſtempers more, whereof
the Writings of Phyſitians and Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliſts
are full.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:61076:95"/>
To make this Water, the Orange
Bloſſoms ſhall be gathered in the
Morning before the Sun hath Shone
on them, and Diſtilled in a Pewter
Still, with a ſlow Fire, that they
may not in the leaſt be Burnt, for
this Diſtilling muſt only be done by
Steaming out; whereby we ſhall
get, though but a little, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
a very Pleaſant and ſtrong
Water. Ye may likewiſe, if ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
a greater Quantity, Diſtil them
in a Limbeck, but then the Water
ſhall not ſmell ſo Sweet.</p>
               <p>The Bloſſoms of Orange Trees
are very good to be laid in a Cheſt
of clean Linnen, to give it a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Smell.</p>
               <p>But to draw Oyl out of the Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms
by Diſtillation, is not well poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
here in theſe Countries, becauſe
the abundance which is hereunto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
is too great; for ſix hundred
Pounds do ſcarce yield two or three
Ounces: Yet that we may not be
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61076:95"/>
wholy deprived of this pleaſant
Smell, here is afterward Taught how
we ſhall Prepare this another way.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Brandy:</note>To make an Extraction with Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
from the Orange Bloſſoms; take
to every Pint two Ounces of Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms,
ſet them in the Sun to Diſtil,
fourteen Days long; and uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a ſpoonful together, againſt many

and eſpecially againſt the Cholick or
ſhrinking of the Guts.</p>
               <p>To Preſerve theſe Bloſſoms in
Sugar, which is commonly called
Confiting; they ſhall be gathered
juſt before they open, and boiled in
clean Rain-Water, till they be ſoft,
and have in part loſt their Bitterneſs;
after boyl the Sugar to a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
thickneſs of a Syrop, and pour
the ſame (after it is well Purifyed
with Whites of Eggs, and thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Clear) warm upon the Bloſſoms,
and let them ſtand cooling together;
if the Syrop be too thin, or becomes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61076:96"/>
ſo afterwards, ye muſt boil the ſame
again to its convenient Thickneſs,
that the Bloſſoms may be kept and
preſerved the better: This is a moſt
excellent Remedy againſt bad Airs,
foul and ſtinking Vapours, and alſo
an excellent Dainty.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Paſtilli.</note>Furthermore of Orange Bloſſoms,
there are made <hi>Pastilli,</hi> or little Balls,
after this following Faſhion: Take
fifty Bloſſoms which are quite open,
pluck them off by the Stalk, that ye
may not touch the Leaves, as little
as is poſſible, that the Sent may not
be ſpoiled; cut the Leaves with
Sciſſers, very ſmall one by one. To
this take a pound of the beſt Loaf-Sugar-Candy
that may be got, beat
the ſame fine, and put them in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
braſs Baſon, and add three Ounces
diſtilled Water of Orange Bloſſoms
thereunto, ſtir it with a <hi>Spatula,</hi> till
it be mingled together, which then
ſet upon Coals, thoroughly kindled,
and let it boil leiſurly, till, when
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61076:96"/>
taken up between your Fingers, it
begins to ſtick to them as it were
with fine ſmall Threds; then take it
from the Fire, and put the clean cut
Orange Bloſſoms into the boyled Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
ſtirring the ſame together with a

take a Board of hard Wood, which
is full of little hollow Places, and
ſtrow it thick with fine beaten Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then fill all the holes full with
a ſilver Spoon, of this mingled Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop,
which when cold, and then
taken out, the Sugar which hangs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

Knife from theſe little Balls, and then
you have <hi>Paſtilli,</hi> which are very
Good, Pleaſant, and Uſeful, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Heart; and againſt all Faintings. They
are alſo a good. Means againſt all

Take Nuts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Piſtaches, or

of ſtrong Brine, till all bad Scents be
drawn out of it, and being waſhed
again in freſh Water, wet it again
in the forementioned Oyl; yet ſo
that the Oyl doth not drop out of
it of it ſelf; take then a new Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

thereon a Laying of this oyled Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
and then Bloſſoms again, and

ſo on a Laying of the one, and a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the other, till the Pot be filled;
which then cover cloſe with a Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

that five or ſix Days one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
