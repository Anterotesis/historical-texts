            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NORABLE SIR HENRIE MOVNTAGVE, the Lord Chiefe Iustice of ENGLAND, <hi>my very good Lord.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honourable, my allegiance to the Almighty King necessitates my endeuours to glorify his Great Name. My Profession hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on me all ministeriall seruices. My filiall dutie to our blessed Mother the Church, hath taught me to help forward her cause, both with tongue and penne. My thankfulnes to your Lo. tyes me to seeke your honourable authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of all these labours. They run to you first, as if they waited your manumission of them to the world. If bookes be our children, and the masculine issue of our braines; then it is fit that your Lo. who haue the patronage of the father, should also vouchsafe a blessing to the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nor is this all: there is yet a weightier reason
<pb facs="tcp:25651:3"/>
why they should refuge themselues vnder your Lo<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> protection. The world is quickly offended, if it be told of the offences: men study courses, &amp; practise them; and if the Clergie find fault, yea if we doe not iustify and make good what they magnifie, &amp; make common, they will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry. It is the most thanklesse seruice to tell men of their misdeeds. Now a busines so distastfull requires a worthy Patron: &amp; whose Patronage should I desire but your Lo<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> whose I am, and to whom I owe all duty &amp; seruice? whose but your Lo<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> who are in place to reforme vice, and to encourage goodnes: to make that practicall and exemplary, which is here onely theoricall and preceptory? God hath intrusted to your hands his Sword of Iustice: draw it in his defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the enemies of his Grace &amp; Gospel. You sit at the common sterne, and therfore are not so much your owne as your Countreys. Helpe vs with your hands, we will helpe you with our prayers. The God of maiestie &amp; mercy, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your heart, rectifie your hand, iustifie your soule, and lastly crowne your head with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory.</p>

            <head>To the worthy Citizens of Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> Parish, syncere louers of the Gospell, present happinesse, and <hi>euerlasting Peace.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Owe you a treble debt, of loue, of seruice, of thankfulnesse. The former, the more I pay, the more still I owe. The second I will be ready to pay to the vttermost of my power; though short both of your deserts, and my owne desires. Of the last I will striue to giue full payment; and in that (if it be possible) to come out of your debts. Of all I haue in this volume giuen you the earnest: as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you vse to doe with bad debters, take this till more comes. You see I haue venturously traffic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with my poore talent in publike, whilest I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold richer graces kept close at home, and buried in silence: liking it better to husband a little to the common good, then to hoord vp much wealth in a sullen niggardice. I censure none: if all were writers, who should bee readers? if none, idle Pamphlets would take vp the generall eye, be read and applauded, onely through want of better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
<pb facs="tcp:25651:4"/>
If the graine be good, it doth better in the market, then in the Garner. All I can say for my selfe is, I desire to doe good; whereof if I should faile, yet euen that I did desire it, and endeuor it, shall content my conscience. I am not affrighted with that common obiection of a dead letter: I know that God can effectuate his owne ends, and neuer required man to appoint him the meanes. If it were profitable being spoken, sure it cannot be vnnecessary being written. It is not vnknowne to you, that an infirmity did put me to silence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weekes: whilest my tongue was so suspended from preaching, my hand tooke opportunity of writing. To vindicate my life from the least sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of idlenesse, or any such aspersions of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable tongues, I haue set forth this reall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which shall giue iust confutation to such slanders. If it be now condemned, I am sure it is onely for doing well. I very well know the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of preaching in this Citie: wee may say of it in another sense, what Christ said of Ierusalem, <hi>O thou that killest the Prophets.</hi> Many a Minister comes to a Parish with his veines full of bloud, his bones of marrow; but how soone doth he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust his spirits, waste his vigor! And albeit there are many good soules, for whose sake hee is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make himselfe a sacrifice: yet there are some so vnmercifull, that after all his labor would send him a begger to his graue. I tell you but the fault of some, quitting your particular selues: I speake not to diminish the credit of your bounty,
<pb facs="tcp:25651:4"/>
which I haue found, and heere with a thankefull profession acknowledge it. In testimony whereof I haue set to my hand, and sent it you a token of the gratitude of my heart. Receiue it from him that is vnfainedly desirous of your saluation: and if he knew by what other means soeuer he might bring you to euerlasting peace; would studie it, practise it, continue it; whilst his Organ of speech hath breath enough to mooue it.</p>

is spent in these three generalls. 1. There were, <hi>Omnia ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena, et externa:</hi> all things outward and sauouring of earth: ver. 18. <hi>A Mount that might still be touched, &amp;c.</hi> Here, all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna et coelestia,</hi> spirituall and heauenly. 2.

               <hi>The Sun of Righteousnesse:</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> stiled him <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>That light, which lightens euery one comming into the world.</hi> 3. There, all were <hi>Terribilia,</hi> fearefull and amazing: not onely to the people, ver. 19. who <hi>intreated that the Word should not bee spoken to them any more.</hi> But euen to <hi>Moses,</hi> ver. 21. <hi>So terrible was the sight, that</hi> Moses <hi>said, I exceedingly feare and quake.</hi> Here, all <hi>Amabilia et laeta,</hi> louely as <hi>Rachel,</hi> delightfull as Musike: the Gospel is called the <hi>Message of peace.</hi> Our Apostle therefore preacheth a double quantity in the Gospell; <hi>Magnitudinem Gloriae, multitudinem gratiae:</hi> the greatnes of Glory, to worke in vs reuerence: the multitude of Grace, to worke in vs loue &amp; obedience. <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>The Law was giuen by</hi> Moses, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Christ Iesus.</hi> The excellency of Christ aboue <hi>Moses,</hi> is exemplified in the third Chapter of this Epistle, <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 6.</note> Moses <hi>verily was faithfull in all Gods house as a seruant: But Christ as a Sonne ouer his owne house, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the words; the parts are generally two, the Accesse, and the Obiect. First, for the Accesse, <hi>Yee are come.</hi> What, on your own feet without a Guide? No; <note n="e" place="margin">Paraeus.</note> 
               <hi>Accessistis, hoc est, fide Euangelica perducti estis.</hi> Yee are come, that is, yee are brought by the faith of the Gospel. There is one that brings you; God: euery person in the blessed Trinity. It is <hi>Opus Patris;</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 44.</note> 
               <hi>No man can come except the Father draw him. Opus Filij,</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Can. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Draw me, we will runne after thee. Opus spiritus sancti,</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 143. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Let thy good spirit lead me into the Land of righteousnes</hi> Man is by nature in <hi>Zedechias</hi> case, <note n="i" place="margin">2. Kin. 25. 7.</note> 
               <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>lame:</hi> Blind, <hi>Non inuenisset viam, nisi via inuenisset eum:</hi> vnlesse the vvay had found him, he could neuer haue found the way. Lame, he may know that the Temple of heauen hath a <note n="k" place="margin">Acts 3. 2.</note>

Grace: but cannot come thither till God brings him, loo sen his stupified ioynts, and put into his hand the Almes of mercy. This done, he may <hi>enter into the Temple, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and leaping, and praising GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus first he giues the Soule eyes, vnderstanding; then feet, gracious affections: and now expects that he should come. God hath not so done all for thee, that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest doe nothing for thy selfe. <hi>A Deo sine te factus, à te fine Deo infectus, A Christo sine te refectus, non à te fine Christo, nec à Christo sine te perfectus:</hi> God did create thee without thy selfe, thou didst lose thy selfe without God: without thy selfe Christ did redeeme thee; but neither thy selfe without Christ, nor Christ without thy selfe shall perfect thee. <hi>Potest Dominus inueniri, adueniri, non praeueniri:</hi> There may be a finding of God, a comming to God, but <note place="margin">Ber.</note> no preuenting of God. Haue faith. <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Hee that commeth to God, must belieue:</hi> and that of thine owne, for there is no comming on anothers foote. Thus that we might come to Christ, Christ came to vs. <hi>Non de coelo merita nostra, sed peccata traxerunt:</hi> Not our merits, but our maladies drew that great Physician from heauen to vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yee are</hi> (not comming, but) <hi>come:</hi> it is rather a time perfectly past, then expectantly future. Which plainely demonstrates, that this is a description of the Church in her militant estate, so well as triumphant. Indeed either hath a relation to other, a communion to other; and the inestimable priuiledges of them both are wrapped vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The connexion of Glory to Grace is so infallible, that they often change names: Heauen is called the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Holinesse, and Holinesse is called the kingdome of Heauen. <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 8. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Yee are saued by hope:</hi> and <note n="n" place="margin">Iohn 5. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Hee that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, hath euerlasting life, and is passed from death to life.</hi> So sure, as if they were already in Heauen. So <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <hi>fulgura montes:</hi> the highest Mountaines are most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd to the violences of Heauen. ver. 18. There was a <hi>Mount burning with fire.</hi> This is no Mountaine of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or terror, but <hi>Sion:</hi> safe, pleasant, delightfull <hi>Sion;</hi> the <hi>ioy of the whole earth,</hi> the beloued of GOD: the <hi>Iohn</hi> that leaned on the bosome of Christ. <note n="p" place="margin">Psal. 87. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord loues the gates of</hi> Sion <hi>better then all the dwellings of</hi> Iacob. But though a <hi>Mount,</hi> though Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> yet it might be a solitary and vnfrecuented Hill: like that whereunto <note n="q" place="margin">Math. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>the Diuell tooke Christ, and shewed him the kingdomes of the world:</hi> vvhere a man can onely see glory, not enioy it. Or like that mount <note n="r" place="margin">Deu. 34. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Nebo,</hi> or top of <hi>Pisgah,</hi> whereon <hi>Moses</hi> might onely stand, and behold the Land of Canaan.</p>
            <p>Not so, but on this Mount there stands a <hi>City:</hi> a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <note place="margin">2</note> Citie, and full of buildings: like that, wherein Christ sayes <note n="s" place="margin">Ioh. 14. 2.</note> 
               <hi>there are many mansions.</hi> But now whose <hi>Citie</hi> is this?

               <hi>There shall not be left one store vpon another.</hi> But this Citie is built with no other stones then Iaspers, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirs, Emeralds, and Amathysts.

There be Cities eminent for situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, glorious for building, commodious for traffique: yet haue all these benefits poisoned by euill Citizens. When <hi>Alcibiades</hi> would sell a house, among other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences for which he praised it, he especially commends it for this; that it hath a good neighbour. Who bee the neighbours in this Citie? Angels, glorious &amp; excellent creatures, the great Kings Courtiers; heere, our Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, there, our companions. Yes, you will say, one or two Angels: yea a <hi>company;</hi> not like <hi>Dauids</hi> at <hi>Adullam,</hi> nor <hi>Absolons</hi> in <hi>Hebron;</hi> but <hi>innumerable, Myriads of Angels.</hi>

No, for it is the part of a iust Iudge, <hi>Parcere subiectis, &amp; debellare superbos:</hi> to punish obstinate Rebels, and to protect peaceable and obedient subiects.</p>
            <p>Somewhat was said of adopted Citizens, such as were strangers borne, and by grace naturalized. What manner <note place="margin">6.</note> of creatures are they, that GOD hath admitted to dwell there? <hi>Spirits.</hi> Why, Diuels are spirits: No, spirits <hi>of Men.</hi> But many men haue wicked spirits, and shall such dwell there? No, the spirits of <hi>Iust</hi> men. Why, <hi>Solon, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristides, Phocion, Scipio,</hi> were iust men: they were moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iust, but not truely iustified, not <hi>perfected.</hi> These are iust spirits <hi>made perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How came they to be thus perfect? By <hi>Iesus,</hi>

               <hi>iustification.</hi> What is this <hi>Iesus? A Mediator.</hi> Man was guilty, God was angry: how should they be reconciled? A Mediator must doe it. For this purpose <hi>Apparuit inter mortales peceatores, &amp; immortalem iustum, mortalis cum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus, iustus cum Deo.</hi> Hee appeared betweene mortall <note place="margin">Aug.</note> sinners, and the immortall Iudge, mortall with men, iust with God: so was a perfect Mediator. Whereof? <hi>Noui foederis, of the new Couenant.</hi> The old was forfeited, a new one comes by him that renues all. Not <hi>Doe this and liue:</hi>

but <note n="g" place="margin">Iohn 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>belieue</hi> on him that hath done it for thee, &amp; liue for euer. How is this Couenant confirmed? It is sealed with <hi>Bloud.</hi> How is this bloud applyed? <hi>Aspergendo, by sprinkling:</hi> as the dore-posts sprinkled with the bloud of the Paschall Lambe, caused the destroying Angel to passe ouer the Israelites: So the aspersion of this immaculate Lambes bloud vpon the conscience, shall free vs from the eternall vengeance. But what's the vertue of this bloud? <hi>It speaketh better things then that of Abel.</hi> That bloud cried for vengeance; this cryes for forgiuenesse. The voice of that was, Lord, see and iudge: the voice of this is, <hi>Father, forgiue them, they know not what they doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus briefely haue I paraphrased the Text. Now for methods sake, in the tractation wee may consider ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally these fiue points. 1. There is a Citie; <hi>Ierusalem, the Citie of the liuing God.</hi> 2. The situation whereon it is built, <hi>Mount Sion.</hi> 3. The Citizens, who are Angels and men: <hi>an innumerable company of Angels,</hi> and <hi>spirits of iust men.</hi> 4. The King that gouernes it; <hi>GOD the Iudge of all.</hi> 5. The Purchaser that bought it, and gaue it vs, <hi>Iesus, the Mediator of the new Couenant.</hi> But now the situation hath the first place in the words, therfore challengeth the same in my discourse. And indeed on good cause should the foundation goe before the building: we first seek out a fit ground, and then proceed to edifie on it.</p>

Now what is that stately building of a humane lumpe, but the same earth his foote treads vpon, better tempered, because painted worse; when it wants the guest, the soule that quickens it worst of all?

               <p>Now these two Cities were begun in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel: Cain</hi> a Citizen of the world, <hi>Abel</hi> a Citizen of God.

Their nature, their knowledge, their power, their dignitie, their distinction, their ministery.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their nature; they are not qualities and motions, but spirituall substances, really subsisting. This their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions testifie, running on Gods commands; executing his hests, &amp;c. They are not flesh and bone, yet sometimes haue taken visible formes. <hi>Abraham</hi> intertaining three Angels, <hi>set meate before them,</hi>

But this is an idle opinion, for there may be a true eating, though the meat be not conuerted into the substance of the body. So our Sauiour did eate after his rising from death, yet no man thinkes his meate was turned into his substance. It is safe to say with the Text, <hi>they did eate,</hi> and performe other offices of a body truly. Now this was by diuine dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation for a time, the bettter to accomplish their enioyned

                  <hi>Michael and his Angels fought against the Dragon, and the Dragon fought and his angels; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed not.</hi> The Deuill hath a raging malice, but no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing power. One Angell is too hard for many deuils. But against the power of <hi>Angels</hi> it is obiected, that a man preuailed against an Angell. <note n="f" place="margin">Hos. 12. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Iacob had power ouer the Angoll, and preuailed.</hi> Some had a sottish opinion, that this Angell was the Deuill in <hi>Esau's</hi> likenesse, and that by the power of a good Angell <hi>Iacob</hi> ouercame. Now lest hee should ascribe the victory to himselfe and his owne strength, the Angell smote him on the thigh, so that hee halted. But there is no mention made saue of one Angel: he that wrastled with him, was the same that blessed him: he that blessed him, was the same that touched him: a good Angell, for an euill would neuer haue blessed him. But indeed this <hi>Angell</hi> was the Sonne of God. 1. Because he blessed him, God blesseth, not Angels. 2. It is said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 28. that he <hi>preuayled with GOD;</hi> and verse 30. that hee <hi>saw God face to face:</hi> therefore it was God, not an Angell. Whether it were God or an Angell, you may see the power of faith, that it can preuail with migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Angels, with almighty God. Hee that wrastled with <hi>Iacob,</hi> gaue him power to ouercome. <hi>Seipso fortior est,</hi> so God is stronger then himselfe. Hee could not preuaile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would not: he disposeth his power according to his will, not his will according to his power. <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 19. 22.</note>

               <p n="4">4. Their dignity consists in two things; In respect of their Place, and of their Grace. 1. For their abode, it is in

heauen. Euill Angels dwell belowe, <note n="i" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 4.</note>

                  <hi>The Angels doe behold the face of my Father in heauen.</hi> They are heauenly Courtiers, and heauenly Quiristers, eternally singing <hi>Ichouahs</hi> praise. 2. In respect of their Grace, so that they are called the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of GOD:</hi> and are farre more excellent then man. It is true that the Sonne of God dignified mans nature more then theirs: <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>For he tooke not on him the nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham.</hi>

                     </gap>am:</hi> The Angels refuse to be worshipped of mans nature, which they see GOD himselfe hath accepted. But though he tooke not their nature, yet he dignified their office: for he is often called by the name of <hi>Angel.</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Gene. 48. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>The Angel that redeemed mee,</hi> sayes aged <hi>Israel:</hi> the onely redeeming <hi>Angel</hi> is Christ. <note n="o" place="margin">Exo. 14. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>The Angel</hi> that went with the Campe of Israel, is called, ver. 24. <hi>The Lord. Paul</hi> sayes expresly, it was <hi>Christ.</hi> 1. Cor. 10. 4. 9. He is called <hi>Angelus foederis,</hi> the <note n="p" place="margin">Mal. 3. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Angel of the Couenant.</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Reue. 20. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>I saw an Angel hauing the key of the bottomlesse pit: and he bound Satan:</hi> but onely Christ can bind Satan, and <note n="r" place="margin">Reue. 1. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>hath the keyes of death and hell.</hi> Thus Christ hath accepted the name of Angels, yet hee tooke not on him the nature of Angels, but of man: no more then the Angels tooke on them the nature of man, vvhen they appeared in an humane shape.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their distinction. <hi>Gregory</hi> collects from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>Nouem Angelorum ordines,</hi> nine seuerall orders of Angels. <hi>Angels, Archangels, Vertues, Powers, Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Dominations, Thrones, Cherubim</hi> and <hi>Seraphim.</hi> We grant indeed that there be certaine distinctions &amp; degrees in the Quire of Heauen: but whether distinguished by nature, gifts, or offices, none can determine. The Papists plead much for the Princedome of <hi>Michael</hi> aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angels. Their ground is Reuel. 12. 7. <hi>Michael &amp; his Angels fought &amp;c. Bellarmine</hi> affirmes, that euer since the fall of <hi>Lucifer, Michael</hi> is head of the glorious Angels:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25651:28"/>
and the Rhemists collect from that place the reason, why <hi>Michael</hi> is ordinarily painted fighting with a Dragon. But the foolish Painter so well as wise <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> can tell vs how <hi>Michael</hi> came to be chose in <hi>Lucifers</hi> roome. <hi>Iude</hi> saith, the wicked Angels that left their habitation, are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in chaines of darknesse:</hi> but hee tells vs not, that such as did not fall are preferred to higher places, but rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue still in their <hi>first estate</hi> and dignitie. Indeed <hi>Iude</hi> calls <hi>Michael</hi> an Archangel, and <hi>Daniel Vnum de principibus,</hi> one of the principall Angels: but it can neuer be proued, that he was, is, or shall be Monarch, or head of all Angels. Themselues say, that the greatest Angel is vsed in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Embassage: but <hi>Gabriel,</hi> not <hi>Michael,</hi> was sent for the contracting of that sacred match betweene the GOD of <note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> Heauen and the blessed Virgin. Therefore <hi>Gabriel,</hi> not <hi>Michael,</hi> should be supreme both in naturall graces, and supernaturall prerogatiues. Indeed Christ is the <hi>Michael</hi> there mentioned: for the blessed Angels cannot be said to be any other <hi>Michaels</hi> Angels, then Christ. So <hi>August. Bulling. Marlor.</hi> Perhaps in the vision <hi>Michael</hi> &amp; an host of Angels appeared to <hi>Iohn,</hi> but they represented Christ and his members. <hi>Christus est Ecclesiae suae Promachus, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli eius Symachi:</hi> It is against the principles of holy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, <note place="margin">Aretius.</note> to ascribe this victory to <hi>Michael</hi> or any other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel whatsoeuer. <note n="s" place="margin">Reu. 12. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>They ouercame Satan by the bloud of the Lambe,</hi> not by <hi>Michael,</hi> or any <hi>Angel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Their ministerie: from hence, some of the Fathers say, the Angels tooke their names. So <hi>Gregor. Angeli vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabulum nomen est officij, non naturae:</hi> Angel is a name of office, not of nature. The Inhabitants of that celestiall Country are alwaies Spirits, but cannot alwaies be called <hi>Angels. Tunc solùm sunt Angeli, quando per eos aliqua nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiantur:</hi> they are then onely Angels, or (it is all one) mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, when they are sent on some message. Therefore he concludes; <hi>Hi qui minima nuntiant Angeli, qui summa nuntiant Archangeli vocantur:</hi> They that are sent on busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:25651:29"/>
of lesse moment are called Angels, of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance Archangels. <hi>August. Ex eo quod est, Spiritus est: ex eo quod agit, Angelus est.</hi> They are Spirits in regard of their Being, Angels in regard of their Dooing. <hi>Good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> saith <hi>Isidor, are deputed for the ministery of mans salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> God hath giuen man three helps: Sense to see dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger neere, Reason to suspect danger far off, Angels to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent that he neither sees nor suspects. Now the ministery of Angels is three-fold; to God, to his Church, to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To God, which consists principally in two things. 1. In adoring, and ascribing glory to him. So the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims</hi> cryed <note n="a" place="margin">Esay 6. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.</hi> An Army sung, <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 2. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Glory to God on high.</hi> The whole Quire of heauen, <note n="c" place="margin">Reue. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receiue honour and power.</hi> 2. In standing in his presence, ready at his command. <note n="d" place="margin">Psa. 103. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>They do his commandements, harkning to the voice of his Word.</hi> For this promptnes of obedience wee pray, <hi>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heauen. Quod oramus, agamus.</hi> Thus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were messengers, that Christ should bee conceiued. Luke 1. 31. that he was conceiued. Mat. 1. 20. that he was borne. Luke 2. 11. that he was risen. Luke 24. 4. that hee vvas ascended. Act. 1. 11. These were great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, therefore were confirmed vvith the testimonie of Angels.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the Church. <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Are they not all ministring Spirits, sent forth to minister for them, who shall be heires of saluation?</hi> And by this their ordination to seruice the Apostle shewes, how infinitely farre the preeminence of Christ transcends theirs. But did not Christ put <note n="f" place="margin">Phil. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>vpon him the forme of a seruant?</hi> Doth not himselfe professe, that <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 20. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>hee came not to be ministred vnto, but to minister?</hi> The answer is easy; <hi>Non esse hoc naturae, sed voluntariae exinanitionis:</hi> This was not a natural or enforced, but a willing abasement of himself. <hi>Humilitatem non habitam induit, celsitatem habitam non exuit.</hi> Hee put on an humiliation that he had not, hee
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:25651:29"/>
did not put off the glory that he had: But the Angels were created to this end, that they should serue; <hi>Totamque con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionem sub ministerio contineri. Istis naturale, illi aduentiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Caluin.</note> To them it was necessary, to Christ voluntary. Now then ministery to the Church is three wayes considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In this life, and that to our Bodies, and to our Soules. 1. To our Bodies: for they necessarily tend to the preseruation of our temporall estates, euen from our Cradles to our Graues. This is true in Doctrine, and in Example.

They shall beare thee vp in their hands, lest thou dash thy foote against a stone.</hi> In example: an Angel comforts, directs, feedes <hi>Elias.</hi> Angels plucke <hi>Lot</hi> out of Sodome. An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel aduiseth <hi>Ioseph</hi> to fly into Egypt with <hi>Iesus. Abraham</hi> so encouraged his seruant, <note n="i" place="margin">Gen 24. 7.</note>

GOD hath sent them to guide vs to good, to gard vs from euill: when we follow their guidance, they reioyce. Let vs hate to sinne, as we would not wish to bring griefe to the thresholds of heauen. 2. That their number might be made vp againe. They lost a number of Spirits, they are glad to haue it made vp with Soules. The Angels ioyned company with men, praysing God on earth: so they delight to haue men made their fellow-Choristers in heauen. <note place="margin">Luke 2.</note>

               <p n="2">2.

But to shew that the Almighty God being tied to no meanes, doth yet worke by meanes, to vphold the weakenesse of our natures. A Prince sees his little children besieged, and sends his stronger sonnes, able souldiers to relieue them. Their helpe to vs is certaine, though not visible: we cannot describe it, nor prescribe it, but vvee feele it in the successe: they preserue vs. Against the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> band, <note n="c" place="margin">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:25651:31"/>
ants: yea to euery Infidell kingdome such an Angel: yea to Antichrist; lastly, euen to hell it selfe. Sure then they vvill not pinch themselues: they appoynt to the Pope two principall Seraphims, <hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>Gabriel,</hi> euer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his Person. For that <hi>Michael</hi> is the chiefest, <hi>Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torellus</hi> produceth two very equall witnesses: the Roman Liturgie, and <hi>Tasso's</hi> Ierusalem: as a worthy Diuine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. To the Conclaue they assigne one speciall assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Angel. But mee thinks, as they Ideate their Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, this Angel should desire the roome, and become a suter to the holy Ghost to name him Pope in the next Conclaue. For by this meanes hee doth wonderfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his Diocesse, hauing all the lower world vnder him; all particular Angels of speciall Societies subiect to him: yea all the Archangels and Principalities officed to seueral Estates, must concurre to his gard and assistance.</p>
               <p>The truth is, God sometimes allowes the help of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to the very reprobates: but to this scope &amp; purpose, <hi>Populs sui promouere salutem,</hi> to further the welfare of his owne people. For all the atchieuements and victories, which come to the heathen by helpe of Angels, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not for their good, but the good of the Saints. It is for the Sonne of Gods sake they minister to vs: and to none do they performe these comfortable seruices, but to the Elect in Iesus Christ.</p>

               <p>It is a question much disputed, whether besides the protection of Angels in common, euery particular man haue one particular Angel for his Guardian. I find many of the Fathers allotting euery one a particular Angel. <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. Singulae Gentes praepositos Angelos habere creduntur: imo omnes homines Angelos suos. Origen, Basil, Hierome, Chrysostome, Theophylact, Gregory Nyssen, Primasius, Iustin Martyr, Augustin,</hi> most of the Schoolemen, and some Protestant Diuines: all conclude that euery man from his birth, or especially from his Baptisme, hath a particular Angel. I will not dispute it, yet I must doubt it; because I see no cleare ground in the Scriptures to proue it. The two chiefe places cited are these, Math. 18. 10. <hi>Despise not these little ones, for their Angels behold the face of my Father in heauen.</hi> This place <hi>Caietan</hi> and others expound, not that euery little one hath a peculiar guardant Angel, but <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes omnibus;</hi> that all the Angels take care of all Gods little ones. As the Scriptures construe it selfe; <note n="h" place="margin">Luke 15. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>All the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels reioyce</hi> at the conuersion of one sinner. The other place is, Acts 12. 15. <hi>Peter</hi> being vnexpectedly deliuered out of prison, came to <hi>Maries</hi> house where the Saints were gathered together. <hi>Rhoda</hi> hearing his voice, ranne in, and told them how <hi>Peter</hi> stood at the gate. They said to her, Thou art mad: but when shee constantly affirmed it, they said, <hi>It is his Angel.</hi> I answere that the Disciples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at the strange report, spake they knew not vvhat. On the like reason, because <hi>Peter</hi> transported in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ transfigured, said, <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 17. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Let vs build here three Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles:</hi> some might inferre that Saints departed dwell in Tabernacles. Because the two sonnes of <hi>Zebede</hi> desired to <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 20. 21.</note> sit one at Christs right hand, the other on his left in his kingdome; they might haue concluded that Christ
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:25651:32"/>
was to be a temporall King. Or because the <hi>Disciples</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iesus walking on the Sea, in their <hi>troubled</hi> minds, said <note n="l" place="margin">Math. 14. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>It was a spirit;</hi> others might proue that spirits walke. <hi>Omne dictum sancti non est dictum sanctum.</hi> All are not Christian truths, that true Christians haue spoken. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt errores non Christiani, sed homines:</hi> they erre not as they are Christians, but as they are men.</p>
               <p>But it is obiected, that they spake after the common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of men in that age. Wee reply, that in that age it was a common opinion that dead men walked: so it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by <hi>Herod</hi> hearing the fame of Iesus; <note n="m" place="margin">Math. 14. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>This is Iohn the Baptist, he is risen from the dead. Uox populi</hi> is not euer <hi>vox Dei:</hi> common errors are no rules of truth. And if the place were so manifest, as they could wish it, why might it not rather be vnderstood thus? <hi>It is his Angel,</hi> that is, some Angel that God hath sent for his deliuerance. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times many men haue but one Angel, other times one man hath many Angels. Exod. 14. 10. There was but one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel for many people. 2. King. 6. 17. There were many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for one man. Let vs now make some vses concerning this discourse of Angels. These may be two-fold; some for imitation, others for application.</p>
               <p>First for imitation; there are three things specially to be obserued in Angels: Purenesse of substance, Readines of obedience, Feruour of Charitie. These are couertly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied from Psal. 104. <hi>He maketh his Angels spirits, his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psalme 104. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>a flaming fire. Spirits,</hi> there is the Puritie of their substance: <hi>ministers,</hi> there's the Readinesse of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: <hi>Flame of fire,</hi> there's the heate of their Charitie. Thus were the <hi>Cherubims</hi> of the Tabernacle made, figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these three vertues in the Angels. Exod. 25. First, they were made of <hi>Pure gold.</hi> ver. 18. This shewes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of their <hi>substance,</hi> for gold is the purest and best of mettals. To this Gods owne Word is compared: <note n="a" place="margin">Cant. 1. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>We will make thee borders of gold, with studdes of siluer.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they had two wings stretched out, to witnesse <hi>Promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:25651:32"/>
obedientiae;</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Dan. 9. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Gabriel did fly swiftly.</hi> Of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the winged are the swiftest. <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 55. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>O that I had wings like a Doue, then would I fly away, and be at rest.</hi> The most sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly transient thing, <hi>riches</hi> is compared to a winged crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <note n="d" place="margin">Prou. 23. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Riches makes it selfe wings like an Eagle.</hi> Thirdly, they were made with their faces one towards another, to manifest the truth of their loue; not like proud men tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away their countenance from their brethren. Lastly, though one were toward another, yet both toward the <hi>Mercie-seate:</hi> beholding him in sight, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were beholden in dutie.</p>
               <p>Thus we see, 1. that their nature is pure; and this their mansion declares, which is heauen: for <hi>into it shall enter no vncleane thing.</hi> They are shining and singing starres: <note n="e" place="margin">Iob 38. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>When the morning starres sang together, and all the sonnes of God shouted for ioy.</hi> Heauen like fire, <hi>Similem sibi reddit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredientem,</hi> makes that it receiues like it selfe. 2. That their obedience is ready and swift, their very name imports, Angels. <hi>Aquo dominatio, ab eo denominatio:</hi> for a name is giuen from some supereminent qualitie. <note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 18. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee rode vpon a Cherub, and did fly.</hi> 3. That their Charity is great, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by their busie protecting vs, grieuing at our falls, reioycing at our perseuerance in good, &amp; helping vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to saluation. Let vs imitate them in foure things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Puritie: nothing is more pleasing to God. It hath the blessing of this life, &amp; of the life to come. Of this life; <note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 73. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Truly God is good to Israel, euen to such as are of a pure heart.</hi> God is good to the whole vvorld with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefites, better to Israel with extraordinary bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, but best of all to the <hi>Pure in heart</hi> with his sauing Graces. Of the life to come: <note n="h" place="margin">Psal 24. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Who shall stand in Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place? he that hath cleane hands, and a pure heart.</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 5. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</hi> Thereis no ioy like to this beatificall vision, to see God is the height of happinesse. But so shall the wicked; <note n="k" place="margin">Reue. 1. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>they shal see him whom they haue pierced.</hi> Diuines vsually distinguish of that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:25651:33"/>
sight: <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 11. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>They shall see the Sonne of man comming in a cloud;</hi> they shall see him as man, not as God; as their iust Iudge, not mercifull Sauiour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In Pietie and obedience, wherein the Angels are ready and speedy, resolute and absolute. As they helpe vs to commaund the creature, so let them teach vs to obey the Creator. They fly when God sends them: true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience hath no lead at the heeles. <hi>Paul</hi> herein was like an Angel; hauing his Commission, hee stood not to <note n="m" place="margin">Gala. 1. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with flesh and bloud. Quantum morae addis, tantum o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientiae detrahis.</hi> So much as a man addes to delay, hee takes away from obedience. The truely obedient man doth not procrastinate: <hi>Sed statim parat aures auditui, lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guam voci, pedem itineri, manum operi, cor praecipienti.</hi> He <note place="margin">Bern.</note> instantly prepareth his eare for the message: <note n="n" place="margin">1. Sam. 3. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Speak Lord, for thy seruant heareth.</hi> His tongue giueth a ready answer to the question: <note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 21. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Simon, louest thou me? Lord, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est that I loue thee.</hi> His foote is shod for the iourney; <note n="p" place="margin">Eph. 6. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>his feete be shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace.</hi> His hand is fit for the worke, <note n="q" place="margin">Gene. 22. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham stretched forth his hand to slay his sonne.</hi> His heart is pliable to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: <hi>Paratum cor: O Lord, my heart is ready.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In Charitie: Angels looke vpon and loue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all loue vs: Let this teach vs to loue them &amp; our selues. Doe they seeke our peace, and shall wee vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly warre? It was the Angels song, Luke 2. <hi>Pax in terris, Peace vpon earth:</hi> warre with none but with Antichrist &amp; the diuell. The Angels haue no need of our loue, vve of theirs. Loue we that on earth, which shall dwell vvith vs for euer in heauen, Charitie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In humility: those glorious spirits stoope to do vs seruice, let vs not thinke it bad or base to serue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in loue. No one man can so farre exceede ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Angels excell the best men: doe they abase themselues to our succour, and shall we in a foolish pride soorne our brethren? The haughty peece lookes on the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:25651:33"/>
poore betwixt scorne and anger; <hi>Touch mee not,</hi> I am of purer mould: yet <hi>Mors dominos seruis;</hi> blended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the forgotten graue, none makes the finer dust: we cannot say, such a Ladies rottennesse smells sweeter then such a beggers. Come downe thou proud spirit, deny not succour to thy distressed brother, lest God deny his high Angels to succour thee. Thus for imitation, now for application, learne we other vses.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is terror to the vvicked, who contemne and condemne the righteous. <note n="r" place="margin">Math. 18. 10</note> 
                  <hi>Despise not these little ones, for their Angels are with my Father in heauen.</hi> Beware you that scoffe at poore Innocents, their Angels may plague you. They for their parts may be content to put vp abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and to forgiue iniuries: but their Angels may take vengeance. <note n="s" place="margin">Acts 12. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Herod vexed certaine of the Church, killed Iames with the sword, and seeing it please the Iewes, hee tooke Peter also.</hi> They could not helpe this; but their Angels did: for <note n="t" place="margin">verse 23.</note> 
                  <hi>an Angel of the Lord smote him that he died.</hi> Thou maiest haue euasion from the executioners of men, but no protection against the Officers of GOD. When they are bidden to strike, they will lay on sure strokes. <note n="u" place="margin">Gene. 19. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Wee will destroy this place, for the Lord hath sent vs to destroy it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They teach vs deuout reuerence, so to behaue our selues as in the sight and presence of holy Angels. The consideration of so blessed a company, doth not onely <hi>Conferre fiduciam,</hi> and <hi>afferre deuotionem,</hi> but <hi>inferre reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentiam;</hi> saith <hi>Bernard.</hi> When to <hi>Iacob</hi> in his dreame was presented that <hi>Ladder,</hi> and the <hi>Angels ascending and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending on it:</hi> wakening hee saies; <hi>How fearefull is this place!</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Gen. 28. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heauen. Seneca</hi> said, that the conceit of <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> &amp; such graue men in our company would restraine vs from euill: but what are these to the holy Angels of heauen? <note n="y" place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Wee are a spectacle to the Angels:</hi> they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruers and witnesses of all our actions. <note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>For this cause the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:25651:34"/>
vvoman ought to haue power on her head, because of the Angels.</hi> This is not to be vnderstood of offence onely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Ministers of the Church: but to signifie that a woman throwing off the vaile of modestie, and token of subiection to her husband, doth make euen the Angels of heauen witnesses of her dissolute contumacie. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are present with thee when all men on the earth are absent from thee. I aske thee, when thou pollutest the marriage bed, attemptest an homicide, plottest a treason, forgest a vvriting, wouldest thou then haue the Angels present with thee, or absent from thee? If thou desirest them present, why dost thou offend them by thy turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes? If absent, thy protectors are gone, and the diuels would easily confound thee. <hi>Nonfacias coram Angelis Dei,</hi> yea <hi>coram Deo Angelorum:</hi> Do not that thing before the Angels of God; yea before the GOD of Angels; vvhich thou wouldest shame to doe in the sight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of an earthly man.</p>
               <p>Yet let vs marke here by the way, that albeit the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels deserue our reuerence, yet they desire not our adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Indeed the euill Angels request it: it was a speciall boone which the Diuell begd of Christ, <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 4. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>to fall downe &amp; worship him.</hi> But the good refuse it; <note n="c" place="margin">Reue. 19. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>See thou doe it not, for I am thy fellow seruant;</hi> saith the Angell to kneeling <hi>Iohn.</hi> As we vsually come too short in our due reuerence to the Angels; so the Papists goe too farre in vndue ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. They haue a set prayer for it: <hi>Angele Dei, Custos mei me tibi commissum lege super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>a, semper rege, custodi gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berna.</hi> This sacrilegious honour those holy spirits refuse: they take no charge of such superstitious soules. <hi>Accipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt commissum, non arripi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="3">3. This declares to vs the excellent company that is in heauen. Were the place lesse noble and maiesticall, yet the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:25651:34"/>
company it affords is able to make the soule right blessed. We are loth to leaue this earth for the societie of some friends, in whom we delight; yet wee are all subiect to mutuall dislikes. Besides the meeting of those good friends againe in heauen, there be also glorious Angels. There is nothing in them but is amiable, admirable: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in possibilitie of changing our pleasures. There thou shalt see and conuerse with those ancient Worthies, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Primitiue times, all of them out-shining the starres: where our loue shall be as eternall, as is our glory. There wee shall liue familiarly in the sight of those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, whom now we receiue good from, and see not. Yea there is the fountaine of all felicity, that Sauiour of ours, whose grace onely brings vs to the blessed vision of the whole Trinitie. Neither can there be a higher happinesse, then the eternall fruition of Iesus Christ. Let this teach vs all to blesse our God that hath thus aduanced vs. Man is corporeall dust; O that this clay of ours should come to dwel with those incorporeal spirits! <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 22. 30.</note>

               <p n="1">1. Though it be a <hi>Generall Assembly,</hi> yet it is but <hi>one.</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Cant. 6. 8.</note> There be threescore Queenes, and fourescore Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, and Virgins without number: <hi>but my Doue, my vndefiled is but one: shee is the onely one of her Mother.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there be two parts of this One Church: Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant in Heauen, and Militant on Earth. The Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant part is a company of Iustified spirits, triumphing ouer the flesh, vvorld, and diuell: spirits, I say, for <note n="*" place="margin">Except our Sauiours, and the bodyes of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> and of those Saints that rose at Christs Resurrection, of which yet many Diuines doubt.</note> bodies are not yet ascended. They haue two hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py priuiledges. 1. To reioyce in the conquest ouer sinne and death: the most righteous man liuing is <hi>in praelio,</hi> in a continuall warfare. But so are the other: for Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <note n="f" place="margin">Reue. 12. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>There was warre in Heauen.</hi> This must be vnderstood of heauen on earth; vvhere there is no truce with Satan; <hi>Pax cum Deo, bellum cum diabolo:</hi> We haue peace with God, but (on this condition, that) warre with the diuell. Therefore so runne the promises, <hi>Uincenti dabitur: To him that ouercomes,</hi> shall be giuen <note n="g" place="margin">Reue. 7. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Palmes:</hi> to shew that they had been warriours, are now conquerours, 1. To praise God continually, and to sing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:25651:35"/>
                  <hi>Amen: Blessing and glory, thankesgiuing and honour be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for euer and euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The militant part is a company of men liuing vnder the crosse, and desiring to be with Christ. They suffer, and this is their way to glory; <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 14 22.</note> 
                  <hi>through much tribulation entring into the kingdome of God.</hi> They desire dissolution, being <note n="i" place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>willing rather to be absent from the body, and to bee present with the Lord,</hi> not simply and absolutely desiring death: but first that they might leaue sinning, and so cease to displease God: and then to come neerer to their blessed Sauiour, whose loue hath rauished their hearts. Now this militant Church may haue many parts: as the Ocean sea is but one, yet distinguished according to the Regions vpon which it lies. So there is the Spanish Ocean, the English Ocean, the German Ocean. There is a Church in England, a Church in France, a Church in Germany: yet there is but one militant Church. <hi>Multa Ecclesiae, vna Ecclesia;</hi> saith S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> One Sunne, many beames; one Kingdome, many shires; one tree, many branches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We must note, that Christ is the alone head of his Church, and can haue no other partner to share with him in this dignity. <note n="k" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Iesus Christ is the corner stone, in whom all the building fitly framed together, growes vnto an holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Lord.</hi> Hee doth not onely by his authority go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne it, but also by his grace quicken it: so that wee liue not, but <hi>Christ liueth in vs.</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Col. 2. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Let vs hold the head, from which all the body by ioynts and bands hauing nourishment ministred, increaseth with the increase of God.</hi> He requires no deputy, he needs none. For <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 18. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>wheresoeuer you are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my name, I am in the middest of you.</hi> Now euery Commission ceaseth in the presence of him that giues it.</p>
               <p>It is therefore as great arrogancy in the Pope to call himselfe <hi>Caput Ecclesiae,</hi> Head of the Church; as for a subiect to keepe himselfe in commission in the presence
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:25651:36"/>
of the King. But they distinguish of heads; there is a Principall, and a Ministeriall Head. Christ is not so weake in himselfe, or so respectlesse of vs, as to need any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall head. Indeed there be <hi>Heads Materialiter,</hi> who are no other then principall members. So <hi>Saul</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Head of the Tribes,</hi> Psal. 18. 43. <hi>Thou hast made me the head of the heathen,</hi> 2. Sam. 23. 8. <hi>The Tachmonite head of the Captaines.</hi> Nehem. 11. 16. <hi>Iozabad head of the Leuites.</hi> The eldest was called <hi>head</hi> of the familie, Exod. 6. 14. <hi>These bee the heads of their fathers houses.</hi> But there is a <hi>Head Formaliter,</hi> to giue sense, motion, vertue, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: this none but onely Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wee must know, that there is no saluation out of this Church; such as neuer become members of it, must eternally perish: they that are true members, shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. <note n="n" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>If they had beene of vs, they would haue continued with vs: but they went out from vs, that it might be manifest they were not of vs.</hi>

                  <hi>Without are dogs and scorners,</hi> &amp;c. All out of the Arke perished in the waters. <note n="p" place="margin">Act. 2. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord added to the Church daily such as should bee saued.</hi> First, because there is no meanes of saluation out of it; no word to teach, no Sacraments to confirm. And especially because out of the Church there is no Christ, and out of Christ no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Who haue not the Church their Mother, cannot haue God their Father. This teacheth vs to honour our Mother, and like little children to hang at her brests for our sustenance. <note n="q" place="margin">Esa. 66. 11.</note>

                  <hi>The generall assembly:</hi> this is the property of the Church; <hi>Generall.</hi> It is Catholike in three respects; of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:25651:36"/>
Time, of Persons, of Place. 1. Of Time, because the Church had a beeing in all ages, euer since the Promise was giuen to our first Parents in Paradise. If there had beene a time when no Church had beene on earth, the world should haue then perished: for it stands for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects sake. 2. Of persons; for it consists of all degrees and sorts of men; rich and poore, Princes and subiects, bond and free. There is no order nor state excluded, if they exclude not themselues. <note n="s" place="margin">1. Iohn 2. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ is the Propitiation for our sinnes.</hi> He may be so indeed for the sinnes of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Disciples, but how appeares it for mine? yes; <note n="t" place="margin">Vers. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>not for our sinnes onely, but for the sinnes of the wholeworld;</hi> euery condition of beleeuers. 3. Of Place, it is gathered from all parts of the earth; especially vnder the new Testament. <note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 26. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Wheresoeuer this Gospell shall bee preached in the whole world.</hi> When Christ gaue his Apostles their Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee gaue also the whole world for their Parish. <hi>Goe teach all nations, and baptize, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we see the property of this Church, Catholike or Generall. It is <hi>one,</hi> but not tyed to one time, nor one place, nor one person: it is <hi>Catholike</hi> to all times, to all places, to all persons. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayes that the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists in his dayes would haue tyed the Church to <hi>Carten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in <hi>Africa:</hi> as the Papists in our dayes to <hi>Rome</hi> in Italy. How is it then a <hi>Generall assembly?</hi> Thus that Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian rabble, which haue almost nothing in their mouthes but the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Church;</hi> yet doe mostly infringe the liberties of the <hi>Church,</hi> and hedge it in. All of them haue made the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> to be nothing else but the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Church; and some of them the <hi>Romane</hi> Church to be nothing else but the <hi>Pope.</hi> So in effect <hi>Papa virtualiter est <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ota Ecclesia;</hi> say they. The Anabaptists imagined a Church like the Ticke, all body and no head: the Papists haue made a Church like the Toadstoole, all head and no body. What a monster is their Pope, that will bee all in all; eye and tongue, body and head, &amp; taile too? As <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:25651:37"/>
tooke off the head of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and set on another of his owne: so they haue smitten off Christs head, and set on the Pope. Let them take their imaginary head: say we onely to Christ: <hi>Whom haue we in heauen but thee? and on earth none besides thee.</hi> Our dependance be for euer on our <hi>Head</hi> the Lord Iesus.</p>
               <p>Before I leaue this point, I desire to expresse two things: one for distinction, the other for instruction. First for distinction betwixt this <hi>Generall assembly,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches: then for instruction, to shew who bee true members of this Catholike <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The maine difference betweene them consists in this: that the Catholike Church is alwaies inuisible, the members thereof only knowne to God: particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are sometimes inuisible, and lying hid; other times manifest in the open profession of Christs name. As the Moone is eft-soones ecclipsed or clouded, and often shineth in the full.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It lies hid through want of the word preached, and publike administration of the Sacraments. So it was in the dayes of <hi>Elias,</hi> when hee wished to die; <note n="a" place="margin">1. King. 19. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>I onely am left.</hi> Strange Apostacie, when so notable a Prophet could not discerne the Church! yet; vers. 18. <hi>I haue left seuen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, that neuer bowed their knees to Baal.</hi> So it was in the raigne of <hi>Asa;</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">2. Chro. 15. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>For a long season Israel hath bene without the true God without a teaching Priest, and without the Law.</hi> The Papists demand where our Church was before the daies of <hi>Luther:</hi> we answer, that an vniuersall Apostacie was ouer the face of the world, the true Church was not then visible: but the graine of trueth lay hid vnder a great heape of popish chaffe. But this inuisibility doth not proue a nullitie. They cannot impugne the antiquity of our Church, vnlesse they conuince themselues. For the Church of England holds no other doctrin then that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> primarily did hold, and that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> deliuered to them in sacred writing; <hi>Iustification</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:25651:37"/>
onely by the <hi>bloud of Christ.</hi> If they be falne from this, who can blame vs for falling from them? It was high time to leaue them, when they left the Lord Iesus. So long as we preserue the truths antiquity, wee must smile at their fond obiection of nouelty. The Church of God is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, not Romane Catholike: thats iust as foolish a phrase, as the by-word of Kent and Christendome. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and vniuersall are contradictories. If we haue any thing from them, that they had from God; it is our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that we haue kept it, their woe that they haue lost it. <hi>Esau's</hi> blessing and birth-right is lost to himselfe, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto <hi>Iacob.</hi> They haue not so much reason to boast, as we to reioyce.</p>
               <p>Our Church had a substantiall being before, but hath gotten a better being by the repurgation of the Gospell: which is maintained by our Christian Princes, iustly sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Defenders of the ancient Faith.</hi> It was Gods Floore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though full of chaffe: but now since <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 3. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>hee that hath his fanne in his hand</hi> hath purged it, it is clearer in shew and substance. It was before a wedge of pure gold, but vsurped by the hands of Impostors: that by their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and sophistications for gaine and sinister respects, augmented it into a huge body and masse. It had the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of gold still, but mingled with the drosse of traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, superstitions, will-worships. You ask where was the gold? shew vs the place. We answer, it was in that masse: now for extracting and purifying it from the drosse, God gaue vs the touchstone of his word, which made it sound, &amp; manifests it to be sound. The Lord doth not then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his: the time was that the whole world seemed to groan, <hi>factum se videns Arrianum,</hi> beholding it selfe made <hi>Arrian;</hi> yet God had his nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. <hi>Sardis</hi> is said to be dead, <note n="d" place="margin">Reu. 3. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>thou hast a name that thou liuest, but thou art dead:</hi> yet there be <note n="e" place="margin">Vers. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>a few names in Sardis, which haue not defiled their garments.</hi> When ordinary meanes faile, by extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Lord gathers his elect. The Israelites in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:25651:38"/>
wanted both Circumcision and Passeouer, yet GOD made supply by Manna, and the Pillar of the cloud.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Church is visible when it flourisheth: not that the faith and secret election of men is seene; but there are apparant signes by frequenting the Sanctuary, and submitting themselues to the Ministery of the Word. Now this visible Church is a mixt company of men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the faith. I call it mixt, for in it are both belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and hypocrites, corne and tares: it is a band of men, where be some valiant souldiers, and many cowards. It is called a Church from the better, not from the greater part. The vngodly, though they are in the Church, are not of the Church: as the superfluous humours in the veynes are not parts of the body, but rather the sicknesse of it. These professe <hi>veram fidem, sed non verè;</hi> the true faith, but not truly. Hence it appeares, that there be two sorts of members in the Church: members before God, such as beside the outward profession keepe a <hi>pure heart, a good conscience, and faith vnfained.</hi> Members before men, such as haue onely the colour and huske of Religion, in heart <hi>denying the power of godlinesse:</hi> yet these are by vs to be esteemed members, according to the rule of charity iudging the best.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for Instruction, what I haue to say consists in the examination of two points. First, whether the Church of England be a part of this Catholike Church: then next, whether the Church of Rome haue the same prerogatiue.</p>
               <p>For our selues; the most infallible marke of the true Church, is the right ministration of the Sacraments, and sincere Preaching the true Doctrine of the Gospell. That is the true Mother and Spouse of Christ, that brings forth children to him <note n="f" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>of immortall seed, by the Word of GOD which abideth for euer:</hi> not of traditions, miracles, dreames; but of this <hi>incorruptible seed.</hi> And when they are borne
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:25651:38"/>
anew, feedes them with syncere <hi>Milke</hi> out of her tvvo brests, the two Testaments. This you know in your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to be true in our Mother: shee doth not giue vs <hi>pro lacte venenum,</hi> but milke; euen the same that Christ himselfe put into her brests. When we grow strong, shee giues vs <hi>meate,</hi> not bones: troubles vs not with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of the Schooles; that haue <hi>Plus argutiarum quàm doctrinae, plus doctrinae quàm vsus:</hi> but <hi>Quod accepit a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino,</hi> what shee hath receiued of the Lord; neither more nor lesse, but iust weight. She doth not say, <hi>Haec dicit Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> but <hi>Haec dicit Dominus:</hi> not thus saith the Pope in his Decretalls, but thus saith the Lord in his Scriptures. She doth <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 9. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>say the truth in Christ, and lyeth not, her conscience bearing her witnesse in the holy Ghost.</hi> She doth not sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticate truth, not mingle wine with water, not dawbe the walls of Gods house with vntempered morter: not build vpon the foundation straw &amp; stubble: not adulterate the Word; like a lustfull man, whose end is not to encrease mankind, but to satisfie concupiscence. O then let vs hang vpon her lips, that preserue this true knowledge: and say with <hi>Peter;</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 6. 68.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, to whom should we goe? Thou hast the words of eternall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus wee haue prooued the truth of our Church by Scripture: but our aduersaries oppose the sufficiencie of this proofe, by disabling the Scriptures. They say wee cannot know Scripture to be Scripture, but by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church. It is false, for the witnesse of man subiect to error, is nothing to the testimony of GOD that cannot erre. Therefore the Scripture is called the <note n="i" place="margin">Esay 8 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Testimonie,</hi> because it beares witnesse to it selfe. Besides, the Church hath her beginning from the Word, for there can be no Church without faith, no faith without the Word, no Word without the Scriptures. So the Church depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds on the Scripture, not the Scripture on the church. The Lawyer that hath only power to expound the Law, is vnder the Law. But they obiect, that <hi>Faith comes by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:25651:39"/>
                  <hi>hearing,</hi> and hearing by the voice of the Church. <hi>Paul</hi> intends there not that generall faith whereby wee belieue Scripture to be Scripture: but that iustifying faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we attaine saluation. And this comes by the voice of the Church, not of it selfe, but as it is the ministerie of Gods Word. <hi>Iohn</hi> is but <hi>Uox clamantis,</hi> Christ is <hi>Verbum clamans.</hi> Particular Churches haue erred; therefore the best securitie from error is in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>This is a <hi>Lesbian</hi> rule, able to decide all Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and it is <hi>vitio hominum,</hi> by the fault of bad Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that it doth not. For whether <hi>Aliorum incuriâ</hi> that despise it, or <hi>Aliorum iniuriâ</hi> that peruert it, it suffers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, and may not be heard declare it selfe. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist in expounding Scripture after his owne fancie, makes himselfe Iudge, not the Scripture. But all their drift is with Gods losse to promoue the Popes gaine. He must be Iudge, yea he shall be an vnerring Iudge. Yet if the Pope haue this infallibility, I wonder what need there is of Councells. Here they fly to distinctions, as to familiar spirits. The Pope may erre <hi>Argumentatiuè,</hi> not <hi>Definitiuè:</hi> in his chamber, not in his chaire: <hi>Personaliter, non Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter:</hi> as man, not as Pope. How proue they such an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Scripture? Here they fly to the Pope, hee so expounds it. How prooue they the Pope cannot erre? Here straight they fly back againe to Scripture; <hi>Peter, I haue prayed for thee that thy faith shal not faile.</hi> These hang gether like a sick mans dreame. <hi>Insequeris? fugio. Fugis? insequor.</hi> Yet thus they conclude against their own wills; whiles they only proue the Pope by the Scripture, spight of their teeth they preferre the Scripture aboue the Pope.</p>
               <p>If this be so, that the truth of the Gospell being profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, belieued, obeyed among vs, manifest vs against all aduersaries, to be true members of this <hi>Generall assembly:</hi> then two subordinate questions offer themselues collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally here to be handled. First, whether corrupters of our Truth, and disturbers of our peace are to bee tolerated.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:25651:39"/>
Secondly, whether for some corruptions of doctrine, or vices in manners, it be lawfull for any of vs, to make sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from vs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Seditious and pestilent seedsmen of heresies are to be restrained. If <hi>a little leuen sowre the whole lumpe,</hi> what will a little poison do? If <hi>Paul</hi> to his <note n="k" place="margin">Gala. 5. 9.</note> Galatians could not endure <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> together: how would he to his Corinthians, endure <note n="l" place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Belial</hi> together? Hee sticks not to ingeminate Anathema's to them that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched another Gospel. The Papists cry out against vs for persecution: they that shame not to bely the Scriptures, will not blush to bely vs. Their prosperity, their riches, their numbers among vs, directly proue; that a man may be a Papist in England, and liue. But if their religion turne to treason, shall it scape vnpunished? A Papist may liue, a Traitor may not liue. To perswade that a Christian king at the Popes will may, yea must be decrowned or murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: is this the voice of Religion, or Treason? If this be conscience, there is no villany: if such an act merite Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, let no man feare Hell. I would aske a Papist, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be not bound by his religion to execute the Popes doctrinall will: whether if he bid him kill his King, hee may refraine from that sacred bloud, and not sinne. If he refuse treason, he is not constant to his Religion: if hee keepe his Religion, hee must not sticke at any act of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. So that who knowes whether this day a mere Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, may not on the Popes command to morrow be a Traytor?</p>
               <p>But say they, this a supposition as likely as if Heauen should fall: the Pope will neuer command it. I answere, that Popes haue commanded it. But we hope his present Holinesse will not: we were in a pitious case, if our secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie was no better then your hope. God blesse our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soueraigne from euer standing at the Popes mercy. Why should such Seminaries of heresie, and Incendiaries of conspiracie be suffered? What atonement of affection
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:25651:40"/>
can there be in such disparitie of Religion? when some cry, God helpe vs: others, <hi>Baal</hi> heare vs. They to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints, wee to the Lord that made Heauen and Earth. But the euent hath often prooued, which of these could best heare prayers. As in that memorable fight on the Leuant Seas, of fiue English ships against eleuen Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish; they crying for victory to our Lady, wee to our Lord: it seemes, the Sonne heard better then the Mother, for the victory was ours. The Common-vvealth that stands vpon legges, partly of yron, and partly of clay, is neuer sure. One wombe held <hi>Romulus</hi> &amp; <hi>Remus</hi> in peace, one kingdome could not containe them.</p>
               <p>But euery mans mind is as free as the Emperors: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is a Castle, and there is nothing so voluntarie as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: faith comes by perswasion, not by compulsion. Yield all this: and say with <hi>Tertullian; Nihil minus fidei est, quàm fidem cogere.</hi> And with <hi>Bernard; Suspendite ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bera, ostendite vbera.</hi> Make a man in error rather blush, then bleede. But if they breake the foundation, <hi>Non feren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, sed feriendi.</hi> First speake to the Conscience by good counsell: but if that eare be stopt, shake the whole house about it. Speake to the eares of the inheritance, of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, of the body; by mulct, by prison, by exile. Let the Liberty say to the Conscience, For thy sake I am restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: let the Inheritance say, For thy sake I am empoueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: let the Body say, For thy sake I am afflicted. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause heresie dies not with the particular person, but kills also others: and <hi>Centum inficit, dum vnum intersicit.</hi> And because it strikes at the life of a Christian, that is his Faith; <hi>For the iust shal liue by his faith.</hi> Therfore <hi>pereat vnus, potius quàm vnitas.

So strange an Article, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe doubts whether it may bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from Scripture or no: but that the Church hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it so to be.

               <p n="2">2. Whether a separation may bee iustly made from our Church for some errors or corruptions of life. I know that diuers, who were once among vs, neuer of vs, haue put out their owne lights, indeed excommunicated themselues. What's their plea? that our assemblies are full of enormities. I answer, that the defects and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Church must be distinguished: they are eyther in doctrine or in manners. For doctrine, some errors are <hi>Citra fundamentum,</hi> some <hi>Circa fundamentum,</hi> others <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra fundamentum.</hi> Errors <hi>beside</hi> the foundation trouble, errors <hi>about</hi> the foundation shake, errors <hi>against</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ouerturne all. So long then as no foundation is harmed, it is not lawfull depart. vntill the Church se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates from Christ, we must not separate from it. In two cases there is warrant of separation. First, when the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Gods worship is quite corrupted. <note n="n" place="margin">2. Cor, 6. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>What agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> when this is, ver. 17. <hi>Come out from among them, and be ye separate,</hi> saith the Lord, when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had set vp Idols in Israel, <note n="o" place="margin">2. Chr. 11. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>the Priests and the Leuites left their suburbs and possession, and came to Iudah and Ierusalem.</hi> Secondly, when the substance of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:25651:41"/>
doctrine is quite corrupted. <note n="p" place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man consent not to the words of our Lord Iesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godlinesse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>From such, vers. 5. withdraw thy selfe. Paul</hi> in the Synagogue at Ephesus preached for the space of three moneths together. <note n="q" place="margin">Acts 19. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>But when diuers were hardned, and beleeued not, but spake euill of that way, he departed from them, and separated the Disciples.</hi> In these two cases lawfull, not else.</p>
               <p>For corruption in manners, they make not <hi>Nullam Ecclesiam, sed malam ecclesiam;</hi> not no Church, but a bad Church. Wicked Scribes sitting in <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, and teaching the things he wrote, must be heard. <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 23. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatsoeuer they bid you obserue, that obserue and doe: but doe not after their workes.</hi> Separate from their priuate society, not from the publike assembly. But they charge vs, that we deny Christ. I answere, Deniall of Christ is double, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in iudgement or in fact. Deniall of Christ in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, makes a Christian no Christian: denyall in fact, the iudgement being sound, makes him not no Christian, but an euill Christian. When the Iewes had crucified the Lord of life, they remained still a Church, if there were any on the face of the earth: and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was still called the <note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 27. 53.</note>

               <p>Now wee haue proued and approued the truth of our owne Church at home; let vs examine whether the Church of Rome be also a true member of this Catholike <hi>Assembly.</hi> Errors that annihilate a Church, are of two sorts, some weakening, others destroying the foundation. Weakening error is the building of <note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 12.</note>

Those which destroy the foundation, are the ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing errors; by them a Church ceaseth to bee a Church. Yet if an error be against the foundation, we are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the persons; whether they erre of malice, or of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. If of malice, <note n="e" place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 8.</note> like <hi>Iannes and Iambres that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood Moses, resisting the truth;</hi> it is no longer a Church. But if of weakenesse, wee must not so peremptorily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: for <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the Galatians as a Church of God, though they were peruerted to another doctrine; embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a fundamentall error of Iustification by works. The Church of Rome doth wilfully &amp; obstinately destroy the foundation, therfore may be concluded for no Church. If they wil be iustified by the works of the law, they are faln from Grace.</p>

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:25651:42"/>
Let vs heare how they quit themselues. First, they would doe it by retorting all this backe vpon vs: they tell vs flatly, that we are no Church, and thus they prooue it. They say, we haue no Bishops, so no Ministers, so no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, therefore no Church. Here they clappe their wings, and crow, Victory, Victory. <note n="f" place="margin">Esay 9. 21.</note> As <hi>Manasseh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Ephraim, and Ephraim against Manasseh, and both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Iudah.</hi> So they haue set our brothers against vs, vs against our brothers, Papists against vs all. Behold the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent we are in: the Papists say we haue no Ministers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not made by Bishops; the Puritans say we haue no Ministers, because they are made by Bishops. Which of these speake true? Neither. First to answer the Puritan; Bishops may make Ministers: <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to <note n="g" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 22.</note>

                  <hi>For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest ordaine Elders in euery City.</hi> Now we haue true Bishops, therefore in Gods name allow vs to haue true Ministers. For the Romanists, that tell vs vve haue none of these, how strangely do they bely vs, and themselues? <hi>Oportet mendacem esse memorem.</hi> Haue they forgot their obrayding vs, that we haue all our Episcopall rites from them? All our ministeriall orders from them? If we haue it from them, then we haue it. They are <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto's</hi> owne words in his <hi>Motiues:</hi> The Protestants are Apes of the Papists, the Communion-booke is made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together out of the Masse-booke. Why then do they not communicate with vs? It is not for conscience, but for malice. Let it be granted, that wee haue this from them: but then they must grant withall, that <hi>Iacob</hi> by Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing hath gotten <hi>Esau's</hi> Birthright. So the Israelites were faine to go to the Philistines to sharpen their sythes. We abhorre not Episcopall ordinations, but Papall.

Let them keepe their owne, giue vs ours.</p>
               <p>But further they obiect the continuance of their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession. We answere, the succession of Person is nothing worth without the succession of Doctrine; which they want. If it were by vs granted, what neuer shall be by them proued, that <hi>Peter</hi> is succeeded by the Pope: Yet as <hi>Matthias</hi> succeeding <hi>Iudas</hi> was neuer the worse, so the Pope succeeding <hi>Peter</hi> is neuer the better. <hi>Perijt dignitas Cathedrae, quando veritas Doctrinae.</hi> But they say that in the Romane Church, Baptisme is rightly for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it administred; therefore it is a true Church. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they haue the outward washing, but quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne the inward; which stands in iustification by the imputed righteousnesse of Christ. But the Samaritans had Circumcision, yet were they not a true Church. Baptisme seuered from the preaching of the Gospel, is of no more force, then a seale when it is plucked off from the Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Indeed truly, though they haue Baptisme, yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to them, but to a hidden Church among them. For doubtlesse God hath his chosen and sealed number in the midst of those Apostates. As the light in the Lanthorn belongs not properly to the Lanthorne, but to the Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. That Sacrament in the assembly of Rome, is like a true mans purse in a thiefes hand: it no more proues them a true Church, then that purse prooues the theefe a true man. The Lord of his goodnesse, that hath giuen them the signe of the Grace, giue them also the grace of the signe, true vvashing away of their sinnes in the bloud of Christ.</p>
               <p>Some haue obiected, and they seeme to be kind friends to Rome: that Antichrist must sit in the <hi>Temple,</hi> that is the Church: therefore this sitting of Antichrist in Rome, proues them to be a true Church. But I am sure by this argument what they get in the hundred, they lose in the Shire: they may put these gaines in their eye. I hope they will not confesse their Pope Antichrist, to haue vs grant
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:25651:43"/>
them a true Church. Therefore some of them haue affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Hominem non Christianum posse esse Romanum Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficem.</hi> And would not hee be a strange <hi>Head</hi> of Christs Church, that is not a true member of Christs <hi>Body?</hi> But howsoeuer, their argument holds not: for it is one thing to be in the Church, another thing to be of the Church. Antichrist sits in that place, not as a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the Church, but as an Vsurper. So the Pyrate sits in the Merchants ship, yet hath no right to it. All that can be prooued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is, that among the Papists there is a hidden Church, in the midst whereof Antichrist dominereth, but hath no part of saluation in it. What cause then haue we to blesse our GOD, that hath brought vs from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> out of darknesse into his maruelous light, from the Romish Synagogue to the <hi>Generall Assembly, and Church of the first borne vvhich are vvritten in Heauen?</hi> and the Lord of his mercie preserue vs in it for euer and euer.</p>
               <p>To conclude, there be diuerse Censures of the Romane Church. Some say it is no Church, but <hi>Aequiuocè;</hi> as the picture of a man is called a man: or a painted fire, a fire. It is no more a Church, then the carkase of a dead man, that hath on a liuing mans garments, is a liuing man, looke it neuer so like him. These looke vpon it <hi>Oculo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, sed seuero:</hi> with a true, but a sharpe eye. Others say, It is <hi>non sanum membrum, sed membrum:</hi> It is not a sound member, but a member. It hath Scriptures, but corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Traditions: but indeed they haue nullified the natiue sense; and so are Lanthornes that shew light to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, none to themselues. They haue the Articles of the Creed, and make the same generall confession of faith: yet ouerthrow all this another way. Herein they are like a fond Father, that with much indulgence tenders the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his child, would not suffer the cold wind to blowe vpon him, yet by secret conueyances inwardly infects the heart, &amp; destroyes him. Thus they say, it is still a member,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:25651:44"/>
still a Church; as a braine-sick man is a man. The Romane Assembly is <hi>Verè Ecclesia, sed non vera Ecclesia:</hi> truely a Church, but not a true Church. A leprous man is a man: <hi>Adultera vxor, tamen vxor est:</hi> an adulterous wife is still a wife. So <hi>Duraus. In Papatu est Ecclesia, et Papatus non est Ecclesia. Vt Ecclesia Dei, vt Papalis Diaboli.</hi> In Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is a Church, yet Popery is not the Church. As it is a Church, it is of God; as Popish, of the diuell. It is <hi>Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata Ecclesia,</hi> an incurable Church, that <hi>hates to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:</hi> therefore no Church. <hi>Wee would haue cured Babel, but she would not be cured.</hi> She hath apostated into treason, clipped <hi>Regiam monetam,</hi> the great Kings coine, the Word of God: turned that pure gold into sophisticate Alchimy: prayer to Christ, into inuocation of Saints. These men conclude, that it is not a body diseased, &amp; full of wounds, that hath the throat cut, yet with some life and breath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining: but a rotten and dead carkase, void of spirituall life. It hath blended Iudaisme and Paganisme together with Christianitie, and so sweld vp a superstitious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God; therefore no Church.</p>
               <p>For my part I iudge not: GOD reserues to himselfe three things; The reuenge of iniuries, The glory of deeds, The iudgement of secrets. I will not iudge, but like a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse giue in my testimony. And here <hi>Qui bene distinguit, bene docet.</hi> The best construction is that which enclines to charitie: that is, there is no probable saluation in the <note place="margin">Zanch.</note> Church of Rome. Infants dying before they come to these errors, I beleeue saued: for others, <hi>Nescio quid dicere;</hi> I know not what to say. They haue damnable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, as that of Free will, of Merites, &amp;c. yet the persons that of weakenesse defend them, may be saued. God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons euen wilfull errors, if they be truly repented. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I belieue that many of our forefathers went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, though through blindnesse. Now indeede they are more inexcusable, because our sound is gone out among them. There are <hi>Seducentes</hi> and <hi>Seducti:</hi> the wilfull blind

lead the wofull blind, vntill both fall into the ditch. If they will not see, there is no helpe, no hope. If simple ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance mislead, there is hope of return: but if affected, it is most wretched. Our office is to helpe them with our prayers: and let vs pray for them as <hi>Paul</hi> for his Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; <hi>That the eyes of our vnderstanding beeing enlightened,</hi>

                  <hi>they may know what is the hope of Gods calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance is in the Saints.</hi> Many of them haue ready hearts, but they want eyes: wee haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen eyes, God grant vs ready hearts.</p>

Christ, to whom that Name is by speciall title and right giuen. <hi>Primogenitus inter multos fratres,</hi> saith <hi>Paul:</hi> he is the <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note>

                  <hi>first borne</hi> from the dead. He is the <hi>first borne,</hi> as he is the Sonne of God, and as hee is man. As he is the Sonne of God, in respect of time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, the beginning of all: in respect of dignity, because hee is the foundation of all good to his Church. <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Of his fulnesse haue we all receiued, and grace for grace.</hi> As he is man, he is the <hi>first borne,</hi> not in respect of time, but of excellency and vertue. In respect of his miraculous conception; the <hi>first</hi> that euer was conceiued without sinne, and <note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 1. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>by the ouershadowing of the holy Ghost.</hi> In res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of his birth, he was the <hi>first borue</hi> of <hi>Mary.</hi>

                  <hi>Shee brought forth her first borne Sonne, and called his name Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi> In respect of his resurrection; when GOD raised him out of the graue, he is said to <hi>beget his Sonne.</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day haue I begotten thee.</hi> And lest the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of birth onely should be deduced from that place, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expressely applies it to his resurrection. Acts 13. 33. <hi>God raised vp Iesus againe, as it is written in the second Psalme; Thou art my Sonne, this day haue I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee.</hi> Lastly, in respect of his preeminence: <note n="h" place="margin">Col. 1. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>hee is the first borne from the dead, that in all things he might haue the preeminence.</hi> So the priuiledge of primogeniture is singularly and indiuidually his.</p>
               <p>How then are the faithfull heere called the <hi>first borne?</hi> To answer this, we must know that God hath sonnes by nature, and by grace. Christ by nature onely, all the elect by grace. Christ is a Sonne begotten, not made; we are sonnes made, not begotten in respect of nature. Christ as God is begotten, not borne: as man he is borne, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. We see the priuiledge of Christs primogeniture: from his let vs looke to ours, for from him wee haue it. The elect are called <hi>First-borne</hi> in three respects.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:25651:45"/>
1. Because they are vnited to the first borne. <note n="i" place="margin">Hebr. 2. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>For both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren.</hi> Hee that is made <hi>vnus cum primogenito,</hi> may be well called <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenitus:</hi> one with the first borne is a first borne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because they are culled and called out of the world. Many wicked are created before them, but they are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Gods decree to life before the other; for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are not chosen at all. <hi>Esau</hi> was <hi>Isaaks</hi> first borne, but <hi>Iacob</hi> was Gods first borne. Many of the worlds first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne haue beene reiected. <note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 48. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Israel</hi> laid his <hi>right hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ephraim</hi> the younger, and his <hi>left vpon Manasseh</hi> the elder. <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 49. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Reuben, thou art my first borne, but thou shalt not be excellent. Cain Adams</hi> first borne; <hi>Ismael, Abrahams</hi> first borne, were cast off. <note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 4. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my sonne, euen my first borne.</hi> The Lord had first chosen that nation to be his people, yet afterward reiected them, and accepted the Gentiles: so that <hi>the elder serue the younger.</hi> But Gods first borne are neuer refused: whom hee hath <hi>predestinated</hi> to be <hi>sonnes,</hi> hee hath also <hi>called to bee heyres.</hi> So that this primogeniture is not in respect of generation, but of regeneration. Though they be not <hi>primò conditi,</hi> they are <hi>primò reconditi.</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Iohn 1. 13.</note>

                  <note n="o" place="margin">Iam. 1. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Of his owne will begate he vs, with the word of trueth, that wee should be a kinde of first fruits of his creatures.</hi> The Spirit begets of <hi>immortall seed,</hi> grace; in the wombe of the Church; the meanes of this <hi>Birth</hi> being the Word. <note n="p" place="margin">Iohn. 3. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be borne againe, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</hi> Out of that vniuersall apostacie God sent his Sonne, to beget some first borne to himselfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because the priuiledges of the first borne are theirs. These were many, as we may find in allusion to the Law. 1. The excellency of strength: <note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 49. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Reuben my first borne, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and the excellencie of power.</hi> Man decayes, and the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:25651:46"/>
children of age are not so strong as the children of youth: therefore the <hi>first borne</hi> are called the <hi>beginning of power,</hi> and the <hi>excellency of strength.</hi> True it is, that there's no decay in Gods Spirit that begets: yet because the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are first in Gods intention of fauour, and hee giues them that strength of grace to resist sinne, and to serue him, which the world hath not; therefore they are called his <hi>Firstborne,</hi> the excellency of his power. Though we be weake in our selues, yet his strength is glorified in our weakenes, his <note n="r" place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Grace is sufficient for vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The name of the family was giuen to the first borne. <note n="s" place="margin">1. Sam. 9. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Is not my family the least of all the families of the Tribe of Beniamin,</hi> saith <hi>Saul?</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Iudg. 11. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Gilead</hi> made his whole family to be called <hi>Gileadites.</hi> For further exemplying of this priuiledge, read Numbers. chap. 26. ver. 23. to ver. 52. Is this dignity lost vnder the Gospell to the first borne in Christ? no, for euen the wicked dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the righteous, are for their sakes vouchsafed the name of <hi>Christians.</hi> The name of the <hi>first borne</hi> hath <hi>christned</hi> all the familie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Priesthood and the right to sacrifice. <note n="u" place="margin">Exod. 24. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses sent twelue young men, according to the twelue tribes of Israel, to offer burnt offerings, and sacrifice peace offerings vnto the Lord.</hi> Those young men are thought to bee no other, but twelue of the <hi>first borne</hi> of the chiefe of the Tribes: to whom the right of sacrificing &amp; Priesthood did belong, till the Leuites were separated for that end. <note n="x" place="margin">Num. 3. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>Take the Leuites in stead of all the first borne among the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> Neither is this priuiledge lost by the Gospel: <note n="y" place="margin">Reu. 1. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ hath made vs Kings and Priests vnto God his Father;</hi> to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp spirituall sacrifice of thanksgiuing to him. Priests, but <hi>Priests to God;</hi> lest the Schismaticke should take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage thereby to trouble the ciuill state. The Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory sacrifice is offered for vs by our high Priest <hi>Iesus:</hi> the sacrifices of our Priesthood are onely gratulatory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Double portion. <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 21. 17.</note> If a man haue two wiues, one
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:25651:46"/>
beloued, and another hated, and children by them both: <hi>if the first borne sonne be hers that is hated,</hi> yet when he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his sonnes to inherit, though perhaps hee would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the sonne of the loued, yet <hi>hee shall acknowledge the sonne of the hated, by giuing him a double portion of all that he hath: for hee is the beginning of his strength, the right of the first borne is his.</hi> So the elect haue a double portion: not onely a share in the things of this life, but much more in heauen. <note n="b" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Godlinesse hath the promise both of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> It is a false imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God makes none of his children happy in this life. <hi>Abraham</hi> was rich, <hi>Dauid</hi> a King. But if he denies them opulencie, hee neuer denies them content. This is the cheefe riches; for we see others <hi>Esurientes in popina;</hi> as the by-word is, staruing in a Cookes shop, wretched in their highest fortunes. The godly haue so much share of this world, as may stand with their eternall blessednesse in the world to come. And such may bee content with a small portion here, that are sure of the inheritance heereafter. <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> gaue great gifts of siluer and gold, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, to all his children: <note n="c" place="margin">2. Chr. 21. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>but the kingdome hee gaue to Iehoram, because he was the first borne.</hi> Our Law giues the first borne sonne the inheritance: God will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue his of it. Thus hath Christ promised a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the faithfull; <note n="d" place="margin">Mark. 10. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>He shall receiue an hundred fold now in this time, and in the world to come eternall life.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Birth-right with the Iewes was a type of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life. The consideration of this excellent priuiledge doth teach vs three lessons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we are dedicated to God. Exod. 13. 2. Numb. 3. 13. <hi>Sanctifie to me all the first borne.</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">1. Sam. 1. 28.</note> So <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>nah</hi> dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated her first borne <hi>Samuel</hi> to the Lord. <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 2. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Mary</hi> brought Christ to <hi>Ierusalem, to present him to the Lord; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law; Euery male that openeth the wombe, shall be called holy to the Lord.</hi> To robbe God of his tythes is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge; but to take away from him our soules, this is the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:25651:47"/>
highest sacriledge. In this we haue a sequestration from common vse, we are no longer as we were. <hi>They are mine,</hi> saith the Lord: not onely by a common right, so al things are his. <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulnesse of it.</hi> nor onely for a gratefull acknowledgement, that the increase of all things comes from him. But as the Israelites were Gods by a speciall claime; because he preserued them in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, when the first borne were slaine. For whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption he accepted the first borne of their beasts: when he might haue commanded all, lest this should seem grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to them, he required but the first part. Hee onely reserued what he preserued. So we were all by nature in as much danger of Gods wrath, as were the Israelites of the destroying Angell when the first borne of the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were smitten dead. But the Lord sprinkled the dores of our hearts with the bloud of his holy Lambe <hi>Iesus.</hi> Hath the Lord spared vs? then hee chalengeth vs. To take from man his owne is iniurious, from God sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious. <note n="g" place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Glorifie God in your body, and in your spirit.</hi> why? <hi>for they are Gods, ye are not your owne,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle. Thus hee confessed himselfe not his owne man: <note n="h" place="margin">Acts 27. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>There stood by me this night the Angell of God, whose I am, and whom I serue.</hi> Wee are Gods possession, the first borne which he hath redeemed by his owne <hi>First-borne,</hi> Christ. This wee acknowledge when wee present our children to God in Baptisme. Yet O strange and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full inconstancy! when wee haue giuen them to God in baptisme, by a foolish indulgence wee take them away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in education. A Prince abhorres to haue his eldest sonne marry with a harlot; this were to vilifie and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that royall bloud. And shall God brooke his First borne to be contracted with that vgly strumpet, Sinne? This were to forfeit and make void the right of primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seeing we are Gods first borne, let vs offer our first and best things to him. The Lord hath deserued the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:25651:47"/>
of our seruice: <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>First seeke the kingdome of God, and the righteousnesse thereof.</hi> Our first studies, our first labours must bee consecrated to God. The Law required three properties in the sacrifices offered to God. 1. They must be first borne: <hi>vt illi reddamus prima, qui nobis debil omnia:</hi> that vvee should vvillingly giue him the first, that had bountifully giuen vs all. So vve must giue the first houre of the day, the first vvorke of our hands, the first wordes of our lips to the Lord. 2. They must bee cleane beasts, for God abhorred the vncleane, maimed, or deformed. <note n="k" place="margin">Mal. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye offer polluted bread vpon mine Altar. If ye offer the blinde for sacrifice, is it not euill? if ye offer the lame &amp; sicke, is it not euill? offer it now to the gouernor, will hee be pleased with it?</hi> So vvee must hold vp to God <hi>cleane hands,</hi> and send vp <hi>pure hearts:</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Hebr. 12. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>making straight paths for our feete, lest that which is halting be turned out of the way.</hi> 3. The sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices must be Males, because the best and most perfect things are to be giuen to God. <hi>Multi homines, pauci viri.</hi> Let vs offer vp our masculine vertues, <note n="m" place="margin">Eph. 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>growing to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man,</hi> to the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ. We must aime at this perfect sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Besides in the Law there were three other rules obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable in the consecration of the first borne. 1. That they should be seuen daies with the damme, and the eight day be giuen to God. Exod. 22. 30. wherein there vvas not onely a respondence to the rule of circumcision, limited to the eight day, Gen. 17. 12. But to preuent their fraud in offering to God things of no seruice, being too soone taken from the damme. 2. In voluntary oblations they were forbidden to dedicate to the Lord any of the first borne. <note n="n" place="margin">Leuit. 27. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>The firstling of the beasts which should be the Lords firstling, no man shall sanctifie it.</hi> The reason is, because that vvas <hi>the Lords</hi> already. Wee haue such names highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded on our Hospitall-walls, painted on the windowes of our Churches, often engrauen in marble the memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tenent of worthy acts, for excellent benefactors. Yet
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:25651:48"/>
All their beneuolence to God, is not the Tenth of that they haue robbed God, &amp; taken from his Church. Foole, giue of thine owne, if thou wilt haue reward in Heauen: first restore iustly what thou hast gathered vniustly.

               <p>There be some, 1. that sell their Birthright: it is said of the Lawyer that hee hath <hi>linguam venalem,</hi> a saleable tongue: the couetous <hi>venalem animam,</hi> a saleable soule: the harlot <hi>venalem carnem:</hi> a saleable flesh. <hi>Esau sold</hi> his birthright, <hi>Ahab sold himselfe</hi> to worke wickednesse, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das sold</hi> his soule for thirty peeces. <note n="u" place="margin">Eccle. 10. 9.</note>

They seeme to make conscience of their waies generally, and to be good husbands of their talents: but when an opportune temptation comes, with meat in the mouth; a fit aduantage of much wealth, of high honour, of secret pleasure; they will embrace and fasten on it, though they pawne their soules for a season. And indeed he that knowingly ventures to sin, doth as it were mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his birthright, puts it to the hazard of redeeming by repentance. But it is dangerous to be a Marchant ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in this case: the birthright is precious, if that infernall Broker get but a colour of title in it, hee will vse tricks to make thee breake thy day, and then sue out a Iudgement against thee. 3. Some lose their Birthright; profane and negligent wretches, that leaue their soule perpetually vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded, vnregarded. They may be carefull about many things, but one thing is necessary, to keepe their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. While they sleepe, the <hi>enemy sowes tares:</hi> it is a

Malice giues it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and hath nothing for it. The Ambitious bargaines to haue a little honour for his Birthright, the Couetous to haue some gold for his birthright, the voluptuous to haue some sensuall pleasure for his birthright: but the malicious giues it away for nothing, except it be vexation, that doth anguish him, and languish him. The desperate destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his body, giues away his birthright: hee hath nought for it but horrors within, and terrors without. These men serue the diuels turne for nothing. Looke O miserable man vpon the Purchaser of thy Birthright Christ, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the price it cost him: if thou sell that for a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that he bought with so much paine, thou thinkest him an idle Marchant.

So doth God, not that he needes any booke of remembrance, but because all things are present with him, as if they were written in a booke. They among men which are chosen to any speciall place or seruice, are written in a booke: so the Romane Senators were called <hi>Patres conscripti:</hi> and it is called the Muster-booke, wherein stand the names
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:25651:50"/>
of the Souldiers pressed to the warres. To conclude, this <hi>writing in heauen,</hi> is the booke of Election, wherein all that shall be saued, are registred.</p>
               <p>Here vnauoydably wee come to the maine question, that may seeme to infringe this happy priuiledge of the Church. Whether to be written in Heauen be an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble assurance of saluation: or whether any there registred may come to be blotted out. The truth is, that none <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> in heauen can euer be lost; yet they obiect against it, Psal. 69. 28. <hi>Let them be blotted out of the booke of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and let them not be written among the righteous.</hi> Hence they inferre, that some names once there recorded, are afterwards put out. But this opinion casteth a double a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersion vpon God himselfe. Either it makes him igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of future things, as if he foresaw not the end of elect and reprobate, and so were deceiued in decreeing some to be saued, that shal not be saued. Or that his decree is muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in excluding those vpon their sinnes, vvhom he hath formerly chosen. From both these weakenesses S. <hi>Paul</hi> vindicates him. 2. Tim. 2. 19. <hi>The foundation of GOD standeth sure, hauing the seale, The Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> First, the Lord <hi>knowes</hi> them that are his; this were not true if Gods Prescience could be deluded. Then his <hi>foundation stands sure:</hi> but that were no sure foundation, if those hee hath decreed to be his, should afterward fall out not to bee his. The very Conclusion of truth is this; <hi>Impossibilis est deletio:</hi> they vvhich are <hi>vvritten in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> can neuer come into hell. To cleare this from the opposed doubt, among many I will cull out three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per distinctions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One may be said to be written in heauen <hi>simpliciter,</hi> and <hi>secundum quid.</hi> Hee that is simply written there, <hi>In quantum praedestinatus ad vitam,</hi> because elected to life, can neuer be blotted out. Hee that is but written after a sort, may; for hee is written <hi>Non secundum Dei praescien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, sed secundum praesentem iustitiam:</hi> not according to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:25651:51"/>
Gods former decree, but according to their present righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. So they are said to be blotted out, not in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Gods knowledge: for hee knowes they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer written there; but according to their present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, apostating from grace to sinne. <hi>Lyran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Some are blotted out, <hi>non secundum rei veritatem, sed hominum opinionem:</hi> not according to the truth of the thing, but according to mens opinion. It is vsuall in the Scriptures, to say a thing is done, <hi>quando innotescat fieri,</hi> when it is declared to bee done. Hypocrites haue a simulation of outward sanctitie, so that men in charity iudge them to be written in heauen. But when those gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering starres appeare to be onely <hi>Ignes fatui,</hi> foolish me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors; and fall from the firmament of the Church; then we say they are blotted out. The <hi>written ex existentiâ,</hi> by a perfect being, neuer lost; but <hi>ex apparentiâ,</hi> by a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled appearance, may. Some God so writes, <hi>In se vt simpliciter habituri vitam;</hi> that they haue life simply in themselues, though not of themselues. Others hee so writes, <hi>vt habeant non in se, sed in sua causa;</hi> from which falling they are said to be obliterated. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayes, wee must not so take it, that God first writes, and then dasheth out. For if a <hi>Pilate</hi> could say, <hi>Quod scripsi, scripsi; what I haue written, I haue written;</hi> and it shall stand. Shall God say, <hi>Quod scripsi expungam,</hi> what I haue written I will wipe out, and it stall not stand? They are written then <hi>Secundum spem ipsorum, qui ibi se scriptos putabant;</hi> according to their owne hope that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed their names there. And are blotted out, <hi>Quando ipsis constet illos non ibi fuisse;</hi> when it is manifest to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues that their names neuer had any such honour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. This euen that Psalme strengthens, whence they fetch their opposition. <note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 69. 28.</note>

               <p>But how then shall wee iustifie <hi>Moses</hi> his desire? <note n="r" place="margin">Exod. 32. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou wilt forgiue their sinne,</hi> faire and good: <hi>but if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy booke, which thou hast written.</hi> Did <hi>Moses</hi> wish an impossibility? Some opinionate, that this was not the booke of life that <hi>Moses</hi> meant: but they erre. 1. Some by this vnderstand the booke of the Law: as if this were his meaning. If thou destroy the people to whom thou hast giuen the Law, let not my name be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as the Law giuer. But it is answered. 1. that the booke of the Law was not yet written; and he could not desire blotting forth of a booke that was not. 2. This was in <hi>Moses</hi> his power when he wrote the Law, to leaue out his owne name; he needed not to trouble God about it. 3. He opposeth the greatest losse he could sustaine, against the greatest benefit the people could obtaine: but this was no great losse to bee blotted out of that booke. 4. <hi>Moses</hi> speakes of a booke that God had written: but the booke of the Law, sauing onely the Decalogue, <hi>Moses</hi> wrote himselfe. 2. <hi>Ierome</hi> vnderstands this desire of <hi>Moses</hi> for death in this life; <hi>Perire in praesentem, non in perpetuum.</hi> But if he conceiues no more then a temporall death, Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere confutes it; <hi>Whosoeuer hath sinned against mee, him will I blot out.</hi> ver. 33. Onely sinners are raced out of this booke; but from the booke of terrene life, both sinners and iust come to be blotted: for good and bad are subiect to temporall death. 3. <hi>Caietan</hi> vnderstands it <hi>De libro Principatus in hac vita,</hi> to be the booke of Soueraignty: because it is decreed by God as in a booke, <hi>quòd isti vel illi principentur:</hi> that this or that man should haue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. But God answeres, onely sinners are raced out of the booke: but in the booke of gouernment are bad Kings, so well as good. And for that booke, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 9. as if he wished no more, but not to be counted of Israel; or haue his name among the Patriarchs and Prophets. If
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:25651:52"/>
Israel had perished, the booke of his Couenant with Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael had also perished. So for that booke of <hi>Iasher.</hi> Iosh. 10. 13. it is thought to be lost; therefore no great matter to be put out of it. It must needs bee then the booke of life, and how could <hi>Moses</hi> wish a <hi>racing</hi> out of that booke?</p>
               <p>Some say, that by sinne a man may come to be blotted out of that booke, wherein he thought himselfe written. But if it could not be done without sinne, this constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were to make <hi>Moses Petere peccare mortaliter;</hi> to beg power to sinne mortally, that hee might bee blotted out. Neyther doth God for vnrighteousnesse race out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but indeed they race out themselues. Some take it to be a parabolicall speech, to shew the intention of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. As <hi>Rachel</hi> said to <hi>Iacob,</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Gen. 30. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Giue mee children, or else I die.</hi> Yet she had rather liue and haue no children, then haue children and presently dye. As if one should say; Do this, or else kill me: yet he had rather haue the thing omitted, then himselfe killed. <hi>Tostat.</hi> But this were to make <hi>Moses</hi> speake one thing, &amp; meane another: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he desired it from his heart. Others thinke <hi>Moses</hi> spake affirmatiuely, after this sense: that if God would not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the peoples sinne, it would follow that himselfe should be blotted out. <hi>Rupert.</hi> But this had been against the iustice of God, that one should be damned for the sinne of another. Againe this had conuinced <hi>Moses</hi> of wauering and doubtfulnesse of his saluation: but the faithfull haue confidence, that though thousands should perish, yet they are sure of eternall blisse.</p>
               <p>Some say, <hi>Moses</hi> wished this after the disposition of the inferiour part of his soule; and not <hi>in voluntate ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem superiorem sequente;</hi> not in that will which is gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by reason. They exemplifie it in Christ, who desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>cup to passe from him,</hi> yet <hi>simpliciter vellet pati,</hi> sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply he would suffer. But there is great difference in the example. 1. Christ eschewes death, <hi>Moses</hi> ensues death:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:25651:52"/>
the obiect of their desires was vnlike. 2. Christ by his office was to beare the sinne and punishment of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <hi>Moses</hi> was neuer called to such a mediatorship. 3. Christ prayeth there as a man: for as God hee prayeth not, but is prayed to. There is <hi>Duplex affectus, Mentis &amp; Sensus.</hi> Christ in the affection of his minde was willing to suffer, but in his affection of Sense he desired the cup to passe. So that in Christ to escape death, was a naturall desire: in <hi>Moses</hi> to wish death, yea an eternall death, was a contranaturall desire: it proceeded not from the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall part, but from his inward feeling and meditation.</p>
               <p>Others thinke hee prayed, <hi>quia turbatus erat,</hi> being troubled: not considering at that instant whether that was possible that he begged. <hi>

But this is against the rule of charity: for though anothers soule be dearer to me then my owne body: yet my owne soule ought to be dearer vnto me then all mens soules in the world. yea if all the soules of the Saints; yea of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her selfe, should perish, except my soule perished for them: saith <hi>Tostatus: Citius deberem eligere omnes illas perire quàm animam meam.</hi> I ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to chuse to saue my owne soule, then all theirs.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the most and best rest vpon this sense. Because the saluation of Israel was ioyned with the glory of God: both in respect of the promises made to the Fathers, which was not for his honour to frustrate: and to preuent the blasphemies of the enemies insulting on their ruine; <hi>God hath forsaken his people: Moses ante omnia gloriam Deispecta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:25651:53"/>
Precious to vs is the saluation of others, more precious the saluation of our selues, but most precious of all is the glory of God. Such a wish as this great Prophet of the olde Testament, had that great Apostle of the new. <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>I could wish my-selfe accursed from Christ, for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh.</hi> They say, to cleare both these desires from sinne, there is no other solution but this: that both of them for Gods glory in Israels safety desired a separation from glory for a time, not damnation of body and soule for euer. Howsoeuer, there was some difference in their wishes. <hi>Chrys. Moses</hi> wished <hi>Perire cum caeteris, Paul perire pro caeteris. Moses cum pereuntibus, Paulus ne pereant. Moses</hi> desired to perish with them that perished: <hi>Paul</hi> desired to perish, that they might not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. But the aime of both was the Lords glory, and the peoples safety. Their zeale was ineffable, their example inimitable, their affection vnmatchable. Yet thus farre desirable, that all Ministers, like <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> zealous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeke their peoples saluation. And I am perswaded, that a Parent doth not more earnestly desire the welfare of his childe, then doth a good Minister the sauing of his flocke. What we desire for you, doe you labor for your selues, and the Lord Iesus worke for vs all.</p>
               <p>There be some that would haue it granted, that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did sinne in those wishes; and the concession thereof doth safely end all controuersie. I see no preiudice in this answere, for the best Saints liuing haue had their weakenesses. But if you please after all these, to admitte also the hearing of my opinion. Mine I call it, because I neuer read or heard any yet giue it: I call it an opinion, because <hi>vnusquis<expan>

By this <hi>Booke</hi> I thinke he meanes Gods fauour: as we vsually say, to be in a mans fauour, is to be in his bookes. We speake of one that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblingly cousoned vs, such a man shall neuer come in my bookes. For you will not enter that man into your
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:25651:53"/>
booke, whom you doe not both trust and fauour. To be blotted out of Gods booke, is to bee liable to his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, subiectuall to his iudgements. Now I cannot bee perswaded, that <hi>Moses</hi> euer imagined God would eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally destroy Israel: therefore nor did he beg eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to himselfe. Hee wished no more to himselfe, then he feared to them. But it is expresly set downe, ver. 14. that God would not cast away <hi>Israel</hi> to euerlasting perdition. <hi>The Lord repented of the euill, which hee thought to doe vnto his people.</hi> But thus; Lord, if they must needs vndergoe thy wrath and seuere punishment for their sin, so punish me in the same measure that haue not sinned. If thou wilt not fauour them, forget to fauour me: let mee feele thy hand with them. It was not then euerlasting damnation, that hee eyther feared to them, or desired to himselfe: but onely the desertion of Gods present loue and good pleasure to him, together with subiection to his iudgements; whereof they should taste so deepely, as if God had neuer booked them for his owne. This seemes to be the true sense by Gods answere; <hi>Those that haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I will blot out of my booke.</hi> The offenders shall smart, they that haue sinned shall bee punished. So <hi>Dauid</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saints felt grieuous impositions, though they neuer perished, but were ordained to eternall life.</p>
               <p>To conclude, they that are <hi>written in heauen</hi> can neuer be lost. Woe then to that Religion, which teacheth euen the best Saint to doubt of his saluation while hee liueth. Hath Christ said, Beleeue: and shall man say, Doubt? This is a racke and strappado to the conscience: for hee that doubteth of his saluation, doubteth of Gods loue: and he that doubteth of Gods loue, cannot heartily loue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. If this loue be wanting, it is not possible to haue true peace. O the terrors of this troubled conscience! It is like an Ague, it may haue intermission, but the fit will come and shake him. An vntoward beast is a trouble to a man, an vnto ward seruant a great trouble, an vntoward
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:25651:54"/>
wife a greater trouble, but the greatest trouble of all is an vntoward conscience. <note n="u" place="margin">Psal. 32. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed is the man whose sinnes are forgiuen:</hi> where there is no remission of sinnes, there is no blessednesse. Now there is no true blessednesse but that is enioyed, and none is enioyed vnlesse it be felt, and it cannot be felt vnlesse it be possessed, and it is not posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnlesse a man know it, and how does he know it, that doubts whether he hath it or not?</p>
               <p>All soules are passengers in this world, our way is in the middle of the sea: we haue no sure footing: which way soeuer we cast our eyes, wee see nothing but deepe waters, the Deuill and our owne flesh raising vp against vs infinite stormes. God directs vs to Christ, as to a sure Anchor-hold, he bids vs vndoe our Cables, and fling vp our Anchors in the vaile, fasten them vpon Iesus: we doe so and are safe. But a sister of ours passing in the shippe with vs, that hath long taken vpon her to rule the helme, deales vnkindly with vs; shee cuts in pieces our Cables, throwes away our Anchors, and tels vs wee may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to fasten them on the Rocke, our Mediatour.

No, they that are <hi>written</hi> in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall leaues of heauen, shall neuer be wrapped in the clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy sheetes of darkenes. A man may haue his name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Chronicles, yet lost: written in durable marble, yet perish: written on a monument equall to a <hi>Colossus,</hi> yet be ignominious: written on the Hospitall-gates, yet goe to hell: written on his own house, yet another come to possesse it. All these are but writings in the dnst, or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vvaters; where the characters perish so soone as they are made. They no more proue a man happy, then the foole could proue <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> a Saint, because his name was written in the Creed. But they that be <hi>written

               <p>Now to apply all this vsefully to our selues; some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would be satisfied how wee may know our names <hi>written in heauen.</hi> It is certaine that no eye hath looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods booke, yet himselfe hath allowed certaine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and proofes, whereby wee haue more then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecturall knowledge. The principall is the <hi>Testimonie of Gods Spirit</hi> concurring with <hi>our spirit.</hi> Rom. 8. 16. But of this I haue liberally spoken in some later passages of this booke; together with the most pregnant signes of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Here therefore I am straightned to insert onely some (there omitted) effects. Which are these foure; If our hearts be on Gods booke, If the poore be in our booke, If wee well order the booke of our conscience, Lastly, if we can write our selues holy in earth, then be bold we are <hi>vvritten</hi> happy <hi>in heauen.</hi>

                  <hi>thy conuersation is in heauen.</hi> A Senator relating to his sonne the great honours decreed to a number of Souldiers,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:25651:56"/>
whose names vvere written in a booke: the sonne was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate to see that booke. The father shewes him the outside; it seemed so glorious that he desired him to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it: No, it was sealed by the Councell. Then saith the sonne, tell me if my name be there: the father replyes, the names are secreted to the Senate. The son studying how he might get some satisfaction, desired him to deliuer the merits of those inscribed Souldiers. The father relates to him their noble atchieuements, and worthy actions of valour, wherewith they had eternized their names. Such are written, and none but such must be written in this booke. The sonne consulting with his owne heart, that he had no such trophies to shew; but had spent his time in courting Ladies, rather then encountring Knights; that he was better for a dance then a march: that he knew no drumme but the tabret, no courage but to be drunke. Hereupon he presently retyr'd himselfe, repented, entred into a combate with his owne affections: subdued them, became temperate, continent, valiant, vertuous. VVhen the Souldiers came to receiue their wreathes, he steps in to challenge one for himselfe. Being asked, vpon vvhat title; he answered, If honours be giuen to Conquerers, I haue gotten the most noble conquest of all. Wherein? These haue subdued strange foes, but I haue conquered my selfe: and indeed this is iudged the greatest victory. The application is familiar: thou desirest to know whose names are written in blessednes, it shall not be told thee, This or that indiuiduall person: but generally thus, men so qualified: faithfull in Christ, and to Christ: obedient to the truth, and for the truth: that haue subiected their owne affections, and resigned themselues to the guidance of the heauenly will: these men haue made noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, and shall haue Princely Crownes: find in thy selfe this sanctimony, and thou hast a sure testimonie: thou art <hi>written in heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all men challenge this: they beleeue and obey, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:25651:56"/>
doe good deeds: and therefore some to be sure of putting in themselues, constantly affirme all men are written. But infinite numbers vvill be deceiued at the last. For if there were vniuersall inscription, there should follow vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall Election: if vniuersall election, then vniuersall saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Do you wonder that the <hi>Lambes</hi> cannot liue in quiet? consider the number of <hi>goates</hi> among them. Ezek. 34. 18.

But GOD shall iudge and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. ver. 20. <hi>Behold, I, euen I will iudge betweene the fatte cattell, and the leane cattell.</hi> Because they haue thrust with side and shoulder, and push'd all the diseased vvith their hornes: <hi>therefore I will saue my flocke, and they shal no more be a prey, and I will iudge betweene cattell and cattell.</hi> The <hi>goates</hi> will annoy till they be quite separated. Too many among vs haue these goatish conditions: they climbe vp ambitiously to the mountres of preferment, like <hi>goates:</hi> they pill and barke the Common-wealth, like <hi>goates:</hi> they lust after women as hote as <hi>goates:</hi> they trouble the vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Israel, the peace of the Church, like <hi>goates:</hi> they tread vnder feet Gods blessings; like <hi>goates:</hi> they smell of impietie, as ranke as <hi>goates:</hi> and therefore they must be separated, as <hi>goates.</hi>

Thus the goates and the sheepe be like in externall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion: they feed both in one pasture, lie both in one fold, all their life time: but Christ will put them asunder at the last day. Like two trauellers that goe together to one Towne, take vp one Inne, feed together at one boord, sleepe together in one bedde: but in the morning their wayes part. The sheepe and goates eate together, drinke together, sleepe together, rot together, but at this day there shall be a separation. The goates may deceiue man both in life and death, they may be taken for sheepe, but Christ can discerne betweene cattell and cattell. God iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth by the Liuer, man by the Liuery. If the Liuer be rotten, looke the flesh neuer so faire, the good market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will not buy it.

               <p n="3">3. The Probation; euery man must vndergoe his try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.

Wee may forget our sinnes, but God keepes a true Register. If the sufferings of the Saints be recorded, then sure their violences by whom they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer are not forgotten. Now the book of the Law where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are iudged containes three leaues: Nature, the Law written, and the Gospell. Some must be tryed by the first onely, some by the first and second, others by all three.</p>
               <p>First, that some shall be iudged onely by the Law of Nature, it is cleare. <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 2. 12.</note>

1. It is a knowledge of certaine principles tending to liue well; and of conclusions thence necessarily inferred, agreeable with the eternall rule of Truth, planted by God in man, and teaching him to worship his maker. Thus <hi>Melancthon</hi> defines it. The matter of it is Principles with conclusions directing to a good life. Parents are to be honoured; this is a principle engraffed: therefore I must honour my Parents, this is a conclusion deducted. The forme of it is an accordance with the rule of truth, Gods morall Law: for the Law naturall is the summary abridgement of the Law morall. The Author of it is God, who hath written it in mans heart. <hi>Ambros. Deus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Creator singulorum pectoribus infudit.</hi> The end is, that it might be a testimony of that Diuine prouidence whereby God now ruleth, and of that Iustice whereby he will iudge men. This agrees with the Apostles definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Rom. 2. 15. <hi>Which shew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witnesse, and their thoughts excusing or accusing. The worke,</hi> there's the matter of it: <hi>of the Law,</hi> there's the forme: <hi>written,</hi> there's the Author that imprints it: <hi>the conscience accusing or excusing,</hi> there's the end. In this inward testimony arising from nature, are these two principall things: <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. The other point to be discussed is, vvhether the breach of this Law doth condemne. Some obiect, that it is quite blotted out of man, therefore cannot bind him. No question, it is much obscured in respect, both of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall and effectuall faculties. For vnderstanding it gropeth, <note n="e" place="margin">Acts 17. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>ifhaply it might feele after God. Adam</hi> had the knowledge of good by experience, of euill onely by contemplation: but falling he had also an experimentall knowledge of euill. For affection, mans will is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse,

               <p>Thus is this naturall light dimmed and ouercast by the corruption of prosperous lusts: yet <hi>ne ipsa quidem delet ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitas:</hi> sinne doth not quite race it out. 1. Because there are certaine principles reuiuing in the most dissolute. As the desire of happinesse; and euery one would attaine that end, though they erre in the meanes. Yea they know that euill is to bee auoided, which appeares in that they would not haue any wrong offered to themselues. These generall rules all know, albeit in the particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications they are blinded. Hence it came, that some grosse sinnes were not condemned of them: as robbery among the Germans, lust of males among the Grecians. Rom. 1. 27. Indeed God did punish <hi>malitiam per duri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiem:</hi> yet still remaine some sparkes and cold sinders of that primary and originall fire. 2. That the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not quite extinct, appeares by the force and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the conscience; for this doth vexe and sting the most obstinate soule. By this <hi>Cain</hi> was driuen to confesse the monstrousnesse of his sinne. 3.

The very Gentiles had many excellent politicke Lawes, and positiue constitutions. This seemes to cleare the meaning of <hi>Plato's</hi> two assertions: <hi>Legem esse inuentionem veritatis,</hi> that was the Law of Nature: <hi>Legem esse imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem veritatis,</hi> such were the positiue decrees grounded vpon the other. But what precepts doth this Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and what remnants of it doth man retaine?</p>
               <p>The Law of nature commands man, to liue religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to God aboue him, iustly to man with him, soberly to things vnder him. To deale iustly with men nature giues him two rules: one affirmatiue, <hi>What thou wouldest haue others to doe to thee, so doe to them:</hi> the other nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, <hi>Quod <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

No, for the Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to mans nature: so though the knowledge was lost by mans default, yet the bond remaines on Gods part. The Gospel was neuer giuen to mans nature, but after the fall, and is aboue nature. <hi>Adam</hi> was the roote of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in respect of nature, not in respect of grace.

and Gentiles: but not to belieue is the proper sin of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and it is a grand sinne, because they haue the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of faith. 2. Because infidelity is the roote of all sins, as faith is of all good works: the want of faith leads from transgression to presumption, from presumption to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire. 3. Especially, because faith takes away the guilt of all sinnes, and freeth from condemnation: but infidelitie retaines the guilt of it selfe and others. <hi>Omnia peccata per infidelitatem retinentur, per fidem remittuntur.

                  <hi>thee in the last day.</hi> The Sermons thou hast heard, shall rise vp in iudgement to condemne thee. Hence arise three conclusions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no presumption for a Christian to belieue the pardon of his sinnes in Christ: for to doe the will of God is not to presume. If we doe not belieue this, Christ shal iudge vs damnable by the Gospell: therefore if wee doe conscionably belieue this, he shall acquite vs by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. <hi>Non est praesumptio credentis, vbi est authoritas iuben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> There is no presumption in man to belieue it, when there is the authority of God to command it. Of all things in a Christian, God doth not loue a nice dainty, and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly faith. He loues to haue a mans modesty bashfull, his humility fearefull, his penitence sorrowfull, his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ioyful, his compassion pitifull: but he loues a faith that hath boldnesse in it. That is not afraid to trouble God with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Let vs draw neere with a true heart in full assurance of faith.</hi> Not to doe this faithfully, is against the Gospel; therefore to be iudged of that sinne.</p>
               <p>The infallible certaintie of a true Christians saluation, is knowne to himselfe, and cannot be doubted vvithout sinne. For if it be sinne to distrust this, it is then righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse to belieue it. The summe of the Gospel is mans saluation by Christ: he that belieues not this, belieues not the Gospell: and he that knowes the Gospel, and belieues it not, shall by it be condemned. Now God in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel doth not require that absolute perfection, which he did in the Law, vnder the perill of damnation: but quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the rigour of the Law by the satisfaction of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. So that the Gospell accepts the intent and endeuour for the act; as the will to repent for penitence, and the wil to belieue for faith. It is then not onely a weakenes, but a wickednes to distrust Gods mercy in thy saluation; let not this faultiudge thee before Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Gospel requires probation of faith by a good life. <hi>Norma fides, forma vitae:</hi> as we belieue we must liue. Doe we belieue Christ hath redeemed vs? We must liue like such as are redeemed: if freed, let vs demeane our selues as children of freedome. It is nothing at this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to say, I haue belieued, when the life shall witnesse the contrary: thy lips affirme, but thy works deny. As our Sauiour said, <hi>Opera testantur de me; my workes beare witnesse of me,</hi> that I am Christ: so thou must say, <hi>Opera te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantur de me,</hi> my works beare witnesse of me, that I am a Christian. Thou shalt be saued for thy faith, not for thy works: but for such a faith as is without works thou shalt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:25651:69"/>
neuer be saued. Works are disioyned <hi>A iustificando, non a iustificato;</hi> from the act of iustifying, not from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son iustified. If this Iudge for his owne merits giue vs saluation, wee must shew him the faire copy of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation. <hi>Quicquid Christus operatur pro nobis, operatur in nobis.</hi> Whatsoeuer Christ vvorkes for vs, he also workes in vs. If he hath freed vs from the damnation of sinne, he hath also freed vs from the dominion of sinne. Albeit in our iustification <hi>Fiet nobis secundum fidem nostram;</hi> Be it vnto vs according to our <hi>Faith:</hi> yet in saluation <hi>Reddetur vnicuique secundum operasua;</hi> Euery man shall bee rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to his workes. Let not that which is a word of comfort to vs, be a bill of inditement against vs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Sentence.</hi> As there be two sorts of men to be sentenced, so there is a double sentence: one of Absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the other of Damnation. With Absolution our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our begins in action, with that let vs begin in meditation. He begins with fauour, O he is ready to shew mercy: and comes slowly to wrath and iudgement. In the Absolution are considerable foure circumstances; A Calling, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending, a Reply, and an Answere. First, the calling is set downe. Math. 25. 34. <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</hi> In which gracious speech wee may perceiue sixe gradations.</p>

To testifie their humilitie, that albeit these things are true, yet they acknowledge no merite in them: they haue not done so much of these as they ought. Besides, they might haue an after-consideration of their sinnes past; which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued with their good works, they find one to out-weigh a thousand.

here what becomes of good mens soules when they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their bodies: they are in the <hi>heauenly Citie.</hi> There are many idle opinions, what becomes of mans soule in death. Some haue thought, that the soules then, though they die not, yet are still kept within the body (as it were asleepe) vntill the last day. But the Scripture speakes expresly the contrary: for <hi>Diues</hi> his soule was in hell, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> his soule in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome. <note n="k" place="margin">Reu. 6. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>I saw vnder the Altar the soules of them that were slaine for the Word of God.</hi> Some haue imagined a transmigration of soules forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their owne bodies, into other bodies. <hi>Herod</hi> seemes to be of this opinion: when newes was brought him concerning the fame of <hi>Iesus,</hi> he said to his seruants; <note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 14. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>This is Iohn the Baptist, he is risen from the dead.</hi> He thought that the soule of <hi>Iohn</hi> was put into the body of <hi>Iesus.</hi> It is alleaged, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> liuing and feeding with beasts, <hi>vntill seuen times were passed ouer him;</hi> had lost his owne soule, and the soule of a beast was entered in the roome. But this is a friuolous conceit: indeed God had bereft him of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reason, yet he had still the soule of a man. Doe not many among vs, that haue the soules of men, liue like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched beasts? The lustfull like a goate, the couetous like a vvolfe, the drunkard like a hogge, the Politician like a foxe, the rayler like a barking curre. Others think, that the soule neither dieth nor sleepeth, nor passeth out of one body into another, but wandreth vp and downe here on earth among men: and often appeareth to this man, ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that: whence came that fabulous opinion that dead men walke. For this purpose they alleage the Witch of Endor, who made <hi>Samuel</hi> appeare to <hi>Saul,</hi> and answere him. But the truth is, that was not <hi>Samuel</hi> indeed, but an apparition, the meere counterset of him. For not all the Witches in the world, nor all the Diuels in hell can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the soules of the faithfull: for they are in Gods kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Dying, their soules are immediatly translated to blessednesse: <hi>there are the spirits of iust men made perfect:</hi>

and there to abide, vntill the generall Resurrection shall restore them to their owne bodies. For the soules of the Reprobates, departing in their sinnes, they goe directly to hell, and are kept there as in a sure prison.</p>
               <p>Let this instruct all such as haue a Christian hope, to let their soules depart with comfort. <hi>Emittuntur, non amit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuntur:</hi> death doth not lose them, but loosen them, &amp; set them free from the bondage of corruption. Howle and lament if thou thinke thy soule perisheth. There are some that feare not so much to die, as to be dead: they know the pang is bitter, but it is short: it is the comfortlesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the dead that is their dread.

               </p>
               <p>In a larger sense it is taken for all Pietie, and so iustice and holinesse are all one.

For it is not sufficient <hi>Legere, sed degere vitam sanctorum:</hi> not to read, but to lead the liues of Saints. Papists in this goe too farre, as euil men come too short. Good men imitate the Saints, but doe not worship them: Papists worship the Saints, but doe not imitate them: lewd men doe neither. Perhaps they will imitate their infirmities: as if onely for that they liked them, for

which onely God misliked them. The Saints are to bee held as Patternes, not as Patrones of our life. But the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists praise not God in his Saints, nor the Saints for God, but as God. Onely let vs reuerently walke in their grace, that we may ioyfully come to their place.</p>
               <p>In a stricter sense it is taken for that morall vertue, which giues to euery man his owne. This vertue hath beene highly commended in the heathen: but one saith truly, <hi>Iustitia ethnic orum miranda potius, quàm laudanda:</hi> their Iustice deserued more admiration, then commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they wanted him that should make them iust.

The buyer thinkes he is iust, and hee is iust couso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, no more. The Vsurer would storme and stare, as if had seene a spirit, if hee were taxed for vniust. Presently he consults (his Scriptures) his bonds, and (his Priest) his Scriuener: and there the one sweares, the other shewes in blacke and white, that he takes but ten in the hundred. Is he then vniust? Yes, <note n="d" place="margin">Ezek. 22. 16</note>

Where must the Lay-Parson sit, that fattes himselfe with the Tyth-graine, &amp; will not giue the poore Minister the straw? Is this iust? He takes the tenth of his neighbours profits, and neuer so much as reades him an Homelie for it: is this iust? Hee layes sactilegious hands on Gods sanctified things, and neuer askes him leaue: is this iust? Where shall the Engrosser appeare, that hoords vp commodities bought with ready mony, and when he vents them, makes the poore pay treble vsury for it: is this iust? What shall become of that vnspeakeably rich Transporter, who carries out men and money, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouerishing of the Land, and brings home gawdes and puppets, fitte for no bodies vse but prides?

The other property is actiuely expressed; <hi>Iust,</hi> it is not said Iustified: not that they made themselues iust, but that Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse hath iustified them; so both they are, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted iust.

As it is easier for a man healed and directed the way, to come to the goale; then for him that lies lame in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. <hi>Qui dedit ingressum,</hi> must also <hi>dare progressum: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficere &amp; perficere;</hi> to make and to make vp, to doe and to perfect, are both the workes of God. Wee could neuer be iust, vnlesse Christ iustifie vs: neuer come to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vnlesse he perfect vs. He that begun this good work, must also finish it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Made perfect.</hi> In heauen are none but the <hi>perfect. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis sedes expectat talem sessorem:</hi> such a house requires such an inhabitant. On earth there is a kind of <hi>Perfection:</hi> all the faithfull are perfectly iustified, but not perfectly san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. The reprobates are <hi>perfectè imperfecti:</hi> the godly <hi>imperfectè perfecti:</hi> those perfectly imperfect, these imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly perfect. They are so perfect that they are acquitted in Christ, and there remaines no iudgement for them, but onely a declaration of their pardon. Iustification admits no latitude, in it <hi>nec magis nec minus,</hi> for none can be more then iust. But the perfection of sanctity is wrought by degrees: <hi>non plenam induimus perfectionem, donec totam exuimus infectionem:</hi> all the staines of our infection must first be cleansed, and quite washed away; before this full perfection be giuen vs. Christs bloud doth now wholly take from vs the guiltinesse of sin, not wholly the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinne: that blessednesse is reserued only for heauen.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore be <hi>perficientes,</hi> going and growing vp, that at last we may be <hi>Perfecti, made perfecti.</hi> This is not wrought on a sodain; a child doth not presently become a man. Euen the Lord Iesus had his time of <hi>growing,</hi> and can any member grow faster then the Head? Indeed the malefactor on the crosse shot vp in an houre; but this was miraculous, and God seldome workes by such miracles. God neyther sends Angels from heauen, nor the dead from hell, to giue warning to men vpon earth. <note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 16. 31.</note>

Thou allowest not a Surgion vnnecessarily to breake thy head, to try his skill, and the vertue of his plaister. Sprindges were better taken away <hi>quae non prosunt,</hi> because they doe no good: then the setting of watchmen by them to warn trauellers, <hi>ne noceant;</hi> that they be not hurt by them. Take away thy lusts quite, this is the way to be sure: for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may be like <hi>Baal,</hi> so fast asleepe that all thy cryes are not able to waken her.</p>
               <p>To conclude, hee that will weare a crowne in heauen, must be all his life on earth preparing the gold to make it. Not that thy owne vertues crowne thee, but that GOD without thy vertues will neuer crowne thee. The robe of glory that is worne there, must be spun and wouen heere: spun out of the side of Christ by faith, and embroydered with our good workes.

               <p>How should a man be <hi>Perfectus,</hi> that was neuer <hi>factus,</hi> well begun? I wonder what perfection a wine-bibber lookes for; sure to be a <hi>perfect</hi> drunkard.

What perfection hopes the couetous Churle; that allowes himselfe a race of fourescore yeares; and sets God at the latter end of it: and he hath that place too with this condition, that hee trouble not his minde about it till the last day comes.

that onely one. <note n="l" place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>For there is one God, and one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor betweene God and men, the man Christ Iesus.</hi> God was angry, man was guiltie, Christ is the Mediator betwixt them: who being God, could satisfie God, and beeing man, could suffer for man. We are lost, and desire some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to recouer vs: what shall that be? Mercy? No, God is iust: he that hath offended must be punished. Shall it be Iustice? No, we haue need of mercy: that he who hath offended might be spared. Here, to be so merciful as not to wrong his iustice, to be so iust as not to forget his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; there must be a <hi>Mediator.</hi> This must not be the world, that was Gods owne before, he made it: not Angels, for they are engaged for their owne creation; and being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, cannot satisfie an infinite Maiestie by infinite pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for infinite sinnes.</p>
               <p>Gods Sonne must doe it: now if hee come to satisfie for pride, he must put on humilitie: if for rebellion, he must put on obedience: if for stubbornnesse, he must put on patience: he must serue if he will deserue: this God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone cannot doe: if to die, he must be mortall, this onely God cannot be. Therefore this <hi>Mediator</hi> is made man, to be himselfe bound; as he is GOD to free others that are bound. Man to become weake, God to vanquish. Man to die, God to triumph ouer death. This is that sacred <hi>Ladder,</hi> whose top in heauen reaching to the bosome of God, expresseth his Diuinitie: &amp; his foote on earth close to <hi>Iacobs</hi> loynes, witnesseth his Humanitie. We are bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rout debters, God is a sure Creditor, Christ sets all on his score. We are ignorant Clients, God is a skilfull Iudge, Christ is our Aduocate to plead our cause for vs. God is a iust Master, we are vnfaithfull, vnfruitfull, vnprofitable seruants, this <hi>Mediator</hi> takes vp the matter betweene vs.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:25651:83"/>
                  <hi>Mediatorship</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> couenant is a high office, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible to none but the Lord Iesus. Who should appeare betweene a iust God, and sinfull men; but he that is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall with men, and iust with God? It is a <hi>Couenant,</hi> for there is something agreed on both sides: we couenant to belieue, and God to forgiue. A <hi>New</hi> couenant; there was cold comfort for vs in the old. A man reading, <hi>Fac hoc et vines, Doe this and thou shalt liue:</hi> thinks of it as if he were bidden to catch a starre from the firmament, &amp; take it for his labour. But in the <hi>New, Crede et vine;</hi> belieue &amp; liue for euer. The condition on mans part is belieuing, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant on Gods part is Sauing. Now, though it be true, that it is as easie for man of himselfe to fulfill the Law, as it is to belieue the Gospel, yet the <hi>New couenant, Dat cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> giues a man power to belieue: for faith is the faire gift of God. <hi>Praecipit non adiuvat Lex, offert et affert E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelium.</hi> The Law giues commandement, but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment: the Gospel brings saluation to our hearts, &amp; our hearts to saluation. As it chargeth vs, so it aydeth vs. As this <hi>Mediator</hi> giues <hi>Fidem quam credimus,</hi> the faith which we belieue, mercy and remission: so also <hi>Fidem qua credimus,</hi> the faith whereby we belieue, grace to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this mercy. <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 8. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ hath obtained a more excellent ministery, by how much also he is the Mediator of a better Couenant, which was established vpon better promises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Briefely here consider the excellencie of this <hi>New</hi> and Euangelicall Couenant, aboue the <hi>Old</hi> and Legall. In the beginning God made man righteous: for he created him <note n="o" place="margin">Gene. 1. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>in his owne Image,</hi> which the Apostle saies <note n="p" place="margin">Ephe. 4. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>consisted in righteousnesse and the holinesse of truth.</hi> But man soone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced this goodly and godly picture. <note n="q" place="margin">Eccl. 7. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>This I haue found, that God made man righteous, but he sought out many inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> waves to make himselfe wicked and wretched. Hence it followed that our restitution was a greater work then our constitution. The house was with more ease built vp new, then repaired being old and ruinous. That
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:25651:83"/>
was done <hi>per verbum enuntiatum,</hi> this <hi>per verbum annunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum.</hi> There he spake the word, and all things were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: here the <note n="r" place="margin">Iohn 1. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Word was made flesh: Fecit mira, tulit dira: passus dura verba, duriora verbera.</hi> There it was done by saying, <hi>Dic verbum tantùm:</hi> here by doing, yea by dying: suffering grieuous words, more grieuous wounds: <hi>Factus in terris, fractus in terris.</hi> There all begun in <hi>Adam,</hi> who was <hi>Terrae filius,</hi> a sonne of the earth: here all in Christ, who is <hi>Coeli Dominus,</hi> the Lord of Heauen. Spirituall life is better then naturall, firmer, surer. There man had one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a power to stand, but with it a power to fall, according to his owne pleasure: heere he hath a certaintie of insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable coniunction to Christ. He so stands as neuer to fall, so liues as neuer to die, so is loued as neuer to bee hated. There <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> were married to propagate <hi>filios carnis,</hi> children of the flesh: heere Christ is married to his Church, to beget <hi>filios spirituales,</hi> children in the Spirit: and that with a bond neuer to be diuorced. Thus at first God commanded that to exist, which was not before: now he makes one contrary to be changed into another: flesh into spirit, darknesse into light, corruption into ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse: greater miracles, then changing stones into bread; <hi>Dignus vindice nodus,</hi> a knot worthy the finger of God to vntie. Here is the wonderfull worke of the <hi>New</hi> Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: we were made <hi>Ex spirituoris,</hi> redeemed <hi>ex sanguine cordis:</hi> created by the breath of Gods mouth, but saued by the bloud of his heart. Therefore not sixe Cherubims as in the vision of <hi>Esay,</hi> nor foure and twenty Elders, as in the Reuelation of <hi>Iohn;</hi> but a royall Armie of heauenly souldiers were heard praysing GOD at the birth of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>
               <p>In summe, there is but <hi>one Mediator</hi> of the <hi>New Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi> neither Saint nor Angel hath any part in this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <hi>Melancth.

By paying the Creditor for the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; so Christ is alone <hi>Mediator.</hi> 3. By desiring the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor to forgiue the Debter; and in this sense, he saies An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints are Mediators. But this distinction is no other then <hi>Bellarmines</hi> mincing; who indeed seemes to be ashamed of the blasphemous phrases in their Missals. As <hi>Maria mater gratiae: Sancte Petre miserere mei, salua me, &amp;c.</hi> These, saith he, are our words, but not our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; that <hi>Mary</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> should conferre grace on vs in this life, or glory in the life to come. Yet both their Schoole and Practice speakes more. For <hi>Aquin</hi> sayes, our prayers are effectuall by the merits of Saints; &amp; that Christs intercession is gotten by the patronage of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, by the interuention of Martyrs, by the bloud of <hi>Becket,</hi> and merits of all Saints. And the practice of the people, is to hold Angels and Saints immediate Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, able to satisfie and saue. But as one hath well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued; if euery Saint in the Popes Calender be receiued as a Mediator, we shall worship vnknowne men, as the Athenians did vnknown gods.

As we appeale from the Kings-Bench barre to the Chancerie, so a Papist may appeale from the Tribunall of God to the Court of our Lady.

               <p>
                  <hi>To the bloud.</hi> To speake properly, it is the death of Christ that satisfies the Iustice of God for our sinnes: and that is the true materiall cause of our redemption. Yet is this frequently ascribed to his bloud. <note n="e" place="margin">Hebr. 9. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>The bloud of Christ purgeth the Conscience from dead works.</hi>

                  <hi>Out of his pierced side came forth bloud and water.</hi> As God wrote nothing in vaine, so what he hath often repeated, hee would haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously considered. <hi>Non leuiter praetereat lectura nostra, quod tam frequenter insculpsit Scriptura sacra.</hi> There are some reasons why our saluation is ascribed to CHRISTS bloud.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because in the bloud is the life. <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 9. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Flesh with the bloud therof, which is the life therof, you shall not eat.</hi> Leu. 17. 14. The soule of a beast is in the bloud, and in the bloud is the life of euery reasonable creature on earth. The effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof doth exhaust the vitall spirits, and death fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. In Christs bloud was his life; the shedding of that was his death: that death by the losse of that bloud is our redemption.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because this bloud answeres to the types of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall sacrifices. This our Apostle exemplifies in a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 9. 18. &amp;c</note> 
                  <hi>The first Testament was not dedicated without bloud. Moses sprinkling the booke and all the people, sayd, This is the bloud of the Testament. Almost all things are by the Law purged by bloud, and without shedding of bloud is no
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:25651:87"/>
remission.</hi> No reconciliation, no remission without bloud. All directed vs to this Lambe of GOD, whose bloud onely vindicates vs from eternall condemnation. Not that the bloud of a meere man could thus merite; but of that man who is also God: therefore it is called the <note n="i" place="margin">Acts 20. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Bloud of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Because bloud is fitter for applyment to the heart of man; who is so weake in apprehension that GOD is faine to lead him as it were by the senses? Not that there is a necessary receiuing of Christs materiall bloud by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one that shall be saued: so it might sprinkle vpon the souldiers that crucified him, who yet might go to hell. But it is receiued <hi>Mentaliter &amp; Sacramentaliter;</hi> there is a mentall and a sacramentall application. Thus wee are said to drink his bloud, that receiue it spiritually by faith. The Papists in their opinion are fed orally with the very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall bloud of Christ: but then surely none of them can goe to hell; <hi>for hee that eates the flesh, and drinkes the bloud</hi>

                  <hi>of the Sonne of Man, hath eternall life.</hi> But now the Priests, for feare belike lest too many of the people should be saued, and so Purgatory the Popedomes pillar be quite ouerthrowne, haue taken away the Cup from them; and turned Christs <hi>Bibite omnes</hi> into <hi>Bibite non omnes; Drinke ye all,</hi> into drinke ye onely <hi>Priests,</hi> not the rest. When they had giuen this bloud so high an honor, they thought it too good for the common sort. First they said, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Cup; there they gaue it too much: then they tooke it from the people, there they gaue them too little. First they strained it, and then they restrained it. But they answere, the people haue this bloud in the bread; for that is flesh, and can there be flesh without bloud? If so, why then doe themselues take the Cup? Eyther it is necessary for the people, or superfluous for the Priests. Vnlesse they value a Clergy mans soule at a higher rate then a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: as if Christs bloud were not shed for the one, so well as for the other.</p>

But to let goe their sacrilegious absurdities, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selues spiritually to receiue this bloud, shed for vs, and communicated to vs. This bloud is ready for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, if our hearts be ready for apprehension. To vs it is, though not elementally, yet alimentally profitable. There is a bloud that nourisheth, as the Pelican her young ones with her owne bloud; Christ so feedes our soules to saluation with this bloud. There is a bloud that mollifies; as the warme bloud of a goate softens the Adamant: wee haue obdurate hearts if Christs bloud cannot melt them. There is a bloud that purgeth as the Kids; so the <note n="k" place="margin">1. Iohn. 1. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>bloud of Christ cleanseth vs from all sinne.</hi> There is a bloud that colours, as the Deeres; so doth Christs bloud giue a pure colour to his Church; <hi>Thou art all faire my loue.</hi>

As <hi>Eue</hi> came out of <hi>Adams</hi> side sleeping, so the <hi>Church</hi> is taken out of <hi>Christs</hi> side bleeding. Thus God disposed it in mercy; <hi>Ut effundatur sanguis Christi, ne confundatur anima Christiani:</hi> that Christs bloud should be spilt, to saue our soules from spilling.</p>

                  <hi>That speaketh better things then that of Abel.</hi> This is a Metaphor, to shew the force of Christs bloud, so preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God as if it had a tongue. The comparison is between <hi>Abels</hi> bloud and <hi>Christs:</hi> now <hi>Abels</hi> is said to cry; <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 4. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>The voyce of thy brothers bloud cryeth vnto mee from the ground. Clamitat in coelum vox sanguinis.</hi> So Christs bloud is said to speake; <hi>Quot vulnera, tot voces;</hi> so many wounds, so many words.</p>
               <p>There is great respondence of Christ to <hi>Abel. Abel</hi> was slaine by his brother, <hi>Christ</hi> by his brethren; the voice of the Iewes was <hi>Crucifie</hi> him. <hi>Abel</hi> was slaine because he sacrificed; <hi>Christ</hi> was slaine that he might be sacrificed. <hi>Cain</hi> enuied <hi>Abel</hi> because he was accepted; the Iewes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Christ</hi> because hee was good. <hi>Abel</hi> might say to his brother; <hi>For my sacrifice dost thou kill me? Christ did say to</hi> the Iewes; <hi>For which of my good workes doe you stone mee? Abel</hi> was so slaine, that his bloud was aboundantly shed, and that in many places; for it is said <hi>Vox sanguinum;</hi> the <hi>voice of blouds.</hi> So Christs bloud was let out with thornes, scourges, nailes, speare. As <hi>Cain</hi> sustained a threefold pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; he was <hi>cursed</hi> in his soule, a vagabond on earth, vnprosperous in his labours. So are the Iewes plagued; they haue no place they can call their owne; when they haue heaped vp riches, some other takes them away; they cannot see their owne City but they must pay for it; they are cursed in their obstinate blindnesse: thus according to their owne request, the bloud of Christ is vpon them and vpon their children.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Christs</hi> bloud speakes <hi>better things: Abels</hi> cryed <hi>vindictam,</hi> Christs speakes <hi>misericordiam.</hi> That, Lord see and reuenge; this, <hi>Father, forgiue them, they know
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:25651:89"/>
not what they doe.</hi> God hath an eare of mercy, so well as of Iustice. If he heard that bloud speaking for confusion, then he will heare this speake for remission. If hee heard the Seruant, he will much rather heare the Sonne: if he heard the seruant for spilling, hee will much more heare the Sonne for sauing. <hi>Postula à me,</hi> saith God to his Son: <note n="p" place="margin">Psal. 2. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Aske of me, and I will giue thee:</hi> the Father will deny the Sonne nothing.

            <p>In a sinfull action there be two things: the Materiall, and the Formall part: which we commonly distinguish into the act and defect.

He could haue no tongue to plead, nor wit to circumuent, nor hands to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away, without God: from him hee hath those crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that notion and motion. But to peruert all these to damnifie others, and to damne himselfe, ariseth from his owne auarous and rancorous prauity. His intent is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; yet not without Gods wisedom to raise profit from it. Perhaps the oppressed had too good a liking to the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:25651:92"/>
World, and beganne to admit a little confidence in their wealth: the Lord hath benefited them, in taking away these snares, to saue their soules.</p>
            <p>Yet without toleration, countenance, or helpe to the wicked. The Vsurer hath done thee good: by making thee poore in purse, helped thee to the riches of grace; yet he goes to hell for his labour. They that doe GOD seruice against their wills, shall haue but shrewd wages. It cannot be denied, but the diuell did God seruice; in trying <hi>Iob,</hi> winnowing <hi>Peter,</hi> buffetting <hi>Paul,</hi> executing <hi>Iudas:</hi> yet shall not all this ease the least torment of his damnation. For triall here, are these oppressors suffred to <hi>ride ouer</hi> the godly's <hi>heads,</hi> and to driue them <hi>through fire and vvater:</hi> when these haue like furnaces, purged them from drosse &amp; corruption, themselues shall be burnt. For it is vsuall with God, when he hath done beating his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to throw the rodde into the fire. <hi>Babylon</hi> a long time shall be the Lords <hi>Hammer</hi> to bruise the Nations, at last it selfe shal be bruised. <hi>Iudas</hi> did an act, that redounds to Gods eternal honour, and our blessed saluation, yet was his wages the gallhouse. All these hammers, axes, rods, sawes, swords, instruments, when they haue done those offices they neuer meant, shall for those they haue meant, be throwne to confusion.</p>
            <p>I will now leaue Gods iustice to himselfe; and come to the iniustice of these Oppressors, and the passion of the sufferers. And because the qualitie of these latter shal adde some aggrauation to the cruell malice of the former; I will first set before your eyes the Martyrs. The Psalme beeing written by <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the suffrers spoken of in the first person plurall; <hi>We, Vs,</hi> and <hi>Our:</hi> it followes, that it was both <hi>Dauid,</hi> and such as <hi>Dauid</hi> was; beloued of God, holy, Saints.</p>
            <p>And whom doth the vvorld thinke to <hi>ride ouer,</hi> but Saints? Psal. 44. 22. Who should be appointed to the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:25651:92"/>
slaughter, but <hi>Sheepe?</hi> The Wolfe will not prey on the Fox, he's too crafty: nor on the Elephant, he's too mighty: nor on a dogge, he's too equall: but on the silly Lambe, that can neither run to scape, nor fight to conquer. They write of a Bird, that is the Crocodiles toothpicker, and feedes on the fragments left in his teeth whiles the serpent lyes a sunning: vvhich when the vnthankfull Crocodile would deuoure, God hath set so sharpe a prick on the top of the Birds head, that he dares not shut his iawes till it be gone. And they speake of a little Fish, that goes bristling by the Pike, or any other rauenous water-creature, and they dare not for his pricks &amp; thornes, touch him. Those whom Nature or Art, strength or sleight, haue made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exposable to easie ruine, may passe vnmolested. The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked will not grapple vpon equall termes: they must haue either locall or ceremoniall aduantage. But the godly are weake and poore; and it is not hard to prey vpon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate fortunes. A lowe hedge is soone troden downe; and ouer a vvretch deiected on the base earth, an insulting enemy may easily stride. Whiles <hi>Dauid</hi> is downe, (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him figured the Church) <hi>the plowers may plow vpon</hi>

Thus ascended, &amp; attended, twice a yeare at least, he rides ouer the <hi>heads</hi> and hearts of the poore Tenants: that they can no more grow in wealth, then corne can that is scattered in the high way: for they as that, are continually ouer-ridden by their mercilesse Landlords. Let these riders take heede, lest the curses of the poore stumble their horses, and breake their neckes.</p>
               <p>The churlish Cormorant is a mischicuous <hi>Rider:</hi> hee sits on a black Iade, Couetousnesse; and rides onely from market to market, to buy vp graine, when hee hath store to sell: and so hatcheth vp dearth in a yere of plenty. Our Land is too full of these riders: they repine &amp; complaine of the vnseasonablenesse of the weather, of the barrennesse of the earth: but they conceale the true cause, whereof their owne soules are conscious, their vncharitablenesse. The earth hath neuer been so frozen as their consciences: nor is the ground so fruitlesse of plenty, as they of pitie. This is not <hi>mala terra, bona gens;</hi> but <hi>mala gens, bona ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra:</hi> vve haue bad minds, good materialls. The earth hath
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:25651:96"/>
not scanted her fruits, but our concealings haue beene close, our enhancings rauenous, our transportations la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish. The Lord sends graine, and the diuell sends gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The imprecations of the poore shall follow these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>iders, and the eares of God shall attend their cries.</p>
               <p>There is the proud Gallant, that comes foorth like a May-morning, decked with all the glory of Art; and his adorned Lady, in her owne imagination a second <hi>Flora:</hi> and these are <hi>Riders</hi> too, but closer riders: the world with them runnes vpon wheeles; and they hastning to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, out-runne it. Their great reuenues will not hold out with the yeere: the furniture on their backs exceedes their rent-day. Hence they are faine to wring the poore spundges of the Country, to quench the burning heat of the City. Therefore say the Countrey-men, that their Carts are neuer worse employed, then when they do ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to Coaches.</p>
               <p>There is the fraudulent Tradesman; that rides no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then betweene the Bursse and the shop, on the backe of a quick-spirited hobby call'd Cheating: and whereas greatnesse presseth the poore to death with their weight, this man trips vp their heels with his cunning. They haue one God at the Church, another at their shops: and they will fill their coffers, though they fester their consciences. This <hi>Rider</hi> laughes men in the face, whiles he treads on their hearts; his tongue knowes no other pace, but a false gallop.</p>
               <p>The bribe-groping Officer, in what Court soeuer his dition lies, is an oppressing <hi>Rider:</hi> they that would haue their suites granted, must subiect their necks to his feete, and let him ride ouer them. He confutes the old allegory of Iustice, that is vsually drawne blind; for he will see to doe a Petitioner ease by the light of his angels. Nothing can vnlocke his lips but a golden key. This <hi>Riders</hi> horse, like that proud Emperors, must be shod with siluer: and the poore man must buy of him, and that at a deare rate,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:25651:97"/>
his owne treading on.</p>
               <p>I come to him last, whom I haue not least cause to think vpon, the Church-defrauder; that rides vpon a vvinged horse, as if he would flie to the diuell, called Sacriledge. He may appeare in the shape of a Protestant, but he is the most absolute Recusant; for he refuseth to pay God his owne. He weares the Name of Christ, for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Papists weare the Crosse; onely for a charme. These are the Merchants of soules, the Pyrats of Gods Ship the Church, the vnderminers of Religion; that are still practising traines to blow it vp. They will not pay their Leuites, their Leuites must pay them. They will not part with their Cures, whereof they haue the donation, but vpon purchase. But it is no wonder if they sell the Cures, that haue first sold their soules. The charitable man dreames of building Churches, but starts to thinke that these men will pull them downe againe.</p>

Neither doth he thirst so much after ordinary bloud, that runnes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon veines, as after the bloud-Royall. There is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case, saith one, that may so properly be called the Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euill. He is the diuells make-bate, and his cheefe Officer to set Princes together by the eares.

holy-dayes in hell, that hee did but poetize. So all their fabulous discourse of Purgatory is but Epigrams &amp; poetry; a more serious kinde of iest.

            <p>I should narrow vp the scope and liberty of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if I should heere tie my discourse to the letter. <hi>Wee went through fire, and through water.</hi> It is an effect of our persecution; and may thus be resolued: we were by their malice driuen to great extremity. <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>water</hi> are two elements, which (they say) haue no mercy: yet eyther of them more then our oppressors. The time was that a red Sea diuided the waters; and gaue dry passage to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> of <hi>Israel</hi> and of God. Whereof the Psalmist heere <note place="margin">Psal. 66. 6.</note> sings, vers. 6. <hi>Hee turned the Sea into dry land: they vvent through the floud on foote, there did wee reioyce in him.</hi> And the <hi>fire</hi> in an Ouen, whose heate was septupled, touched not those three seruants of the Lord. But these more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed and insensible creatures haue no mercy; nor can they inuent a cruelty, which they forbeare to execute.</p>
            <p>Some translations haue it: <hi>Wee went into fire, and into water:</hi> which extends their persecution to our deaths, and comprehends the latitude of mortall martyrdome. And thus vnderstood, the next words, of the deliuerance <hi>(Thou broughtest vs out into a wealthy place)</hi> must bee meant of our glory in heauen. But the euident circumstances fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing deny that interpretation: therefore I adhere to

the last and best Translation; <hi>Wee went through fire and through water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein two things may seeme to be imported, and imparted to our consideration. 1. <hi>We went.</hi> They went so conueniently as they might, and so conscionably as they durst, from the hands of their persecutors. 2.

To deny God this fealtie and tribute of our blouds, when his glory hath vse of such a seruice at our hands, is not onely to deny him that is his owne by many deare titles; of creation which was <hi>ex spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu oris,</hi> by the breath of his mouth; and of redemption which was <hi>ex sanguine cordis,</hi> by the bloud of his heart. But to withdraw this iustly required testimony, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray and crucifie him; and scarce inferior to their periury, whose false witnesse condemned him.</p>
               <p>In this we restore to God his talent with profit; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our owne soule he gaue vs, but as many more as our example workes vpon, and winnes to him.

               <p>So that suffering for <hi>Iesus,</hi> is a thing to which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth an ample reward. <hi>No man shall for sake parents, or friends, or inheritance, or liuing, or life for my sake; but hee shall haue</hi> in exchange <hi>a hundred fold</hi> so much comfort in this life, and in the world to come <hi>life euerlasting.</hi> But all times and occasions yeeld not warrant for such a seruice. Much lesse can the Seminaries, dying in England for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, arrogate to themselues the glory of Martyrdome; though a vicious affectation of it hath hartned and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to such a prodigality of their blouds.

Thou hast brought vs out.</hi> When <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> was taken vp by the Mariners, put from the succour of the Shippe; no helpe in any Rockes, nor mercy in the waters; neither means nor desire to escape by swimming: for he yeelds himselfe into the iaws of death with as mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified affection, as if a lumpe of lead had beene throwne into the sea: a man would haue thought that saluation it selfe could not haue saued <hi>Ionas.</hi> Yet <hi>Ionas</hi> shall not die. Here is now a deliuery fit for God, a cure for the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hand to vndertake.</p>
               <p>Mans extremity is Gods opportunity. Distressed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is importunate. <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 102. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>It is time that thou haue mercy vpon vs: yea the time is come.</hi> But if God doe not presently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, we are ready to pant out a groane of despaire, <hi>The
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:25651:105"/>
time is past.</hi> If our importunity preuaile not, wee thinke all opportunity is gone. But God sayes, <hi>Tempus nondum venit;</hi> the time is not yet. God waites the maturity of the danger, the more to increase his honour. As <hi>Alexander</hi> cheared himselfe when hee should fight with men and beasts; haughty enemies, and huge Elephants. <hi>Tandem par animo meo periculum video.</hi> I see at last a danger some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what equall to my minde.

                  <hi>Thy daughter is dead; trouble the master no further.</hi> This was the word Christ expected to heare. And now he sayes, <hi>Be not afraid, onely beleeue.</hi> Heare the Israelites desperate complaint. The waters of the Sea roare before their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the wheeles of the Chariots rattle behinde their backs: hereon they cry to <hi>Moses,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 14. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Were there no graues in Egypt, that thou hast brought vs hither to die?</hi> Now saith <hi>Moses; Feare not, stand still, and see the saluation of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From that hath beene spoken, and that which follows, we may obserue two workes of Gods mercy. Which consist <hi>Remouendo Promouendo:</hi> the one remouing avvay much euill, the other preferring to much good. <hi>Eduxisti,</hi> shewes his kindenesse in freeing vs from calamity; <hi>In lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum opulentum,</hi> his goodnesse in exalting vs to dignity. The former is an act of deliuerance, the latter of aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So there is <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> from whence vvee are freed; and <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> to which vvee are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</p>

For the former, wee haue God heere <hi>Educentem,</hi> bringing out of trouble. Sometime wee finde GOD <hi>Ducentem;</hi> leading, guiding, directing. <hi>Wilt not thou, O Lord, goe forth vvith our hoastes?</hi> And <hi>Hee ledde them</hi>

               <p>For their vigour or <hi>strength:</hi> the affliction of man, in the greatest extremitie, that he can lay it on man, is but finite as the afflicter. The blow comes but from an arme of flesh, and therefore can wound but flesh. Yeeld the extention of it to reach so farre as any possible malice can driue it: yet it can but racke the body, distend the ioynts, sluce out the bloud, and giue liberty to the imprison'd soule. Which soule they cannot strike. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith Christ, <hi>Feare not him that hath power ouer the body</hi> onely, not ouer the soule. And euen in the middest of this dire persecution, God can eyther quite deliuer vs,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:25651:106"/>
that the storme shall blow ouer our heads, and hurt vs not: or if he suffers vs to suffer that, yet he will so qualifie the heat of it, that the coole refreshing of his blessed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit inwardly to the Conscience, shall in a manner extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the torment. But now this <hi>vvealthy place;</hi> the spring of ioy that succeedes this winter of anguish, is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited, insuppressible, inexpressible, infinite. So strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guarded with an almighty power, that no robber vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently, nor theefe subtilly, can steale it from vs. Some pleasure is mixed with that paine, but no paine is incident to this pleasure. There was some laughter among those teares, but there shall be no teares in this laughter: For <hi>Teares shall bee quite wiped from our eyes.</hi> By hovv much then the power of God transcends mans; yea Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie mans malice; by so much shall our reioysing exceede our passion. By how much the glorious City of heauen, walled with Iasper and pure gold, shining as brasse, is <note place="margin">Reu. 21. 12. 18.</note> stronger then the vndefensed and naked cottage of this transient world: our future comforts arise in measure, pleasure and security, aboue our passed distresse.

               <p>There is in the godly a purpose of heart to serue the Lord. This is the child of a sanctified spirit, borne not without the throbs and throwes of true penitence. Not a transient and perishing flower, like <hi>Ionah's</hi> Gourd, <hi>Filius noctis; oriens, moriens:</hi> but the sound fruit, which the sap of grace in the heart sends forth. Luke 15.

               <p>But this <hi>Resolution</hi> hath a stronger force: it is the effect of a mature and deliberate iudgement; wrought by Gods Spirit, grounded on a voluntary deuotion; not without true sanctification: though it cannot, without some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of time and meanes, come to performe that act which it intends.

               <p>Well, this is but the beginning, and you know, many beginne, that doe not accomplish: but what shall become of them that neuer begin? If he doth little, that purposeth,

and performes not: what hope is there of them that vvill not purpose? It is hard to make an Vsnrer leaue his extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the vncleane his lusts, the swearer his dishallowed speeches: when neither of them saith so much, as <hi>I vvill</hi> leaue them. The habite of godlinesse is farre off, when to <hi>vvill</hi> is not present: &amp; we despaire of their performance, in whom cannot be wrought a purpose.</p>
               <p>But to you of whom there is more hope, that say, <hi>vve will</hi> praise the Lord; forget not to adde <hi>Dauids</hi> execution to <hi>Dauids</hi> intention.

               <p>God neuer left his Church destitute of a certain sacred place, wherein he would be worshipped. <hi>Adam</hi> had a place, wherein he should present himselfe to God, and God did present himselfe to him; Paradise. God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Abraham</hi> in a place, and sanctified it: and there <note n="s" place="margin">Gen. 12. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> built an Altar; for it was <hi>holy.</hi> When hee commanded him to sacrifice his Sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him a place; on <note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 22. 1. 2.

Chron. 3. <hi>Iacob</hi> according to the seuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hee dwelt in, built seuerall Altars to serue God on. The Israelites were translated out of Egypt for this very cause, that they might haue a place to sacrifice to the Lord. When they were come into <hi>Canaan,</hi> God commanded and directed <hi>Moses,</hi> to make a Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: which was but <hi>mobile Tabernaculum,</hi> to bee dissolued when <hi>Salomons</hi> glorious Temple was finished. Now all
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:25651:111"/>
these particular places were consecrated to the seruice of God; and called <hi>Loca Dei,</hi> Gods <hi>Places;</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> calls this <hi>Domum Dei,</hi> Gods <hi>House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the first note of the straine, the <hi>Place.</hi> The next is his <hi>Entrance;</hi> wherein obserue;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Dauids</hi> first care is to visit Gods house. It is very likely that this <hi>Psalme</hi> was written by <hi>Dauid,</hi> eyther in exile vnder <hi>Saul,</hi> or in persecution by <hi>Absalon,</hi> or in some grieuous distresse: whereout being deliuered, hee first resolues to salute Gods <hi>House. Chrysostome in Opere imperfect.</hi> or whosoeuer was the Author of that booke; notes it the property of a good Sonne, when hee comes to towne, first to visite his Fathers <hi>house,</hi> and to performe the honour that is due to him. We finde this in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Christ.</hi> Math. 22. so soone as euer he came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> first he visits his <hi>Fathers house, He went into the Temple.</hi> What <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 10. 12.</note> the Sonne and Lord of <hi>Dauid</hi> did there, the same course doth the Seruant of his Sonne take heere: First, <hi>I will goe into thy House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh for one dramme of this respect of Gods <hi>house</hi> in these dayes. Shall that place haue a principall place in our affections? we would not then thinke one houre tedious in it, when many yeares delight vs in the <hi>Tents of Kedar.</hi> This was not <hi>Dauids</hi> opinion. <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 84. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>One day in thy Court is better then a thousand.</hi> Nor grudge at euery penny that a Leuy taxeth to the Church: as if <hi>Tegumen parietibus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum</hi> was enough: bare walls and a couer to keepe vs from raine: and <hi>aliquid ornatus</hi> was but superfluous; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be a cushion and a wainscot seate, for a Gentlemans better ease. The greatest preparation vsually against some solemne feast, is but a little fresh straw vnder the feete; the ordinary allowance for hogs in the stye, or horses in the stable.

                  <hi>Templa Deo, Templis Monachos, Monachis dedit agros.</hi> He gaue Temples to God, Ministers to those Temples, and maintenance to those Ministers. But the Epitaphs of too many in these dayes may well run in contrary termes. They take Tenths from good Ministers, good Ministers from the Churches, yea and some of them also the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from God. But here <hi>Quicquid tetigero, vlcus erit:</hi> that which I should touch is an vlcer: and I will spend no Physicke <hi>in immedicabile vulnus,</hi> vpon an incurable wound; but leaue it <hi>Enserecidendum Domini;</hi> to be cut off with the sword of Gods vengeance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obserue the reason why <hi>Dauid</hi> would goe into Gods house; and this hath a double degree. To giue him. 1. Praise. 2. Publike praise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Praise.</hi> Might not <hi>Dauid</hi> praise God in any place? Yes, <hi>Dauid</hi> might and must blesse the Lord in any place, in euery place: but the place that is principally destin'd to this purpose, is <hi>Domus Dei;</hi> Gods <hi>House.</hi> The name which God imposed on his <hi>house,</hi> and by which, as it were, he Christned it; was <hi>Domus orationis,</hi> the <hi>house of prayer.</hi> As Christ, Math. 21. deriues it from Esa. 56. <hi>My house shall be called the house of prayer.</hi> Therefore those <note place="margin">Math. 21. 13. Esa. 56. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>houses</hi> were called in the Primitiue times, <hi>Dominica,</hi> the Lords <hi>houses;</hi> and <hi>Oratoria, houses</hi> of prayer, deuoted to the praise of God.</p>
               <p>I might heere take iust cause to taxe an error of our times. Many come to these holy places, and are so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a desire of hearing, that they forget the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie of praying and praising God. The End is euer held more noble then the meanes, that conduce vnto it. Sin brought in ignorance, and ignorance takes away de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion. The Word preached brings in knowledge, and knowledge rectifies deuotion. So that all our preaching is but to beget your praying, to instruct you to praise and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:25651:112"/>
worship God. The most immediate &amp; proper seruice and worship of God, is the end, and hearing but the meanes to that end. And the rule is true; <hi>Semper finis excellit id quod est ad finem:</hi> the end euer excells that which leads to the end. <note n="b" place="margin">Th. 1. qu. 117 art. 1.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Non tam audire, quàm obedire requirit Deus.</hi> God rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons not so much of our audience, as of our obedience: not the hearers, but the <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>dooers</hi> are <hi>blessed</hi> in their <hi>deed.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Christ saith, <hi>Blessed are they that heare the Word of God;</hi> but with this condition, that <hi>they keepe it.</hi> The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of GOD is the fruit of hearing, shew me this fruit. Our <hi>Oratoria</hi> are turned into <hi>Auditoria,</hi> and we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that God should speake earnestly to vs, but wee will not speake deuoutly to him. I hope that no man will so ignorantly and iniuriously vnderstand me, as if I spake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst hearing of Sermons frequently. God forbid: you must heare, and we must preach Acts. 6. <hi>The Apostles gaue themselues continually to prayer, and to the preaching of</hi>

                  <hi>the Word.</hi> Where yet <hi>Prayer</hi> is put in the first place.</p>
               <p>I complaine not that our Churches are <hi>Auditories,</hi> but that they are not <hi>Oratories:</hi> not that you come to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, (for Gods sake come faster) but that you neglect publique prayer. As if it were onely Gods part to blesse you, not yours to blesse God. And hereof I complaine with good company. <note n="d" place="margin">De Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preh.

                  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, that such a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude came to his Sermons, that there was scarce roome for a late commer: &amp; those would all patiently attend the end of the Sermon: But when prayers were to be read, or Sacraments to be administred, the company was thinne, the seates empty. <hi>Uacua, desertaque Ecclesia reddebatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beloued, mistake not. It is not the onely exercise of a Christian to heare a Sermon: nor is that Sabbath well spent, that dispatcheth no other businesse for heauen. I will be bold to tell you, that in Heauen there shall be no
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:25651:113"/>
Sermons; and yet in Heauen there shall be <hi>Halleluiahs.</hi> And this same end, for which <hi>Dauid</hi> came to Gods <hi>house,</hi> shall remaine in glory; to praise the Lord. So that all Gods seruice is not to be narrowed vp in hearing; it hath greater latitude; there must be prayer, praise, adoration, and worship of God. Neither is it the scope of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to knowe, but the scope of knowledge, is to be a good Christian. You are not Heathen, to aske <hi>Quid cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum,</hi> What must we belieue? nor Catechists to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note n="e" place="margin">Luke 3. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Quid faciendum,</hi> What must we doe? You know what to belieue, you know what to doe. Our preaching hath not so much need <hi>monere,</hi> as <hi>monere:</hi> though you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so need instruction, yet more need of exhortation: for you haue learnt more then euer you haue followed. Come then hither, both to heare God, and to praise God. As <hi>Dauid</hi> was not onely here a Praiser, but ver. 16. a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. <hi>Come and heare all ye that feare God, and I wil tell you what he hath done for my soule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Which fitly brings mee to the further exemplyfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this cause, mouing <hi>Dauid</hi> to enter into Gods <hi>house.</hi> Which was not onely to praise him, but to praise him publiquely. Otherwise, he might haue muttered his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to himselfe: no, he desires that his mouth should be a trumpet of Gods glory; as frequently in the Psalmes; <hi>I will praise thee before the great congregations.</hi> There are some, that whatsoeuer seruice they doe to God, desire ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vvitnesses of it: others desire no witnesses at all.</p>
               <p>The former are hypocrites; who would haue all mens eyes take notice of their deuotion: as if they durst not trust God vvithout witnesse, for feare he should deny it. Such were the Pharises; they gaue no almes without the proclamation of a trumpet: and their prayers were at the corners of streets; such corners where diuerse streets met, &amp; so more spectable to many passengers. To these Christ, Math. 6. Doe thy deuotion in secret; <hi>and hee that see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>secret, shall reward thee openly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other haue a little desire to serue GOD, but they would haue no witnesses at all. They depend vpon some great man, that will be angry with it. And these would faine haue God take notice of their deuotion, and no body else. So <hi>Nichodemus</hi> stole to Christ by night: and many a Papists seruant would come to Church, if hee were sure his Master might not know of it.

How few looke to their feet, before they enter these holy dores? Eccl. 5. and <note place="margin">Eccl. 5. 1.</note> so they offer the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of imprudent and impudent fooles.

and thus among their cups the litigation grew hote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them: whereas indeed <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> was but one man. Others, when they come first into the Church, they swappe downe on their seates, clappe their hattes before their eyes, and scarce bow their knees; as if they came to blesse God, not to intreat God to blesse them.

It is a common opinion in the world, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth dull a mans wits, and deiect his spirits: as if mirth and mischiefe were onely sworne brothers. But Gods word teacheth, and a good conscience findeth, that no man can be so ioyfull, as the faithfull: nor is there so merry a land, as the holy Land: no place of ioy like the Church. Let the wicked thinke, that they cannot laugh if they be tied to the Law of Grace, nor be merry if God be in the company. But the Christian knowes, there is no true ioy, but the good ioy: and if this be any where, it is in the Temple. <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 122. 1.</note>

               <head>Burnt Offerings.</head>
               <p>I haue three disswasions from punctuall tractation of this point. 1. The poore remnant of the fugitiue time. <note place="margin">See Serm. on Psal. 118. 27.</note> 2. I haue liberally handled it on former occasions. 3. The necessity is not great of discoursing the Sacrifices of the Law, in these dayes of the Gospell wee haue the light; and therefore need not trouble our selues to call backe the shadowes.</p>
               <p>Sacrifices are of great Antiquity: not onely the Booke of God, but euen the Law of nature hath imprinted in mans heart, that Sacrifices must be offered. It is written in the conscience, that an homage was due to the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our power, which is able to reuenge it selfe of dishonour and contempt done it; and to regratifie them with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that serued it. But <hi>Dauids</hi> Sacrifice was the earnest of a thankefull heart. I might amplifie it, and perhaps picke vp some good gleanings after others full carts.</p>
               <p>I could also obserue, that <hi>Dauid</hi> came not before God empty-handed; but brought with him some actuall testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his deuoted affection; <hi>Burnt offerings.</hi> To the confusion of their faces, who will no longer serue God, if hee growes chargeable to them. If they may receiue from God good things, and pay him onely with good words, they are content to worship him. But if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee in his fauour, but it must cost them the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on; they will saue their purses, though they lose their soules. If hee requires ought for his Church, poore Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, or poore members; they cry vvith <hi>Iudas, Ad quid perditio haec?</hi> why is this waste? They are onely so long rich in deuotion, as they may be rich by deuotion: and no longer.</p>
               <p>But for our selues, be we sure that the best Sacrifice we can giue to God, is obedience: not a dead beast, but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing soule.

               <p>The third and highest degree of this Song is, <hi>Uowes; I will pay thee my vowes.</hi> And here among <hi>vowes, I might</hi> sooner then with <hi>Burnt offerings,</hi> lose the time, your patience, and my selfe. This <hi>vow</hi> was no meritorious or supererogatory worke in <hi>Dauid.</hi> But though the Lavv generally binds him to Gods seruice, yet to some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar act of Gods seruice, he may newly binde himselfe by a <hi>vow.</hi> So <note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 28. 20. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Iacob vowed a vow, saying; If God will be vvith me, &amp;c. This stone that I haue set for a pillar, shall be Gods house; and of all that thou shalt giue me, I will surely giue the Tenth vnto thee.</hi> Our Prophet did vow performance of that duty, to which without vowing hee was obliged. Psal. 119. <hi>I haue vowed or sworne, and will performe it: that</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There are many cautions in <hi>vowes,</hi> which I must now
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:25651:119"/>
vow to omitte. Onely <hi>Salomons</hi> rule excepted, Eccles. 5. <hi>When thou vowest a vow to God, deferre not to pay it; for hee</hi>

                  <hi>hath no pleasure in fooles, pay that thou hast vowed. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sinne.</hi> Let nothing be vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that is not <hi>Penes vonentem,</hi> in the power of the vower: and then the thing being good, and thou enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, this <hi>vow</hi> must be kept.

               </p>
               <p>The Papists haue strange, and often impossible <hi>vowes;</hi> of Pouerty, Virginity, Pilgrimage. I will teach thee to make these <hi>vowes</hi> too, God enable thee to keepe them. If thou wilt vow <hi>pouertie,</hi> let it be <hi>in spirit.</hi> Vow thy selfe not in the world a begger, but a begger to Christ. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny blessed Saints haue serued GOD with their wealth, and thought not that religion was only in them that beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. If thou wilt vow <hi>virginity,</hi> vow thy selfe a Virgin to Christ: whether thou be married or single, keepe <hi>the bed vndefiled;</hi> that <note n="l" place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>thou mayest be presented a pure Virgin to Christ.</hi> If thou wilt vow <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> let it not be to our Lady of <hi>Loretto,</hi> or of <hi>Halle</hi> and <hi>Zichem,</hi> indeed not to our Lady, but to our Lord: vow thy selfe a Pilgrime to Christ: Loade not thy selfe with the luggage of this world, lest it hinder thy iourney; and cease not trauelling till thou come to thy Home; the place of peace and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall rest. These are lawfull, lawdible vowes: the Lord send vs all to make them, and to keepe them.</p>
               <p>You see, I am quickly got vp these two latter stayres: Some more speciall vse remaines onely to be made, and so giue way to conclusion. I will take from these three bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, a iust reproofe of three sorts of people: <hi>Refusers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders, Back-sliders.</hi> Refusers to come, being called. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders, that come being not prepared. And Back-sliders, that make vowes, but not keepe them. The first say not, <hi>We will goe into thy house.</hi> The second say, <hi>We will goe into
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:25651:119"/>
thy house,</hi> but not <hi>with burnt offerings.</hi> The last deny not both the former: <hi>We will goe into thy house,</hi> and <hi>with burnt offerings;</hi> but <hi>non soluent vota;</hi> they will not <hi>pay their vowes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Refusers</hi> or Recusants are of two sorts; Papists, and Separatists, or Schismatikes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Papists; and they haue so much recourse <hi>ad trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marina Iudicia;</hi> to beyond-sea Iudgements; that they dare not come into Gods house, because of the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction. And the Popes haue so wrought and brought it about now, that they will not onely <hi>in abstracto</hi> be had in reuerence; but <hi>in concreto</hi> be feared with obseruation. Though at first thirty Bishops there successiuely yeelded their heads to the blocke for Christ: yet afterwards, by change of Bishops in that See, and of humors in those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, such alteration hath followed; that Rome is no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to what Rome was, then <note n="m" place="margin">1. Sam. 19. 13</note> 
                  <hi>Michals Image on a pillow of goates haire,</hi> was like <hi>Dauid.</hi> The cause therefore of their not communicating with vs, is awe of the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie. For some of their greatest Writers haue iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our Communion booke, to containe all doctrine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to saluation. The not suffering them to come to Gods <hi>house,</hi> is then rather a point of Popish policie and state, then of Christian deuotion. But indeed they are the Satanicall Iesuites that set them afoote. The common people, like the <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> a dead Sea, would be quiet enough, if these blustring windes did not put them into tumult. And so long as those dogges can barke against Gods <hi>house,</hi> the poore affrighted people dare not come there. So that England may haue their bodies, but Rome hath their hearts; and the danger is fearefull, lest Satan also come in for his share, and take possession of their soules.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Schismatikes; who, because their curious eyes (looking through the spectacles of opinion) spy some Morphew of corruption on the Churches face, will vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:25651:120"/>
forsake it. There are some that refuse peaceable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the Poet made his Playes, to please the people; or as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was Christned; for company. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists are peeuishly wretched: discontent driues them from God; and though they say, they flie for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, indeed they flie from their conscience: leauing all true deuotion behind them, and their wiues and children vpon the Parish.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Well, they are gone, and my discourse shall trauell no further after them: but fall vpon others neerer hand. There are some so farre from <hi>Refusers,</hi> that they are rather <hi>Intruders.</hi> They will come into <hi>Gods house,</hi> but they will bring no <hi>burnt offerings</hi> with them: no preparation of heart to receiue benefit in the Church. They come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their <hi>wedding garment,</hi> and shall one day heare that fearefull and vnanswerable question; <hi>Friends, how came you in hither?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the vtterly prophane, that come rather with a lame knowledge, then a blinde zeale. For some of them, good clothes carry them to Church: and they had rather men should note the fashion of their habites, then God the habite of their hearts. They can better brooke ten dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in their liues, then one in their locks. Others are the secure semi-atheisticall Cosmopolites; and these come too: and none take a truer measure of the Sermon: for their sleepe beginnes with the prayer before it, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens iust at the Psalme after it. These thinke, that God may be serued well enough with looking on. And their vtmost dutie, but to bring their bodies a little further li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, then they shall be brought dead: for then perhaps they shall come to the Church-yard, now they will bring them to Church. Deuotion and they are almost strangers, and so much as they know of it, they dishonour by their acquaintance. Their <hi>burnt offerings</hi> are nothing else, but a number of eyes at vtmost lift vp to heauen; their heart
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:25651:120"/>
hath another center. They bring as many sinnes vvith them euery day to Church, as they haue beene all their liues in committing. Their hands are not washed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersions of lust and bloud: their eyes are full of vvhore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, their lips of slander, their affections of couetousnes, their wits of cheating, their soules of impiety. If there were no Saints in the Church, how could they hope, the roofe would not fall on their guilty heads! But I wil leaue them to the Lords reproofe. Iere. 7. <hi>Will ye steale, murther, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, and sweare falsely: and come and stand before</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 7. 9. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>mee in this house,</hi> staring mee in the face, as if you were innocent? <hi>Behold, euen I haue seene it, saith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is yet a last-sort; that will come into Gods <hi>house,</hi> and bring with them <hi>burnt offerings,</hi> a shew of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall deuotion; but they will not <hi>pay their Vowes.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, vvarre, captiuitie, calamitie, famine, sicknes, brings downe the most elate and lofty spirits. It turnes the proud Gallants fether into a kerchefe, pulls the wine from the lippes of the drunkard; ties vp the tongue of the svvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, whom thunder could not adiure to silence: makes the Adulterer lothe the place of his sinne, the bed. And though the Vsurer stuffe his pillow with nothing but his bonds and morgages, softer and sweeter in his opinion then Downe or fethers; yet his head vvill not leaue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
               <p>This misery doth so sting, terrifie, and put sense into the dead flesh of the nummed conscience; that (all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights being found like plumme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s of lead, tied about a man while he is exposed in this Sea; so farre from help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to swimme, that they sinke him rather) the eye lookes about for another shore, and finds none but God. To this so long forgotten God, the heart beginnes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse a messenger, and that is Prayer. God (the vvicked see) must be called on, but they knowe not how. They haue beene so meere strangers to him, that they cannot
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:25651:121"/>
tell how to salute him. Like beggers that are blind, they are forced to beg, but they see not of whom. Or if their eyes are so farre open; <hi>Vident quasi è longinquo salutem, sed interiacente pelago: vident quò eundum, non quà:</hi> They see health a farre off, as it were beyond the Sea: they see whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would goe, but not which way.</p>
               <p>If any inferior thing, or created proppe could vphold them, God should not be sollicited. If friends wil, if Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sike will, if money will, if all the delicate obiects for any sense will ease or appease their griefe, they will not seek to heauen. Yea, if <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the God of Ekron can cure them, they will not trouble the GOD of Israel. But all lower pleasures to one thus sick, is but like a sweet harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of musike to a deafe man. There is no hope of comfort but from aboue the clowds. Health &amp; prosperity is but as a Coach to carry our desires to heauen, but sicknes is the post-horse. Onely this <hi>Sub poena</hi> can bring vs to put vp a supplication in the high Court of Requests and Mercie. Now loe, they pray, they beseech, they sigh, they weepe, they bleed, and lastly they <hi>vow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What <hi>vow</hi> they? Either some new act to be done, or some old act to be left vndone. Now the drunkard vowes abstinence, the lustfull vowes continence, the swearer vowes to leaue his blasphemy: the Incloser vowes to throwe open his taken in commons: the proud vow to leaue their gawdy vanitie: the vvorldling vowes to be charitable, and to relieue the poore. And perhaps at such a pinch or dead lift, one Vsurer in a thousand yeeres may vow to forsake his vsury, and to restore all that he hath so gotten. Now they say, Lord, remoue from me this mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, this extremity; and I will hereafter serue thee better, loue thee more, belieue thy Gospell, relieue thy poore, giue something to an Hospitall, or doe some such act as may testifie my thankfulnes.</p>
               <p>Well, God heares and grants; health comes, strength is recouered, the danger is ouer, they are well. Now <hi>vbi
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:25651:121"/>
vota?</hi> Where be their <hi>vowes?</hi> Alas, we rise from our beds of sicknes, and leaue our <hi>vowes</hi> behind vs.
<q>
                     <l>Aegrotus surgit, sed pia vota iacent.</l>

               </p>
               <p>Physicians haue a rule among themselues, concerning their Patients: <hi>Take whiles they be in paine.</hi> For whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they promise sick, when they are well, they vvill not performe it. So God had need to take what deuotion hee can get at our hands in our misery; for when prosperitie returnes, we forget our <hi>vowes.</hi> You haue often heard that old verse:

               </p>
               <p>The morall of it sutes full to our present purpose. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that a terrible Earthquake had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer throwne many houses, slaine much people. Hereupon the remaining Inhabitants affrighted, fel deuoutly to their prayers and <hi>vowes:</hi> priuately in their chambers, publikely in their Churches: the poore were relieued, iustice admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, their liues much amended. But afterwards when God held his hand, they held their tongues: hee forbore plaguing, and they forbore praying: the rod ceased, and their pietie withall; they forgot their <hi>vowes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Lord hath striken vs by famine; in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the raine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs; or in powring down too much too fast vpon vs: Or by a greeuous plague, turning our popular streets into a Desart: we straight growe penitent; Zeale carries vp our cryes to heauen; wee pray, wee sigh, we weepe. Sorrow sits in our eyes, deuotion on our lips, God hath at that time more hearty prayers in an houre, then ordinarily in a yeere. But as the Poet spake,
<q>
                     <l>Nocte pluit tota, redeunt spectacula manè.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord no sooner takes off the burden of misery; but we also shake of the burden off pietie; we forget our
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:25651:122"/>
vowes. O the mercy of God, that such forgetfulnesse should possesse Christian hearts! This was vnthankfull Israels fault, Psalm. 106. <hi>They soone forgot his workes:</hi> they forgate, yea <hi>soone:</hi> they made haste to forget: so the <note place="margin">Psal. 106. 13.</note> Originall is; <hi>They made haste, they forgate.</hi> Like men that in sleep shake death by the hand, but when they are awake will not know him.</p>
               <p>It is storied of a rich Merchant, that in a great storme at Sea, vowed to <hi>Iupiter</hi> if he would saue him and his ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, to giue him a Hecatombe. The storme ceaseth, and he bethinkes himselfe that a Hecatombe was vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; he resolues on seuen Oxen. Another tempest comes, and now hee <hi>vowes</hi> againe the seuen at least. Deliuered then also, he thought that seuen were too many, and one Oxe vvould serue the turne. Yet another perill comes, and now he <hi>vowes</hi> solemnely to fall no lower: if he might be rescued, an Oxe <hi>Iupiter</hi> shall haue. Againe freed, the Oxe stickes in his stomacke, and hee would faine dravv his deuotion to a lower rate; a Sheepe vvas sufficient. But at last being set ashore, hee thought a Sheepe too much; and purposeth to carry to the Altar onely a few Dates. But by the way, he eates vp the Dates, and layes on the Altar onely the shels. After this rate doe many performe their <hi>vowes.</hi> They promise whole Hecatombes in sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; but they reduce them lower and lower still, as they grow vvell. He that <hi>vowed</hi> to build an Hospitall; to restore an Impropriation to the Church; to lay open his inclosures, and to serue God with an honest heart: brings all at last to a poore reckoning; and thinkes to please the Lord with his empty shells. There vvas some hope of this mans soules health, vvhiles his body was sicke: but as his body riseth to strength, his soule falls to vveake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>It is the reproach of Rome; <hi>No peny, no Pater noster:</hi> let it not be our reproach and reproofe too; No plague, no Pater-noster; no punishments, no prayers. Thy <hi>vowes</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:25651:122"/>

               <p>Well then Beloued; if wee haue vowed a lawfull vow to the Lord, let vs pay it.

               <p>You see all the parts of this Song: the whole comfort or harmony of all is <hi>Praising God.</hi> I haue shewed you <hi>Quo loco,</hi> in his <hi>house: Quo modo,</hi> with <hi>burnt offerings: Quo animo, paying</hi> our <hi>vowes.</hi> Time hath abridged this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, contrary to my promise and purpose.</p>

            <p>I am sure, Gods law giues tythes to his Church: but say they, that Law is abolished; repealed by a new Act of Parliament. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle frees vs from the olde Law.

And yet they hope not to be saued by the Law, but by the Gospell.</p>
            <p>The Apostle saith, <hi>Part of all;</hi> why then not the tenth part, vvhich God at the first commanded, and custome in all ages commended? That part once assigned of God, should preuent all arbitrary disposing of men. What Landlord leaues it to his Tenant, to pay him vvhat rent he list?

I haue read, that the <hi>Sophy</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> beeing to send a great summe of money for an offering to <hi>Mahomet</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> would send none of his owne coyne; for that he said was gotten by ill meanes: but exchanged it with English Merchants, because theirs was gotten honestly, and with a good conscience. So it may bee, you thinke that your owne vniust moneys, and extorted commings in by the ruine of your Tenants, is no good offering to GOD. But the Church-mans liuing comes honestly, and with a good conscience; and therefore you will take that, to offer your sacrifice of almes to God. But heerein you come short of the <hi>Persian:</hi> you doe not giue your owne Lordships and lands in exchange. Yet me thinkes, if spirituall liuings must be giuen to the poore, you might suffer the Church to giue her owne. I could neuer finde eyther <hi>in Albo Praetorum,</hi> or <hi>in Rubrica Martyrum,</hi> how the Laity was deputed to this stewardship.

Behold the <hi>Proportion;</hi> punishments respondent to the sinnes.</p>
               <p>Here is sufficient cause to make the wicked tremble; God hath proportioned out a iudgement for their sins. Man by his wickednesse, cuts out a garment of confusion for his owne backe. I know that this kind of punishing is not alwayes executed in this world. Gods temporall Iudgements are (like our Quarter Sessions) kept here and there. Some; much; yea most is reserued for another world. If all sinne were punished here, we should looke no further.

Yes; first an infinite God is offended, and a finite man is the offender. Because he cannot be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of an infinite wrath at once, he must haue it in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: the short dimensions of his Essence, must haue a long extention of his punishment: what wants in place, must be supplied in time.

               <p>Secondly, he that delights in sinne, desires it may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continue: and <hi>velle peccatum, est peccatum:</hi> so that an infinite desire, must needs haue an infinite punishment. <hi>Qui moritur sine poenitentia, si semper viueret, semper pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caret.</hi> He that dies without repentance, if he should euer liue, would euer sinne.

The Grace of God is two-fold.

A sparke of fire falling vpon water, ice, snow, goes out: on wood, flaxe, or such apt matter, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles. Baptisme is the Sacrament of admission into the Congregation; of Insition and Initiation, whereby vve are matriculated, and receiued into the motherhood of the Church. Therefore the sacred Font is placed at the Church-doore, to insinuate and signifie our <hi>Entrance.</hi> So <hi>Adoption</hi> is the first <hi>doore</hi> or <hi>gate,</hi> whereby wee passe to the <hi>Citie</hi> of glory.</p>
               <p>This is our new Creation, whereat the <hi>Angels</hi> of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <hi>reioyce.</hi> Luke 15.

Our Generation was <hi>A non esse, ad esse:</hi> from not being, to be. But our Regeneration is <hi>A malè esse, ad benè esse,</hi> from a being euill, to be well; and that for euer.

               <p>Now if you would be sure, that you are gone through this <hi>gate;</hi> call to mind what hath been your Repentance. The first signe of Regeneration is throbbes and throwes: you cannot be <hi>adopted</hi> to Christ without sensible paine, and compunction of heart for your sinnes. The Christian hath two Birthes, and they are two <hi>gates:</hi> hee can passe through none of them but with anguish. Both our first and second Birth begin with crying.

               <p>In a cleare <hi>eye</hi> the looker sees his owne image: so God in a sanctified vnderstanding sees a limited resemblance of his infinite selfe. And as some Physicians say, that if loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in a sicke mans eyes, they see their image, there is hope of life: but the want of this resultance is held an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of instant death: whereby they giue themselues a prognosticke signe, whether the Patient will dye of that sicknesse, or recouer it; by the reflection of his <hi>eyes.</hi> But it is certaine, if Gods image be not in the vnderstanding, <hi>instat mors animae,</hi> the soule is in danger: if it shine there, there is comfort of life, yea life of comfort. Hence it is that the <hi>God of this world</hi> doth so striue to <hi>blind the minds of them that beleeue not; ne imago Dei<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. that the light of</hi>

               </head>
               <p>Of this spirituall <hi>eye</hi> is in the Soule. God framing mans soule, planted in it two faculties: the Superior, that is the Vnderstanding, which perceiueth and iudgeth: the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, that is the <hi>will,</hi> which being enformed of the other, accordingly followes or flies, chuseth or refuseth. The Scripture fauouring the simplest capacity, compares these two powers of the soule, to two knowne parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The <hi>vnderstanding</hi> to the <hi>Eye;</hi> the <hi>Affections</hi> to the <hi>Foote:</hi> the <hi>eye</hi> directing, the <hi>foote</hi> walking. Euery man is naturally borne blinde and lame: as <hi>Zedekiah</hi> captiuated to the King of Babylon; first they <hi>put out his eyes,</hi> and then <note place="margin">2. King. 25. 7.</note> they lamed <hi>his feete with fetters of brasse.</hi> So is euery man by nature; and therefore easily made a slaue to the king of infernall Babylon, if the mercy of Christ should not redeeme him. This consideration reacheth foorth to vs two vses: the one of Instruction, the other of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This teacheth vs to desire in the first place, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning</hi> of our <hi>eyes;</hi> and then after, the strengthening of our feete. So that sweet Prophet ordereth his prayers, Psal. 25. First <hi>Shew me thy wayes, O Lord: teach mee thy paths.</hi> Then <hi>Lead me in thy truth.</hi> First, cleare my eyes, <note place="margin">Psal. 25. 4. 5.</note> then enable my feete, Psal. 119. <hi>Make mee to vnderstand</hi>

Swift horses without a skilfull waggoner, endanger more. Hee that labours for feet before he hath eyes, takes a preposterous course: for of the two, the lame is more likely to come to his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes end, then the blind. Could hee runne as swift as
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:25651:150"/>
                  <hi>Hazael,</hi> and outstrip the young Hart on the mountaines; yet being blinde, he would hardly hitte the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. There is but one way thither; by-paths innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable: it is a thousand to one against him, that he mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the right. If he be set into it, yet there are so many blockes, rubbes, obstacles put before him by the Deuill, and the world; that hee can no more goe into the true way, then he could discerne it from the false. But if a man hath eyes, there is hope he will creepe to heauen, though on lame feet. Hee sees where Ierusalem stands, and hath direction for the way; (as trauellers in scroles; from such a village to such a city, &amp;c.) so the word of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes his iourney; From <hi>Faith to vertue, from vertue to knowledge, from knowledge to temperance, from temperance</hi>

               <p>What more then a world of happinesse doth this mans eye not see! Hereupon wee call a meere foole a naturall. The worldlings haue esteemed, and misnamed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Gods fooles: but wee know them the fooles of the world. The greatest Philosopher is but a sot to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest Christian: therefore Philosophy (vnbaptized vvith grace) is said to be monoculate, to haue but one eye, and that is of naturall Reason; a left eye of the soule. But the Christian hath two eyes: the left eye of Reason, whereby he may see into the secrets of nature, as farre as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher: and the right eye of faith, which the other want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot conceiue the <hi>mystery of godlinesse.</hi> This <note n="f" place="margin">1.

                  <hi>If any of you lacke wisedome, let him aske of God.</hi> The first Character our forefathers taught vs, was Christs Crosse.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Our spirituall blindnesse came vpon vs by Gods iust curse for our sinnes. As the Philistins put out <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> eyes, for his many mischiefes done them: so GOD on farre greater cause blinded <hi>Adam,</hi> and his perpetuall issue. He had pure and good knowledge; but because his ambition was <hi>appetere prohibitum,</hi> to desire that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden: his punishment was <hi>perdere concessum,</hi> to lose that hee had. Now the same hand that layd on this penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, must take it off. The blind men in the Gospell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer'd not their sight till Christ came. They were as types to vs; to teach vs that only the Spirit of Christ can restore our spirituall eyes. Therefore of this <note n="h" place="margin">Reue. 3. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Spirit</hi> are

we <hi>counselled to buy eye-salue, to annoint our eyes, that vvee may see.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This originall defect is encreased by actuall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions. We were borne ignorant, wee haue made our selues blind; putting out euen that remaining sparke of nature. Wee <note n="i" place="margin">Phil. 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>mind earthly things:</hi> setting not onely our <note n="k" place="margin">Colos. 3. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>affections,</hi> but euen fixing our whole knowledge on this World. And it is impossible that mans eye should looke on earth and heauen also at one instant. It is a rule in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy; Nothing receiues any thing, but that is emptie of all other things of a contrary nature. The eare must be empty of all sounds, the taste of all sauours, the eye of all colours; before there can be entertainement giuen to a new obiect. The smell possessed with Rew, cannot sent the Rose: the taste infected with gall, imagines all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels bitter: and a greene glasse held before the eyes, presents all things looked on, greene. So if the soules eye be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp with the gawdy vanities of this py'd world, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discerne the things, that concerne euerlasting peace. The <hi>vnderstanding</hi> then must be with-drawn from earth, that it may contemplate heauen. This confutes their practices, that haue vowed a Monkish life, addicted to speculation &amp; eying of heauen; yet are perpetually raking in the mudde of the earth to get money; with an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie of reconciling these two opposite obiects to their eyes at once. In vaine they lift vp ceremoniall eyes of a forc'd deuotion; for the eye of their heart is fixed down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: Vnlesse they haue squint-ey'd soules, that can looke two wayes at once. But I rather think, that like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen, they looke one way, and rowe another: for hee must needs be strangely squint-ey'd, that can at the same instant fasten one of his lights on the light of glory, &amp; the other on the darknes of iniquitie. The riches aboue and below are remote things; <hi>Quorum dum aliud contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim aspicimus, aliud contemptim despicimus:</hi> vvhereof whiles we admire the one, we vilipend the other.

his conscience begins to wake, he sings her asleep againe. And as in some, the fuliginous vapours arising from the lower parts of the body, blinde the eyes: so in him the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous euaporations of the fleshes lusts, haue caused abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute blindnesse.

               <p n="2">2. There is another disease, called the Pearle in the eye; a dangerous disease, and heereof are all worldlings sicke: for earthly riches is such a pearle in their eye, that they cannot see the pearle of the Gospell, which the wise <hi>Merchant</hi> sold all he had to purchase. By distrusting and distracting cares of the world, this intellectuall eye is not onely depraued, but depriued of light. <hi>Affectio mundi, infectio animi:</hi> our soules are affected, infected with this contagion. We are easily inclined, and declined from our supernall blisse, by doting loue of these transient delights. And <hi>vbi amor, ibi oculus:</hi> the eye followes the heart, with more diligence then a seruant his Master. Now it is no wonder if that eye be blinde, which the Deuill hath daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vp with the dirt of this world! Couetousnesse is an Ingrosser, whersoeuer it dwells: and as it would ingrosse the whole Vniuerse to it vnsatiate selfe, so it takes vp the whole soule, with all the affections and desires of it. It giues euery member and faculty presse-mony, and bindes all their contention to get riches. It leaues not so much as an eye for our selues, not a thought for God. <hi>Quicquid</hi>

This pearle then must be cut out of the worldlings eye, vvith the sharpe knife of repentance; otherwise he is likely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to see heauen. For it may be well said to them, as the Philosopher answered to some, that asked him curious questions of the world; whether it had a soule, whether it were round, &amp;c. <hi>Vos de mundo solliciti estis, &amp; vestram immunditiem non c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the world, but idle neglecters of your vnclean selues. These are the <hi>Diseases:</hi> there is also a double defect in this naturall <hi>Eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It perceiues onely naturall and externall things; <hi>qua ante pedes sunt;</hi> which lie at their feete, 2. Pet. 1. For <hi>It cannot see a farre off.</hi> It beholds only the barque or <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 9.</note> rinde; but not the inward vertue. It can perceiue vvhat thy riches are, thy house adorned, thy lands tilled, thy grounds stocked: but not those spirituall blessings, and celestiall priuiledges, that belong to thee as thou art a Christian. It iudgeth the Cabinet by the Lether and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, not by the costly iewels in it. It may see <hi>Iobs</hi> outward affliction, not his inward consolation. If God swells their garners with plenteous fruits, and fills their bones with marrow, this they see: but the <hi>hope of Gods calling,</hi> the comforts of the Gospell, the sauing health of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and the promises of eternall life, they not see. The world is their circumference; other things <hi>Nec capiunt, nec cupiunt; neque tenent manibus, nec cernunt oculis;</hi> they neyther comprehend nor couet; neither hold, nor behold them.</p>
               <p>A beast hath one kinde of eye, a naturall man two, a Christian three. The beast hath an eye of Sense, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man of Sense and Reason, the Christian of Sense, of Reason, and of Faith. Each of these hath his seuerall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, seuerall intentions. The eye of sense regards onely sensuall things: the eye of reason onely sensible and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things: the eye of faith, spirituall, supernall, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall things.</p>
               <p>The eye of sense doth not extend to intelligible things, and matters of discourse. Tell a bruit beast of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and the conclusions of nature, he vnderstands you not. The belly of Sense hath no eares for such instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Let it be fed, nourished, haue the appetite deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: of further felicitie it hath neyther notion, nor
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:25651:154"/>
motion. <hi>Nec noscit, nec poscit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eye of Reason sees further then that of Sense; and hath (more then common Sense) a rationall and discur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue apprehension of intelligible obiects. For the bodies of creatures, the bruites see them as well as man, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps some better: but in these bodies he perceiues hidden vertues, obiectuall to the scope of vnderstanding, which the beast cannot see. I confesse that many a man is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue in the graduall ascents of reason. Tell a rusticke or mechanicke that the Sun is greater then the whole earth, or that a little starre is larger then his car-wheele; and he derides thy boldnesse, and thinkes thou wouldst be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for telling alye. Though this by the eye of mature reason is discerned perfect truth.</p>
               <p>The eye of Faith sees further then both the former; for it lookes into the <hi>hope of our calling, and the glorious inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints.</hi> The Christian hath not onely an eye of Sense co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with beasts; nor an eye of reason com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with men; but also an eye of faith proper to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. Wherein he goes beyond the naturall man, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the naturall man goes beyond the beast. The vnregenerate liuesall his dayes in a mist: he cannot looke vp to heauen; in comparison whereof that world he sees, is but a base moale-hill; and himselfe is like a blind moale, digging in it. Yea in this very world, his owne proper element, how little doth he truely perceiue! There is no herbe or flower hee treads on, that he truely knowes. Yea he is a stranger at home, and is ignorant of what is in his owne bosome. But for things that concerne a better world, he hath no insight. <hi>The naturall man perceiueth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishnesse vnto</hi>

                  <hi>him; neyther can hee know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</hi> Those things are incredible, impossible to him, which we build our faiths on. <hi>Happy</hi> then are their <hi>eyes that see these things.</hi> In matters of the world our sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity moues pity, or makes sport: let it content vs, that

these losses are requited by our spirituall knowledge, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further into better matters.

               <p>I cannot leaue this excellent Organ, the <hi>eye;</hi> till I haue shewed you two things. 1. The danger of spirituall blindnesse. 2. The meanes to cure it.</p>

we compare it with naturall. The bodies eye may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spared then the soules. As to want the eyes of Angels, is farre worse then to want the eyes of beasts. The want of corporal sight is often good, not euill: euil in the sense, good in the consequence. He may the better intend hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things, that sees no earthly to drawe him away. Many a mans eye hath done him hurt. <hi>The sonnes of God</hi>

Per oculorum beneficium intrat cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis veneficium.</hi> The lightning of lust hath scorched the heart through those windowes. <hi>Malus oculus, malus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> An euill eye makes an euill mind. The Apostle speakes of <hi>eyes full of adultery:</hi> it is a feareful thing to haue an eye great with whoredome. And there be eyes full of couetousnesse, lusting after the grounds and goods of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men: as <hi>Ahabs eye</hi> was full of <hi>Nabaoths</hi> vineyard. But <hi>non tutum est conspicere, quod non licitum est concupisce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> Let not thine eye be enamoured of that, which thy heart must not couet. You see therefore, that sometimes the losse of corporall sight doth the soule good: and the eye of faith sees the better, because the eye of flesh sees not at all.</p>
               <p>Besides, the bodily blind feeles and acknowledgeth his want of sight: but the spiritually thinks that none haue clearer eyes then himselfe. He that wants corporall eyes, blesseth them that see: this man derides &amp; despiseth them. Their blindnesse is therefore more dangerous, <hi>Qui suam ignorant ignorantiam;</hi> that <hi>know not they are blind,</hi> as <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi> Reue. 3.

                  <hi>If yee were blind, yee should not haue sinne: but now yee say, We see, therefore your sinne remaineth.</hi> The blind in body is commonly led either by his seruant, or his wife, or his dogge: there may be yet some respect in these guides. But the blind in soule is led by the world, which should be his seruant, is his traytor: or by the flesh, which should be as a wife, is his harlot: or by the deuill, which is a dog

               <p>Now the meanes to cleare this <hi>Eye,</hi> is to get it a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, of our selues. That the <hi>eye</hi> may be cured, this knowledge must be procured.</p>

3. That there be a proportionall distance betwixt the organ and the obiect: neither too neere, nor too far off. A bright thing held too neere the sight, confounds it: be it neuer so bright, if too farre off, it cannot discerne it. God hath sweetly ordered and compounded this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Those euerlasting ioyes are not close by our eyes, lest the glory should swallow vs vp: for mortall eyes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not behold immortall things; nor our corruptible sight see stedfastly that eternall splendor. <hi>Who can see God, and liue?</hi> And though you say, it is the soule that sees; yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen this soule, whiles it is prisoned in this muddy vaile, or rather Iayle, the flesh, hath by reason of the others im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency and passiblenesse, a thicke cloud cast betweene it selfe and glory. <note n="o" place="margin">1.

And the subiect of this spectacle is by demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prooued solid and substantiall: because<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing but that can giue this intellectuall eye firme content and complacency. How go the affections of man in a rolling and ranging pace from one creature to another! now thy heart is set vpon wealth; thou wilt haue it, though thou digge for it <hi>in visceribus</hi> both <hi>matris &amp; filiorum;</hi> in the bowels of the earth, and of the sonnes of the earth. Say wealth is come, thou art then for honor: thy riches are a ladder, whereby thou wouldest climbe to dignity. <hi>Dede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet diuitem esse ignobilem.</hi> Nobility gotten hath not set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thee: thou art trauersing new desires.

Wealth and greatnesse commands thy pleasure; thy lust is answered: then thou art for musike, and so actest a fourth part; thou art thine owne fidler. Now thy bloud is to be heated with delicates; thou must be indulgent to thy throat with lust-prouoking meates; and so playest yet another part, a Cater to vncleannesse. When all is done,</p>

               </p>
               <p>When thou hast thus wandred, and beg'd of euery poore creature a scrap of comfort, yet thou art but claw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cloyed with variety, with vanity; not contented.

mans own heart. The fire flieth to his sphere, the stone falleth to his center, the riuers run to the sea, as to their end and rest; and are but violently detained in any other place. The needle touched with the Loadstone, stands euer trembling and quiuering, till it enioy the full aspect of the Northerne Pole. Thus the Lord is onely our Center; the very life of satisfaction; full of perfect and infallible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and he alone can content the boundlesse apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this intellectuall <hi>eye.</hi> All other are but shadowes and vanities, but this matter obiected in my Text, satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.

3. Others yet haue interiected such obscure and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy clouds, between their sight and this Sunne of glory, that they cannot see. Whether of errors, that darken the light of the truth: Or of affected ignorance, that blindes their owne eyes: Or of blasphemous Atheisme; they will see nothing, but what they doe see. <note n="a" place="margin">2.

They cannot see the way to blisse, they haue blinded themselues; interposed such clouds betwixt them and heauen, that this <hi>glorious light</hi> cannot shine vnto them. There must be then a clearer space: and this God grants to faith. <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 7. 55. 56.</note> 
                  <hi>Stephen full of the holy Ghost, looked vp stedfastly into heauen, and saw the glory of GOD,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold, I see the heauens open, and the Sonne of man stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the right hand of God.</hi> Though this bee taken for more then a spirituall sight; yet hence we haue this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; that our eyes of Faith shall see God now in Grace, and our eyes of flesh heereafter in glory.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Lastly, the obiect must be stable and firme, for if it moue too swiftly, it dazeleth the eye, and cannot be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (according to the perfect forme of it) beholden.

            <p>First we haue the <hi>Rich man,</hi> vers. 16. prospering in his wealth: not onely in the vsurious gaines, which his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <note place="margin">Prosperity permitted to the wicked.</note> fraud, oppression, or vniust dealing might get: but euen in those things which God by the hand of nature did reach forth to him. For his <hi>ground brought forth plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully.</hi> So deepe a draught haue the wicked often drunk in the common cup of blessings. <hi>Their Bull gendreth and faileth not: their Cow calueth and casteth not. They spend</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iob 21. 10.</note>

               <note place="margin">Psal. 73. 5. 7.</note> 
               <hi>they plagued like others.</hi> There they haue exemption from misery. <hi>Their eyes stand out for fatnesse: they haue more then heart could wish.</hi> There they haue accumulation of felicity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we haue him caring what to doe, vers. 17. <note place="margin">Care keepes wealth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</note> He had so much gaine, so much graine; that his roomes could not answere the capacity of his heart. <hi>What shall I doe, because I haue no roome, where to bestow my fruits?</hi> Care is the inseparable companion of aboundance. <hi>Vnâ recipiuntur diuitiae &amp; solicitudo.</hi> They, to whom is giuen most wealth, are most giuen to carking, sharking, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous thoughtfulnesse, with a little inuersion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours meaning; <hi>Where is much giuen, there is much,</hi> yea more <hi>required.</hi> Those hearts whom the world hath done most to satisfie, are least of all satisfied: still they require more, and perplexe themselues to get it. A reasonable man would thinke, that they who possesse abundant ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, should not be possessed with abundant cares. But <hi>care not for to morrow,</hi> saith Christ. <hi>Cuius enim diei spatium</hi>

Thirdly, wee haue his resolution; which in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, hath a double succession (though no successe) for their disposed order and places. <hi>This will I doe,</hi> vers. 18. what? 1. <hi>I will pull downe my barnes, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.</hi> He thinks of no roome <hi>in visceribus pauperum,</hi> in the bowels of the poore: which the Lord hath proposed to him, a fit recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of his superfluity. He mindes not to build an hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or to repaire a Church; eyther <hi>in cultum Christi,</hi> or <hi>culturam Christiani:</hi> to the worship of Christ, or educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of orphanes, or consolation of distressed soules: but onely respects <hi>Horreum suum,</hi> and <hi>Hordeum suum:</hi> his <hi>Barne</hi> and his barley. The want of roome troubles him: his haruest was so great, that he is crop-sicke. The sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make of his <hi>Barne</hi> is too little to hold that surfet of corne he intends it; and therfore in anger he will pull it downe, and make it answerable to his owne desires. 2. This hee takes as granted, and vpon the new building of his <hi>Barne,</hi> he builds his rest, ver. 19. Then <hi>I will say to my soule; Soule, thou hast much goods laid vp for many yeeres, take thine ease, eate, drinke, and be merry.</hi> He dreames his belly full, and now his pipes goe: he sings <hi>requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>em,</hi> and lullabies his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the cradle of his barne. This sweet newes hee whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to his soule. Though he had wearied his body with incessant toyles, and made it a gally-slaue to his imperious affection: yet his soule had beene especially disquieted, and therefore hee promiseth his soule some ease. In this indulgent promise, there is a Preface, and a Solace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Preface assures his soule <hi>much goods,</hi> and <hi>many yeares; multas diuitias, multos annos.</hi> He knew that a scant and sparing proffer would not satisfie his boundlesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: there must be shew of an abundant impletion. It is not enough to haue an ample rocke or dista<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e of wealth, vnlesse a longeuall time be afforded to spinne it out. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loxenus</hi> his wish coupled with his pleasant viands a long throat, (Crane-like); to prorogue his delight: for short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:25651:162"/>
doth somewhat abate sweetnesse. <hi>Rex horae,</hi> a king of one houre can scarce warme his throne: it keeps a Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass-lord flat, that he knowes his end. If this man had bin his own Lord, how excellent an estate would hee haue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His Farme should haue been so large, and his lease so long, that I doubt whether <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise had a greater Lordship, or <hi>Metbushalem</hi> a longer life. The last of his desires is of the longest size: giue him much <hi>goods,</hi> and much <hi>time,</hi> abundance of ioyes, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of dayes; and you hitte or fitte the length of his foote.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Solace is a daunce of foure paces; <hi>Take thine ease, eate, drinke, and be merry.</hi> The full belly loues an easie Chaire; he must needs ioyne with his laborious surfets the vacation of sleepe. He hath taken great paines to bring death vpon him; and now standing at his dore, it heares him talke of <hi>ease.</hi> He promiseth himselfe that, which he trauells to destroy, life: and euen now ends what he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to begin. So worldlings weary and weare out their liues to hoord wealth: and when wealth comes, &amp; health goes, they would giue all for life. O fooles! in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all quest of riches, to hunt themselues out of breath; and then be glad to restore all at once for recouerie. The next <hi>pace</hi> is, <hi>Eate:</hi> his bones must not onely be pleased, but his belly. It is somewhat yet, that this man resolues at last no more to pinch his guts: therefore what before he was in their debt, he will pay them with the vsury of surfets. He purposeth to make himselfe of a thinne starueling, a fatte Epicure; and so to translate <hi>Parcum</hi> into <hi>Porcum.</hi> The third pace is, <hi>Drinke:</hi> where gluttony is bid vvelcome, there is no shutting out of drunkennesse. You shall not take a <hi>Nabal,</hi> but he plyes his gobblet, as well as his tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. And this is a ready course to retire himselfe from his former vexation; to drowne his cares in Wine. The last pace is a Leualto; <hi>Be merry:</hi> When hee hath got iunkets in his belly, and vvines in his braine, what should he doe,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:25651:162"/>
but leape, dance, reuell, <hi>be merry,</hi> be mad! After feasting, must follow iesting. Heere be all the foure passages: he <hi>sleepes</hi> care away, he <hi>eates</hi> care away, he <hi>drinks</hi> care away, and now he sings care away. His pipes be full, and they must needes squeak, though the name of the good, yea the name of GOD be dishonoured. But to such a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merry scoffer might well be applied that verse, which was sounded in the eare of a great Rimer dying: <hi>Desine ludere temerè, nitere properè surgere, de puluere.</hi> Leaue playing, &amp; fall to praying: it is but sorry iesting with death. Thus his dance was like <hi>Sardanapalus; Ede, bibe, lude:</hi> Eate, drinke, and be <hi>merry:</hi> but there is one thing marres all his sport; the bringing of his soule to iudgement. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth a merry life, and a long life; but death sayes nay to both. He gratifies his soule, &amp; ratifies his state; but cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens himselfe in all. It may be said of him, as King <hi>Iohn</hi> of the fatte Stagge dying; See how easily he hath liued, yet he neuer heard Masse. This was the sweet, but the sowre followes. <hi>Qui gaudebit cum mundo, non regnabit cum</hi>

Let our lesson hence be this.</p>
               <p>That our purposes may be sped with a happy successe, let vs intend in the Lord, for the Lord. 1. Let vs deriue authoritie of our intentions from his sacred Truth; which giues rules not onely to liue well, and to speake well, but euen <hi>ad bene c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:25651:164"/>
Whatsoeuer ye doe, yea or intend to doe, let both action of hand, and thought of heart be all to Gods glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let vs in all our purposes reserue the first place for Gods helping hand. <note n="f" place="margin">Iohn 15. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Without mee yee can doe nothing,</hi> saith Christ. But it is obiected that <hi>Paul</hi> spake peremptorily to his Corinthians. <note n="g" place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 5.</note>

                  <hi>I will goe to the house of the Lord.</hi> I answere, <hi>Cor tenet, quod lingua tacet:</hi> they that had so much grace in their hearts, wanted not this grace; <hi>et noscere et poscere facultatem Domini,</hi> to know and desire the Lords permission. You shall neuer take men so well affected to good workes, that doe not implore Gods assistance. Though they doe not euer expresse in vvord, yet they neuer suppresse in thought, that reseruation; <hi>If it please God,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> doth afterwards in that place; <note n="i" place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>If the Lord permit.</hi> If any will dare to resolue too confidently, patronizing their temeritie from such patterns; as if their <hi>voluntates</hi> were <hi>potestates,</hi> let them know that like Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, they haue measured others, but neuer tooke mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of themselues: that there is great difference betwixt a holy Propet or Apostle, and a profane Publican.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obserue, that God now speakes so to the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, that he will be heard: he preacheth another kind of Sermon to him then euer he did before: a fatall, finall, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Sermon, a Text of Iudgement; <hi>This night shal they fetch away thy soule.</hi> For this is Gods Lecture, himselfe reades it; <hi>But God said.</hi> Hee had preached to the vvord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling often before; and those Sermons were of three sorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By his Word. But <hi>cares</hi> of the world <hi>choake</hi> this <hi>Seed:</hi> the <hi>heart goes after couetousnesse;</hi> euen whiles the flesh sits vnder the pulpit. This is the deuills three-wing'd arrow, (wealth, pride, voluptuousnesse) vvhereby hee nailes the very heart fast to the earth. It is his talent of lead, which he hangs on the feet of the soule, the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:25651:164"/>
that keepes her from mounting vp into heauen: with the printed beauty of this filthy Harlot hee bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth their mindes, steales their desires from Christ, and sends them a whoring to the hote Stewes of hell. Thus is Gods first Sermon quite lost.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Iudgements on others, whose smart should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze him. For God, when hee strikes others, vvarnes thee, <hi>Tua res agitur, &amp;c.</hi> When the next house is on fire, thy cause is in question. God hath smitten Israel, that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> might feare. <hi>Though Israel play the Harlot, yet let not Iudah offend.</hi>

The Deuill hath hood-wink'd him with gaine; and so carries him quietly (like a hooded hawke) on his fist without baiting to hell. This Sermon is lost also.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By crosses on himselfe; and this Sermon comes a little neerer to him; for it concernes his feeling. The first was obiected to his eare, the second to his eye, this last to his sense. But as the first Sermon hee would not heare, the next not see, so this he will not feele: <note n="m" place="margin">Ier. 5. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>hee is stricken, but he hath not sorrowed.</hi> He imputes all to his ill lucke, that hee loseth the game of his worldly desires: he lookes no more vp to heauen, then if there was none. <note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 10. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>God is not in all his thoughts.</hi> All these Sermons are lost.</p>
               <p>But now God will be heard: <hi>He said;</hi> he spoke home; a word and a blow. He will be vnderstood, though not stood vnder. <hi>Uociferat, vulnerat: per dictum, per ictum.</hi> This is such a Sermon, as shall not passe without conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

               <p>The <hi>Soule,</hi> thy soule: not thy <hi>Barnes,</hi> nor thy croppe; neither the continent, nor content: not thy gods, which thou holdest deare; not thy body vvhich thou prizest dearer; but thy <hi>soule,</hi> which should bee to thee dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of all. Imagine the whole conuexe of heauen for thy <hi>Barne,</hi> (and that were one large enough) and all the riches of the world thy graine, (and that were crop suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:) yet put all these into one ballance, and thy <hi>soule</hi> into the other; and thy <hi>soule</hi> out-waighes, out-values the world. <hi>What is the whole world worth to him that loseth his soule?</hi> The Soule is of a precious nature.</p>
               <p>One in substance like the Sunne, yet of diuers ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. It is confined in the body, not refined by the body, but is often most actiue, when her layler is most dull. Shee is a carefull hous-wife, disposing all well at home; conseruing all formes, and mustring them to her owne seruiceable vse. The senses discerne the out-side, the circumstance, the huske of things: she the inside, the vertue, the marrow; resoluing effects into causes; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, comparing, contemplating things in their highest sublimity. Fire turnes coales into fire: the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy concocts meat into bloud; but the soule conuerts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into spirits; reducing their purest formes within her dimensiue lines. In mans composition there is a shadow of the Trinity. For to make vp one man, there is an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary body, a diuine soule, and a firmamentall spirit. Here is the difference: In God there are three persons in one essence, in vs three essences in one person. So in the Soule there is a trinity of powers, vegetable, sensitiue, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall:
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:25651:167"/>
the former would onely be; the second be, and be well; the third be, be well, and befor euer well. O ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent nature, in whose cabinet ten thousand formes may sit at once; which giues agitation to the body, without whom it would fall downe a dead and inanimate lumpe of clay. This <hi>Soule</hi> shall be required.</p>
               <p>Thy <hi>Soule</hi> which vnderstands what delight is; and conceiues a tickling pleasure in these couetous desires. But to satisfie thy soule, thou wouldst not be so greedy of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance: for a little serues the body. If it haue food to sustaine it, garments to hide it, harbour to shelter it, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to refresh it, it is contented. And satietie of these things doth not <hi>(reficere, sed interficere)</hi> comfort, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found it. Too much meat surfets the body, too much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell wearies it, too much wine drownes it: onely <hi>Quod conuenit, conseruat.</hi> It is then the soule that requires this plenitude, and therefore from this plenitude shall the <hi>Soule</hi> be required.</p>
               <p>Thy <hi>Soule,</hi> which is not made of a perishing nature, as the body; but of an euerlasting substance: And hath by the eternity therof a capablenes of moreioy, or moresorrow: it must be euer in heauen, or euerin hell. This night must this <hi>Soule</hi> receiue her doome; thy <hi>Soule</hi> shall be required.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Soule</hi> which shall be the bodies perpetuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, sauing a short diuorce by the hand of death in the graue: but afterwards ordained to an euerlasting re-vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whereas all worldly goods being once broken off by death, can neuer againe be recouered. The soule shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the body, but riches to neyther; and this <hi>Soule</hi> must be required.</p>
               <p>This is a losse, a crosse beyond all, that the worldlings imagination can giue being to. How differ the vvickeds thoughts dying, from their thoughts liuing! In the daies of their peace they forget to get for the soule any good. Eyther it must rest it selfe on these inferiour props, or des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of refuge. The eye is not scanted of lustfull obiects,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:25651:168"/>
the eare of melodious sounds, the palate of well rellishing viands. But the soules <hi>eye</hi> is not fastned on heauen, nor her <hi>eares</hi> on the Word of God: her <hi>taste</hi> sauours not the bread of life; she is neither brought to <hi>touch,</hi> nor to <hi>smell</hi> on Christs <hi>Vesture. Animas habent, quasi inanimata vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vunt:</hi> regarding their flesh, as that pamperd Romane did his; and their soules as he esteemed his horse: who being a spruce, neat, and fatte Epicure, &amp; riding on a leane scrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Iade, was asked by the <hi>Censors</hi> the reason. His answer was, <hi>Ego curo meipsum, statius verò equum:</hi> I looke to my selfe, but my man to my horse. So these worldlings looke to their bodies, let who will take care of their soules.</p>
               <p>But when this night comes, with what a price would they purchase againe their Soules, so morgag'd to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill for a little vanitie! Now <hi>curare non volunt,</hi> then <hi>recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perare non valent.</hi> With what studious and artificiall cost is the body adorned, whiles the beggerly soule lyes in totterd ragges! The flesh is pleased with the purest flowre of the Wheat, and reddest bloud of the grape, the soule is famished. The body is allowed libertie, euen to licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, the Soule is vnder Satans locke and key, shack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the fetters of ignorance and impietie. At this nights terrour, to what bondage, hunger, cold, calamitie, would they not subiect their bodies; to free their soules out of that friendlesse and endlesse prison! Why cannot men thinke of this before it be too late? It will sound harshly in thine eare, O thou riotous or auarous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, when this Passing-bell rings; <hi>Thy soule shall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> If the Prince should confiscate thy goods, which thou louest so dearly, this newes would strike cold to thy heart: but here thy <hi>soule</hi> is confiscate.

               <p>In this darke <hi>Quando</hi> lie hid two fearefull extremities; Sadnesse, and Suddennesse. It is not onely said, In the <hi>night,</hi> but in <hi>This night.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Night;</hi> this aggrauates the horror of his iudgement. The <hi>night</hi> is a sad and vncomfortable time: therefore misery is compared to the <hi>Night,</hi> and ioy said to come in the <hi>Morning. Pray that your flight be not in the night,</hi> saith Christ to the Iewes; as if the dismall time would make desperate their sorow. The night presents to the fantasie, which then lies most patient of such impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, many deceiuing and affrightfull imaginations. Well then may a true (not fantasied) terror worke strongly on this wretches heart, whiles the night helps it forward. All sicknesse is generally stronger by night, then by day: this very circumstance of season then aggrauates his miserie; making at once his greefe stronger, himselfe vveaker.</p>
               <p>But what if wee looke further then the literall sense;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:25651:170"/>
and conceiue by this night the darknesse of his soule? Such a blindnesse as he brings on himselfe, though the day of the Gospell be broke round about him. The cause of night to a man, is the interposition of the earth betwixt him and the Sunne. This worldling hath placed the earth, the thicke and grosse body of riches, betweene his eyes and the Sunne of righteousnesse. And so shine the Sunne neuer so cleare, it is still night with him. There is light enough without him, but there is darknesse too much within him. And then darkenesse must to darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; inward to outward, as Christ calls it, <hi>vtter darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> He would not see whiles he might, hee shall not see when he would. Though hee shall for euer haue fire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, yet it shall giue him no light: except it bee a little glimmering, to shew him the torments of others, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the torments of himselfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This night,</hi> the sadnesse is yet encreased by the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainnesse. It will be fearefull, not onely to bee surprised in the night, but in that night when hee doth not dreame of any such matter; when there is no feare, nor suspition of apprehension. His case is, as with a man that hauing rested with a pleasing slumber, and beene fedde with a golden dreame; suddenly waking findes his house fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming about his eares, his wife and children dying in the fire, robbers ransacking his coffers, and transporting his goods, all louers forsaking, no friend pitying, when the very thrusting in of an arme might deliuer him. This rich man was long asleepe, and beene delighted with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wanton dreames, of enlarged <hi>barnes,</hi> and plentifull har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uests; (as all worldly pleasures are but waking dreames) now he starts vp on the hearing of this Soule-knell, and perceiues all was but a dreame; and that indeed hee is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastingly wretched.</p>
               <p>The suddennes encreaseth the misery. The rich man hath no time to dispose his goods, how shall he doe with his soule? If in his health, wealth, peace, strength; suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:25651:171"/>
with all the helps of nature, of opportunity, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell, counsell of ministers, comfort of friends, he would not worke out his saluation: what shall hee doe when extreame pangs deny capablenesse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, and shortnesse of his time preuents their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to him? He hath a huge bottome of sinne to vnrauell by repentance, which he hath beene many years winding vp by disobedience: now a great worke, and a little time doe not well agree. This sudden call is feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>This night</hi> shall thy soule be required. Yet before I part from this point, let me giue you two notes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is mercy in God, that it is <hi>hac nocte,</hi> this <hi>night;</hi> not this <hi>houre,</hi> not this moment. <hi>Hac nocte</hi> vvas suddaine, but <hi>hoc momento</hi> had beene more sudden; and that this larger exhibition of time is allowed, was Gods meere mercy, against the worldlings merit. He that spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Niniueh many forties of yeares, will yet allow her forty daies. He that forbore this wretch many daies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing <note place="margin">Ionas 3. 4.</note> no fruit worth his expectation, will yet adde a few houres. God in the midst of iustice remembers mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: much time he had receiued, and abused; yet he shall haue a little more. When the Lords hand is lifted vp to strike him, yet he giues him some <hi>lucida interualla moniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> warning before he lets it downe. But let not the worldling presume on this: sometimes, not an houre, not a minute is granted. Sword, Palsie, Apoplexie, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postume makes quicke dispatch: and there is no space gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to cry for mercy. But what if a paucity of houres be permitted? ancient wounds are not cured in haste, the plaister must lie long vpon them. There was one man so saued, to take away desperation: and but one so saued, to <note place="margin">Vnuslatio in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne poenituit: vnus quidem vt null<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="2">2. The day of the wicked turnes at last to a night. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the day of vanity, comes the night of iudgment. Now is the time, when the rich mans Sunne sets; his light and his delight is taken from him. His last sand is runne out; the clocke hath ended his latest minute, his <hi>night</hi> is come.

               <p>This day to some may be distinguished into twelue houres. The first giues vs natiuity; euen in this houre there is sin; an originall prauity, indisposition to good, pronenesse to euill. Secondly, Infancy; God now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects the cradle. Thirdly, Childhood; and now we learn to speake and to sweare together; the sap of iniquity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to put out. Fourthly, Tender age, wherein toyes and gawdes fill vp our scene. Fiftly, Youth: this is a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, a gadding time. <hi>Remember not the sins of this time,</hi>

God that could not be heard before for the loud noyse of vanity, now looks for audience, for obedience. Seuenthly, This is full of cares &amp; crosses; the dugs of the world taste bitter; it is full time that this houre should weane vs. Eightly, Brings vs to a sense of mortality, we feele our bloud decaying. Ninthly, Our bodies goe crooked and stooping, to put vs in minde that they are going to their originall earth. Tenthly, We are euen as dying: we do dye by degrees: our senses first faile vs, our eyes are dimme like old <hi>Isaacs,</hi> our eares deafe, our taste dull: our grinders are done, our stilts vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to support vs. Eleuenthly, We are a burden to our selues, to our friends: we long for death, if any hope of a better life hath possessed our hearts. The twelfth houre

I knovv, that God cuts many one short of most of these houres, and often shuts vp his day-light, before hee comes to his noone. But howsoeuer man passe from Infancy to child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, from childhood to youth, from youth to age: yet <hi>senectutem nemo excedit;</hi> none can be more then olde. Though <hi>tam senex nemo, quin putet se annum posse viuere;</hi> no man is so old, but still he thinks hee may liue another yeare.

               <p>God allowes this liberall time to some: but what ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are we to our selues, that of all these twelue houres, allow our selues not one! Many post off their conuersion from day to day, sending Religion afore them to thirty, and then putting it off to forty; and not pleased yet to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertake it, promise it entertainment at threescore: at last death comes and allowes not one houre. In youth men resolue to allow themselues the time of age to serue God: in age they shuffle it off to sicknesse; when sicknes comes, care to dispose their goods, lothnesse to dye, hope to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape martyrs that good thought; and their resolution still keepes before them the length of Gracious street at least.

               <p>God often in the Scriptures hath promised to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the fatherlesse, and to prouide for those, whom the Parents faith haue left to his protection.

Leaue not thy children the inheritance of thy sinne, turne not the prouidence of God from them by iniquitie, who hath promised to protect them, if co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to him. Loe the wit of a worldly man! he takes thought to make his children rich, and yet takes the onely course to vndoe them. No casualtie shall fall vpon their stocks, (so they plot) by an act of God or man: but here certain losse falls presently vpon their soules; and a finall ruine shall impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially at last consume their estates. For God will blast the stocks and branches, that are planted in the moorish and muddy ground of vsury.

then coole and worke him with reprehension for his euil.

               <p>Of all: that abundant wealth can bring no good, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Soule, Body, or Name. Man is said to haue three liues; Spirituall, Corporall, and Ciuill, as the Lawyers call it: the life of his good name. Neyther to this, nor to the life of his Soule or Body, can multitude of riches conferre any good. This Text shall prooue it in all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the <hi>Soule</hi> can opulency procure no benefit. All Christians know that good for the Soule is the passion and merits of Christ; faith to apprehend these; repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to mortifie sinnes: sanctification to giue vs celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all liues; and saluation to glorifie our persons. But can any of these be bought with money? <hi>Thou and thy money perish together, that thinkest the gifts of God may be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>

                  <hi>with money.</hi> God will not barter away his graces (as the Indians their gold) for thy gawdes and rattles. Hee wil not take the morgage of a Lordship for the debt thou owest him. The smoake of thy sacrifice smells neuer the sweeter, because thou art cloathed in silkes; or canst sit downe to tell thy Michaelmasse thousands. Thy adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries cannot be commuted for in heauen, nor thy vsuries be answered by a fine before the Tribunall of the highest. Thou mayest as soone and easily mount vp to heauen with wings of lead, as by feathers of wealth. Indeed they can doe a man as much good in distresse of conscience, as to haue his head bound with a wette cloth in a cold mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning can cure the head-ach. If wealth could keepe a man from hell, how few rich men would be damned? But he is not <hi>sanctior quiditior;</hi> nor is saluation vendible to a full purse. The doctrine of Rome may affirme it; but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

of God will not afford it. This Cosmopolite had barnes and barres, but these cannot hedge in his Soule; that is <hi>required.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. To the <hi>body</hi> perhaps there is some more expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good; but no more successe. Thou art anguished; will thy wealth purchase health? Sleepe is denied thy sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and after many changed sides and places, thou canst finde no rest: goe now, empty thy coffers, and try what slumber the charmes and chimes of gold can ring thee. Thy stomake loathes meate; all thy riches are not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent sawce, to get thee an appetite. Couldst thou drinke <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> draught, it will not ease thy head-ache.

               <p>But the rich man hath a fire, when the poore sits cold: the rich an harbour, attendance, and delicate prouision, when the poore wants both house and home, meate and money, garments and company.

                  <note place="margin">Prou. 19. 4.</note> No part of my Sermon hath denied, but the competency of these earthly things is a blessing: neyther dare I infer, that the want of these is a curse; for the best haue wanted them, not the Sauiour of men himselfe excepted.

It is not then the plenitude, but competency of these things, that affords euen the rich content.

Come his wealth well, yet what is Credit, or how may we define a good Name? Is it to haue a Pageant of crindges &amp; faces acted to a taffaty Iacket? To be followed by a world of hang-byes; and howted at by the reeling multitude, like a bird of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, stucke full of py'd fethers? To be dawb'd ouer with court-morter, flattery; and set vp as a Butte, for whores, panders, drunkards, cheaters, to shoot their commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

at? To be licked with a sycophants rankling toung; and to haue poore men crouch to him, as little dogges vse to a great mastiffe? Is this a good name? Is this credit? Indeed these things may giue him a great sound: as the clapper doth to a bell; makes it haue a great sound, but the bell is hollow. They are empty gulls, whose credit is nothing else but a great noyse, forced by these lewd clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. A rich worldling is like a great Cannon, and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers praises are the powder that charge him; whereupon he takes fire, and makes a great report; but instantly goes off, goes out in stench. Hee may thinke himselfe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but no wise man, no good man doth: and the fame that is deriued from fooles, is infamy.</p>
               <p>That which I take to be a good <hi>Name,</hi> is this: <hi>Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri a Lande dignis;</hi> to bee well esteemed of in Christian hearts; to finde reuerence in good mens soules. <hi>Bonum</hi>

It is well that good men commend thee in their consciences, but it is better when thy good conscience can commend thee in it selfe. Happy is he, whose <hi>owne heart</hi> doth not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him.</hi> This credit wealth cannot procure, but grace: <note place="margin">1. Iohn 3. 21.</note> not goods, but goodnesse. The poorest man seruing God with a faithfull heart, findes this approbation in san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified affections, when golden asses goe without it. I confesse, many rich men haue had this credit, but they wil neuer thanke their riches for it. Their greatnesse neuer helped them to this name, but their goodnesse. They haue honoured the Lord, and those the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised that he <hi>will honour.</hi> So that all the reputation which wealth can procure a man in Gods iudgement, is but <hi>Thou foole.</hi> In that parabolicall history, Luk. 16. mention is made of a <hi>rich man,</hi> but none of his name; as if it vvere vnworthy to stand in the Lords booke.

               <p>Loe now the benefit of worldly wealth; &amp; the brands which disfigure the Soule, Body, Name of couetous men. For his Reputation, <hi>Follie</hi> challengeth it: for his riches, <hi>vncertainty</hi> deuoures it: for his Soule, <hi>Satan</hi> claimes it. Hee is gone in all respects; and now there is nothing left of him, but his infamy in the thoughts of men, his goods in the keeping of the world, his body in the prison of the graue, and his soule in the hand of hell. <hi>Abijt,</hi> he is gone: a tempest hath stole him away in the <hi>night;</hi> saith <hi>Iob.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To conclude, it may yet bee obiected; that though much wealth can procure to soule, body, or name, no good; yet it may be an antidote to preuent some euill, or a medicine to rid them al of some maladie. The insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of such a promise in riches, is punctually also confuted in this Text. For neyther the Rich mans Soule, body, nor estate is secured by his abundance. Infernall spirits fetch his soule: temporall men possesse his wealth: eternall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures blast his good name: and the wormes prey vpon his carkasse. What euill then can riches eyther preuent or remoue from man?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not from the soule: all euill to this, is eyther <hi>Poenae,</hi> or <hi>Culpae;</hi> of sinne, or of punishment for sinne.</p>
               <p>For Sinne, what vice is euacuated by riches? Is the wealthy man humbled by his abundance? no, he is rather swelled into a frothy pride; conceiting himselfe more then he is, or at least imagining, that he is eyther (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,) the man or some body. And as pride is <hi>radix omnis

peccati;</hi> the root of all sinne; so riches is the root of pride, <hi>Diuitiarum vermis superbia,</hi> saith S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> When the summe of prosperity heates the dunghill of riches, there is engendred the snake of pride. Wealth is but a quill, to blow vp the bladder of high-mindednesse. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> knew this inseparable consequence, when hee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Timothy,</hi> to <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded.</hi> And doe we thinke that the heat <note place="margin">1.

Riches is a warm nest, where lust securely sits to hatch all her vncleane brood. From fulnesse of bread, the Sodomites fall to vnnaturall wantonnesse. <hi>Ceres et Liber pinguescunt Venerem.</hi> Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is not abated by multiplication of riches; but rather <hi>Longiorem &amp; magis strenuam reddit manum;</hi> giues it a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and stronger arme. For as the poore cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, so the rich will not restraine the tyranny of great oppressors. <hi>They couet fields, and take them by violence:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mic. 2. 2.</note> how? <hi>Because their hand hath power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Punishment, what security is in money? Doth the Deuill balke a Lorldly house, as if hee were afraid to come in? Dares he not tempt a rich man to lewdnes? Let experience witnes, whether he dare not bring the highest Gallant both to sin &amp; shame. Let his food be neuer so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, he will be a guest at his table; and perhaps thrust in one dish to his feast, drunkennes. Be his attendance neuer so complete, yet Satan will waite on him too. Wealth is no charme to coniure away the Deuill: such an amulet &amp; the Popes holy-water, are both of a force.

Hath hee any seruant there, to fanne cold ayre vpon his tormented ioynts? Nay, the namelesse <hi>Diues</hi> goes from soft linen to sheetes of fire, from purple robes to flames <note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> of the same colour, purple flames: from delicate morsels, to want a droppe of water. <hi>Herod,</hi> though a King on earth, when he comes to that smokie vault, hath not a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion to sitte on, more then the meanest Parasite in his Court. So poore a defence are they for an oppressed Soule.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor from the body can riches remoue any plague. The lightning from heauen may consume vs, though we be clad in gold: the vapours of earth choke vs, though perfumes are still in our nostrills: and poison burst vs, though we haue the most virtuall Antidotes. What iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the poore subiect to, from which the rich is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted? Their feet do as soone stumble, and their bones are as quickly broken. Consumptions, Feuers, Gowtes, Dropsyes, Pleurisies, Palseys, Surfets; are houshold guests in rich mens families, and but meere strangers in cottages. They are the effects of superfluous fare and idlenes; and keepe their Ordinary at rich mens tables. Anguish lies oftner on a Downe-bed, then on a pallet: diseases waite vpon luxurie, as close as luxurie vpon wealth. These frogs dare leape into King <hi>Pharaohs</hi> chamber, and forbeare not the most sumptuous pallace. But money can buy medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines: yet what sicke man would not wish, that hee had no money, on condition that he had no maladie. Labour and moderate diet are the poore mans friends, &amp; preserue him from the acquaintance of Master Doctor, or the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted bills of his Apothecarie. Though our worldling heere promiseth out of his abundance, meat, drinke, and mirth: yet his bodie growes sicke, and his soule sadde: he was before carelesse, and hee is now curelesse: all his

vvealth cannot retaine his health, when God will take it away.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But what shall we say to the Estate? Euills to that are pouertie, hunger, thirst, wearinesse, seruillitie: Wee hope wealth can stop the invasion of these miseries. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse: it rather mounts a man, as a Wrastler does his combatant, that it may giue him the greater fall. Riches are but a sheeld of Waxe, against a sword of power. The larger state, the fairest marke for misfortune to shoote at. Eagles catch not after flies: nor will the <hi>Hercules</hi> of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition lift vp his clubbe, but against these Giants. There is not in pouertie that matter, for a Great mans couetous fire to worke vpon. If <hi>Naboth</hi> had had no Vineyard to preiudice the command of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Lordship, hee had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued both his peace and life. Violent winds blow through a hollow willow, or ouer a poore shrubbe, and let them stand: whiles they rend a peeces Oaks and great Cedars, that oppose their great bodies to the furious blasts. The tempests of oppressing power meddle not with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible quiet of poore Labourers, but shake vp rich men by the very rootes; that their blasted fortunes may be fit timber for their owne building.

Imprisonment, restraint, banishment, confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, fining, and confining are Greatnesses Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; instruments and staires to climbe vp by into rich mens possessions. Wealth hath foure hindrances from dooing good to the State.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God vsually punisheth our ouer-louing of riches with their losse. He thinks them vnworthy to be riualls with himselfe: for all height and strength of loue is his due. So that the ready way to lose wealth, is to loue it. <hi>Et delectatio perdet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The greatnesse of state, or of affection to it, opens the way to ruine. A full and large saile giues vantage to a Tempest: this pulled downe, the danger of the gust, and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:25651:181"/>
of shipwracke by it, is eluded: and it passeth by vvith onely waues, roring as if it was angry for being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented. He that walks on plaine ground, either doth not fall, or riseth againe with little hurt. He that climbes high towres, is in more danger of falling; and if he fall, of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his necke.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We see the most rich Worldlings liue the most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably; slaued to that vvealth, whereof they keepe the key vnder their girdles. <hi>Esuriunt in popina,</hi> as we say, they starue in a Cookes shoppe. A man would thinke, that if wealth could doe any good, it could surely do this good; keepe the owner from want, hunger, sorow, care: No, euen these euills riches doe not auoide, but rather force on him. Whereof is a man couetous, but of riches? when these riches come, you thinke he is cured of his couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: no, he is more couetous. Though he hath receiued <hi>desiderium animi,</hi> yet he keeps still <hi>animum desiderij.</hi> The desires of his mind granted, abolish not his mind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. So a man might striue to extinguish the Lampe, by putting oyle into it; but this makes it burne more. And as it is with some, that thirstily drink harish and ill-brewed drinks, haue not their heate hereby allayed, but inflamed: So this vvorldlings hote eagernesse of riches is not coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but fired by his abundance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That which makes a man easie to hit, makes also his wound greeuous. The Poet tells vs, that when <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi> his house burnes, (a little cottage in the Forrest) he <note place="margin">Iuv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But if this accident light vpon the Vsurers house, distraction seizeth him withall: he cryes out of this Chamber, and that chest, of his Closet and Cabinet, of his bonds &amp; morgages, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and plate; and is so much the more impatient, as hee had more to lose.</p>
               <p>In a vvord, here is all the difference betwixt the rich

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Epistle was written with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls</hi> owne hand: chap. 6. 11. <hi>Ye see how large a letter I haue written vnto you with my owne hand.</hi> It is for quality excellent, for quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie large. Hee wrote not so long an Epistle to any other Church with his owne hand. Indeed he wrote a letter to <hi>Philemon</hi> with his owne hand, vers. 19. <hi>I Paul haue written it with mine own hand:</hi> but it was short. He wrote longer Epistles to the Romanes and Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but not with his owne hand, but by Scribes. Wee haue cause therefore to regard it more: as his pains were
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:25651:183"/>
greater in writing, so let our diligence bee greater in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing.</p>
            <p>The maine purpose of it is to discouer: 1. That ill coniunction of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> the ceremonies of the Law, with the sanctimony of the Gospell. 2. The free Grace and Iustification by the bloud of Christ without the workes of the Law. In this the Galatians had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a beginning, but now had admitted a recidiuation. For this cause the Apostle chides, vers. 7. <hi>Yee did runne well: who did hinder you that you should not obey the Trueth?</hi> Where there is a Concession, and a Conuiction: a step; and a stop. The Concession or Step, <hi>ye did runne well.</hi> The Conuiction or Stop; <hi>Who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the former he compares Christianity to a race: all men must first be <hi>viatores</hi> in this valley of teares, before they can be <hi>Assess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>res,</hi> and sit with Christ in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory. Onely as it agrees with a Race in many things; as labor, it's no idle thing to be a Christian; short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it is a Race, the perplexity is recompenced vvith the breuity: continuance, the runner must hold out the last steppe, if he will obtaine the prize. So there are some differences. 1. In other races many runne, onely one winnes the goale: but in this all that runne faithfully, shal raigne triumphantly. Though they cannot runne so fast as others, nor so farre as others; yet euen they that came at the eleuenth houre into the Vineyard, receiued they pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, so well as they that came at the third. For the Lord regards not <hi>Quantum,</hi> but <hi>ex quanto:</hi> not how much, but how well. What euer houre they are called, let them spend the aftertime in a zealous diligence. 2. In other ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces one hinders another, but in this iourney one helpes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The more the merrier: no enuy or grudging, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the way or the goale. <hi>Dispar gloria singulorum, sed communis latitia omnium.</hi> There may bee different glory of some, yet there is a common ioy of all. Euery

good man is a spurre to his brother. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ranne to Christs Sepulcher: <hi>Iohn</hi> out-ran <hi>Peter</hi> vnto the graue, <hi>Peter</hi> out-went <hi>Iohn</hi> into the graue. But we run together vnto Christs Throne; some come before, some after, all meet in the Communion of Saints. 3. In other races the runner obtaines a prize that shall perish; all the runners heere get an incorruptible crowne. They runne for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle prize, a little praise; we for eternall glory. Runne wee then cheerefully; behold, a kingdome lyes at the stake. God giue vs all eyes of faith to see it, and hearts of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to runne to it, through the power of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>In the latter the Apostle may seeme to put a superfluous question; <hi>Who did hinder you?</hi> For there are many aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. As first Satan, the General of that damned crue that hinder our passage to heauen. <hi>Paul</hi> excuseth himselfe to the <hi>Thessalonians:</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">1. Thes. 2. 18. Zach. 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Wee would haue come vnto you once and againe, but Satan hindered vs.</hi> Zach. 3. <hi>Ioshua the high Priest stood before the Angell of the Lord, and Satan stood at his right hand to resist him.</hi> Where God hath his Church, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath his chappell. So also wicked men; such as haue taken the Deuils oath of Allegiance. What the Deuill cannot doe immediately by himselfe, hee does mediately by his Instruments. To erre <hi>Humanum,</hi> is the weakenes of a man; but to seduce <hi>diabolicum,</hi> is the part of a Deuill. It is ill to play the woman, worse to play the beast, worst of all to play the Deuill. But what speciall hinderers the Apostle meanes, wee shall haue precise occasion in some future passages to demonstrate.</p>
            <p>Onely I must not omit, that the Apostle giues a direct resolution by way of negation, vers. 8. <hi>This perswasion com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He that wils the death of no sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, will not lead him into the wayes of destruction. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he suffes Satan to temptal, but to a diuerse purpose: the good to try them, the reprobate to destroy them. The temptations of the godly are for their instruction; of the

               <hi>Let no man say when hee is tempted, I am tempted of God, for God tempteth no man.</hi> In him we liue, moue, and haue our being. A Gentile Poet sung it, a Christian <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> Apostle sanctified it, all the creatures in heauen and earth cry Amen vnto it. Life is his, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we liue well or ill: motion is his, whether wee lift vp our hands to prayer or murder: but the prauity and corruption of these is none of his. Is any part of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or power of soule depraued? <hi>This commeth not from him that calleth vs.</hi> What is then the cause of sinne?</p>
            <p>I answere, properly nothing: it hath indeed a deficient cause, but no efficient cause. It is a defect, priuation, or orbity of that God made; the thing it self he neuer made. Will you aske what is the cause of sickenesse? I answere, the destitution of health. If what's the cause of darknes; the absence of the Sunne: if of blindnesse, the deficiency of seeing. What is the cause of silence? no cause: there are causes of speech, organs, ayre, &amp;c. take away these, what followes but silence? you see the light: who euer saw darkenesse? you heare speech: who euer heard si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence?

Let vs looke home to our owne flesh; from thence it commeth that destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Me, me, adsum qui feci.</hi> The Lord put not onely this confession in our mouthes, but this feeling in our hearts; that all our euill commeth from our selues, all our good from Iesus Christ.</p>

               <hi>Of him that called you:</hi> He hath called you to liberty, will you intangle your selues in new bondage? who pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties him that being redeemed from prison, wilfully recasts himselfe into it? Or that saued from the fire, will runne into it againe? Art thou <hi>Titio ereptus,</hi> and yet hast a mind to be burned? He hath called you not to the ceremonies, but to their Antitype; not to those legall Lambes, but to that Euangelicall <hi>Lambe</hi> of God, that taketh away the sins of the world. Will you be directed by Lampes, when the Sunne is risen? no, hee hath called you to the truth and comforts of the Gospell; obey that call: And then he that hath perswaded you to vertue, by calling you to grace, shall crowne you with eternall glory.</p>
            <p>Now one argument whereby the Apostle deterres them from blending Iudaisme with Christianity, is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the danger of corrupting the doctrine of the Gospell: <hi>A little Leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe.</hi> One ceremony of the legall rites obserued with an opinion of necessity, sowreth all that sweetnesse of redemption that commeth by Christ.

deduced from it. Most properly our Apostle by <hi>leauen</hi> vnderstands false doctrine, and by <hi>lumpe</hi> the truth of the Gospell: so the sense is this; one heresie infects a masse of truth. Or if we restraine it to persons, by <hi>leauen</hi> he meaneth false Teachers, and by <hi>lumpe</hi> the Church of <hi>Galatia:</hi> and so a teacher of the bondage to the Law, sowres the liberty of the Gospell. <note n="g" place="margin">verse 2.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, I Paul say vnto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Or if yet we will looke vpon it with more generall view, we may by <hi>leauen</hi> vnderstand sinne, by <hi>lumpe</hi> man, by <hi>leauening</hi> Infection. Here are three respondences, and all worthily considerable.</p>
            <p>First taking <hi>leauen</hi> for false Doctrine, so we find in the new Testament foure sorts of <hi>leauens,</hi> Math. 16. <hi>Beware of the leauen of the Pharises, and of the Sadduces;</hi> there bee two of them; the Pharisaicall, and the Sadducean leauens. <note place="margin">Math. 16. 6.</note> Mark. 8. <hi>Beware of the leauen of Herod,</hi> there's the third. The fourth is my Text, the leauen of mingling Mosaicall <note place="margin">Mark. 8. 15.</note> ordinances with Christs Institutions. It will not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse to take a transient view of these <hi>Leauens:</hi> for though former times had the originals, wee ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paines: we haue paralell leauens.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To begin with the Pharises; to these I may well li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our Seminaries; one egge is not liker another. Euen a Iesuite wrote in good earnest, <hi>Non malè comparari Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaeos Catholicis;</hi> Papists are fitly compared to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Whether he spake it ignorantly or vnwittingly, or purposely; I am sure <hi>Caiphas</hi> neuer spoke truer when he meant it not. Shall we take a little paines to confer them? The Pharises had corrupted, yea in a manner annulled the Law of God by their Traditions: and for this <note n="h" place="margin">Math. 15. 6.</note> Christ complaines against them. Now for the Papists, this was one of their Tridentine decrees; <hi>With the same reuerence and deuotion doc we receiue and respect Traditions, that wee doe the bookes of the olde and new Testaments.</hi> Shut thine eyes and heare both speake, and then for a wager vvhich
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:25651:185"/>
is the Pharise, which the Seminary? Indeed to some tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions we giue <hi>locum,</hi> but <hi>locum suum;</hi> a place, but their owne place. They must neuer dare to take the wall of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Again, the Pharises corrupted the good Text with their lewd Glosses. The law was, that no Leper might come into the Temple; their traditionall Glosse was, that if hee were let downe through the roofe, this was no offence. As that drunkard, that hauing for sworne going to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Tauerne, yet being carried thither euery day on mens shoulders, thought hee had not broken his oath. Their Sabbath dayes iourney was a thousand Cubits; their Glosse vnderstood this without the walls, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all day through the city no sinne. The Papists are not behinde them in their foule interpretations, not sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to call that sacred Writ a nose of waxe, formable to any construction. <hi>Paul</hi> subscribes his two Epistles to the Thessalonians thus; <hi>Missa fuit ex Athenis;</hi> a Papist cryes out strait, Heres a plaine text for the Masse. Psal. 8. <hi>Omnia subiecisti pedibus eius; Thou hast put all things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

               <hi>his feete:</hi> This is spoken of the beasts subiection to man: their Glosse construes it of mens subiection to the Pope. So Esa. 49. <hi>They shall bow downe to thee with their face toward the earth, and licke vp the dust of thy feete.</hi> Here <note place="margin">Esa. 49. 23.</note> saith their Glosse, is a plaine proofe for kissing the Popes feet. Our Sauiour sayes; <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 18. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Except ye become as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ye shall not enter the kingdome of heauen:</hi> Heereupon Saint <hi>Francis</hi> commands one <hi>Massaeus</hi> to tumble round on the earth like a little childe, that he might enter. <hi>If thy foot offend thee,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>out it off.</hi> Heereupon when the penitent confessed to S. <hi>Anthony</hi> that he had kicked his mother, he vrged him with that Text: the man went and cut off his foot, but S. <hi>Anthony</hi> (honestly to make him amends) set it on againe. Were these not goodly constructions? So the new elected Pope in his solemne <hi>Lateran</hi> Procession, must take copper money out of his

Chamberlaines lap, and scatter it among the people, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note n="k" place="margin">Act. 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Siluer and gold haue I none, but such as I haue I giue vnto you.</hi> And is not this a probable truth, a praise-able bounty? Seuen yeares penance is enioyned to a deadly sinne; because <hi>Miriam</hi> was separated seuen dayes for her leprosie; and God saith to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap. 4. I haue giuen thee a day for a yeare. Oh genuine and most neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concording of Scriptures! When Gods word sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects Priests to Kings, their Glosse subiects Kings to Priests, at least to Popes. But as when they determined to kill the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth, that they might be sure to poyson him, they stucke not to poyson their owne God in the Sacrament. So purposing to teare the honour, and deface the maiesty of Kings, they first offer violence to the sacred word of God. In these damnable Glosses it is hard to decide; whether Pharise is beyond Papist, or Papist beyond Pharise. But <hi>Dum haec malè construunt, seipsos malè destruunt.</hi> Their euill construction of the Scriptures brings a worse destruction to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. They make that serue the turne of their policie, which God meant to serue the turne of his glory.</p>
            <p>The Pharises cleaued to the letter, but despised the Spirit: so do Papists. <hi>Hoc est corpus</hi> must bee materially there: for this they wrangle, fight, burne the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters; yet few of them care to finde it spiritually there. <hi>Dabo claues,</hi> I will giue thee the keyes; therefore none can enter heauen except the Pope open the dores. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Peters</hi> two keyes, one of knowledge, the other of power, are fitted to two lockes, Ignorance, and Indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But wee know who keepes the keyes, and lets in many thousands to heauen without the Popes leaue. <note n="l" place="margin">Reu. 3. 7.</note> 
               <hi>These things saith hee that is holy and true, hee that hath the key of Dauid, he that openeth, and no man shutteth, that shutteth, and no man openeth.</hi> Some of the Rabbins af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that God requires two things concerning his law, Custodie and Worke: custody in heart, worke in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:25651:186"/>
The Pharises thought it enough to haue it in their frontlets, not in their hearts. So the Romist hath his <hi>opus operatum;</hi> prayers numbred on beades, fastings, pilgrimages, &amp;c. and then cryes like <hi>Saul;</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 13</note> 
               <hi>Blessed bee thou of the Lord; I haue performed the commandement of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pharises iustified themselues by their workes, and would not sticke to say of the Law, <hi>All this haue I kept from my youth.</hi> Doe not the Papists so? doe they not climbe to saluation by their owne works, &amp; iustify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues? Those thought it not only easie to fulfill the Law, but possible to doe more then they were bound to. They thought it not worth thanks to performe what they were bidden. Gods Law was too little for their holinesse. They plyed God with vnbidden oblations, gaue more then they needed, then was commanded. <hi>I pay tithes of all,</hi> said that Pharise: of all? it was more then he needed. If God would haue a Sabbath kept, they ouer-keepe it: let a house be on fire, that day they would not quench it. And what other is the boasting opinion of the Romanists? it is nothing with them to content God, they can earne him, supererogate of him. Yea these Iewish Papists haue done more then enough for themselues, many good vvorks to spare for others: this they call the Churches Treasure, &amp; they sell them for ready money. But Christ taught vs all to say, <hi>We are vnprofitable seruants;</hi> intimating, that doe what we can, yet God is a loser by the best of vs.</p>
            <p>To omit the miserable penances of the Pharises, prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues with thornes, and wounding their flesh with whips; wherein it is not possible for a Papist to goe beyond them. If the misvsing, macerating, lacerating their owne bodies be a meanes to come into heauen, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Pharises should enter farre sooner then the Papists. Yet were those kept out, and shall these enter? <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 5. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Except your righteousnesse shall exceed the righteousnes of the Scribes and Pharises, ye shall not enter into the kingdome of Heauen.</hi>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:25651:187"/>
The people were so besotted on them, that they thought if but two men should goe to heauen, the one must bee a Scribe, the other a Pharise. But here was strange newes; neyther of them both shall come there. So the Papists thinke, that if but two men be saued, one must be a Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the other a Iesuite. Hee that should say, neyther of them both was likely to speed so well, should haue the whole multitude stare vpon him for such a Paradoxe.</p>
            <p>The Pharises brag'd much of <hi>Moses</hi> Chaire; iust so doe our Papists of <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire. The Pharises iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it that there was no error in theirs: the Papists af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that there's no possibility of error in theirs.

Then would they answere him, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the fourth was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, when he purposed peremptorily to proceed against <hi>Lewys le Debonayre;</hi> the French Bishops answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in flat termes; <hi>Si excommunicaturus veniret, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatus discederet:</hi> If he came to excommunicate, hee should be sent back excommunicated.</p>
            <p>The Pharises compassed Sea and Land to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes; <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 23. 15.</note> 
               <hi>and when they had made one, they make him two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold more the child of hell then themselues.</hi> Doe not our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries so? Yes they are <hi>Compassers</hi> too, like their grand Master. Iob. 2. much like those <hi>Circulatores,</hi> and <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celliones,</hi> a limbe of the <hi>Donatists.</hi> They creepe into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies houses, I had almost said into their Chambers: the Pursuiuant in modesty hath forborne the Gentlewomans bed, and missed him. Confession and Penance are the principall wheeles, whereupon the Engine of their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie runnes. By the first they find out mens secret incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; by the other they heape riches to their Tribe. They will not lead a Nouice into the maine at first, to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:25651:187"/>
make him belieue the Popes infallibility of Iudgement, authoritie to decrowne Kings, to make Scripture no Scripture, and no Scripture Scripture, &amp;c. This meat is too tough, it will not downe: therefore they court his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections with pleasing delights, smooth semblances, and moderate constructions; as neare to the religion from which they would peruert him, as possibly may be affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. So by degrees they gaine him, God and the Truth loseth him. In their owne Countreys, places of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, they vizour their hearts, in England they vizour their faces too.</p>
            <p>The Pharises made difference of oathes. <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 23. 16.</note> Whosoeuer shall <hi>sweare</hi> by the <hi>Temple,</hi> it is nothing: but whosoeuer shall sweare by the <hi>Gold</hi> of the Temple, hee is a debter. <hi>Ye fooles and blind: for whether is greater, the gold or the Temple that sanctifieth the gold?</hi> That was their doctrine, this was Christs reproofe. So the Papists haue their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions betwixt a materiall and a formall oath: one to bind the conscience, the other not. Out of such an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky copulation of fraud and malice, was that monstrous stigmatike Equiuocation engendred. A damned egge, not couered by any faire bird, but hatch'd as the Poets faine of O sprayes, with a thunderclap. A meere bastard, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer was the Father, Iesuites keepe the child, and bring it vp as their onely darling. But they haue their Bulls of dispensation for it: fit, they should all speed, as some did once with their buls. Two Seminaries came into England with their two Bulls, but being apprehended, those two Bulls call'd in a third Bull, which was Bull the hangman, to dispatch them both.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the Pharises vsed to <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 23. 14.</note> 
               <hi>deuoure widowes houses, &amp; for a pretence to make long prayer.</hi> It is euill to deuoure a mans house, worse to deuour a widowes house, worst of all when their lips seemed to pray, to be chewing that morsell. Ierusalem had neuer worse Pharises then Rome: these were meere bunglers to the Iesuites. The new Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:25651:188"/>
haue made very Proselytes and Novices of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.. A widowes cottage fill'd the pauch of an old Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise. Large Patrimonies and faire reuenues wil not stoppe the throte of the Iesuite. They deuoure the Land as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> leane kine, and yet looke hunger-starued still. You shall haue them first fall in with the wife, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill did with <hi>Eue:</hi> but they couzen the husband of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, as the deuill couzoned <hi>Adam.</hi> Euen other Orders among them, cry shame vpon the Iesuites: they prole away all with a face of sad pietie and sterne mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

They haue studied reasons against the Resurrection. The flesh turnes into rottennesse, rottennesse to dust, &amp;c.

But they professe some religion among vs; it may be so; but they fit and square it to their owne humors: as that Giant dealt with his guests, for all whom he had but one bed; if they were too short for it, he rack'd them out longer; if too long, he cut them shorter.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Insculptum est omnibus esse Deum:</hi> it is vvritten in all hearts by the pen of nature that there is a God. It is not possible to get out these indeleble characters. Say vvhat they will, they would giue much to be sure that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was not true. The discourse of reason confutes them. <note n="e" place="margin">Iob 12. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Aske now the beasts, and they shall teach thee: the fowles of the ayre, and they shall tell thee.</hi> Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of <hi>GOD</hi> hath wrought this? <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentemque refert qualibet herba Deum.</hi> The little pile of grasse tells vs, there is a God that made it. Besides, they haue a conscience within them, Gods deputy in the soule,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:25651:189"/>
which will speak for the Maker and Master, and be heard too. <hi>Qui negat esse Deum, mihi negat, et tibi, non sibi.</hi> Hee that denies there is a God, denies it to me, and to thee, but neuer to himselfe. You may sooner pull his heart out of his brest, then this conception out of his heart. Thus is their leuen toss'd backe into their owne teeth: they will not now acknowledge this; they shall one day feele this. <hi>Oculos quos culpa clausit, poena aperiet:</hi> the eyes vvhich Atheisme hath shut, damnation shall open. This is a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Leuen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The next <hi>Leuen</hi> is that of the <hi>Herodians:</hi> heere crafty and dissembling hypocrits might be thought their fittest and most sutable paralells: because Christ calls <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> a Foxe. <note n="f" place="margin">Luke 13. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Goe and tell that Foxe.</hi> But the <hi>Herodians</hi> were rather noted for profane fellowes; and so wee must seeke out other matches. Such as carry in their gestures a tepidity of religion, a loosenesse of life: that <hi>turne the grace of God into wantonnesse:</hi> and make that which brings saluation to all, a meanes of confusion to themselues. This disease is <hi>Interius,</hi> within: and quickly becomes <hi>Interitus,</hi> a violent destruction. Profest Atheists, and open Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, are through the manifestation of their malice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented: these are bosome Serpents, that sting in silence. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saies, that Extreme is lesse hurtfull, which is neerest to the <hi>medium,</hi> and doth communicate with it in something. Prodigality is lesse noxious then Auarice, because it hath this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with liberalitie, to giue: which the other hath not. Fiery zeale is dangerous: by this <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Act. 22. 4.</note> persecuted Christ, by this the Iewes <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 10. 2.</note> crucified Christ. But profane coldnesse is worse, because it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the meane, which is zeale in religion.</p>
            <p>By these wretches lewdnes among vs, the Romish ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries take aduantage to slander our Religion.

4. There is a fourth <hi>Leuen,</hi> to which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath principall respect in this place; and that is the mixing of Law with Gospell; I meane Ceremoniall and legall rites with the truth of Iesus Christ. This leven might well die in forgetfulnesse, and haue moulded away, if there had not beene a late generation of Thraskites to deuoure it as bread. They must abstaine from Swines flesh, and from bloud, and that vpon conscience to the Ceremoniall law. But he that thus abstaines from bloud and flesh, the flesh and bloud of Christ shall doe him no good. What is this but to licke vp the Galatians vomit? to swallow that hard and indigestible leven, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tooke so much paines about, to get out of their stomacks.

The one is inseparable to the other: For hee that forfeits <hi>Bonum vnde,</hi> shall lose <hi>Bonum inde.</hi> They that spoyle that grace whence they might do good, shall lose that glory whence they expect good.

So hee puts into the basen sixe pence, and withall takes out his masters angell: the Image makes curtsie and seemes to thanke him still.

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:25651:198"/>
follow that we should not pray for heretikes, adulterers, homicides; which were directly crosse to the rule of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Certainly <hi>Paul</hi> in that generall rule admitted of no exception; it is an Aphorisme wherein no sober iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can find distinction. The Apostle thought of no veniall, when he called all mortall. <hi>The wages of sinne</hi> (not of this or that sinne, as sacriledge, robbery, blasphemy, &amp;c. but of sinne, any sinne, euery sinne: though men deeme it triuiall, they shall find it mortall) <hi>is death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know there is a iust distinction of sinnes, of greater &amp; lesse. Puritie and equality of all transgressions is an idle dreame. It was a worse murder to kill <hi>Zachariah</hi> at the Altar, then <hi>Uriah</hi> in the field. To steale <hi>Sacra de Sacro,</hi> holy things out of a holy place, is worse theft then to steale <hi>profana de profano,</hi> common things out of a profane place. The difference of the punishments manifests a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the sinnes. As in heauen <hi>one starre excells ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther starre in glory:</hi> so in hell, one firebrand exceeds ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in burning; though all feele the fire hote enough.

               <hi>shall receiue greater damnation.</hi> As they haue been more wicked, they shall be more wretched. This distinction of sinnes vvee take vp and iustifie: yea we dare goe further, and say there are some sinnes mortall, and some veniall, but not in their owne nature. The difference is not <hi>ratione Peccatorum, sed Peccantium;</hi> not in respect of the sinnes, but of the Sinners. To the faithfull and penitent all sinnes are veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: to the vnbeleeuers and impenitent, all sinnes are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. It is <hi>misericordia remittentis,</hi> not <hi>natura transgressio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis;</hi> the mercy of the forgiuer, not the qualitie of the sin, that maketh it veniall. All transgressions are mortall in
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:25651:199"/>
themselues, and by repentance all veniall in Christ. The least sinne legally considered, is mortall: the greatest sin Euangelically considered, is pardonable.</p>
            <p>This difference we approoue: yea wee say, that small sinnes are more easily pardoned: and great sinnes, when they are remitted, are more hardly remitted. For certainly offenders are more or lesse punished, accoding to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the offence. An eye with an eye, but bloud with bloud, and life with life.

Oh the incredible soules lost in the Labyrinth of

these vnsuspected, (and in their imagination iustifiable) sinners!</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Minima Insensibilia;</hi> these little sinnes are not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily felt, therefore most pernicious. If a man hath died his hand in bloud, <hi>irrequieta conscientia;</hi> a peacelesse consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haunts him with vnceslant vexation: let him hate his brother, this little murder he feeles not. The deuill like a roring Lyon is soone heard: forming himselfe to a foxe, his insinuation is not perceiued. Hee rores in monstrous iniquities, in treason, murder, sacriledge, oppression: these be thundring sinnes, that will waken the soule if it be not lethargiz'd. But creeping like a silent Foxe, he deuoures the grapes without disturbance. <note n="u" place="margin">Cant. 2. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Take vs the Foxes, the little foxes: for they spoyle the Vines.</hi> If Satan hew at the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and knock at the foundation of the house, we heare the noise, and preserue the building. They are those small <hi>Teredines,</hi> little sinnes, that in sensibly eate it to dust, and it is ruined ere we are aware. So long as Sinne comes not in thunder, it neuer wakens men: if it doe not enter into Theomachie, and denounce open warre against GOD, they make but a tush of it. To abuse the good creature is nothing, so long as they are not drunke: to giue nothing to the poore is no sinne, so long as they take not from the poore: to sleepe out the Sermon is but a little drowsinesse, all is wel so long as they break not the Sabbath in absence from Church. These and such like are the common thoughts, and so triuiall an estimate they beare of these sinnes, that they thinke God should doe them wrong to call them to any reckoning for them.</p>
            <p>Thus they sowe sinnes, as that enemy did tares, here a <hi>little,</hi> and there a <hi>little:</hi> but growne vp, the whole fielde was ouergrowne with them. A sinne that cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <hi>Sine grands corruptione sui, graui laesione proximi, magno contemptu Dei:</hi> without his owne notorious depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, his brothers greeuous oppression, Gods manifest contempt and prouocation; this quickly amazeth a man,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:25651:201"/>
and he starts backe from the deuils first offer. If the deuill at first had come to <hi>Iudas,</hi> here's a hundred peeces, betray thy Master: none, he was not yet hardned enough in vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany: let Satan first worke him to hypocrisie, then to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes, and lastly hee shall preuaile him with him for treason too. Hee might refuse a hundred peeces before, now he will take thirty.</p>
            <p>When that good Prophet wept vpon <hi>Hazael,</hi> he asked; <hi>Why weepeth my Lord?</hi> He answered, <hi>Because I</hi>

But he did it: ambition brought him to a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, a kingdome brought him to tyrannie, tyrannie to insolence, insolence not onely to oppression of his owne, but to invasion of other Countreys: among which Israel felt the smart, in the burning of her Cities, and massacring her Inhabitants. Thus by degrees he was wrought to this selfe-incredited mischiefe: as impossible as at first he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, at last he performed it. Doubtlesse there be some that would shudder at the temptation to periurie: yet <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detentm,</hi> by insensible steppes they arriue at it: by lying they come to swearing, by swearing to forswearing. If the Vsurer had an oppressed mans widow, and orphanes lying and crying at his dores, perhaps shame, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse, would seize on him: but let him exact, inhaunce, oppresse, excoriate the Common-wealth, and not heare it in a publique clamour, he neuer wincheth for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. A fact that lookes at the first blush horrid and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, is presently either auoided, or within some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest limits restrained: but another <hi>Dum paruum creditur, securius in vsu retinetur:</hi> the opinion of paruitie abates the opinion of prauitie: that which is weakely censured, is

strongly retained. Our officious lies, soothing adulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, amorous wishes, wanton songs, scoffing at Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, censuring of Sermons; being reprooued, we laugh them out. But these laughing sinnes, will be one day found crying sinnes.

Psalme: <hi>Blessed is the man that hath not walked,</hi> &amp;c. First he gets a man to walke a turne or two with him in sinne, as it were to conferre and debate the matter. After some walking, lest he should be weary, he preuailes with him to <hi>stand in the way of sinners;</hi> after admission of the thought, to commission of the act. Lastly, hee perswades him for his ease to <hi>fit downe in the seate of the scornefull;</hi> falling to despise God, and deride all goodnesse. Thus hee brings him from <hi>walking</hi> to <hi>standing,</hi> from standing to <hi>sitting</hi> stil: and this is <hi>limen inferni,</hi> the very threshold of hell. Wee iudge of sinne, as of the Sunne; little because far off: yet indeed it is bigger then the earth. The neerer wee come to the sense of iniquity, the greater it appeares. Was it such a sinne for <hi>Adam</hi> to eate a forbidden Apple? Yes, the greatnes is remonstrable in the euent, it brought de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction vpon himselfe and his posterity.

It came to the turne of the Kings speciall fauourite, thus to lose his life: the King resoluing both to keep the custome, yet to saue his friend, obiected that God was no murderer, nor delighted in the bloud of men. That if he were a God, he was certainely good, and goodnesse stood not in the desire of his owne crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures destruction. Therefore in stead of the mans head, he offered the head of an onyon: and for bloud, heart, and liuers of men, all these of birds or beasts. The Deuill must be pleased with this: hee saw that this little homage was some acknowledgement of his soueraignty.</p>
            <p>Satan can hold a mans soule in by a little, as a bird that hangs in the net by a claw. Perhaps shame &amp; feare keepes some from eruption into scandalous things: the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is vizarded, the affection is not mortified. Like an Eunuch, he doth not beget palpable &amp; grosse turpitudes: yet hath a lust, itch, and concupiscence: this little serues the Deuils turne. Satan would keepe away the light of the Truth from a man; well, he is so seated that hee will haue it; by knowledge he seemes to cast out Satan. Yet if he can but insinuate into his affection, this little cord will pull him in againe with ease. Must he lose the Sconce of thy vnderstanding? Let him hold the Cittadell of thy desires: this little gate will let him in at his pleasure.</p>

God gaue a Law, but no dispensation for any breach of it: his Generall rules haue no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vnlesse it please the Diuine Oracle to dispense vvith it. Thou shalt not worship an Idoll: no, not to saue my life? Not to saue life, as those three seruants of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>

to doe ill. The Pope sayes, Kill an hereticall King. God sayes, <hi>Touch him not:</hi> woe to that soule who takes the Popes word, before the Lords word. God charged a Prophet, that <note n="a" place="margin">1. King. 13. 9.</note> 
               <hi>he should eate no bread, nor drinke water in Bethel.</hi> Another Prophet came; saying, <note n="b" place="margin">Vers. 8.</note> 
               <hi>An Angell spake to me</hi> (blessed Angels speake truth: nay more, hee spake) <hi>by the word of the Lord. Bring him backe, that hee may eate bread, and drinke water.</hi> He did so, but marke the euent: returning home, <note n="c" place="margin">Vers. 24.</note>

            <p>Let vs refuse iniquity in what extenuation of quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or colour of qualitie soeuer it be offerd vs. For sinne is like a bemired dog; if it fawnes on vs, it foules vs. And the least sinne is like a little leake in a shippe, which if it be not stopped, will sinke the whole vessell. The French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue a military Prouerbe; <hi>The losse of a nayle, the losse of an Army.</hi> The want of a nayle looseth the shooe, the losse of a shooe troubles the horse, the horse indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the rider, the rider breaking his ranke molests the company, so farre as to hazard the whole Army. From slender and regardlesse beginnings, grow out these fatall and destructiue effects. The dores are shut, the theefe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter: a little boy is put in at the window, and he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the dore for the great thiefe; so the house is robbed. A charme is cast in at the window, eye, or eare; that quickly vnlocks the dore of the heart, till all the roomes be ransak't, not a peece of vertue, or one gemme of grace left.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> marching to the warres, requested to lodge his Army in a certaine Citie, by whose borders he must needs passe: the Gouernour answered that he would not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his Citie with so numerous and dangerous a guest. <hi>Pompey</hi> then desired but entertainement and reliefe for his sicke souldiours, who were perishing for want of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour: the Gouernour thought, sicke men could do them
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:25651:206"/>
no mischiefe; this was granted, they admitted. Being there a while, they recouered their health, opened the gates to the rest, so became strong enough to take the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. If Satan cannot get leaue for his whole Army of lusts, yet he begs hard for his weake ones, as sinnes of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but those sickly souldiours soone get strength to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise the soule.</p>
            <p>The trees of the Forrest held a solemne Parliament, wherin they consulted of the innumerable wrongs which the <hi>Axe</hi> had done them: therefore made an Act, that no tree should hereafter lend the <hi>Axe</hi> a helme, on paine of being cut downe. The Axe trauels vp &amp; downe the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, begs wood of the Cedar, Oke, Ash, Elme, euen to the Poplar; not one would lend him a chip. At last he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired so much as would serue him to cut downe the bryers and bushes; alledging that those shrubs did suck away the iuyce of the ground, hinder the growth, and obscure the glory of the faire and goodly Trees. Hereon they were content to afford him so much; when he had gotten his helme, he cut downe themselues too. These be the subtle reaches of sinne; giue it but a little aduantage, on the faire promises to remooue thy troubles; and it will cut downe thy soule also. Therefore <hi>Obsta principijs:</hi> trust it not in the least. Consider a sinne (as indeed it is) a crucifying of Christ; wilt thou say, I may crucifie Christ a little? I may scourge his flesh, wound his side, pierce his heart a little? What man loues the Lord Iesus, who would either say it, or doe it? Consider thy falling into sinne, a hurling of thy selfe downe from some high pinacle: wilt thou say, I may breake my necke a little? Consider it a casting thy selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vnquenchable fire; wilt thou say, I may burne my soule and body a little! As suffering wee thinke the least misery too great, so sinning let vs thinke the least iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie too great. So auoiding also little sinnes, we shall finde great fauour with Iesus Christ.</p>

               <hi>there are none found that returned to giue glory to God, saue this stranger.</hi> God had his Tythe there, whence he might least expect it. Now what doth Christ commend him for? For his thankefulnesse, for his humility, for his faith: why these graces were Christs owne; doth hee praise him for that himselfe had giuen him? Yes, this is Gods custome; <hi>Sua dona coronat;</hi> hee crownes his owne graces, hee rewards his owne gifts. Which teacheth how wee should vnderstand <hi>Reward</hi> in the Scripture. <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 20. 8.</note>

            <p>Now what doth hee specially commend in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted Leper? his praysing of God. The Leper pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God, God praiseth the Leper. He prayseth in his praysing two things; the <hi>Rightnesse,</hi> and the <hi>Rarenesse.</hi> 1. The Rightnesse, that he gaue praise to God; directed it thither where it was onely due. <hi>He returned to giue glory to God: non mihi sed Deo,</hi> saith Christ: not to me, but to God. Perhaps his knowledge was not yet so farre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, as to know him that cured him, to be God: therefore bestowed his praise where hee was sure it should be accepted, where onely it is deserued; on God. <hi>I seeke not my owne praise,</hi> saith Iesus, but <hi>mittentis, the praise of him that sent me.</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 54.</note> 
               <hi>If I honour my selfe, my honour is nothing.</hi> 2. The Rarenesse, and that in two respects. 1. That hee alone of tenne, blessed God, God had but his Tenth: it is much if the tenth soule goe to heauen. The godly are so rare, that they are set vp <note n="n" place="margin">Esay 8. 18.</note> 
               <hi>for markes, and signes and wonders;</hi> as if the world stood amazed at them. 2. That hee onely was the Stranger; a Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan.</p>
            <p>Many great vertues were found among the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans; Faith, Charity. Thankfulnesse: First, Faith; <note n="*" place="margin">Iohn. 4. 39.</note> 
               <hi>Many of the Samaritans of that Citie beleeued on him.</hi> Secondly, Charity; It was the Samaritan that tooke compassion on the man wounded between Ierusalem and Iericho. The <hi>Priest</hi> and the <hi>Leuite</hi> passed by him without pitie, but the Samaritan <note n="o" place="margin">Luke 10. 34.</note> 
               <hi>bound vp his wounds.</hi> Thirdly, Gratitude exemplified in this Samaritan Leper: none of the Iewes
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:25651:209"/>
gaue God praise for their healing, but only the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. It was strange that in Gentiles should be found such vertue, where it was least looked for. <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 8. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Verily I say vnto you, I haue not found so great faith, no not in Israel.</hi> The least informed did proue the best reformed. Samaritan was held a word of reproach amongst the Iewes; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by their malicious imputation to Christ. <note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 48.</note> 
               <hi>Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a Diuell?</hi> They were esteemed as dogges: <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 15. 26.</note> 
               <hi>It is not meete to take the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread, and to cast it to dogs.</hi> And at the first promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Gospell, the Apostles receiued a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest prohibition; <note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 10. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Goe not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any City of the Samaritans enter ye not.</hi> It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rare to reape such fruites out of the wild Forrest, cursed like the mountaines of <hi>Gilboa;</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">2. Sam. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Let there be no dew, neither raine vpon you, nor fields of offerings.</hi> To be good in good company is little wonder: for Angels to be good in heauen, <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, <hi>Iudas</hi> in Christs Colledge, had been no admirable matter: to apostate in these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces so exemplary of goodnesse, was intolerable weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But for <hi>Abraham</hi> to be good in <hi>Chalde, Noah</hi> in the old world, <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodome:</hi> for a man now to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Spaine, continent in France, chaste in Venice, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in Germany, temperate in England; this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. Such a one is a Lilly in a Forrest of thornes, a handfull of wheate in a field of cockle. Let me not here omit two things, worthy my insertion, and your obseruation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gods iudgement and mans do not concurre: the Samaritans were condemned of the Iewes, yet here nine Iewes are condemned by one Samaritan. They that seeme best to the world, are often the worst to God: they that are best to God, seeme worst to the world. When the Moone is lightest to the earth, she is darkest to heauen: when she is lightest to heauen, she is darkest to the earth. So often men most glorious to the world,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:25651:209"/>
are obscurest to the diuine approbation: others obscure to the worlds acknowledgement, are principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected in Gods fauor. Man would haue cleared the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, and condemned the Publican, when they both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Temple together; the one as it were in the Quire, the other in the Belfrey. But Christs iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is, that the Publicane <note n="u" place="margin">Luke 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>departed rather iustified.</hi> The Iewes thought, that if but 2. men in the world were saued, the one should be a Scribe, the other a Pharise: But Christ saith, neither of them both shall come there. <note n="x" place="margin">Luke 13. 28.</note> 
               <hi>You shall see others in the Kingdome of heauen, and you your selues thrust out.</hi> Some like the Moone are greater or lesse by the Sunne of mens estimation. <hi>Samuel</hi> was mistaken <note n="y" place="margin">1. Sam. 16.</note> in <hi>Eliab, Abinadab</hi> and <hi>Shammah:</hi> for the Lord had chosen <hi>Dauid. Isaac</hi> preferred <hi>Esau,</hi> but God preferred <hi>Iacob:</hi> and made the father giue the blessing to that sonne, to whom he least meant it. All this iustifies that, <note n="a" place="margin">Esay 55. 8.</note> 
               <hi>my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your wayes my wayes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But let vs mention others vertues and good actions with praise. It is the argument of a sullen and proud disposition, not to commend them that do well. Yet there is no ointment so sweet, but there will bee some <note n="d" place="margin">Eccl. 10. 1.</note> 
               <hi>dead flies</hi> to corrupt it.

The Snow is not so white, but there is an <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> to make it blacke. It was Gods commendation of <hi>Iob,</hi> that, <note n="e" place="margin">Iob 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>there was none like him in the earth:</hi> he had no fellow, yet the deuill pickes quarrels, and inuenteth slanders against him. Traducers of their brethren, I call not <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones,</hi> but <hi>Damonis agunt:</hi> I do not say they are deuils, but they do the worke of deuils.</p>
            <p>This mischiefe of deprauing, hath also infected the Church: Many a Preacher thinkes his owne glory e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed, if the next Orbe be lightned with a brighter Starre.

The verse may be distinguished into a Pasport, and a Certificate. <hi>Arise, go thy way,</hi> there is the Pasport: <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole,</hi> there is the Certificate. Hee giues him first a Dismission, leaue to depart: then a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie, or Assurance, both to certifie the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, that he was cleansed of his leprosie; but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to certifie his owne conscience that he was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that the faith of his soule brought health to his body.

                  <hi>Out of the depths haue I cryed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, O Lord.</hi> But there is a depth of depths; and out of that deepe there is no rising. <hi>Arise</hi> now, lest you fall into that deepe then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arise,</hi> for if thou wilt not, thou shalt be raised. <hi>Si non surrexeris volenter, suscitaberis violenter.</hi> If thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to <hi>rise</hi> willingly, thou shalt be rowsed against thy will. If thou wilt not heare the first <hi>Surge,</hi> which is the Ministers voice; thou shalt heare the last <hi>Surge,</hi> which is the Arch-angels voyce. <hi>Dicis, Surgam,</hi> thou saist, I will <hi>rise;</hi> but when! <hi>Modo Domine, modò:</hi> Anon Lord, all in time. Will not this be a silly excuse at the day of Iudgement, <hi>I will rise anon?</hi> Thou must rise <note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 52.</note> 
                  <hi>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last Trumpe.</hi> Though thou cry to the <note n="e" place="margin">Reu. 6. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Mountaines, Fall on me,</hi> and to the <hi>Rockes, Hide me:</hi> yet <hi>Nulla euasio,</hi> thou must <hi>arise</hi> and appeare. There are two voices that sound out this <hi>Surge:</hi> one Euangelicall, and that is of mercy; yet we drowne this, as Italians do thunder; by Drums, Bels, Cannons. The other Angelicall, and that is of Iustice, a voice vnpossible to be auoided. This is that last Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that all the world shall heare: <hi>Arise ye dead, and come to iudgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arise;</hi> let vs now raise vp our selues from corruption of soule, that we may one day be raised from corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of body; They that will not <hi>rise,</hi> their soules must,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:25651:214"/>
must, and carry their bodies to iudgement. This vvorld was made for man, not man for this world: therfore they take a wrong course that lye downe there. He that lyes downe when he should <hi>arise</hi> and goe, shall rise and goe, when he would lie downe. He that sleepes in the cradle of securitie all his life, sinnes soundly without starting: when he once starts and wakes, he must neuer sleepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The deuill and mischiefe are euer watching: and shal man, whom they watch to hurt, sleepe? Hee that would deceiue the deuill, had need to rise betimes. The Lyon is said to sleepe with one eye open, the Hare vvith both: the worldling with both eyes of his soule shut. He neuer riseth till he goes to bed: his soule wakens not, till his body falls asleepe on his death-bed: then perhaps he lookes vp. As sometimes they that haue been blind many yeeres, at the approching of death haue seene: (whereof Physicians giue many reasons) so the death-bed opens the eyes of the soule. Indeed at that time there is possibilitie of waking, but hazard of rising. That poore winter-fruit wil hardly rellish with God. <hi>Miserum incipete viuere, cum definendum est.</hi> It is wretched for a man then to begin his life, when hee must end it. It is at the best but <hi>morosa et morbosa panitentia;</hi> a wearish and sick repentance: wheras God requires a <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>quicke and liuely sacrifice;</hi> this is as sick as the person that makes it. This indeed is not a Conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a Reuersion, or meere refuse.</p>
               <p>To <hi>raise</hi> the secure from their vnseasonable, vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sleepe, God doth ring them a peale of fiue Bells.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first Bell is Conscience: this is the trebble, and doth somewhat trouble: especially if the hand of GOD pulls it. Many thinke of their consciences, as ill Debtors doe of their Creditors; they are loth to talke with them. Indeed God is the Creditor, and Conscience the Seriant, that will meet them at euery turne. It makes a syllogisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conclusion in the mind: Reason, like <hi>Dauid,</hi> drawes the sword, and Conscience, like <hi>Nathan,</hi> knocks him on
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:25651:215"/>
the brest with the hilts. <hi>Dauid</hi> made the Proposition, <hi>The man that hath done this, shall dnee the death: Nathan</hi> the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art the man:</hi> Conscience the Conclusion, <hi>Therefore thou must die.</hi> If you heare not, yea feele not the sound of this bell, suspect your deadnesse of heart: for that Citie is in danger, where the Alarme-bell rings not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second Bell is the Stint, or certaine to all the rest; <hi>Uox Euangelij,</hi> the voice of the Gospell. This Bell of <hi>Aaron</hi> is so perpetually rung amongst vs, that as a knell in a great mortalitie, <hi>(quia frequens, non terrens)</hi> so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon that no man regards it. Indeed, if some particular clapper ring melodiously to the eare, we come to please that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the soule. Luxurient wits thinke the Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase grosse: nothing delights them but a painted and meretricious eloquence. There are some that vvill not heare this Bell at all: like <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> they will not trauell to Ierusalem for a Sermon, but content themselues with a Calfe at home. Others looke that the Preachers tongue should incessantly walke, but let their own hearts lie still. Thus often our Lecturer shall preach, we will giue the hearing when we list. Thus many Ministers come to a Parish with their bones full of marrow, veynes full of bloud: but all is soone spent, and the people neuer the better. We ring, but you doe not <hi>rise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Bell is the Meane; and this is <hi>Suspiria gemitusque morientium;</hi> the cryes &amp; grones of the dying. Anothers Passing-bell is thy warning-bell. Death snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here and there about vs, thousands on our left, tenne thousands on our right: yet as if we had a <hi>Supersedeas,</hi> or Protection against it, we neither relent nor repent. Our securitie is argued of the more madnesse, because we haue so common motions and monitions of death. Yet <hi>None<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimus memores esse necesse mori.</hi> How horrible is it to be drunke in a charnell house? As Christ spake, <hi>Let the dead bury the dead:</hi> So we bring to the Church dead bodies with deader soules.
<q>
                     <pb n="415" facs="tcp:25651:215"/>
                     <l>Forma, fauor populi, feruor inuenilis, opesque,</l>
                     <l>Surripuere tibi noscere quid sit homo.</l>
                  </q>
We confesse our selues mortall, yet we liue as if death had no quarrell against vs. This Bell is the Meane, but it is too meane to wake vs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Bell is the Counter-tenor: <hi>vox paupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> the cry of the poore. This bell rings loud, either to vs for mercy, or against vs for crueltie. Let vs know, that if it cannot waken vs, it shal waken God aganst vs. <note n="g" place="margin">Iam. 5. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Their cryes are entred into the eares of the Lord of Sabbaoth.</hi> Set not thy soule in danger of the peoples curse: by inhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, ingrossings, oppressions, &amp;c. But thou sayest they are wicked men that will curse, and God will not heare the wishes of the wicked. I answere, it is often seene that the curse of the vndone waster, lights vpon the head of the vndooing Vsurer. The imprecation of one euill man may fall vpon another: God so suffers it, not because he cursed thee, but because thou hast deserued this curse. Let this Bell make Oppressors <hi>arise</hi> to shew mercy, that God may rise to shewe them mercy. Otherwise the poore man is ready to pray, <note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 7. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Arise, O Lord,</hi> in thine anger; lift vp thy selfe, because of the rage of our enemies: <hi>awake for vs</hi> to the iudgement thou hast commanded. Yea, though they pray not for it, God will doe it. <note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 12. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>For the oppression of the poore, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord.</hi> I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at it. If this Bel sound mournfully to thee for bread to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, <hi>arise</hi> to this sound, as that neighbor rose at midnight <note place="margin">Luke 11. 8.</note> to relieue his importunate friend. If it cannot waken thy couetous soule to shew mercy to Christ <hi>tempore suo,</hi> in his time of need; nor will Christ arise to shew mercy to thee <hi>tempore tuo,</hi> in thy time of need.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The last Bell is the Tenor, the Bow-bell; able to waken all the Citie. But though that materiall Bell can teach vs when it is time to goe to bedde, yet this mysticall bell cannot teach vs the time to <hi>arise.</hi> This is the abuse of
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:25651:216"/>
the creatures: <note n="k" place="margin">Iam. 5. 3. Haba. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The rust of the gold cryes</hi> against the hoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: <hi>the stone out of the wall</hi> against the Oppressor: the corne and wine against the Epicure. This is a roring and a groning Bell. <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 8. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>The whole creature grones, and trauells in paine</hi> vnder vs. This is the creatures ordinary Sermon: <hi>Accipe, redde, caue;</hi> vse vs without abusing; return thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse without dissembling; or looke for vengeance without sparing. They seeme to cry vnto vs: We desire not to be spared, but not to be abused: <hi>Necessitati subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uire non recusamus, sed luxui:</hi> we would satisfie your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall necessity, not intemperate riot. We are the nocent creatures, that cause their innocencie to become misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And but that the Diuine prouidence restraines them, it is maruell that they break not their league with vs; and with their hornes, and hoofes, and other artillery of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture make warre vpon vs, as their vnrighteous and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Lords.</p>
               <p>Let some of these Bells waken vs: lest as God once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested against Israel, that seeing they would not when it was offered, therefore they should neuer <hi>enter into his rest:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 3.</note> so a renuntiation come out against vs; <hi>If any will be filthy, let them be filthy still:</hi> if they will not <hi>arise,</hi> they shal lie still <note place="margin">Reuc. 22.</note> for euer. If this peale cannot effect it, yet God hath foure things more to rouze vs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Goad, that pricks the skin, and smarts the flesh; Affliction: he hath Crosses and Curses; those gall, these deepely wound: they are able to make any but a <hi>Pharaoh</hi> arise. It was affliction that waken'd <hi>Dauid: It is good for me that I was troubled.</hi> The Leprosie brought <hi>Naaman</hi> to the Prophet; the Prophet brought him to God. It is strange, if bloudy sides put not sense into vs. Yet such was the obduracy of Israel; <note n="m" place="margin">Iere. 5. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou hast stricken them, but they haue not sorrowed: thou hast consumed them, yet they refused to returne.</hi> Insensible hearts! <note n="n" place="margin">Esay 9. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>The people tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to him that smiteth them: neyther doe they seeke the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Hast thou beene wounded, and wilt thou
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:25651:216"/>
not be wakened? beware lest God speake to thy soule, as in another sense Christ did to <hi>Peter;</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Mark. 14. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>Sleepe on now, and take thy rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hee hath to rouze vs Thunder of heauier Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: perhaps the light scratches which some aduerse thornes make, are slightly reckoned; scarce change coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for them. But he sleepes soundly, whom thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cannot wake. <hi>Humanas motura tonitrua mentes.</hi> When God thundred that menace in the cares of <hi>Niniueh,</hi> it wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them. Let <hi>Absolon</hi> fire <hi>Ioabs</hi> barley fields, and he shal make him <hi>rise.</hi> Shake the foundations of the Prison, and <note place="margin">2. Sam. 14. Acts 16.</note> the sterne layler will rise a conuerted Christian; <hi>Sirs, what shall I doe to be saued?</hi> This thundring of iudgements should cleanse our ayre, awaken our sleepy mindes, purge our vncleane hearts. <note n="p" place="margin">Amos 3. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>If the Lyon roare, who will not feare?</hi> If the Lord thunder, what man will not be afraid?</p>
               <p n="3">3. He hath an Ordnance to shoot off, Death. <hi>Statutum est omnibus mori.</hi> It is a Statute-Law of heauen, an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from the Court of Iustice, Euery man shall die. When this Canon is discharged at thy paper-walls, then let thy soule <hi>rise,</hi> or neuer. The shooting off this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance made <hi>Belshazzar</hi> stagger before hee was drunke. <note n="q" place="margin">Dan. 5. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>His knees smote one against another, when that fatall hand</hi> wrote his destiny on the wall. Indeed most doe slumber on the Couch of health, they are quiet, no sicknesse stirs them: they are at a couenant with the graue: <hi>Sed cito fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam datur istam cernere vitam. Praeceps mortis iter:</hi> Death makes a headlong progresse. This Ordinance carries death in the mouth: it is an euen hand that shootes; one that will neuer misse the marke: let this rouze vs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God hath a Trumpet to sound. <note n="r" place="margin">1. Thes. 4. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord shall descend from heauen with a shout, with the voyce of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angell, and with the Trumpe of God. Altisona, grandisona Tuba:</hi> the lowdest Instrument of warre; euery eare shall heare it. As it was in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Lot;</hi>

                  <hi>Otia si tollas, periere Cupidinis arcus. Dauid,</hi> hast thou nothing to doe? Come, walke with mee on thy Palace roofe, I will shew thee beauty; a snare able to take a Saint. It is necessary therefore to be <hi>going;</hi> for so we are not so fair a mark for Satan. <hi>Adam,</hi> so long as he was at his work in the Garden, vvas safe enough: when he became lazie, and fell a dallying with <hi>Eue,</hi> Satan shot him. It vvas <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi> counsell to <hi>Rusticus;</hi> Be euer doing, <hi>vt quando dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus veniat, inueniat occupatum:</hi> that when the Deuill comes with his businesse, he may find thee at thine owne businesse. So thou shalt answere him knocking at thy dore; I am busie; I haue no time to talke, with you, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Do you think the Deuill could be so sure to meet his friends at the Theater, Tauerne, Brothell-house; but that mistresse Idlenesse sends them thither? Yea by this he takes a worldling by the hand at Church: well mette; you are so full of businesse all the weeke, that you breake your sleepes, cannot take your rest: come, heere be two Sermons on the Sunday, sleepe out them. The Sabbath seemes tedious to some, they haue nothing to doe? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Alas, they know not a Sabbaths dayes worke. To pray, to heare, to reade, to meditate, to conferre, to visit, to pray againe: is all this nothing? Because they labour not in their worldly calling, they thinke there needes no labour about their Christian calling: the <hi>working out their saluation</hi> they holde no paines; indeede they take no paines about it. If they did performe these duties, they should find the right spending the Sabbath, not <hi>Nullum laborem, sed alium:</hi> not no labour, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kinde of labour then euer they conceiued. And this not <hi>Opus taedij, sed gaudij.</hi> Thinke on that sweete vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitude of workes and comforts; And <hi>Breue videbitur tempus tantis variet atibus occupatum:</hi> that time must needs seem short, that is spent in such variety of delights. It was the principall of those three faults, whereof <hi>Cato</hi> profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe to haue so seriously repented. One was, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

               <p>Now as <hi>Faith</hi> excells all other graces, so there is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall degree of faith that excells all other degrees. For eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faith, is not a sauing faith. The King of Syria comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Captaines, <hi rend="sup">y</hi>

By his Princely attire, and royall deportment. Perhaps they met with many glorious personages, slew heere and there one; none of them was the King of Israel. Setting vpon <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> they said, <hi>Surely this is the King of Israel;</hi> no, it was not. One drew <hi>a bow at a venture, smote</hi> a man in his Charet, and that was the King of Israel. The faith that belieues Gods Word to be true, is a good faith, but not <hi>Illa fides,</hi> that sauing <hi>Faith.</hi> The faith that beleeues Christ to be the worlds Sauiour, is a true faith, but not that faith. The faith that belieues many men shall be saued, is <hi>vera fides, non illa fides,</hi> a true faith, but not that faith. The faith that beleeues a mans owne soule redeemed, iustified, saued by the merits of Iesus Christ; not without vvorks answerable to this beliefe: this is that faith. That was the King of Israel, and this is the Queene of Isra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>: all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be but her attendants.</p>
               <p>There is <hi>Fides Sentiends, Assentiendi, and Appropriandi:</hi> a man may haue the first, and not the second: he may haue the first and second, and yet not the third: but if he haue the third degree, he hath all the former. Some know the truth, but doe not consent to it: some know it, and assent to it, yet beleeue not their owne part: they that belieue their own mercy, haue all the rest. As meat digested turnes to iuyce in the stomake, to bloud in the liuer, to spirits in the heart: so faith is in the braine knowledge, in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son assent, in the heart application. As the child in the wombe hath first a vegetatiue life, then a sensitiue, last a rationall. So faith, as meere knowledge, hath but a vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as allowance, but sense: onely the applying and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning the merites of Christ to the owne soule by it, this is the rationall, the very life of it.</p>
               <p>But thus we may better exemplifie this Similitude. The vegetatiue soule is the soule of plants, and it is a true soule in the kind, though it haue neither sense nor reason. The sensitiue soule is the soule of beasts, a true soule; includes vegetation, but is voide of reason. The rationall soule is
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:25651:223"/>
the soule of man, a distinct soule by it selfe, comprehends both vegetation and sense, hauing added to them the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of reason. So there are three kindes or degrees of <hi>Faith.</hi> 1. To belieue there is a God; this is the faith of Pagans, and it is a true faith, though it neither belieue the Word of God, nor mercy from God. 2. To belieue that what God sayes is true: this is the faith of deuils and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, and a true faith; including the faith of Pagans, and going beyond it; yet it apprehends no mercy. 3. To belieue on God, to rely vpon his mercy in Christ, and to affie their owne reconciliation; this is the faith of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; comprehends both the former, yet is a distinct faith by it selfe.</p>
               <p>This faith onely saues; and it hath two properties. 1. It is a repenting faith: for Repentance is Faiths Vsher, &amp; deawes all her way with teares. Repentance reades the Law and weepes. Faith reads the Gospell and comforts. Both haue seueral bookes in their hands; <hi>Poenitentia intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etur Mosem, Fides Christum.</hi> Repentance lookes on the rigorous brow of <hi>Moses,</hi> Faith beholds the sweet counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Christ <hi>Iesus.</hi> 2. It is a working faith: if it worke not, it is dead: and a dead faith no more saues, then a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fire warmes. Faith is a great <note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 45. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Queene, her cloathing is of wrought gold: the virgins her companions that follow her,</hi> are good deeds: <hi>Omnis fidelis tantum credit, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Greg.</note> 
                  <hi>sperat &amp; amat: &amp; quantum credit, sperat, &amp; amat; tantum operatur.</hi> A Christian so farre beleeues, as he hopes and loues: and so farre as he belieues, hopes and loues, he workes. Now as <hi>Moses</hi> is said to <note n="r" place="margin">Hebr. 11. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>see him that is invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> because he saw his back-parts: and as when we see the members of the body mouing to their seuerall functions, we know there is a soule within, albeit vnseene: so faith cannot be so invisible, but the fruites of a good life will declare it.</p>
               <p>Thus by degrees you see what is the right sauing faith. As a Lapidary that shewes the buyer an orient pearle; and
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:25651:224"/>
hauing a little fed his eye with that, outpleaseth him with a Saphyre; yet out-values that with some Ruby or Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solite: wherwith rauished, he doth lastly amaze him with a sparkling Diamond transcending all.

So there are diuers vertues like Iewels, but the most precious Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell of all is Faith: And there are diuers degrees of faith, as diuers coloured cloathes; but the sauing faith is arrayed in the Scarlet robe, hath dipped and died her selfe in the bloud of her Sauiour Iesus: yet is she white, pure white as the snow of Lebanon: so are all that be washed in that red fountaine. <note n="s" place="margin">Reu. 7. 14.</note>

               <p>This is the property of that faith that healed him; his owne faith. But how could Christ call it <hi>His</hi> faith, when as faith is Gods gift?

                  <hi>Faith comes by hearing.</hi> Now when God hath giuen a man Faith, he calls it his; <hi>Thy faith;</hi> for what is freer then gift? So the Prophet calls it their own mercy; <note n="b" place="margin">Ion. 2. 8.</note>

                  <hi>Hath made thee whole,</hi> or <hi>saued thee:</hi> It may be read eyther way; It hath <hi>saued</hi> thee, or It hath <hi>salued</hi> thee. First, of them both ioyntly, then seuerally.</p>
               <p>Faith is the meanes to bring health to body, comfort to soule, saluation to both. I call it but the meanes; for some haue giuen it more. Because the Apostle saith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> obtained the promise <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Through the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of faith:</hi> therefore say they, <hi>Fides ipsa Iustitia;</hi> Faith is righteousnesse it selfe. But let S. <hi>Paul</hi> answere them, and expound himselfe: I desire <hi>to</hi>

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:25651:226"/>
hauing mine owne righteousnesse, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ,</hi> (whose is that?) <hi>the righteousnesse which is</hi> (not of vs, but) <hi>of GOD by Faith.</hi> Thus faith is said to saue vs, not of it selfe: the hand feeds the mouth, yet no man thinkes that the mouth eates the hand, onely as the hand conueyes meat to the body, so faith saluation to the soule. Wee say the Ring stancheth bloud, when indeed it is not the Ring, but the stone in it. There are many that make faith an almighty Idoll; it shal saue: but thus they make themselues idle, and trust all vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing. That faith is a meritorious cause of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this a doctrine that may come in time to trample Christs bloud vnder feet.</p>
               <p>Now these speeches rightly vnderstood; <hi>Faith</hi> adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, faith iustifieth, faith saueth; are not derogatory to the glory of God, nor contradictory to these speeches, Christ adopteth, Christ iustifieth, Christ saueth. One thing may bee spoken of diuers particulars in a different sense. God the Father adopteth, the Sonne adopteth, the holy Spirit adopteth, Faith adopteth: all these are true, and without contrariety. They be not as the young men that came out of the two armies before <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Abner:</hi>

               <p>Faith brings iustification, not by any speciall excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it hath in it selfe, but onely by that place and office which God hath assigned it: it is the condition on our parts.

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:25651:226"/>
he had not been healed: it was Gods command that gaue those waters such purging vertue. If the Israelites stung with these fiery serpents in the Desart, had of their owne deuising set vp a brazen Serpent, they had not beene cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: it was neyther the materiall brasse, nor the serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine forme, but the direction of God which effected it. It was not the Statue, but the Statute, that gaue the vertue. So Faith for it owne merit brings none to heauen, but for the promise which the God of Grace and Truth had made to it.</p>
               <p>In common speech wee say of such a man; His Lease maintaines him: is there any absurdity in these words? No man conceiues it to bee a parchment lined vvith a few words, accompanied with a vvaxen Labell, that thus maintaines him: but that House or Land, or rents so conueyed to him. So Faith saueth: I ascribe not this to the Instrument, but to Iesus Christ whom it apprehends, and that inheritance by this meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed.</p>
               <p>But now wouldest thou know thy selfe thus interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? looke to thy faith, this is thy proofe. If a rich man die, and bequeath all his riches and possessions to the next of bloud; many may challenge it, but he that hath the best proofe carries it.

that thou mayest be with Christ. Yet this is not all; thou shalt againe meet those, whom thou now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partest from; and that with greater ioy, then thou hast left in present sorow.</p>
               <p>This comforts vs all: if it be a pleasure for friends to meet on earth, where Satan is still scattering his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of dissention; what is it to meete in heauen, where our peace is free from distraction, from destruction! where if there be any memorie of past things, <hi>meminisse iunabit;</hi> it shall rather delight vs, to thinke of the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries gone, and without feare of returning. It is some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to the merchant, to sitte by a quiet fire, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course the escaped perills of wrackes and stormes. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue then your eyes from this earth; whether you be rich, for whom it is more hard; or poore, for whom it is easier: and know, it is better liuing in heauen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then on earth together.

               <p>That knowledge which we nowe haue is shallow in all of vs, and dissonant in some of vs. There is but one way to know God, that is by <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> and but one way to know Christ, and that is by the Gospell.

Here is the benefite of sight.

In this bright <hi>knowledge we shall all meete.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our present knowledge shall be excelled by our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in 5. differences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In qualitie: this is an abstracted knowledge of Christ absent, that a plenary knowledge of Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. <hi>Ex abstractiua fit intuitiua notitia.</hi> The light of a lampe vanisheth, when the glorious sunne appeareth. <note place="margin">Melanct.</note> If our knowledge were <hi>mundus eruditionis,</hi> a world of learning, yet is it but <hi>eruditio mundi,</hi> the learning of the world; of narrow bounds in regard of the knowledge in heauen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In quantitie; euen that we know now, shall be known then in a greater measure. The orbes, elements, planets, plants; the herbes of the field, parts of our own bodyes we know now; but alas weakly in regard of that perfection which this future life shall giue vs. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Christian, for his owne sauing health, knowes so much as is able to make him euerlastingly blessed: for he knowes Christ his Sauiour, <hi>and that is eternall life.</hi> But then he shall know him in a higher measure, and perfectly see those things, now vnconceaueable. <hi>Paul</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In perfection or maturitie. Our knowledge heere growes from degree: there it shall be one and the same, receauing or requiring no augmentation. <note n="r" place="margin">Psal. 84. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>They goe from strength to strength:</hi> how long? <hi>till they appeare before God in Sion.</hi>

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:25651:239"/>
4. In continuance. Earthly knowledge is momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, all skill in tongs and arts is like the authors, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and shall come to an end. The most famous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists haue often either mette with a derogate name, or beene buried in obliuion. The study of Christ is onely eternall, and shall not be abrogated, but perfected: <hi>we shall know then, as we are knowne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. In vnitie; various, dissonant, and not seldome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant is humane knowledge: indeed not worthy the name of knowledge; for it is Opinion. Man is contrary to man, yea man to himselfe: this same <hi>vnum sentire</hi>

                  <hi>to be of one minde,</hi> is difficult, if not impossible to be found. Though wee ayme our knowledge at one marke, yet some shoote on the right hand, some on the left; some short, &amp; others shoote ouer; hauing a <note n="t" place="margin">1. Cor. 8. 1.</note>

               <p>If any aske, whether our knowledge shall extend no further then to <hi>Christ</hi> our Sauiour.

Here we see the great difference betwixt this life and the next. In this life we grow vp to our full <hi>Stature;</hi> and then we decrease till we decease; we decline and die. In the other, we come at first to a <hi>perfect stature,</hi> and so continue for euer. We are here subiect to sorrowes and sinnes; the first grieuous to vs as we are men, the other as we are good men: loe we shall one day be freed, bee perfect. It is a sweete meditation that fell from a reuerend Diuine; that many vegetable &amp; brute creatures doe exceede men in length of dayes, and in happinesse in their kind; as not wanting the thing they desire. The Oake, the Rauen, the Storke, the Stagge fill vp many yeares, in regard of whom man dies in the minoritie of child-hood. This made the Philosophers call Nature a Stepdame to man, to the rest a true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For shee giues him least time, that could make best vse of his time; and least pleasure, that could best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, and take comfort in it. But here diuinitie teacheth &amp; reacheth a large recompence from our God. Other creatures liue long, and then perish to nothing; man dies soone here, that hereafter he may liue for euer. This shortnesse is recompenced with eternitie. Dost thou blame Nature, O Philosopher, for cutting thee so short that thou canst not get knowledge! Open thine eyes: perfect knowledge is not to be had here, though thy dayes were double to <hi>Methushalems.</hi> Aboue it is. Blesse God then rather for thy liues shortnes: for the sooner thou diest, the sooner thou shalt come to thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired knowledge. The best here is short of the least there. Let no man blame God for making him too soone happie. Say rather with the Psalmist; <hi>My soule is a thirst for the liuing God: O when shall I come to appeare in the glorious presence of the Lord?</hi> who would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake a prison for a pallace, a tabernacle for a Citie, a sea of daungers for a firme land of blisse; the life of men for the life of Angels?

               <head>They said.</head>
               <p>We haue described the Persons, <hi>What they were:</hi> let vs see <hi>what they did. They said:</hi> They open their lips to confesse the invincible and inevitable power of Christ. whence derive we two obseruations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The sense of present miserie takes away Atheisme. Before their mouthes were either shut by silence, or opened by blasphemies; possessed either with a dumbe or a roring deuill. <hi>God was not in all their thoughtes:</hi> or <note place="margin">Psal. 10. 4.</note> if in their thoughts, not in their lips: or if in their lips, but to his dishonour; not named but in their oathes. Now loe, they speake, and make a desperate acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of that power, they erst derided. The day of iudgment, when it comes, shall find no Atheist. What those degenerate creatures would not beleeue, they shall see: they would not acknowledge their maker, they shall find their Iudge: and cry to the mountaines, <hi>Fall one vs, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider this, <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 50. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>ye that forget God, lest you be torne in pieces when there is none to deliuer you.</hi> You may forget him during your short pleasure, you shall remember him for euer in torture. Proceed to <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 139. 20</note> 
                  <hi>speake of him wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, and like enemies to take his Name in vaine;</hi> you shall one day fall low before his footestoole, not with a voluntary but enforced reuerence. You that haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied God on earth, the first voice that shall come from your lips, shall be a hopelesse acknowledgment of his maiestie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The saying that comes from them is desperate: whence note, that in Gods iust punishment <hi>Desperation</hi> is the reward of <hi>Presumption.</hi> They that erst feared two <note place="margin">Presumption running into Despaire.</note> little shall now feare too much. Before they thought
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:25651:247"/>
not of Gods Iustice, now they shall not conceiue his Mercie. Consciences, that are without remorse, are not without horror. It is the kindnes which presumptuous sinne doth the heart to make it at last despaire of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes. <hi>They say.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold, God accuseth not, they accuse themselues. God loues to haue a sinner accuse himselfe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sets his deputie in the brest of man: which though it be a neuter when the act is doing, is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary afterwards. The conscience is like the poise of a clocke: the poise being downe, all motion cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, the wheeles stirre not: wound vp, all is set on going. Whiles conscience is downe, there is no noise or moouing in the heart; all is quiet: but when it is wound vp by the iustice of God, it sets all the wheeles on working: tongue to confesse, eyes to weepe, hands to wring, brest to be beaten, heart to ake, voice to cry; and that, where mercie steps not in, a fatall cry; to the hils, <hi>Fall on vs, and hide vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sinne, and iudgment for sinne, make the most cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell men cowardly. Tyrants whose frownes haue beene death; oppressors that haue made their poore Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants quake at their lookes; now tremble themselues: &amp; would change firmnes with an aspine leafe. They that care not for the act of sinne, shall care for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. <hi>Tumidi faciendo, timidi patiendo. Nero</hi> that could not be tired in cutting throtes, is soone weary of his owne torment. They that haue made others weepe, shall desperately howle themselues. <hi>Cain,</hi> that durst kill the fourth part of the world at a blow, euen his owne brother; dares afterwards not looke a man in the face, lest he <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 4. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>should be slayne.</hi> Who durst be more impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bold with God then <hi>Iudas,</hi> when he betrayed his onely Sonne to murderers? yet after the treason who more cowardly then <hi>Iudas?</hi> he becomes his owne hangman. The curse that followes sinne makes Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:25651:247"/>
it selfe to shudder. But what madnes is it, not to complaine till too late. If our foresight were but halfe as sharpe as our sense, we should not dare to sinne. The issue of wickednes would appeare a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times more horrible, then the act is pleasant.</p>
               <p>Let this teach vs now to thinke of the Iustice of God as well as his mercie, that herafter we may thinke of his mercie as well as his Iustice. The mercie of God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused to encourage lewdnes: and wretched men by Christs merits are emboldned to committe that, for which he dyed: but so men may runne with mercie in their mouthes to hell. They that in life will giue no obedience to the law, shall in death haue no benefite by by the Gospell. When they gaue themselues ouer to lying swaring, coueting &amp;c. they were wont to cry, Mercie, mercie: now loe, they feele what those sinnes are, and cry nothing but Iustice, Iustice; they cannot thinke on mercie. They that haue abused mercie, must be quitted with vengance. The good now sing; <hi>With thee, O Lord, is mercie; therefore thou shalt be feared.</hi> The reprobates sing at last, with thee O Lord, is iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; with thee is storme and tempest, indignation &amp; wrath, confusion and vengence, and therefore art thou feared.</p>
               <p>These necessary occurrences, thus considered; let vs passe to their <hi>Inuocation,</hi> wherein is exemplified their <hi>Error.</hi> Here we must obserue To what, For what, they call.</p>

                  <hi>then say you to my soule, Flie as a bird to your mountaine?</hi> It is Gods charge. <note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 50. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble: and I will deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> But, Rom. 10. <hi>How shall they call on him, in whom they haue not</hi>

                  <hi>beleeued?</hi> Or beleeue in him they haue not knowne? and how should they know him but by his <hi>word?</hi> Alas those mutuall passages, and entercourse of meanes they haue euer barred themselues. They would neither suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer God to trouble them by his word, nor would they offer to trouble him by their prayers. <note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 14. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>They will not call vpon him,</hi> nor will they heare him calling vpon them.</p>
               <p>Therefore as those that neuer were in the companie of God, they know not how to addresse themselues to him; but rather to <hi>rockes and mountaines.</hi> As extremity discerneth friends; <hi>Verè amat, qui miserum amat:</hi> so it distinguisheth a man in himselfe. A suddaine distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance giues a great try all of a Christians disposition. For as in a naturall man at such an affrightment, all the bloud runs to the heart, to guard the part that is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall: so in a good man at such an instance, all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties run to the soule, to saue that which is principall. The bloud and spirits striue to saue the life of the bodie: faith &amp; hope to saue the life of the soule. So that at the suddaine assault of some daunger, a man shall best iudge of his owne heart. It may bee at other times a dissembler; <hi>for mans heart is false, who can know it?</hi> yet at such time it will manifest it selfe, and cannot deceiue.</p>
               <p>If God hath beene our familiar friend, and accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med helper; danger doth not sooner salute vs, then we salute him by our prayers. The first thought of our hearts is <hi>Iesus</hi> Christ: the first voyce of our lips is <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> on the sea in such an extremitie; <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 14. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord saue mee:</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:25651:248"/>
our faith is reposed on his wonted mercy and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Wee know whom we haue beleeued. Daniell</hi> cals on GOD, ere hee fals to the Lions; this stoppes their mouthes.</p>
               <p>The wicked in such miserie, are either heauie and heartlesse, as <hi>Nabal;</hi> whose <note n="k" place="margin">1. Sa. 25. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>heart dyed within him, and he became as a stone.</hi> Or desperate as <hi>Iulian,</hi> throwing his bloud vp into the ayre, with a blasphemous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. Or sottish, as these here; running to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, vnprofitable, vnpossible helpes. When the blow of vengeance strikes the couetous, he runs to his counting house; if his bagges can giue him no succour, he is distracted. If any broken reed bee their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in these ouerwhelming woes, they catch drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hold of that; so they and their hopes perish toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There are some whose tongues are so poysoned with blasphemie, that in an vnexpected accident, the very first breath of their lips is a curse, or an oath. As if they would sweare away destruction, which euery vngodly speech drawes on neerer. If these men hadde beene acquainted with God in faire weather, they would not forget him in a storme. But they that will haue no familiaritie with God in peace, shall haue him to seeke in extremitie.</p>
               <p>When therefore some sudden perill hath threatned thee with terrour, note seriously how thou art affected. Though the danger came vnlook'd for, let it not passe vnthought of: but as thou blessest God for deliuery, so examine the good or ill disposednesse of thine owne heart. If thou find thy selfe couragious and heauenly minded, on thy confidence in God; take at once assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thy faith and Gods mercie.

So these reprobates newly raysed from the earth, cry to it to receiue them againe; glad to remaine (though not on the face of it with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) in the bowels of it with rottenesse and solitude; rather then in the open light to come before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat of Christ. The graue is a drowne-bed to hell.

On necessitie there must be some outward obseruances; but thus qualified. That they be for number few, for signification plaine,

               <p n="4">4. The renting of the <hi>vaile</hi> teacheth vs; that when men sinne rebelliously against God, no prerogatiue shall doe them good. The Temple was one of their principallest priuiledges, their glory, their crowne. <note n="n" place="margin">Ier. 7. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.</hi> It was a figure of the Church militant as <hi>Solomon</hi> the builder was a figure of Christ. For this Temples sake God often spared them. So <hi>Daniel</hi> prayes; <note n="o" place="margin">Dan. 9. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Cause thy face to shine vpon thy Sanctuary, that is desolate.</hi> Yet when they fall away from God, and crucifie their <hi>Messias,</hi> this prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue helpes not.

                  <hi>If ye will not heare, if ye will not lay it to heart, I will send a curse vpon you, I will curse your blessings: yea I haue cursed them already, because you doe not lay it to heart.</hi> It lies in mans sinne, to make God curse his very blessings: and to punish the nocent in the innocent creatures.</p>
               <p>We see the way, how wee may loose Temples, and peace, and Gospell, and all priuiledges; by running the courses of disobedience. Who can number the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings we haue enioyed by the Gospell? Let vs beware, least our vngracious and vngratefull liues robbe vs not of that, with all the appertinent comforts.

Churches and Cities haue no more monuments, but the ruined foundations to testifie that they were. Sin made way for bloud and massacre; Idolatrie puld downe those wals, which otherwise the most sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hand should haue forborne.

                  <hi>They haue burnt vp all the Synagogues in the land:</hi> but they haue done very wickedly to the Lords Sanctuaries.

               <p n="5">5. Lastly, <hi>The Vaile was rent.</hi> By renting the part God did threaten the subuersion of the whole.

thinke that your faire houses shall stand, when they are made couerts of oppressions, and convents of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! when the better things are not fauoured, the worst haue small hope. So <hi>Peter</hi> reasons; <note n="a" place="margin">1. Pet 4. 17.</note>

The Temple was one of the worlds greatest wonders; as curious a workemanship as sixe and thirtie yeares could make it: it wanted not the art of man, yea the blessing of heauen was added to it. Yet now loe, <hi>Etiam periere ruinae;</hi> this goodly building by sin was brought to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, yea euen the very ruines are perished. Shall then your Forts and Pallaces, worldlinges Paradises: full of rapine, emptie of charitie; stand against all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and stormes of iudgement? No, stone shall fall after stone; and ruine shall one day tell the passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as GOD threatned of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> Here stood a goodly Manner, a sumptuous edifice, a royall Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. Or if they fall not downe in themselues, they shall fall to the owners; whose iniquities haue defiled them.</p>
               <p>God punisheth by certaine degrees; first he rents the <hi>vaile,</hi> then rents away the Temple: As by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> hand he first rent <hi>Saules</hi> garment, and then rent away his kingdome.

               <p n="1">1. To consider the fiercenesse of Gods wrath against sinnes and sinners. For God by shaking the earth did no lesse then threaten the vtter subuersion of those despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and bloudie wretches. <hi>Corah</hi> and his confederates were swallowed vp of the earth, for rebelling against <hi>Moses</hi> the Lords seruant. <note n="e" place="margin">Hebr. 10. 29.</note>

               <p n="1">1. This did foresignifie the power and efficacie of the Gospell, that it should bee able to breake the very <hi>rockes.</hi> As the death and passion of Christ did cleaue those so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:25651:262"/>
and almost impenetrable substances: so the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his death and passion shall rend and breake in pieces the <hi>rockie</hi> hearts of men. So <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> said; <note n="o" place="margin">Math. 3. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>God is able of stones to rayse vp children vnto Abraham.</hi> The hearts of <hi>Zaccheus, Mary Magdalene, Paul,</hi> were such rockes; yet they were cleft with the wedge of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. This is that <hi>Rod of Moses,</hi> able to breake the hardest <hi>Rockes;</hi> till they gush out with flouds of penitent teares. This is <hi>Ieremies hammer,</hi> powerfull to bruise the most obdurate hearts. The bloud of the Goate sacrificed, of force to dissolue Adamant. There is power in the bloud of <hi>Iesus,</hi> to put sense into stones. Blessed are you, if you be thus broken-hearted for him, whose heart was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you.

               <p n="2">2. Obserue the wonderfull hardnesse of the Iewes hearts. The <hi>stones rent</hi> and claue in sunder at the cruell death of <hi>Iesus:</hi> but their hearts more stony then stones, are no whit moued. They rend not their garments, much lesse their hearts: when as the earth rent the <hi>Stones</hi> her bones, and the <hi>rockes</hi> her ribbes. The flints are softer then they: the flints breake, they harden. They still belch their malicious blasphemies, the <hi>rocks</hi> relent: the <hi>stones</hi> are become men, and the men <hi>stones.</hi> O the sencelesnesse of a hard heart: <hi>rockes</hi> will sooner breake, then that can be mollified. Euen the hardest creatures are flexible to some agents: flints to the raine, iron to the fire, stones to the hammer: but this heart yeelds to nothing; neyther the showers of mercie, nor the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of reproofe, nor the fire of Iudgements: but like the stithy, are still the harder for beating. All the plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> cannot mollifie the heart of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> It is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drously vnnaturall, that men made the softest hearted of all, should be <hi>rigidiores lupis, duriores lapidibus;</hi> more cruell then wolues, more hard then stones.

Iewes; but it is not so. Howe often hath <hi>Christ</hi> beene here crucified; in the word preaching his Crosse to your eares, in the Sacraments presenting his death to your eyes; thinke, thinke in your owne soules, haue not the stones in the walles of this Church beene as much moued? God forbid our obduratenesse should be punished as theirs was: since they would be so stony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was turned <hi>to a heape of stones;</hi> and the conquering Romanes dasht them pitifully against those <hi>stones,</hi> which they exceeded in hardnesse.</p>
               <p>Here let the wicked see their doome: the stones that will not be softned, shall be broken. There is no chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the decree of God, but change thy nature, and then know thou art not decreed to death. Stony harts shall bee broken to pieces with vengeance: doe not striue to alter that doome, but alter thy owne <hi>stony</hi> heart to a heart of <hi>flesh,</hi> and so preuent it in the particular. Wolues and goates shall not enter into heauen: thou maiest pull starres out of heauen before alter this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; but doe it thus.

               <head>4. Miracle.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>The graues were opened, and many bodyes of Sanits which slept, arose.</hi> Concerning this two questions are moued.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where their soules were all this while before. I answere, where the scripture hath no tongue, we should haue no eare. Most probably thus: their soules were in heauen, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome; and came downe to their bodyes by diuine dispensation, to manifest the power and Deitie of Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whither they went afterwards. I answere by the same likelyhood, that they died no more, but waited on the earth till Christs resurrection; and then attended him to heauen. But these things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, should not be disputed. <hi>Tutum est nescire quod tegitur.</hi> It is a safe ignorance, where a man is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to know. Let vs then see what profitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions we can hence deriue to our selues. They are many, and therefore I will but lightly touch them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This teacheth vs, that Christ by his death hath vanquished death, euen in the graue, his owne cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. That gyant is subdued, the graues flie open, the dead goe out. This beares ample witnesse to that speach of Christ. <note n="r" place="margin">Ioh. 11. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the resurrection and the life: he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he liue.</hi> The bodies of the Saints, what part of the earth or sea so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer holds their dusts, shall not be detayned in prison; when Christ cals for them: as the members must needs goe, when the <hi>Head</hi> drawes them. He shall speake to all creatures, <hi>Reddite quod deuorastis:</hi> restore whatsoeuer of man you haue deuoured: not a dust, not a bone can be denyed. <hi>The bodyes of the Saints shall be raised,</hi> sayth August. <note n="s" place="margin">In Enchirid.</note> 
                  <hi>Tanta facilitate quanta faelicitate:</hi> with as much easynes, as happynes. <note n="t" place="margin">Sen. epist. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Desinunt ista, non pereunt: mors intermittit vitam, non eripit.</hi> Our bodies are left for a time, but perish not: death may discontinue life, not conclude it. <hi>Intermittit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:25651:264"/>
cannot be destroyed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obserue, that all the dead doe not rise, but <hi>Many,</hi> and those <hi>Saints.</hi> The generall resurrection is reserued to the last day: this a pledge or earnest of it. Now who shall rise with this comfort? none but <hi>Saints:</hi> as here Christ takes no other company from the graues, but <hi>Saints.</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">1. Thess. 4. 16</note> 
                  <hi>The dead in Christ shall rise first.</hi> Christ is called <note n="a" place="margin">Coloss. 1. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>The first borne from the dead:</hi> He hath risen, and his shall next follow him. <hi>Euerie man in his owne order;</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ the first fruits, afterward they that are Christs, at his comming.</hi> Wormes and corruption shall not hinder: he that sayd <hi>To Corruption, thou art my mother: and to the wormes, you are my brethren and sisters:</hi> sayd also, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liueth, and</hi> one day <hi>with these eyes I shall behold him.</hi> The wicked shall also be raised, though with horrour, to <hi>looke vpon him whom they haue pierced.</hi> But as Christ did here, so will he at the last, single out the <hi>Saints</hi> to beare him companie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This sheweth the true operation of Christs death in all men. We are all dead in our sins, as these bodies were in their graues: now when Christs death becomes effectuall to our soules, we rise againe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new creatures. From the graue of this world we come into the Church, <hi>the holy Citie.</hi> But thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainest of the deadnes of thy hart: it is well thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainest; there is some life or thou couldst not feele the deadnesse. <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>The houre is comming &amp; now is, when the dead shall heare the voice of the Sonne of God, and they that heare it shall liue.</hi> If this word hath raysed thee from death, and wrought spirituall life in thy heart, thou shalt perceiue it by thy breathing, words glorifying God; &amp; by thy mouing, in the waies, &amp; to the workes of obedience.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Obserue that these Saints which arose, are sayd to haue <hi>Slept.</hi> The death of the godly is often called a <hi>Sleepe.</hi> So it is sayd of the Patriarches and Kings of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:25651:264"/>
they <hi>slept with their fathers.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> saith, they <note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 18</note> 
                  <hi>sleep in Christ.</hi> The Coffin is a couch; <hi>In quo molliùs dormit, qui benè in vita laborauit,</hi> wherein hee takes good rest, that hath wrought hard in the worke of his saluation before he went to bed. <hi>Foelix somnus cum requie, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es cum voluptate, voluptas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="5">5. Lastly obserue that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is called the <hi>Holy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> though she were at this time a sinke of sinne, and a debaushed harlot. Either as some thinke, that she is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>holy,</hi> because she was once holy. So <hi>Rahab</hi> is called the <hi>harlot,</hi> because she was a harlot. <hi>Simon</hi> is termed the <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 26. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Leper,</hi> for that hee was a leper: and <note n="e" place="margin">Math. 10. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Mathew</hi> the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,</hi> for that he was a Publican. Or els she was called <hi>holy</hi> for the couenants sake; in regard of the Temple, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, seruice of God; and of the elect people of God that were in it. Whence we may inferre, how vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is to separate from a Church because it hath some corruptions. Is apostate <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that hath crucified her Sauiour, called still the <hi>holy Citie:</hi> and must England that departeth in nothing from the faith and doctrine of her Sauiour, for some scarce discernible Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be reiected as a foedifragous strumpet? But there be wicked persons in it: what then? Shee may be still a <hi>holy Cittie. Recedatur ab iniquitate, non ab iniquis.</hi> Let vs depart from sinne, we cannot runne from sinners.</p>
               <p>Thus we haue considered the <hi>Miracles;</hi> let vs now looke into the causes, wherefore they were wrought.</p>

1. In regard of <hi>Christ;</hi> to testifie not onely his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, but his Maiestie. His Innocencie, that hee was as <hi>Pilates wife</hi> acknowledged, a <note n="f" place="margin">Math. 27. 19.</note>

               <p n="2">2. In regard of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> to shew their <hi>Obedience</hi> to their Creator: they are not wanting to him, that gaue being to them. These demonstrate, it was their Lord that suffered; and that they were ready to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute vengeance on his murderers. The <hi>heauen</hi> that was <hi>darke</hi> would haue rained fire on them: the <hi>earth</hi> that <hi>quaked,</hi> shooke them to peeces: the <hi>rockes</hi> that <hi>rent,</hi> tumbled on them: and the <hi>graues</hi> that <hi>opened</hi> to let out other prisoners, haue swallowed them quicke. They all waited but his command to performe this revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full execution. Who shall now dare to persecute Christ in his members? The stones are thy enemies, the earth gapes for thee, hell it selfe enlargeth her iawes: if the Lord but hisse to them, they are sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in an vprore against thee. Goe on in your malice ye raging persecutors: you cannot wrong Christ, no not in his very members, but you pull the fists of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in heauen, earth, and hell about your eares: flies from the aire, beasts from the earth, poison from suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, thunder from the clouds; yea at last also (though now they helpe you) the very deuils from hell against you. All creatures shoote their malignancie at them,

that shoot theirs at Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In respect of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> his enemies; to shame and confound them. The <hi>rockes</hi> and <hi>graues</hi> are moued at his passion, not they. <hi>Lapides tremunt homines fremunt.</hi> The stones <hi>rent,</hi> the huge earth quakes with feare; the Iewes rage with malice. We see how difficult it is to mollifie a hard heart: harder then to remoue a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, raise the dead, cleaue a rocke, shake the whole earth. It is a great mryacle to conuert a wicked man; greater then <hi>rending</hi> of <hi>rockes. Moses</hi> rod stroke a <hi>Rocke</hi> thrice and did it: ministers haue stroke mens rocky harts three hundreth times, and cannot. The graues sooner open, then the sepulchers of sinne and darkenes: the vast earth sooner quakes, then mens hearts at Gods iudgements.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In respect of the <hi>women</hi> that stood by; that their faith might be confirmed. For seeing him on the Crosse, at their mercie, whose bowels neuer knew the softnes of such a nature: exposed to all the tyrannie of their hands and tongs: hands that like cruell Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions searched euery part of his blessed body: tongues that ranne nimbly through all the passages of obloquie, till they had ouertaken reproch it selfe, and cast it on him: His body at the full will of the tormenters, and his soule not without intolerable terrors; as they might iudge by strange speech that came from him; <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Doth man triumph ouer him, and doth God forsake him? This might breed in their hearts a suspition: either that hee was a deceiuer, or else vtterly cut off. To stifle this doubt in the very birth, hee <hi>shakes</hi> the earth, and rends the rockes; that as they knew him dying <hi>Hominem v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="5">5. In regard of the <hi>Disciples;</hi> to shame and conuince them for leauing him, Christ had said before, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>Si hitacerent, loquerentur lapides.

Such a shame is it for Apostles and ministers of Christ to hold their peace; that if they be silent, the very stones shall preach against them. The walles, windowes, pauements of Churches shall cry out against such Pastors, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the office of a sheep-heard, and feed Christ his flocke with nothing but ayre. And euen you that come to heare; if no remorse can be put into your hearts at the relation of our Sauiours death: if you haue no feeling of his sorrowes, no apprehension of these mysteries, no repentance of your sinnes, no emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your liues; know that the very seates where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you sit, the walles of your Temples, the very stones you tread on, shall beare witnesse against you.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> that at his death brake the <hi>Rockes;</hi> by the vertue of his death breake our rocky hearts; that being mollified in this life they may be glorified in the life to come. Grant this O <hi>Father</hi> for thy <hi>mercies</hi> sake, O <hi>Christ</hi> for thy <hi>merits</hi> sake, O holy <hi>Spirit</hi> for thy <hi>names</hi> sake: To whom three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, one onely wise and eternall God, be glory and prayse for euer.</p>

large bounds. <hi>Plurima possima;</hi> vile thinges are euer most plentifull. Wisedome flies like the Raile, alone: but <hi>fooles,</hi> like Partridges, by whole coueys. There is but one <hi>Truth,</hi> but innumerable errors. Which should teach vs</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not to <hi>follow a multitude in euill.</hi> In ciuill actions it is good to doe as the most; in religious, to doe as the best. It shall be but poore comfort in hell, <hi>Socios habu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse doloris.</hi> Thou pleadest to the Iudge; I haue done as others: the Iudge answeres; And thou shalt speed as others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To blesse God, that we are none of the many: as much for our <hi>Grace,</hi> whereby we differ from the <hi>fooles</hi> of the world; as for our <hi>Reason,</hi> whereby wee differ from the <hi>fooles</hi> of nature.</p>
               <p>Now as these <hi>fooles</hi> are many, so of many kindes. There is the <hi>Sad foole,</hi> and the <hi>Glad foole:</hi> the <hi>Haughtie foole,</hi> and the <hi>Naughtie foole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Sad</hi> or melancholy <hi>foole</hi> is the <hi>Enuious;</hi> that repines at his brothers good. An enemie to all Gods fauours, if they fall besides himselfe. A man of the worst diet; for he consumes himselfe; and delights in pining, in repining. Hee is readie to quarrell with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his neighbours flocke scape the rotte. He cannot endure to be happie, if with companie. Therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie is called by <hi>Prosper;</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Lib. 3. de vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut. &amp; vitijs.</note> 
                  <hi>De bono alterius tabescentis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimi cruciatus:</hi> the vexation of a languishing minde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising from anothers well-fare. <hi>Tantos Inuidus habet iustae poenae tortores, quantos inuidiosus habuit laudatores.</hi> So many, as the enuied hath praisers, hath the enuious tormentors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Glad foole,</hi> I might say the <hi>Mad foole,</hi> is the dissolute; who rather then he will want sport, makes goodnesse it selfe his Minstrell. His mirth is to fullie euery vertue with some slander; &amp; with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>est to laugh it out of fashion. His vsuall discourse is filled vp with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:25651:270"/>
boasting Parentheses of his old sinnes: and though he cannot make himselfe merry with their act, hee will with their report; as if he roued at this marke, to make himselfe worse then he is. If repentance doe but proffer him her seruice, he kickes her out of dores: his minde is perpetually drunke; and his bodie lightly dies, like <hi>Anacreon,</hi> with a grape in his throat. He is stung of that serpent, whereof he dies laughing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Haughtie foole</hi> is the <hi>ambitious:</hi> who is euer climbing high Towers, and neuer forecasteth how to come downe. Vp he will, though he fall downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. He is wearie of peace in the Countrey, and therefore comes to seeke trouble at Court: where hee haunts great men, as his great spirit haunts him. When he receiues many disappoyntments, he flatters himselfe still with successe. His owne fancie perswades him, as men doe <hi>fooles,</hi> to shoot away another arrow, thereby to find the first: so he looseth both. And lastly, because his pride will admit of no other punisher, he becomes his owne torment: and hauing at first lost his honestie, he will now also loose his wittes; so truely becomes a <hi>foole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Naughtie foole</hi> is the <hi>Couetous.</hi> This is the <hi>Follie</hi> that <hi>Salomon saw vnder the Sunne.</hi> You heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a <hi>merry</hi> foole; but the <hi>very</hi> foole of all is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarous: for he will loose his friends, starue his bodie, damne his soule, and haue no pleasure for it. So sayth the Prophet. <note n="d" place="margin">Ier. 17. 11.</note>

            <p>Malice in humour is like fire in straw, quickly vp, and quickly out: but taking hold of conscience, like fire in steele; <hi>Quod tardè acquisiuit, diù retinet;</hi> what was long in getting, will be longer in keeping.

               <hi>There must be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies among you that they which are approued may be made manifest.</hi> He drawes good out of euill; and makes a good <hi>Shall</hi> of the euill <hi>must:</hi> so raising a vertue from a necessitie. From contentions begot by <hi>Sathan,</hi> hee so sweetly workes, that the profession of his but darkely glowing before, shall be made to shine brightly. In Q. <hi>Maries</hi> time, when persecution wrung the Church, Martyrdome gaue a manifest approbation of many (vnknowne) Saints. The vertues of diuers had bin lesse noted, if this fiery triall had not put them to it. Gods glory and power are more perspicuous, in strengthening his against their enemies, then if they had none.

            <p n="2">2. There may be <hi>Dissention</hi> betwixt the wicked and the wicked; and hereof also is <hi>Satan</hi> authour. He sets his owne together by the eares, like cockes of the game to make him sport.

Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee drawes ruffian into the field against ruffian: and

then laughes at their vainely spilt bloud. All the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, quarrels, whereby one euill neighbour vexeth another; all slaunders, scoldings, reproches, calumnies, are his owne damned fires.

            <p n="1">1. The Deuill is politicke, and will not diuide his subiects, when by their holding together hee may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the Church.

               <note place="margin">Act. 14. 19.</note> Thus Satan holds them vnder colours and pay, whiles they can doe him any seruice: but when they can no longer vexe others, hee falls to vexing of them: and enrageth their thirst to one anothers bloud, when they haue done quaffing the bloud of the Saints.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Deuill in raising seditions and tumults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his owne, intends not the destruction, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his kingdome. Perhaps his forces on earth are weakned, but his Territories in hell are repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: wherein he takes himselfe to raigne most surely. For Satan, during a mans life, knowes not certainely, whether he belongs to God, or to him. Predestination is too mysticall and secret a booke for his condemned eyes to looke into; and repentance hath often stepped in betwixt old age and death: frustrating the hopes of Satan. Therefore he hastens a wicked man, with what speed he can, to hell; for till he came within those smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie gates, Satan is not sure of him; he may start out of his clutches. For this cause he precipitates witches with much suddennesse to their ends: whom, one would thinke, hee should let liue, that they might doe more mischiefe. No; such is his malicious policie, he would be sure of some: and rather take one soule in present, then hazard all on the vaine hope of more gaines.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>Dissention</hi> betweene the wicked and godly; nor yet is Christ the proper and immediate cause of this. For <hi>Rom. 12. If it be possible, as much as lieth</hi>

death. Now because the locall seate of holines on earth is in the hearts of the Saints; of wickednes in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and his Iustruments: therefore it followes, that the euill will persecute the good, and the good may not partake of the vices of the bad. <note n="k" place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 16.</note> 
               <hi>What agreement hath the temple of God with Idols! Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the vncleane thing, and I will receiue you.</hi> Out of the Egypt of this world hath God called his Sonnes.

It is good for the good to sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themselues from the incorrigible wicked; as being the first stayre of the ladder that leaues the earth; and sets the first step of our iourney to heauen. God in his eternall decree separated the elect from the Reprobate: in his Vocation, he sequesters them from nature and sinne. When hee executes particular iudgement, hee takes <hi>Israell</hi> from the Tabernacles of <hi>Corah:</hi> when he will giue the generall, he will seuer the <hi>Sheepe</hi> from the <hi>Goates.</hi>

               <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> causeth not quarrels betweene man and man, as they are creatures; but betwixt goodnesse and euill, as they are contrarie natures.

               <p n="1">1. Debate is like <hi>Fire;</hi> for as that of all elements, so this of all passions, is most violent. The earth is huge, yet we walke quietly on it; it suffers our ploughes to rend vp the entrals of it; to teach vs patience. The aire is copious, yet admits our respiration. The waters boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, yet sayle we vpon them, against them. But <hi>Fire,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially getting the vpper hand, is vnmercifully raging: it left nothing behind, to witnesse the former happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <hi>of Sodome.</hi> The worlds last destruction, shall be by <note n="a" place="margin">2.

take hold of ciuilitie or religion, of Burse or Church, to ouerthrow the common good of both.</p>
               <p>For ciuilitie, the breaking of relatiues, is the ruine of substantiues. We stand not of our selues, but vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.

They say the Church of England may be their mother, but is none of Gods wife: why doe they not call her plaine Whore? For such is a mother that hath children; and no husband. But these the whiles are braue Sons, who care not to proue themselues bastards, that their mother may be noted for an Harlot. But the shame be their owne, Integritie hers; who hath not defiled her bed, though they haue shamed her wombe.

               <p n="1">1. That this <hi>fire</hi> was kindled in Christs time, and hath burned euer since. For if this rage stroke at the head, it will not fauour the members. If the sawcie Deuill durst meddle and incounter with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he will not feare to set vpon a meane souldiour. <hi>Remember,</hi> sayth Christ <hi>the word that I sayd vnto you, The seruant is not greater then the Lord: if they haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted</hi>

In the securest and most quiet state of the Church we haue found this: that sedition hath trode on the heeles of peace; and persecution beene borne into the world, with the feete forward for hast.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the godly must maintaine this <hi>fire;</hi> for there must be in them no deficiencie of fewell. They must hold fast integritie, though this be the matter whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this <hi>fire</hi> workes. No peace must be had with them, that haue no peace with God: I deny not peace in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill affaires, but in conforming our manners to theirs. For righteousnesse must not yeeld to iniquitie: Christ must be borne, and being borne must raigne, though <note n="h" place="margin">Math. 2. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Herod</hi> rage, and the Deuill foame, and all <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> be troubled at it. <note n="i" place="margin">1. Sam. 5. 3.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The Gospell must be preached though hell breake out into opposition: and we must keepe <hi>faith</hi> &amp; a good conscience, though persecutors print in our sides the <hi>markes of the Lord Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That the fruit of the Gospell is so farre from allowing carnall peace, that it giues <hi>Dissention.</hi> It hath euer beene the destinie of the Gospell to bring commotion, trouble, and warres; though no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine teacheth so much peace.

                     </gap>nd peace, but a sword.</hi> Not that the Gospell of it selfe causeth warres; for it maketh peace betweene God and man, man and man, man and his inward soule: but it ouerturneth the tables of the money-changers, spoileth the Banke of vsurers, will not let <hi>Herod</hi> keepe his <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodias,</hi> barres <hi>Demetrius</hi> of his idolatrous shrines, puls the cup from the mouth of the drunkard, denounceth confusion to the oppressor, vnuizardeth painted hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, and discouers the vgly face of fraud to the world; therefore it hath enemies, euen to the effusion of bloud, and endeuourd extirpation of all that professe it. So that partly this proceeds from our owne corruption; that cannot endure the light, because our deedes are euill; and partly from the malice of Sathan, who by the growth of the Gospell looseth his Iurisdiction. For looke how much ground Christianitie gettes, that bloudie infernall Turke looseth. So that neither can the Deuill so vncontrollably lead men to quiet damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither can the euill heart bee so securely euill. For the Gospell informes the vnderstanding, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding tels the conscience, and the conscience will not spare to tell men their wickednesse. Though Gods hand forbeares to strike outwardly, the conscience smites inwardly; and the former vniust peace is broken by a new iust war. Men shall by this meanes know hell
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:25651:283"/>
before they salute, it and discerne themselues in that broad way that leads to damnation. Safe they may be, they cannot be secure. Thus the Gospell begets all maner of enemies, forraine, ciuill, domesticall. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, the Deuill who now makes apparant his hornes, as if it were high time to bestirre himselfe. Hee sees, he cannot lead soules to his blacke kingdome in a twine-threed, as hee was wont without reluctancie: he must clap irons vpon them, and bind them with his strongest tentations. Ciuill, the world which erst ticed vs on, as a baite doth the fish, not knowing that there is a hooke so neere the iawes wee tooke it for a kind and familiar friend; but now it is descried and described for a very aduersary. Domesticall, thy owne bosome is disquieted, and thou must muster vp all the forces of thy soule, to take the Traytour that lurkes within thee, thy owne flesh. This is a neare and a deare enemie, yet we must fight against it, and that with a will to subdue it; denying our selues, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking our delighted lusts and pleasures. The godly must be faine to sit, like the Nightingale, with a thorne against their brest. If they scape conflicts abroad, they are sure to haue them at home: and if forraigne and profest aduersaries should giue ouer their inuasions, yet this domesticall rebell, lust, must with great trouble be subdued. After which spirituall combate, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is that in the end the victorie shall be ours. <note n="k" place="margin">Ecclus. 28. 22.</note>

Employing the graces of God bestowed on vs, to the edification and consolation of others: spending our selues, like torches, to giue others light. A Christian, though he be the freest man of all, yet he is seruant to all: to Christ for himselfe, to others for Christ: <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 5. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>serue one another in loue.</hi> Let this affection of vnitie be encreased by considering three inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of dissension.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A great aduantage is giuen to the enemie. They boast the goodnes of others errours, whilst wee agree not in our truth. They take opportunity to shuffle in their counterfet coine, whiles wee consent not in our gold; I say not so much for the waight or purenes of sub stance, as for the fashion. Is it not a shame for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God to dissent, when the children of hell are at peace? It is a military principle; Tempt not an enemie, by giuing him the aduantage. What is this, but to harten their malignant opposition to assault vs, when they spie in the Citie a Breach? <hi>Qui vnionem rumpit, vnitatem ruit:</hi> Hee that dissolues the vnion of parts, ouerthrowes the vnitie of the whole.</p>

               <p n="2">2 The second generall <hi>fire</hi> he <hi>kindles,</hi> is error and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie; a burning riuer of poyson: that Cup of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which he reacheth out to the world in the hand of that great <hi>Babilonian Whore.</hi> To maintaine this fire, he cals Councells, enacts lawes, teacheth many Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the promulgation of bloudy Statutes: and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as other lawes of Princes (tending to the ruine of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie) are euer neglected, those that are made against Christians, haue beene most seuerely executed. And least the Deuill in this should appeare like himselfe, the Prince of death and darknes; heesits thundring in the Popes mouth like an Angell of light, and so directs him; that vnder <hi>In Dei nomine: Amen;</hi> he vnmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemneth his brother. So that the vsurpation of a diuine dispensation, must burne the poore members of Christ at the fierie stakes. Now this <hi>fire</hi> he <hi>kindleth</hi> by two malicious courses.</p>

eyes; and hartning their affection to darknes. So that the children of the night haue so doted vpon Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they hate and persecute all the meanes and messengers of illumination. Shine the Sunne neuer so bright, the Papists will see by nothing but Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Therefore it may be, they are permitted tapers, torches, and candles, to content their carnall deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that they might not spiritually desire the <hi>Light of the glorious Gospell of Iesus Christ, who is the image of God.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 4.</note> And if euer their caliginous minds spie the least glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of zeale, or feele a litle turning from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer impieties; the shrine, picture, or Image of some Saint hath the glory of their conuersion. A very blocke shall haue the praise, rather then God. But wee can hardly beleeue, they are conuerted from darknes to light, that fetch their illumination out of a stone. It is recorded, that at <hi>Amesbary,</hi> when Queene <hi>Alinor</hi> the wife of King <hi>Henry,</hi> 3. Lay there; a man <note place="margin">Act. &amp; Mon. pag. 355. ex. Chron. Rob.

So certainely those Saints, to the vertue of whose dead bones these hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites attribute the glory of their conuersion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening; would (if they were liuing) rather say these men had no eyes of grace at all, then that any light was giuen them out of their dead dusts, or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted resemblances. This is Sathans first proiect, to cast a thick cloud of inuincible ignorance, betweene mens eyes and the cleare Sunne.</p>

                  <hi>I Paul) once and againe: but Satan hindered vs.</hi> The good minister hath no aduersarie in his calling, but he is of the deuils raising. And herein he is either a wolfe or a foxe; effecting this either by open preuention, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret peruersion.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Openly he opposeth not onely his <hi>Principalities</hi> infernall, but also <hi>Powers</hi> terrestriall against it. What preacher euer beganne to sing with a cleare brest, the songs of <hi>Sion;</hi> for many hundred yeares vnder the Popes reach: but instantly, Pope, Cardinals, Fryers, Deuils cursed him with belles and candles, and were readie to burne him in flames! <hi>Saeuit mundus, cùm often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur immundus.</hi> The world is mad, that his dominion and damnation should be spoken against.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secretly he hinders the free preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, by corrupting their hearts that are deputed to that office. And this he effecteth by infusion of these foure hellish ingredients: Heresie against truth: Schisme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst peace: Popularitie against simplicitie; and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice against Charitie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He poysons some hearts with hereticall poynts of doctrine; which being lightly most pleasing to the flesh, are drunke with thirstie attention. Heresie is (thus defined) <hi>humanosensu electa, Scripturae sacrae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traria, palam docta, pertinaciter defensa:</hi> begot of mans braine, contrary to the holy Scriptures, openly taught, and peremptorily defended. By this, so farre as the flesh in man preuailes against the Spirit, Sathan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes against the truth. So that if they must needs haue any of the pure gold of Gods word, it shall be so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticated,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:25651:290"/>
adulterate, and mingled with the drosse of humane Traditions, that they shall not be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue or receiue it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Those whom he cannot corrupt against truth, he incenseth against peace. Diuision shall accomplish that mischiefe, which errour failed in. Whom he cannot transport to <hi>Rome,</hi> he ferries ouer to <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> He will either keepe men on this side the truth, or send them beyond it. Errour on the right hand shall cast away soules, if errour on the left cannot. Some runne so farre from <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they will not keepe neere <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> as men that runne so eagerly from a Lyon, that they refuge themselues in the hole of a Serpent. The Schismaticke meets with the Romanist, in super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition another way. Thus <hi>Quibus nequit tollere verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, negat permittere vnitatem:</hi> It he cannot depriue vs of truth, he will not permit vs peace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By perswading men to be temporisers, and to catch at the fauours of great men. Thus when a Preacher must measure his Sermon by his Lords humour, the truth of the Lord of Hoasts is smoothered. Against oppression he dares not speake, because it is his Lords fault: not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst pride because it is his Ladies: not against ryot, because it is his young Masters: nor against drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse because they fauour it whom his Great-one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. He must not meddle with those vlcers, which he sees to sticke on his Patrons conscience. That were the way to loose both present benefite, and future bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; he dares not doe it. Whiles he is their seruile chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, he must learne Turkie-worke; to make thrum'd cushions of flatterie for their elbowes. It seemes, it was not Gods businesse that such a one made himselfe Minister for; but his owne or worse. He hath three Masters: he serues his Lord, hee serues himselfe, hee serues the Deuill; which of these will pay him the best wages? Thus if Sathan can neither take away the truth,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:25651:290"/>
nor peace, yet he labours against simplicitie: that for feare of men, and hope of mens, they forbeare to speake against wickednes. What his kingdome looseth one way, it recouers another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By infecting their hearts with couetousnesse, and extending their desires to an insatiable wealth. With this pill he poison'd <hi>Demas;</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> before him, and thousands after him. The Chaire of <hi>Rome</hi> is filled with this pestilence. England hath found it, though many Princes will not find it. When the reuenues of the Crowne amounted not to halfe the Popes yearly taxes. But we are well eased of that vnsupportable burden: <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. begun it, for he first made the <hi>Premunire</hi> against the Pope: and our succeeding Christian Princes haue quite throwne him out of the saddle. God did not make his law so long, but man might easily remember it; comprising it all in ten Commandements. But the Pope hath curtalled it, &amp; made it far shorter; abridging the ten commandements into two words; <hi>Da pecuniam Giue money.</hi> And for this the whole law shall be dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with. Experience hath still proued, that money was the Apostolicall arguments of <hi>Rome.</hi> An Emperour paid for his absolution 120000. ounces of gold: a deare rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning for those wares, that cost the Pope nothing.</p>
               <p>In the raigne of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. The Pope required the tenths of all the moueables in England, Ireland, &amp; Wales: and <note place="margin">Ex Math. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risiens.</note> because he feared, that such moneys could not be spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily enough collected, he sent ouer many vsurers into the land, which were then called <hi>Caursini:</hi> who would lend money to those of the Clergy that wanted, but on so vnreasonable extortion, that the debters were still beggar'd. So that what by his violent exaction, &amp; subtle circumuention by his owne vsurers (for all they had was the Popes money) he desired onely the tenth part, but he got away also the other 9. And indeed the Pope had reason to maintain vsury, for vsury maintained the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:25651:291"/>
Pope. Neither is this infection bounded vp with that Bishop, but dissipated among all his Clergie. Not so much as the very Mendicant Fryers, that professe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pouertie, but haue a wilfull desire to be rich. They haue more holines in their hands, then in their hearts: their hands touch no money, their hearts couet it. But the great <hi>Belphegor</hi> somtimes giues them a purge. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon said <hi>W. Swinderby;</hi> If the Pope may take from the <note place="margin">Act. &amp; Mon. pag. 454.</note> Fryers to make them keepe Saint <hi>Frances</hi> rule; why may not the Emperour take from the Pope, to make him keepe Christs rule? But whosoeuer gets, the poore Laitie looseth all. There was a booke called <hi>Poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarius Asini, The Asses Confessor;</hi> wherein is mentioned this Fable. The wolfe, the foxe, and the asse come to shrift together, to doe penance. The wolfe confesseth himselfe to the foxe, who easily absolueth him. The foxe doth the like to the wolfe, and receiueth the like fauour. After this the asse comes to confession, and his fault was, that being hungry he had taken out one straw from the sheafe of a Pilgrim to <hi>Rome;</hi> whereof he was heartily repentant. But this would not serue, the law was executed seuerely vpon him, he was slaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured. By the wolfe is meant the Pope: by the foxe his Cardinals, Iesuites, Priestes: these quickly absolue one another, how haynous euer their offences were. But when the poore Asse, that's the Laitie, comes to shrift, though his offence be not the waight and worth of a straw; yet on his backe must the law be seuerely executed; and the holy Father the wolfe makes a great matter of it.

They can afford them exhortation, but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion; charging their eares, but in no wise ouer-char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their bellies.

               <p>Some haue had apparant beginnings of loue, whose conclusion hath halted off into worldlinesse, whiles they had little, they communicated some of that little: but the multiplying their riches, hath beene the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their mercies. Too many haue verified this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruent and preposterous obseruation; that the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their purses with money, hath proued the empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hearts of Charitie. As one obserues of <hi>Rome;</hi> that the declination of pietie, came at one instant with the multiplication of mettals. Euen that Clergie, that poore cared onely to feed the flocke; once growne rich studied onely to fil the paile. <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> saith of them, that <hi>Matronarum oblationibus ditabantur,</hi> they were enriched by Ladies gifts. And heruepon, together with that vnlucky separation of the Greeke head from the Latine bodie, the Empire began to dwindle, the Popedome to flourish. Now plentie is the daughter of prosperitie, ambition of plentie, corruption of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So <hi>Diuitiae veniunt, Relligioque fugit.</hi> Religion brings in wealth, wealth thrusts out Religion.</p>
               <p>To this purpose, and to preuent this readie euill, was Gods charge by the pen of <hi>Dauid.</hi>

                  <hi>If riches encrease, set not your heart vpon them.</hi> For till they encrease, there is lesse danger. But sayth one; <hi>Societas quaedam est, etiam nominis, vitijs &amp; diuitijs.</hi> Wealth and wickednesse are neere of kinne. <hi>Nimia bonorumcopia, ingens malorum oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casio.</hi> Plentie of goods, lightly occasions plentie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils. Goodnes commonly lasts till goods come: but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of state; alters condition of persons. How many had beene good, had they not beene great! And as it was said of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> He would haue made a good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:25651:298"/>
was a very ill King: so many haue dyed good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, that would haue liued bad masters. God that can best fit a mans estate here, that it may further his saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereafter; knowes that many a man is gone poore vp to heauen, who rich would haue tumbled downe to hell. We may obserue this in <hi>Peter;</hi> who being got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the High Priestes Hall, sits him downe by the <note n="b" place="margin">Mark. 14. 54.</note> warme fire, and forgets his master. Before <hi>Peter</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Christ at the hard heeles, through cold &amp; heat, hunger and thirst, trouble and wearines; and promiseth an infallible adherence. But now he sittes beaking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by a warme fire, his poore Master is forgotten. Thus his bodie growes warme; his zeale, his soule cold. When he was abroad in the cold, he was the hotter Christian; now he is by the fire-side he grows the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Oh the warmth of this world, how it makes a man forget Christ! He that wants bread, pitties them that be hungry: and they that want fire haue compassion of the poore cold and naked: but the warmth and plentie of the world starues those thoughts.

               </p>
               <p>Whilst vsurie can sit in furres; ambition looke downe from his loftie turrets: lust imagine heauen in her soft embracings; Epicurisme studie dishes and eate them: pride studie fashions &amp; weare them: the downe-troden poore, exposed to the bleakeayre, afflicted, famished, are not thought on. So easily are many that begun in <hi>loue,</hi> put by riches out of the way: and made to forbeare <hi>Walking in Charitie,</hi> euen by that which should enable their steps. Thus auarice breeds with wealth, as they speake of toads that haue beene found in the midst of great stones. Though the man of meane estate, whose owne want instructs his heart to commiserate others, say thus with himselfe; If I had more goods, I would do more good: yet experience iustifies this point, that many haue changed their minds with their meanes: and the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:25651:299"/>

               </p>
               <p>Euerie man hath a better opinion of himselfe, then to thinke thus.

The Musician begins to play; and gaue such a <hi>Lacrymae,</hi> so sad and deepe a lesson that the man fell into a dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish melancholy; standing as one forlorne, with his armes wreathed, his hat puld ouer his eyes, venting many mournefull sighes. Presently the Musician chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his stroake into mirthfull &amp; lusty tunes: and so by degrees into ligges, crotchets, and wanton ayres: then the man also changeth his melancholy into spritely humours, leaping, and dancing, as if he had bin trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into aire. This passion lasting but with the note that moued it; the Musician riseth into wild rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, maskes and Anticks. Whereupon he also riseth to showting, holloing, and such franticke passages, that he grew at last starke madde. Such a charming power,

               <p>His <hi>Walking</hi> in loue was strange and admirable: hee tooke large steps; from heauen to earth, and from earth to heauen. As <hi>Bernard</hi> on that speech of the <hi>Church</hi> concerning her <hi>Beloued.</hi>

                     <p>Our loue should likewise be <hi>holy</hi> &amp; whole: desiring not onely our brothers externall welfare; but much more his internall, his eternall blessednes.

               <head>Who.</head>
               <p>The Person that giues is <hi>Christ:</hi> the qualitie of his person doth highly commend his exeeding loue to vs. We will ascend to this consideration by 4. staires or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and descend by 4. other. Both in going vp, and comming downe, we shall perceiue the admirable loue of the giuer. <hi>Ascendently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We will consider him <hi>Hominem;</hi> a man. <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 19. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold the man,</hi> saith Pilate. We may tarry and wonder at his lowest degree; that a man should giue himselfe for man. <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 5. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die.</hi> But this man gaue himselfe for vnrighteous man to die; not an ordinary, but a greevous death, exposing himselfe to the wrath of God, to the tyrranie of men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. It would pittie our hearts to see a poore dumbe beast so terrified, how much more <hi>Hominem, a man,</hi> the Image of God!</p>
               <p n="2">2 The second degree giues him <hi>hominem innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> an <hi>Innocent</hi> man. <hi>Pilate</hi> could say. <note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 23. 14</note> 
                  <hi>I haue found no fault in this man. No nor yet Herod.</hi> No nor the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, who would haue beene right glad of such an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. So <hi>Pilates Wife</hi> sent her husband word. <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 27. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Haue thou nothing to do with that iust man.</hi> So the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is not onely a man, but a <hi>iust</hi> man, that gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to endure such horrors for vs. If wee pittie the death of malefactors, how should our compassion be to one <hi>Innocent!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the third degree, he is not onely <hi>Homo,</hi> a man; and <hi>Iustus homo,</hi> a <hi>good</hi> man; but also <hi>Magnus homo</hi> a <hi>great</hi> man: royally descended from the auntient Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches and Kinges of <hi>Iudah. Pilate</hi> had so written his <hi>Title,</hi> and he would answere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not alter it; <hi>Quod scripsi, scripsi.</hi> And what was that? <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 19. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Iesus of Nazereth, the King of the Iewes.</hi> Now as is the Person, so is the Passion: the more noble the giuer, the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent the gift. That so high a King would suffer such
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:25651:313"/>
contempt and obloquie to be cast vpon him; when the least part of his disgrace had beene too much for a man of meane condition! That a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Good</hi> man, a <hi>Great</hi> man bore such calumnie, such calamitie for our sakes; here was an vnmatchable, an vnspeakable loue.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is enough, but this is not all: there is yet a higher degree in this Ascent: we are not come to our full <hi>Quantus.</hi> It is this; he was <hi>Plus quam homo,</hi> more then man: not onely <hi>maximus hominum,</hi> but <hi>mator ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus;</hi> the greatest of men, yea greater then all men. Not <hi>mere filius hominis,</hi> but <hi>verè filius Dei:</hi> he was more then the Sonne of man, euen the Sonne of God. As the <hi>Centurion</hi> acknowledged <note n="f" place="margin">Mark. 15. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Truely this man was the Sonne of God.</hi> Here be all the foure staires vpwardes; a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Harmeles</hi> man a <hi>Princely</hi> man; and yet more then man, euen <hi>God</hi> himselfe. <hi>Salomon</hi> was a great king; but here is a <hi>Greater then Salomon. Salomon</hi> was <hi>Christus Domini;</hi> but here is <hi>Christus Dominus:</hi> he was the annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Lord; but this is the Lord himself annointed. And here all tongues grow dumbe; &amp; admiratio sealeth vp euery lippe. This is a depth beyond sounding. You may perhaps drowsily heare this and coldly be affected with it; but let me say, Principalities and Powers, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Seraphins stood amazed at it.</p>
               <p>We see the <hi>Ascent;</hi> shall we bring downe againe this consideration by as many stayres?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider him Almightie God taking vpon him Mans nature: this is the first steppe downe wards <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>The word was made flesh, and dwelt among vs.</hi> And <note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>God sent forth his Sonne made of a woman.</hi> And this was done <note n="i" place="margin">Aug. Epist. 120.</note> 
                  <hi>Naturam suscipiendo nostram, non mutando suam:</hi> by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on our nature, not by putting off his owne. <hi>Homo Deo accessit, non Deus a serecessit.</hi> He is both God and man, yet but one <hi>Christ:</hi> one not by confusion of substance but by vnitie of person. Now in that this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall God became man, he suffered more, then man
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:25651:313"/>
can suffer either liuing or dead. That man should be turned into a beast, into a worme, into dust, into nothing; is not so great a disparagement as that the glorious God should become man. <note n="k" place="margin">Phil. 2. 6. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>He that thought it not robbery to bee equall with God, was made in the likenesse of man.</hi> Hee that <hi>is</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Hebr. 1. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>more excellent then the Angels,</hi> became lower then the Angels, that hee might aduance vs as high as the Angels. Euen <hi>the brightnesse of Gods glorie</hi> takes on him the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our nature: and hee that layd the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth, and made the world, is now in the world made himselfe. This is the first descending de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second stayre brings him yet lower. He is made man: but what Man? Let him be vniuersall Monarch of the world: and haue fealtie and homage acknowledged to him from all kings and Emperors, as his viceroyes: Let him walke vpon Crownes and scepters, and let Princes attend on his Court: and here was some Maiestie, that might a little become the Son of God. No such matter. <hi>Indust formam serui;</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Phil. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>He tooke vpon him the forme of a seruant.</hi> He instructs vs to <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> by his owne example <note n="n" place="margin">Math. 20. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>The Sonne of man came not to be ministred vnto, but to minister.</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Esa. 43. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>O Israel, thou hast made me to serue with thy sinnes.</hi> He gaue himselfe for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, not for a Master; <hi>ad seruitutem, non ad dominatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> He that is Gods Sonne, is made mans seruant. Proudly blind, &amp; blindly poore man, that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest haue such a seruant, as the Sonne of thy maker. This is the second steppe downewards.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is not low enough yet. <hi>I am a worme no man;</hi> sayth the Psalmist in his Person. Yea the <hi>shame of men, and contempt of the people.</hi> He is called. Psal. <note place="margin">Psal. 24. 7.</note> 24. the <hi>King of glory. Be yee open yee euerlasting doores, and the King of glorie shall come in.</hi> But Esa. 53. <hi>He</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 53. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>is despised and reiected of men: we hid as it were our faces
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:25651:314"/>
from him: he was despised, and wee esteemed him not.</hi> O the pittie of God, that those two should come so neare together, the <hi>King of glory,</hi> and <hi>the shame of men. Quo celsior maiestas, eò miserior humilitas.</hi> Thus sayth the Apo stle, <hi>hee made himselfe of no reputation.</hi> Hee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7.</note> all honour as properly due to him, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe (not of little, but) <hi>of no reputation.</hi> Here was deiection; yea here was reiection. Let him be layd in his poore cradle, the <hi>Bethlemites</hi> reiect him; the manger must serue, no roome for him in the Inne. Yea <note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee came to his owne, and his owne receiued him not.</hi> All Israel is to hote for him; hee is glad to flie into Egypt for protection. Come hee to <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> which he had honourd with his presence, instructed with his Sermons, amazed with his myracles, wet and bedewed with his teares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they reiect him. <hi>I would, and ye would not.</hi> Comes he to his kindred? they deride &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him, as if they were ashamed of his allia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Comes he to his <hi>Disciples?</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 66.</note> 
                  <hi>They goe backe &amp; will walke no more with him.</hi> Will yet his Apostles tarry with him? So they say ver. 6. 8. <hi>Lord, to whom shall we goe? thou hast the words of eternall life.</hi> Yet at last one betrayes him, another for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweares him, all forsake him: &amp; <hi>Iesus</hi> is left alone in the middest of his enemies. Can malice yet adde some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aggrauation to his contempt? Yes, they crucifie him with malefactors. The qualitie of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, is made to encrease his dishonour. <hi>In medio La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronum, tanquam Latronum immanissimus:</hi> In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of theeues, as it were the Prince of theeues; sayth <hi>Luther.</hi> He that <hi>thought it no robbery to be equall to the most holy God,</hi> is made equall to theeues and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; yea <hi>tanquam Dux;</hi> as it were a Captaine amongst them. This is the third step.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But wee must goe yet lower. Behold now the deepest stayre, and the greatest reiection. <hi>Affligit me Deus</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Lement. 1. 12</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:25651:314"/>
fierce anger</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Esa. 53. 10.</note>

                     </gap> to griefe.</hi> No burden seemes heauy, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of God helpe to beare it. When God will giue solace, vexation makes but idle offers and assaults. But now to the reiection of all the former, the Lord turnes his backe vpon him as a stranger: the Lord wounds him as an enemie. He cryes out; <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> How could the Sunne and starres, heauen and earth stand, whiles their maker thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained! The former degree was deepe; he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with euill doers; <hi>reckoned amongst the wicked.</hi> Yet theeues fared better in death then he. We find no irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio, no insultation, no taunts, no invectiues against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They had nothing vpon them but paine; hee both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt &amp; torment. If scorne and derision can vexe his good soule, he shall haue it in peales of ordinance shotte against him.

But yet the disciples are but weake men, the Iewes but cruell persecutors the Deuils but malicious enemies: all these doe but their kind, but the lowest degree is; God forgets him, and in his fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hee is forsaken of the highest.

               <p>He <hi>gaue</hi> his life; who could bereaue him of it? To all the high Priestes armed forces he gaue but a verball encounter; <hi>I am he:</hi> and they retire and <hi>fall backward.</hi> His very breath disperst them all. Hee could as easily haue commanded fire from heauen to consume them, or vapours from the earth to choake them. He that controlles Deuils, could easily haue quailed men. More then twelue Legions of Angels were at his becke; and euery Angell able to conquor a Legion of men. Hee giues them leaue to take him; yea power to kill him: from himselfe is that power, which apprehends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Euen whiles he stands before <hi>Pilate</hi> scorned, yet tels him; <hi>Thou couldst haue no power against me, nisi datam desuper; vnlesse it were giuen thee from aboue.</hi> His owne strength leads him, not his aduersaries. He could haue beene freed, but he would not. Constraint had abated his merite: he will deserue, though he die.</p>
               <p>The losse of his life was necessary, yet was it also vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary. <hi>Quod amittitur necessarium est, quod emittitur voluntarium.</hi> Therefore <hi>he gaue vp the Ghost.</hi> In spight of all the world hee might haue kept his soule within <note place="margin">Ambro.</note> his bodie; he would not. The world should haue bin burnt to cinders, and all creatures on earth resolued to their originall dust; before he could haue beene enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Man could not take away his Spirit, therefore he <hi>gaue</hi> it. Otherwise if his Passion had beene onely <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and not <hi>voluntatis;</hi> materiall and not formall; it could not haue beene meritorious, or afforded satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for vs. For that is onely done well, that is

done of our will.</p>
               <p>But it is obiected out of Hebr. 5. that <hi>hee offered vp prayers and supplications, with strong crying and teares, vnto</hi>

                  <hi>him that was able to saue him from death.</hi> Hence some blasphemers say, that <hi>Christ</hi> was a coward in fearing the naturall death of the bodie. If hee had so feared it, hee needed not to haue tasted it. Christ indeed did natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally feare death; otherwise he had not bin so affected as an ordinary man. Yet he willingly suffered death, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he had not beene so well affected as an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Martyre. But he prayes thrice; <hi>Let this cuppasse.</hi> Diuines vsually distinguish here: the Sententiaries thus. That there was in Christ a double humane or created will: the one <hi>voluntas vt natura;</hi> a naturall will; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>voluntas vt ratio,</hi> a reasonable will. Christ according to his naturall will trembled at the pangs of death; and this without sinne: for Nature abhorreth all destructiue things. But in regard of his rationall will, he willingly submits himselfe to drinke that cup. <hi>Not as I will O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but as thou wilt.</hi> Aman, sayth <hi>Aquinas,</hi> will not naturally endure the lancing of any member: yet by his reasonable will he consents to it, for the good of the whole bodie: reason masters sense, and cutting or cauterizing is endured. So Christ by the strength of his naturall wil feared death: but by his Reason perceiuing, that the cutting, wounding, crucifying of the Head, would bring health to the whole Bodie of his <hi>Church;</hi> and either he must bleed on the Crosse, or we must all burne in hell: behold now he willingly and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>giues himselfe an offering and Sacrifice to God for vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But was it a meere temporall death that our Sauiour <hi>feared?</hi> No, he saw the fierce wrath of his Father, and therefore feared. Many resolute men haue not shrunke at a little: diuers Martyrs haue endured strange tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with magnanimitie. But now when he that gaue them strength, quakes at death; shall wee say he was a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:25651:316"/>
Coward? Alas! that which would haue ouerwhelmed man, would not haue made him shrinke: that which he feared, no mortall man but himselfe euer felt. Yet hee feared. The despaire of many thousand men was not so much, as for him to feare. He saw that which none saw, the anger of an infinite God. He perfectly appre hended the cause of feare; our Sinne and torment. He saw the bottome of the Cup; how bitter and dreggish euery drop of that viall was. He truely vnderstood the burden, which we make light of. Men feare not Hell, because they know it not. If they could see through the opened gates, the insufferable horrors of that pit; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling &amp; quaking would run like an ague through their bones. This insupportable lode he saw: that the spunge of vengeance must be wrung out to him; and hee must sucke it vp to the last and least drop. Euery talent of our iniquities must be laid vpon him, till as <hi>a cart he be loden</hi>

            <p>What shall become of the vsurer? No creature in heauen or earth shall testifie his innocencie. But the sighes, cryes, and grones of vndone parents, of beggard widdowes and Orphanes shall witnesse the contrary. All his money, like Hempe seede, is sowed with cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: and euery obligation is written on earth with inke and bloud, and in hell with bloud and fire.</p>
            <p>What shall become of the Encloser of Commons? Who shall plead his innocence? Hedges, ditches, fields, <note place="margin">Dat veniam coruis, vexat censura co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbas.

            <p>Where shall fraud, cosenage, racking of rents, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, periurie, mischiefe appeare?

            <p>I conclude; Make you the picture of <hi>Innocencie,</hi> and hang it in your houses: but especially draw it in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of your hearts. Let it bee a Virgin faire and louely, without any spot of wrong to blemish her beautie. Let her garments be white as snow, and yet not so white as her conscience. Let the teares of compassion drop from her eyes, and an Angell holding a bottle to catch them. Let her weepe, not so much for her owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, as for the wickednes of her afflicters. Let the wayes be milke where she sets her foote, and let not the earth complaine of her pressure. Let the Sun offer her his beames, the clouds their raine, the ground her fruits, euery creature his vertue. Let the poore blesse her: yea, let her very enemies be forced to prayse her. Let the world be sommoned to accuse her of wrong, and let none be found to witnesse it. Let peace lie in her lappe, and Integritie betweene her brests. Let re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion kisse her lippes, and all Lawes reuerence her.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:25651:336"/>
Patience possesse her heart, and humilitie sit in her eyes. Let all Christians make her the precedent of their liues; and studie the doctrine that her mouth teacheth. Let the Angels of heauen be her guardians; and the mercie of God a shield of defence vnto her. Let her tread vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on iniurie, and stampe the Deuill and violence vnder her feete. Let her greatest aduersaries, Oppression and Hypocrisie, flie from her presence. Let rapine, malice, extortion, depopulation, fraud, and wrong, be as farre remoued from her, as hell is from heauen. Let the hand of mercie dry her eyes, and wipe away her teares. Let those glorious spirits lift her vp to the place of rest. Let heauen adde to her beautie, Immortalitie set her in a throne of ioy, and Eternitie crowne her with glorie. Whether may all her children follow her, through the bloud and merites of that most <hi>innocent Lambe Iesus Christ.</hi>

Whereof the first is wrought by Satan <hi>Permittente Deo</hi> God suffering it. The second by God <hi>mediante Diabolo,</hi> Satan being a mediate instrument.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are Dreames for <hi>Error,</hi> wrought by the meere illusion of Satan: whom God once suffered to be a lying Spirit in the mouth of 400. Prophets. Hee working vpon mans affections, inclinations, and humours, causeth in them such dreames, as seduce them to wickednes, and induce them to wrechednes. They write of one <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> an Argiue Soothsayer, that by a dreame hee was brought to the <hi>Theban</hi> voyage; where <hi>Hiatu terrae absorbetur;</hi> he was swallowed vp of the earth. <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 40. 16.</note> So <hi>Pharaohs Baker</hi> was encouraged to hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full error by a dreame. So was that monstrous hoste of <hi>Midian</hi> ouerthrowne by a <hi>Dreame</hi> of a <note n="m" place="margin">Iudg. 7. 13.</note>

Iob</hi> sayes, that <hi>Deus terret per somnia, &amp; per visiones horrorem incuiit.</hi> God strikes terror into the hearts of the wicked by <hi>Dreames.</hi> As a <hi>Malus genius</hi> is said to appeare to <hi>Brutus</hi> the night before his death: or as the face of <hi>Hector</hi> was presented to <hi>Andromache.

               <p n="3">3. Supernaturall; such as are sent by diuine inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and must haue a diuine interpretation, Such were the <hi>dreames</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> expounded by <hi>Ioseph:</hi> the dreames of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> declared by <hi>Daniel.</hi> Of these were two sortes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some were mysticall: such as those two kings dreames; and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> two officers: whose exposition is onely of God. So <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 40. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioseph</hi> answers; <hi>Are not interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Lord?</hi> So <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to <hi>Daniel.</hi>

                  <hi>Thou art able, for the spirit of the holy God is in thee.</hi> The Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Astrologers dearly acknowledged their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <note n="p" place="margin">Dan. 2. 13.</note> with their liues. Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> may <hi>dreame,</hi> but it is a <hi>Ioseph</hi> that must expound it. It is one thing to haue a representation obiected to the fantasie: another thing to haue an intellectuall light giuen to vnderstand it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others are demonstratiue: when the Lord not onely giues the <hi>dreame,</hi> but also withall the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it. Such were <hi>Daniels dreames,</hi> &amp; these <hi>Wisemens,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iosephs</hi> in this chapter. Wherein was a Vision &amp; Pro uision: a vision what to doe: a prouision that no harme might come to <hi>Iesus.</hi> These <hi>dreames</hi> were most specially incident to the new Testament: when God at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rising of the Sunne, began to expell the shadowes of darke my steries. <note n="q" place="margin">Act. 2. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>And it shall come to passe in the last dayes (saith God) I will powre out of my Spirit vpon all flesh: and your sons &amp; your daughters shall prophecie, &amp; your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dreame dreames.</hi> Now the Sunne is gotten vp into the midst of heauen the Gospel into the ful strength, these shadowes vanish: the more light, the lesse shadow.</p>
               <p>So that now to expect reuelation of things by <hi>dreames</hi> were to intreat God to lend vs a candle whiles wee haue the bright Sun. The superstitious Papists are s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:25651:339"/>
in their sleepe, then they can well expound waking. The Abbot of Glastenbury, when <hi>Ethelwold</hi> was Monke there, dreamt of a tree, whose branches were al couered with Monks cowles: &amp; on the highest bough one cowle that ouertop'd all the rest: which must needs be expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the future greatnes of this <hi>Ethelwold.</hi> But it is most admirable, how the <hi>Dominicke</hi> Friers make shift to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the dreame of <hi>Dominickes</hi> mother; which she had when she was with child of him: that she had in her wombe a wolfe with a burning torch in his mouth. Say what they will, a wolfe is a wolfe still: &amp; that order hath euer carried a burning torch to scorch their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Church. But there is no <hi>dreame</hi> of theirs with out an interpretation, without a prediction. And if the euent answere not their foretelling, they expound it after the euent. If one of them chance to dreame of a greene garden, he goes presently and makes his will. Or if another dreame that he shakes a dead friend by the hand, he is ready to call to the Sexton for a graue; takes solemne leaue of the world, and sayes hee cannot liue.</p>
               <p>Beloued, God hath not grounded our fayth vpon <hi>dreames</hi> nor <note n="r" place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>cunningly deuised fables;</hi> but on the holy Gospell, written by his seruants in bookes, and by his spirit in the tables of our hearts. They that will beleeue <hi>dreames</hi> and Traditions aboue Gods sacred word, let them heare and feare their iudgement. <note n="s" place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>For this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should beleeue a lye. That they all might be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned who beleeue not the truth, but had pleasure in vnrighteousnes.</hi> Banish from your hearts; this superstitious follie, to repose any confidence expectant on dreames.</p>
               <p>But if you desire to make any vse of dreames, let it be this. Consider thy selfe in thy dreaming, to what inclination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou art mostly carried: and so by thy thoughts in the night, thou shalt learne to know thy self
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:25651:340"/>
in the day. Be thy dreames lustfull? examine whether the addictions of thy heart run not after the byas of concupiscence. Be they turbulent, consider thy owne contentious disposition. Be they reuengefull, they point to thy malice. Runne they vpon gold and riches, they argue thy couetousnesse.</p>
               <p>Thus God may be said to teach a man by his <hi>dreames</hi> still; <hi>non quid erit, sed qualis est:</hi> not what shall be, but what he is. Not future euents, but present condition may be thus learned. Neither day nor night scapes a good man without some profite: the night teacheth him what he is, as the day what he should be. Therefore said a Philosopher, that all waking men are in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon world: but in sleepe euery man goes into a world by himselfe. For his dreames doe signifie to him those secret inclinations, to which hee thought himselfe a stranger, though they were home-dwellers in his heart. Euen those fancies are speaking images of a mans dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. And as I haue heard of some that talke in their dreames, and then reueale those secrets, which awake they would not haue disclosed. So may thy dreames tell thee when thou wakest, what kind of man thou art. The hypocrite dreames of dissimulation: the proud woman of paint and colours: the theefe of robberie and booties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Iesuite of treasons. Let them aske their very sleepe, <hi>quale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. For so lightly they answere temptations actually wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as their thoughts doe sleeping. Thus onely a man may make good vse of his <hi>dreames.</hi>
               </p>

The Fryers and Iesuites haue very strongly &amp; strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly backbited <hi>Riches:</hi> but all their railing on it is but behind the backe: secretly and in their hearts they loue it. When they are out of the reach of eyes, then Gold is their Sunne by day, and siluer their Moone by night. Some of them for enforced want, like the foxe dispraise the grapes they cannot reach. Or as <hi>Eusebius</hi> notes of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius</hi> the Emperor; that he vsed to raile at learning, &amp; to say, nothing worse became a prince, because himself was illiterate. So they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend nothing more then Pouerty, because they are, &amp; must be poore, against their wills.</p>
               <p>Others of them find fault with <hi>Riches,</hi> whereof they haue great store; but would that none should couet it beside themselues. So the cosening Epicure made all his fellow guests beleeue, that the banket was poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned; that all they refusing, hee might glut himselfe alone. These often cheate themselues, and worke their owne bane: whiles they so beat off others from the world, and wrappe themselues vp in it to their confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The foxe in the fable, with diuerse other beasts, found a <hi>rich</hi> bootie of costly robes and iewels. Hee perswades the Lyon that he needs not trouble himselfe with them, because he is king, and may command all at his pleasure. He tells the Stagge, that if he should put them on, they would so molest him that hee could not escape the huntsmen. For the Boare, hee sayes they would euill fauouredly become him: and the wolfe he shuffles off with the false newes of a fold of Lambes hard by, which would doe him more good. So all gone he begins to put on the robes himselfe, and to reioyce in his lucky fraud. But instantly came the owners, and surprised him: who had so pus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

all: and Great men, because it will make them enuied and hunted after for their trappings. Countrey men it will not become they say: and all the rest, that it will hinder their iourney to heauen. So in conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they driue all away, and get the whole world for their master Pope, and themselues. But at last these foxes are caught in their owne noose: for the deuill finds them so wrapp'd &amp; hamperd in these ornaments, and their hearts so besotted on money and <hi>riches,</hi> that he carries them with as much ease to hell, as the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot drew <hi>Pharaoh</hi> into the red sea.</p>

(when God hath his owne, in the next place) <hi>tribuere cuique suum:</hi> to render euery man his due. If they bee Gods gifts, they must be disposed with iustice.

When the poore creditor comes to demand his owne, they raile at him, they send him loden away, but with ill words, not good money. In the Countrey they set labourers on worke, but they giue them no hire. Tut they are Tenants, vassalls: must they therefore haue no pay?

For the Law of God holds vs not so fast, as the lawes of men. There is more awe of iudgement in the common Pleas, then of a sentence of condemnation in the Court of heauen. The Sherife is altogether feared, not God: their is no dread of any Execution but his.

It is a wretched thing, when Iustice is made a Hackney, that may bee back'd for money, and put on with golden spurs, euen to the desired iourneys end of iniurie and iniquitie.</p>
               <p>If the partie be innocent, let his cause be sentenced for his innocencies sake: if guiltie, let not gold buy out his punishment. If the cause bee doubtfull, the Iudge shall see it worse, when he hath blinded his eyes with Bribes. But the will of the giuer doth transferre right of the gift to the receiuer. No, for it is not a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will. But as a man is willing to giue his purse to the theife, rather then venture his life or limbe: so the poore man giues his Bribes, rather then hazard his cause.

               <p n="3">3. Patiently lost: When God giues riches to the good, he giues them also a heart to trust in himselfe: in himselfe I say, not in them. <note n="f" place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Trust not in vncertaine Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but in the liuing God; who giueth vs aboundantly all things to enioy.</hi> He giues abundantly, but he forbiddeth trust in that abundance. He commends riches to vs, as a great man doth a seruant to his friend; worke him, but trust him not: put labour to him, not confidence in him. Wealth may doe vs good seruice; but if it get the masterie of our trust, it will turne tyrant, Terma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; we condemne our selues to our owne gallies.</p>
               <p>To the godly riches are neuer so deare, but they can be content to forgoe them. They receiue them at Gods hands with much thankfulnesse, and they loose them with much patience. When God takes ought from vs, he does vs no wrong. <hi>Retrahit sua, non abstrahit nostra:</hi>

                  <hi>We haue left all, and followed thee;</hi> sayth <hi>Peter. Nos se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quamur Christum, caetera sequentur nos.</hi> Let vs follow Christ, other thinges shall follow vs. But if they doe not, it is gaine enough to haue Christ. He is too coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:25651:368"/>
whom the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> cannot satisfie. We may loose <hi>diuitias Dei,</hi> but neuer <hi>Deum diuitiarum.</hi> We may be forsaken of these riches of God, but neuer of the God of riches. <hi>Amittamus omnia, dum habeamus haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem omnia.</hi> Let vs loose all, so we haue him that hath all.</p>
               <p>That was neuer perfectly good, that might bee lost. Of this nature are riches: they haue made many prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, none better. As neuer man was better, so neuer wise man thought himselfe better for them. That wise Prophet would neuer haue prayed against riches, if their want had beene the want of blessednesse. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill indeed sayes, <hi>All those will I giue thee:</hi> but the two dearest Aposties say, <hi>Siluer and gold haue I none.</hi> Who would not rather be in the state of those Saints, then of that Deuill? Riches are such thinges, as those that haue them not, want them not: those that haue them, want them: they are lost in a night, and a man is neuer the worse for loosing them. How many Kings (not fewer then nine in our Iland) that haue begun their glory in a Throne, haue ended it in a cell: changing their command of a Scepter, for the contemplation of a Booke! Alas silly things, that they should dare aske one dramme of our confidence. <hi>Non tanta in multis foelicitas, quanta in paucis securitas.</hi> There is not so much happines in the highest estate, as there is content and peace in the lowest. Only then God be our trust, whose mercie we can no more loose, then himselfe can loose his mercie.</p>
               <p>Thus you see this second generall poynt amplified: if Riches be Gods good blessings, (not onely in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, so they are alwayes good, but to vs) then they are gotten honestly, disposed iustly, lost patiently. As much happily might be said for <hi>Honour;</hi> wherein I will briefely consider, how and when it is of God.</p>
               <p>God indeed giues <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Riches;</hi> but not all <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:25651:368"/>
as you heard before not all <hi>Riches.</hi> There are foure things in an honoured person. First his Person, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he pertakes of the common condition of Mankind; liues and dies a man. Euen the sonnes of Princes haue their breath in their nosthrilles. Secondly his <hi>Honour</hi> and dignitie; this simply considered is of God, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he be that hath it, a <hi>Ioseph</hi> or a <hi>Haman.</hi> Thirdly, the manner of comming to his <hi>Honour:</hi> and this is no longer of God, then the meanes are good. If it bee Gods honour, God must giue it, not man vsurpe it. Fourthly the menaging of this <hi>Honour;</hi> and this is also of the Lord, if it be right and religious. It happeneth often that <hi>Potens,</hi> the great man is not of God. <note n="i" place="margin">Hos. 8. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>They haue set vp Kings, but not by me: they haue made Princes, and I knew it not.</hi> The manner of getting dignity is not alwayes of God. <hi>Richard</hi> 3. came to the Crowne of England by bloud and murther. <hi>Alexander</hi> 6. obtained the Popedome, by giuing himselfe to the Deuill: Yet the dignitie is of God. <note n="k" place="margin">Prou. 8. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>By me Kings raigne: by me Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Nobles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a hard question, wherein <hi>Honour</hi> consists. It is in bloud, descending from the veines of noble aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors? Not so, except nature could produce to Noble parents noble children. It was a monstrous tale that <hi>Nicippus</hi> his Ewe should yeane a Lyon. Though it be true among irrationall creatures, that they euer bring forth their like; Eagles hatch Eagles; and Doues Doues: yet in mans progenie there is often found not so like a proportion, as vnlike a disposition. The earthy part onely followes the seed, not that whose forme and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending qualities are from aboue. Honour must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as well plead a Charter of successiue vertue, as of continued scutchions, or it cannot consist in bloud. The best things can neuer be traduced in propagation: thou mayest leaue thy sonne heire to thy lands in thy will, to thy <hi>Honour</hi> in his bloud; thou canst neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath

               <p>That is then onely true <hi>Honour,</hi> where dignitie and desert, bloud and vertue meete together: the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse whereof is from bloud, the goodnesse from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Among <hi>Fooles</hi> dignitie is enough without desert: among wise men desert without dignitie. If they must bee separated, desert is infinitely better. Greatnesse without vertue <hi>laudatur ore alieno, damnatur conscientia sua;</hi> is commended by others tongues, condemned in the owne heart. Vertue though without promotion, is more comforted in the owne content, then dishart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by others contempt. It is a happie composition when they are vnited: thinke it your honour ye great men, that you are ennobled with vertues: not that you haue, but that you deserue <hi>Honour.</hi> Let this that hath beene spoken teach vs some lessons concerning <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>

                  <hi>God resisteth the proud;</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himselfe in a profest warre against him; as if he held a sword against his brest, when he would rise vp in glory, to n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But <hi>he giueth grace to the humble:</hi> like a great &amp; good Prince he giues those seruants grace and honour, whom hee perceiues least ambitious of it. Such men seeke not for honour, as for a Iewell they would faine find, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stumble at it, as <hi>Saul</hi> sought but his Fathers Asses, when he lighted on a Kingdome. Pride like smoke will surge vpward, though it vanish into aire: massie vertue like gold keeps below, &amp; is more preciously respected.</p>
               <p>Hee that would mount, cares not what attendance he daunces at all houres, vpon whose staires hee sittes
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:25651:370"/>
waiting, what enormities he soothes, what deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he imitates, what base offices he does prostrate himselfe to, so he may rise. His carriage is <hi>alienum a se,</hi> quite another thing from himselfe: he doth glew it on indecently, that he may skrew himselfe into fauour. This man neuer vnderstood the charge that goes with honour; Which the most wise disposition of God hath coupled together. Charge without some honour would ouerlay a man. If a man could haue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour without some trouble, it would so transport him, that he were continually in danger of running madde. The poore man enuies the great for his honour: the great perhaps enuies the poore more for his peace: for as he liues obscurely, so securely. He that rightly knowes the many publicke, and more secret vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions incident to <hi>Honour,</hi> would not (as that King sayd of his Crowne) stoope to take it vp, though it lay at his feete before him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Liue worthy of that <hi>Honour</hi> thou hast. Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse not gooded with grace is like a Beacon vpon a high hill: <hi>Qui conspiciunt, despiciunt:</hi> they that behold it, hate it, though perhaps they dare not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it. The knee may be forced to reuerence, but but the mind cannot but abhorre so vnworthy a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. In his pride he stomackes the couerd head, or the stiffe knee of a good <hi>Mordecai,</hi> fretting that other men do not thinke him so good as he thinkes himselfe. But indeed he doth not thinke himselfe more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then others thinke bim base. All the poore ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that hee hath, is onely kept aboue ground with his body; both corrupt, fall, and rotte together: and if it bee coniurd vp at the funerall, to present it selfe, yet it failes not to goe backe with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds.</p>

it selfe, the vulgar breath. Which is <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lua multorum capitum,</hi> a Beast of many heads, and as many tongues, which neuer keepe long in one tune As they neuer agree one with another, so seldome doe they agree long with themselues. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Act. 14.</note> come to <hi>Lystra,</hi> and raise an impotent Creeple: Hereat the amased people would needs make them Gods, and draw Buls and garlands to the Altars for sacrifice to them. Not long after they draw <hi>Paul</hi> out of the Citie, and stone him. They suddenly turne him from a God to a malefactor; and are ready to kill him in stead of killing sacrifice to him. O the fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that thing, which is committed to the keeping of vulgar hands. Trust not then popularitie with thy <hi>Honour,</hi> so it is mutable: but trust vertue with it, so it is durable. Nothing can make sure a good memorie, but a good life. It is a foolish dreame, to hope for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie and a long-lasting name, by a monument of brasse or stone. It is not dead stones, but liuing men, that can redeeme thy good remembrance from obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A Sumptuous Tombe couers thy putrified Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kase; and be thy life neuer so lewd, a commending E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaph shadows all: but the passenger that knew thee, telles his friends; that these out-sides are hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, for thy life was as rotten as is thy corpes: and so is occasioned by thy presumed glorie, to lay open thy deserued infamie. Neither can the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preserue thy honour whiles thou liuest, nor can these dull and senselesse Monuments keepe it when thou art dead. Onely thy noble and Christian life makes euery mans heart thy Tombe, and turnes euery tongue into a pen, to write thy deathlesse Epitaph.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Lastly, if God giues to some men <hi>Honour,</hi> it is then manifest that God allowes difference of persons. He ordaines some to rule and others to obey: some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, others seruants; he setteth some vp on high,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:25651:372"/>
and placeth others in a low degree. To repine at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers greatnesse and our owne meannesse, is to cauill with God; as if hee wanted wisedome and equitie in disposing these inferiour conditions. It is a sauage and popular humour, to maligne and inveigh against men in eminent places. That rhyme, When <hi>Adam</hi> delued, and <hi>Eue</hi> span, Who was then a Gentleman? seemes to bee made among Iacke <hi>Strawes</hi> followers, and to sauour of Rebellious discontent. God allowes no man to vilefie, where hee hath honoured: no scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Libelles disgracing those that liue, yea dispara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the very dead; shall passe the Court of Gods Iustice vncensured. Where the Lord conferres and confirmes <hi>Honour,</hi> woe to the tongue that shall traduce it. This second poynt hath held vs long, the breuitie of the rest shall ease it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Obserue that <hi>Salomon</hi> in the donation of the <hi>left hand,</hi> couples together <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Honour:</hi> as if these two were for the most part inseparable companions. Eccle. 6. <hi>God giues to a man Riches and Honour.</hi> First Riches, and then Honour: for it is lightly found, <note place="margin">Eccl. 6. 2.</note> so much Riches, so much Honour; and reputation is measured by the Acre. I haue wealth enough, saith the worldling. Luke 12. I will turne Gentleman, take <hi>my ease, eate, drinke, and be merry.</hi> Riches are the staires whereby men climbe vp into the height of dignitie; the fortification that defends it: the food it liues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: the oyle that keeps the lampe of <hi>Honour</hi> from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out. <hi>Honour</hi> is a bare robe, if Riches doe not lace and flourish it: and Riches a dull Lumpe, till <hi>Honour</hi> giue a Soule to quicken it. Fiftly then <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Riches,</hi> Wealth and Worship doe beare one another companie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly obserue, that though riches and honour be Gods gifts, yet they are but the gifts of his <hi>left hand:</hi> therefore it necessarily followes, that euery wise man
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:25651:372"/>
will first seeke the blessings of the <hi>Right.</hi>

It is no Wisedome to refuse Gods kindnesse, that offers wealth: nor pietie to scratch for it when God withholds it.

                  <p>When the fulnesse of time was come, <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>God sent his Sonne made of a Woman. Ex muliere, non in muliere:</hi> as <hi>Gorran</hi> notes against <hi>Valentinus,</hi> whose heresie was, that Christ passed through the Virgin as water through a Conduit-pipe. But this Preposition <hi>Ex,</hi> signifies a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent matter: as a house is made of tymber &amp; stones, bread of wheat, wine of grapes. Christ had therefore the materials of his bodie from the virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> though not his <hi>Formale principium:</hi> for the holy Ghost was agent in this wonderfull conception.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this a thing impossible to God, though wonderfull to Man; that this Christ should be the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> without man. As it was possible to God in the first creation, to make a Woman out of a Man without the helpe of a Woman: so in this new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make a Man out of a Woman without the helpe of a man. There is the same reason of possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. It is as easie to bring fire from a steele without a flint, as from a flint without a steele. But he that could <hi>dare essentiam nihilo,</hi> can raise a nature <hi>ex aliquo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God had foure diuerse manners of creating humane creatures. 1. The first man <hi>Adam</hi> was made of no man, but immediately created of God. 2. The second, that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:25651:378"/>
was <hi>Eue,</hi> was made (not of a woman, but) of a man alone. 3. The third sort, all men and women else are begotten of man and woman. 4. Christ the last sort was of a different maner from all these. 1. not of no precedent flesh, as <hi>Adam.</hi> 2. Not of a man without a woman, as <hi>Eue.</hi> 3. Not of man and woman, as all we. 4. But after a new way; of a woman, without a man. We are all in this sort opposed to <hi>Adam,</hi> Christ to <hi>Eue, Adam</hi> was made of neither man nor woman, wee of both man and woman. <hi>Eue</hi> of a man without a woman, Christ of a woman without a man.</p>
                  <p>Now as this was a great worke of God, so it is a great wonder to man. Three miracles here. <hi>Deum nasci, virginem parere, fidem haec credere.</hi> That the Sonne of God should become the Sonne of woman, a great myracle. That a virgin should beare a child, and yet before, at, after the birth remaine still a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, a great myracle. That the faith of man should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue all this, <hi>Maximum miraculum;</hi> this is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test wonder of all.</p>
                  <p>Thus you haue Diuinitie assuming Humanitie: a <hi>great mystery;</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>God manifested in the flesh. In mundum venit, qui mundum condidit:</hi> he comes downe to earth, but hee leaues not heauen; <hi>hic affuit inde non defuit. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana natura assumpta est, Diuina non consumpta est.</hi> Hee tooke Humanitie, he lost not his Diuinitie. He abideth <hi>Mariae Pater,</hi> the Father of <hi>Mary;</hi> who is made <hi>Mariae Filius,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Mary</hi>

                     <hi>Emissenus; Natus qui sentiret occasum, datus qni resciret exordium.</hi> Hee was <hi>borne</hi> that should feele death: hee was <hi>giuen</hi> that was from euerlasting, and could not die. <hi>Natus qui &amp; matre esset iunior, datus quo nec Pater esset antiquior.</hi> He that was <hi>borne</hi> was younger then his mother; hee that was <hi>giuen</hi> was as eternall as his father.

Virgine: sed aliter ex Patre, aliter ex virgine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the flowers are said to haue <hi>Solem in coelo patrem, solum in terra matrem:</hi> so Christ hath a father in heauen without a mother, a mother on earth without a father. Here is then the wonder of his <hi>Humanitie.</hi> The <hi>euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>

               <p>Three vicious sorts of men are here culpable. 1. Some sculke when Christ seekes. If there be any bush in Paradise. <hi>Adam</hi> will thrust his head into it.

                  <hi>because their deeds are euill.</hi> Thus they play at All hid with God: but how foolishly!

               <p n="2">2. Others play at fast and loose with God: as a man behind a tree, one while seene, another while hid. In the day of prosperitie they are hidden; onely in

affliction they come out of their holes. As some beasts are driuen out of their boroughes by pouring in scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding water: or as <hi>Absolon</hi> fetch'd <hi>Ioab,</hi> by setting <note n="a" place="margin">2. Sam. 14. 30.</note>

                  <hi>Lost;</hi> but where was man lost? There are diuerse loosing places.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A garden of delights: and there the first man lost himselfe, and all vs: in a Garden therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour found vs againe. We were <hi>Lost</hi> in a garden of rest, we are found in a garden of trouble. The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent could neuer take the hare, (he was too light foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for him) till hee found him sleeping in a garden of sweet flowers, vnder which the serpent lay hidden. Whilst man not onely surfeits on pleasures, but sleepes in them, Satan that old serpent wounds him to death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A wildernesse is a place able to loose vs: and that's this world, a wide and wilde forrest; many lost in it. Wee read of a rich man, Luk. 12. that <hi>lost</hi> himselfe in one corner of this wildernesse, his very <hi>barnes:</hi>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:25651:387"/>
strange, to be lost in a barne. And yet how many loose themselues in a lesse roome, their Counting house! The vsurer hath there lost his soule, and no man can find it. It is so long wrapped vp among his bonds, till Satan take the forfeit. The depopulator takes a larger field to loose his soule in; and to make sure worke, that grace may neuer find it, he hedges and ditches it in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another loosing place is a Labyrinth or Maze. In the Orchard of this world the God of it hath made a Labyrinth; which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi> describes. <note n="g" place="margin">1. Epist. 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.</hi> The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance hereinto is easie; as you haue seene in that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of Suretiship, the Horne: a man goes gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in at the Butte end, but comes hardly out at the Buckall: the comming forth is difficult. It is so full of crooked meanders, windings, and turnings, out of one sinne into another; from consent to delight, from delight to custome, from custome to impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie: that in this Labyrinth men soone grow to a maze, and know not how to be extricated. <hi>Labyrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, quasi labor intus:</hi> the wicked <note n="h" place="margin">Wised. 5. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>wearie themselues in the wayes of destruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of life. Haec tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Lust of the flesh.</hi> The adulterer looseth himselfe in the forbidden bed. <hi>Inter mammillas perditur:</hi> he is lost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the brests of a Harlot. He that seekes for him, must (as the Pursuivant for the Seminary) not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare the Mistresses bed to find him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lust of the eyes. Ahab</hi> casts a couetous eye at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> vineyard. <hi>Dauid</hi> a lustfull eye at <hi>Bathsheba.</hi> The eye is the pulse of the soule: as Physicians iudge of the heart by the pulse, so wee by the eye. A rolling eye, a rouing heart. The good eye keepes minute-time, and strikes when i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:25651:387"/>
and so puts all out of tune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pride</hi> hath <hi>lost</hi> as many, as any her fellow Deuils. They say, shee was borne in heauen, and being cast downe wandred vpon earth, where a woman tooke her in; and there shee hath dwelt euer since. Indeed <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi> 3. the shop of pride is the womans wardrobe: in this wardrobe many soules both of women and men too are lost. The common studie is new fashions; but it is an ill fashion thus to loose the soule.</p>
               <p>If we would get out of this maze, we must (as God warned the <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 2. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Wisemen) depart another way.</hi> Out of lust we must wind forth by Chastitie, out of couetousnesse by Charitie, out of Pride by Humilitie. Penitence is the clew to guide vs forth: howsoeuer wee came in, we must goe out by Repentance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth loosing place is the multitude of new and strange wayes: wherein men wander, as <hi>Saul</hi> after his Asses, and are lost. There is a way to <hi>Rome,</hi> a way to <hi>Amsterdam:</hi> a way to the sillinesse of ignorance, a way to the fullennesse of arrogancie. None of all these is the way to <hi>Sion.</hi> In the multitude of wayes multitude of soules loose themselues.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Lastly some are lost in the darke vault of ignorance; applauding themselues in their blindnes, and like Bats refusing the Sun-shine. They haue an <note n="k" place="margin">Act. 17. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Altar,</hi> but it is <hi>Ignoto Deo,</hi> to an vnknowne God. Like the Hoast of the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> they are blind, and <hi>lost</hi> betwixt <note n="l" place="margin">2. King. 6. 19</note> 
                  <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Samaria.</hi> They may grope (as the <hi>Sodomites)</hi> for the dore of heauen: but let not the Pope make them beleeue, that they can find it blind-fold. Ignorance is not Gods Starre-chamber of light; but the Deuils vault of darkenes. By that doctrine Antichrist fils hell, and his owne coffers. The light that must bring vs out, is <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 9.</note>

Thus a Seminary comes from <hi>Rome,</hi> and whistles together a number of traytors: he brought poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with him in a Bulls horne, and they all must drinke it.

               <p>In this maner is the poyson of adultery spread from a Harlot.

Great men gracelesse are the deuills speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all factors: they haue their new trickes of vanitie to teach others.

As <hi>Alcibiades</hi> cut off his dogs taile, that all the people might talke of his curtall.

If his hypocrisie can get him into a good house, he will deuour the Patron that breedes him, the maintainer that feedes him: he vndoes the familie where he once sets a foote into theyr dores, or puttes a finger into their purses. <hi>Plinie</hi> sayth, the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile is so delighted with the Sun-shine, that it lies on the earth immoueable, as if it were starke dead. Let the Hypocrite be frank'd vp with prosperitie, and hee sleepes as securely, as if earth had lost all windes, and heauen the thunder. His pamperd body growes so fatte, that his soule lies soft in it, at great ease, and is loath to rise.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Cocatrice, that is sayd to kill with the eyes. <hi>Illius auditos expectant nulla susurros.</hi> The reason why <note place="margin">Nicand.</note> it killes by sight, is thus giuen; because the beames of a <hi>Cocatrices</hi> eye corrupt the visible spirits of a man; which corrupted, corrupt the other spirits comming from the braine, and life of the heart. Our common Phrase hath found out creatures to match this kind of <hi>Serpents;</hi> Whores, vsually call'd Cocatrices. I would to God they were beleeued as dangerous as they are, and are named.</p>
               <p>The Cocatrice is a very hote creature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made with spiraments and breathing places all ouer the body: least the compage and iuncture of the whole composition should be dissolued. The intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate heate of harlots is worse, and in some kind a very reflection from the fire of hell. There is an old tale, that England was once so pesterd with Coca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trices, that a certaine man found out one onely tricke to destroy them: which was by walking vp and downe in glasse before them; whereby their owne shapes were so reflected vpon their owne faces, that they died.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:25651:397"/>
But it is idle, for it is more likely that the man should dye by the corruption of the aire from the cocatrice, then the cocatrice by the resultance of it owne simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from the glasse. As the harlot will sooner peruert a man, then he shall conuert the harlot. Indeed they say, if they first see vs, they kill vs: if we first see them, they die. So if we first see the damnation of a Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan, we saue our selues: if they first see &amp; wound vs, we dye of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There's the <hi>Catterpillar;</hi> you all know this to be the <hi>Couetous.</hi> I confesse that other Serpents are also fit emblemes of the couetous: as the <hi>Toad,</hi> that eats spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly of the very earth for feare it should be all wasted &amp; no food left for her. The Germane Painters to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Couetousnes, doe picture an old woman sitting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a toade. Or the <hi>Earth-worme:</hi> these wormes eate vp the fatt of the earth, toades eate vp those wormes, and dragons eate vp those toades. So lightly pettie vsurers eate vp the fatte of the Countrey, great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors deuoure those litle extortioners, and at last the great red dragon swallowes those oppressors.</p>
               <p>But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here I especially liken them to Catterpillars. <hi>Pline</hi> sayth, that litle wormes bred in the green leaues of plants, proue in three dayes catterpillars &amp; eate vp those plants. The Countrey breeds, these couetous wretches, and they deuour her. He writes also that Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars are bred by a dew, incrassated and thicked by the heate of the Sun. It is the warmth of prospertie, that breedes and feeds our vsurers. Others say, that they come of butterflies egs, the which heate of the Sunne hatcheth, working so fit a passiue matter to the forme of a catterpillar. So commonly your vsurer hatcheth, his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches out of the Butterflies egs, laid abroad by prodigall young galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.

               <p>But I leaue this point, that it may be <hi>sure,</hi> as granted: and come to our selues that we may make it sure.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:25651:400"/>
a deare Saint may want feeling of the spirit of comfort. Grace comes into the soule, as the morning Sun into the world: there is first a dawning, then a meane light, and at last the Sunne in his excellent brightnesse. In a Christian life there is <hi>Professio, Profectio, Perfectio.</hi> A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the name of Christ wrought in our conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: not the huske of religion, but the sap: <hi>a pure heart, a good conscience, and faith vnf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>And yet after this full assurance there may bee some feare: it is not the commendation of this certainty to bee void of doubting. The wealthiest Saints haue sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected their pouertie: and the richest in grace are yet <hi>poorest in spirit.</hi> As it is seene in rich misers; they possesse much, yet esteeme it little in respect of what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: for <hi>Plenitudo opum non implet hiatum mentis:</hi> the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of riches cannot answere the insatiable affection. Whence it comes to passe, that they haue restlesse thoughts, and vexing cares for that they haue not, not caring for that they haue. So many good men, rich in the graces of Gods spirit, are so desirous of more, that they regard not what they enioy, but what they desire: complaining often that they haue no grace, no loue, no life. God doth sometimes from the best mens eyes hide that sauing goodnesse, that is in their hearts.</p>

               <p n="3">3. To trie, whether we will serue God <hi>gratis;</hi> and be constant in his obedience, though we find no present recompence. Satan obiects that against <hi>Iob, Pro nihilo?

               <p n="4">4. That our care may be the greater, to keepe this comfort when we haue it. <hi>Quod lachrymanter Iugemus ademptum, vigilanter seruamus adeptum.</hi> If we so sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lamented the losse, sure we will looke well to the possession.</p>
               <p>In all this; <hi>Deus dona sua non negat, sed commendat.</hi> God intends not to deny vs his comforts, but to instruct our hearts how to value them. <hi>Citò data viliscunt.</hi> If we might haue them for the first asking, their worth would fall to the opinion of cheapnesse and contempt. Wee shall haue it, though we stay for it. And to comfort vs, let vs assuredly know, that this mourning for Gods ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, is an euident demonstration of his presence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of Reprehension to others, that say they are sure of the purchase, before they euer gaue earnest of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Presumption is to be auoided so well as despaire. For as none more complaine that they want this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, then they that haue it: so none more boast of it then they that haue it not. The fond hypocrite takes his owne presumption for this assurance: he liues after the flesh, yet brags of the Spirit.

               <p>Not our spirit alone can giue this assurance: for mans heart is alwayes euill, often deceitfull. At all times euill. <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note>

               <p>No nor doth Gods spirit alone giue this Testimony: least a vaine illusion should be taken for this holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion. But both Gods spirit and our spirit meeting together are <hi>Concordes,</hi> and <hi>Contestes;</hi> ioynt witnesses.

               <p n="4">4. Lastly, this is the sweetest comfort that can come to a man in this life; euen an heauen vpon earth, to be ascertained of his saluation.

               <p>There is no potion of miserie so embittered with gall,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:25651:402"/>
but this can sweeten it with a cofortable rellish. When enemies assault vs, get vs vnder, triumph ouer vs, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that saluation it selfe cannot saue vs: what is our comfort? <hi>Noui in quem credidi,</hi> I know whom I haue beleeued; I am sure the Lord will not forsake me. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit panis?</hi> thou wantest bread; God is thy bread of life.

What state can there be, wherein the stay of this heauenly assurance giues vs not peace and ioy?</p>
               <p>Are we clapt vp in a darke and desolate Dungeon: there the light of the Sunne cannot enter, the light of mercie not be kept out. What restrained bodie, that hath the assurance of this eternall peace, will not pittie the darknes of the prophane mans libertie; or rather the libertie of his darkenesse? No wals can keepe out an infinite Spirit: no darkenes can be vncomfortable, where the <note n="t" place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note>

               <p>Are we cast out in exile; our backes to our natiue home, all the worlds our way. Whether can we goe from God? <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 139. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether shall I goe from thy face? or whether shall I flie from thy presence? If I ascend, &amp;c.</hi> That exile would be strange, that could separate vs from God. I speake not of those poore and common comforts; that in all Lands and coasts, it is his Sunne that shines; his elements of earth or water that beares vs, his aire we breath. But of that speciall priuiledge, that his gracious presence is euer with vs: that no sea is so broad, as to deuide vs from his fauour: that wheresoeuer we feed, he is our host: wheresoeuer we rest, the wings of his blessed prouidence are stretched ouer vs. Let my soule

be sure of this, though the whole world be traytors to me.</p>
               <p>Doth the world despise vs? We haue sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, that God esteemes vs. How vnworthy is that man of Gods fauour, that cannot goe away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with it, without the worlds! Doth it hate vs much? God hates it more. That is not euer worthie which man honours; but that is euer base which God despises. Without question the world would bee our friend, if God were our enemie. The sweetnes of both cannot bee enioyed; let it content vs, wee haue the best.</p>
               <p>It may be, pouertie puts pale leannes into our cheeks: God makes the world fat, but withall puts <hi>leannesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the soule.</hi> We decay in these temporall vanities, but we thriue in eternall riches. <note n="b" place="margin">Iob. 5. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>The good man laughes at destruction and dearth.</hi> Doth sicknes throw vs on our weary beds? It is impossible any man should miscarry, that hath God for his Physitian. So <hi>Martha</hi> confessed to <hi>Iesus;</hi>

Happie dissolution, that parts the soule from the bodie, that it may knit them both to the Lord. Death like the proud Philistine comes marching out in his hydeous shape, daring the whole Hoast of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell to match him with an equall combatant. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist dares not die, for feare <hi>(non esse)</hi> that hee shall not be at all: the couetous vsurer dares not die, for feare <hi>(male esse)</hi> to be damned: the doubtfull consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence dares not die, because he knowes not <hi>(an sit, an

non sit, an damnatus sit)</hi> whether he shall be, or be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or not bee at all. Onely the resolued Christian dares die, because he is assured of his election: he knows he shall be happie; and so lifts vp pleasant eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the infallible place of his eternall rest. He dares encounter with this last enemie, trample on him with the foote of disdaine, and triumphantly sing ouer him; <note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 15</note> O <hi>death</hi> where is thy sting? O <hi>graue</hi> where is thy victorie?

               </p>
               <p>The poore Papist must not beleeue this: such an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance to him were Apocryphall, yea hereticall. He must lie on his death-bed, call vpon what Saint or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell he list; but must not dare to beleeue hee shall goe to heauen. O vncomfortable doctrine, able to loose the soule! What can follow, but feares without, and terrours within; distrustfull sighes, and heart-breaking grones! Goe away he must with death; but whither he knows not. It would be presumption to be confident of heauen. How should Purgatory stand, or the Popes kitchin haue a Larder to maintaine it, if men might be sure of their saluation? Herefore they bequeath so great summes for masses and Dirge's, and Trentals, to bee sung or sayd for them after they are dead: that their soules may at the last be had to heauen; though first for a while they be reezed in Purgatory. If this be all the comfort their Priests, Iesuites, and Confessors can giue them; they may well say to them, as <hi>Iob</hi> to his friends; <note n="f" place="margin">Iob. 16. 2.</note>

                  <p>Indeed this voyce comes from heauen, comes vnto earth: but onely through the mediator betwixt heauen and earth, <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Hee is the alone Sauiour.

All passengers in this world presume they are going to heauen, but we may guesse by the throng, that the greater part take the broader way. Christ leauing the earth in respect of his bodily presence, left there his Gospell, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to mens soules the vertue of his death and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Ministers preach this Gospell, people heare this Gospell, all boast of this Gospell: yet himselfe foretels, that when he comes againe, he shall scarce <hi>find faith vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth.</hi> No doubt he shall find Christians enow, but scarce faith.

He requests not Riches: he knew that man may be better fed then taught: that wealth doth but franke men vp to death. He that preferres Riches before his soule, doth but sell the horse to buy the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or kill a good horse to catch a hare. He begs not honour: many haue leapt from the high throne to the low pitte. The greatest commander on earth hath not a foote of ground in heauen, except hee can get it by entitling himselfe to Christ. He desires not Pleasures: he knowes, there are as great miseries beyond prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as on this side it. And that all vanitie is but the indulgence of the present time: a minute begins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, ends it: for it endures but the acting, &amp; knowes no solace in the memorie. In the fairest garden of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, there is somewhat, <hi>quod in ipsis floribus angat;</hi> that stings in the midst of all vaine contents.</p>
                  <p>In a word, it is not momentany, variable, apt to ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther change or chance, that hee desires; but eternall; <hi>saluation.</hi> He seekes like <hi>Mary,</hi> that <hi>better part which shall neuer be taken from him.</hi> The wise mans minde is euer aboue the moone, saith <hi>Seneca:</hi> let the world make neuer so great a noise, as if it all ran vppon Coaches, and all those full of roarers; yet all peace is there. It is not sublunary, vnder the wheele of changeable mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, that he wishes, but <hi>saluation.</hi> To be saued is sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the best plot: beate your braines, and breake your sleepes, and wast your marrowes, to be wealthy, to be worthy; for riches, for honours: plot, studie, contriue; be as politicke as you can: and then kisse the childe of your owne braines, hugge your inuentions, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud your wittes, doat vpon your aduancements or aduantagements: yet all these are but dreames.

He answers, O <hi>Antigonus,</hi> thou art the cause. Before I ventured nothing but a diseased corpes, and then I chose rather to die quickly, then to liue sickly: I invited death to doe me a kindnes. Now it is otherwise with me, for I haue somewhat to loose. A poore and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted life makes a man bold in his religio: it is nothing to part with hunger, thirst, cold contempt. But when prosperous fortunes flow vpon him, he dares not sticke so constantly to Christ. Would you haue the rich Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant find fault with Idolatrie, &amp; stand to iustifie Gods truth? No he hath somwhat to take to; and although he ventures much, he would be loath to bee a venturer in this Yet this somewhat is nothing in regard of what he looseth, because he will not loose his riches.

But let none of you suffer as an euill-doer.</hi> For Chap. 2. 19. <hi>This is thanke-worthie, if a man for conscience toward God endure griefe, suffering wrongfully.</hi> This our Sauiour taught vs. <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 5. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed are they that suffer persecution for righteousnesse sake, (non qui patiuntur, sed qui patiuntur propter iustitiam)</hi> for theirs is the Kingdome of heauen. <hi>Non mortes, sed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res faciunt martyres.</hi> It is not the death, but the cause, that giues the honour of Martyrdome.</p>
               <p>Indeed there is no man that suffers contrary to the will of God, but many suffer not <hi>Secundùm,</hi> not <hi>according to the will of GOD.</hi> In his concealed

When the Adulterer is wounded for his lust, he cannot thinke himselfe a patient <hi>secundum bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placitum Dei,</hi> according to the will of God. When the vsurer is fetch'd ouer for his extortion, the depopulator for his enclosing, the slanderer for his libelling, all these suffer, but not for conscience toward God, not <hi>according to his will.</hi> They onely are said to suffer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will, that suffer first innocently, then pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Innocently; for the wicked suffer: <hi>mali malè sed meritò.</hi> Euill men beare euill things, but after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts. The Pope hath made many Saints from this kind of suffering. Straw-saints, such as Garnet was. If they be first drench'd at <hi>Tyber,</hi> and after hang'd at <hi>Tyburne, Martyres sunt;</hi> they can be no lesse then Martyrs. Not seldome their names are put into the Rubricke: but they stand there in those red letters for nothing els, but to remember their red &amp; bloudie actions. They may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend some shew of religion, as if for cause thereof they suffered: but it is not a meene, but a mixt cause: not for faith, but for faction: not for truth, but for treason. It is obserued, that as the Physitians say, none die of an ague, nor without an ague: so none of them suffer for the Romish religion, nor without the Romish religion. Therfore as <hi>Aristides</hi> dying of the bite of a Weasell, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly lamented that it was not a Lyo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But hee can make them amends with Sainting them: men shall kneele to them, pray to them, climbe to heauen by the ladder of their merites.
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:25651:414"/>
Alas! poore Saints: the Pope sends them to heauen, but how if they were in hell before? May wee not say of them, as <hi>Augustine</hi> did of <hi>Aristotle:</hi> woe vnto them, they are praysed, and prayed vnto where they are not, and condemned where they are. Vnlesse as the vision was to <hi>Ormus;</hi> that among the Apostles and Martyrs there was a vacant place left in heauen, which sayth he, was reserued for a Priest in England, called <hi>Thomas Becket:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Martyrol. pag. 229.</note> and this reuelation was full twelue years before <hi>Becket</hi> dyed. So except the Pope can make them Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they die, I feare his authoritie can doe little after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Yet indeed the Pope is a great Saint-maker, and hath helped abundance of men to heauen. For he sent them thither through the fire, for the cause of Christ: he condemned, cursed, burnt them to ashes: and thus spight of his teeth, he hath helped to make them martyrs and Saints. For our selues, if wee suffer any wrong of men, let vs be sure we haue not deserued it. Our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence cómends our suffering; for this is <hi>according to the good will</hi> and pleasure of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Patiently; a murmuring mind evacuates the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of thy sufferings. <note n="d" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>For what glory is it, if when ye bee buffetted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently: but if when ye doe well, and suffer for it, ye then take it patiently, this is acceptable to God.</hi> Let me therefore helpe your patience by two considerations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What Christ our head suffered for vs; bitter words, and more bitter wounds. Obserue him; <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Looke to Iesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the ioy that was set before him, endured the crosse, and despised the shame.</hi> So let vs run with patience the race that is set before vs. If we cannot endure an angry word from our brothers mouth, how would we suffer boyling lead, &amp; boyling coales, as the Martyrs did? How to be crucified as our Lord Iesus was? What would we doe then? Shew me now one dram of this patience. Among gallants a word
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:25651:415"/>
and a blow: among ciuill men a word and a writ. The backe of Patience can beare no load. But <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 24. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>ought not Christ first to suffer these things, and then to enter into his glory?</hi> First he was crowned with thornes, &amp; then crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with honours. <hi>Caput spinosum in terris, si sit gloriosum in coelis.</hi> That head must first weare a wreath of sorrow on earth, that shall weare a wreath of ioy in heauen. <note n="g" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Hereunto are we called: because Christ suffered for vs, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs an example, that we should follow his steps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That all this is <hi>according to the will of God.</hi> Our blowes come at least mediately from the hand of God. And this hand is guided with prouidence, &amp; temperd with loue. Distressed worldlings cry out, it was my owne folly that ran me into this danger, or the malice of mine enemy vndid me, or surfeit on such meat made me sicke. So the cur bites the stone, which could neuer haue hurt him but from the hand that threw it. Looke vp to the first mouer, O mad man, and discharge the meanes. The Instrument may be vniust in thy wrongs, but the cause is iust from him that inflicted it. What rod soeuer beats thee, consider it <hi>according to the will of God,</hi> and be patient. His hand sets theirs on worke: I hope thou wilt not dispute with thy maker. The medicine of thy passion is composed by God himselfe: no euils nor deuils shall put in one dram more then his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: no man nor Angell can abate one scruple. The impatient man wants eyther wisedome or obedience. Wisedome, if he be ignorant from whom his crosses come: obedience, if he knowes it, and is not patient.

               <p>Diuerse men haue that for their God, which neuer was their Creator.

For the proud man hath his Idol as it were in the aire: the couetous man hath his Idol in the earth: the drunken Epicure hath his Idol in the water. Let them take their Gods to themselues: let no <hi>Rachel</hi> that hath married <hi>Iacob,</hi> steale away <hi>Labans</hi> Idols. Our Creator is in heauen, boldly giue thy soule to him: who should better haue it, then he that made it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other argument of our comfort, is that he is <hi>Fidelis,</hi> a <hi>Faithfull</hi> Creator, He is faithfull to thee, how vnfaithfull soeuer thou hast beene to him. Hee made thee good, thou madest thy selfe naught? he doth not there yet leaue thee, as man his friend in miserie; but sent his Sonne to redeeme thee. Here was great faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse. He sends his holy Spirit into thy heart, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this redemption of Christ: here is great faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Thou often turnest thy backe vpon him, and following sinne leauest him: he leaues not thee. <note n="h" place="margin">Hebr. 13. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>I will not leaue thee, nor for sake thee:</hi> here is great faithfulnesse. He hath promised <hi>Poenitenti veniam, credenti vitam</hi> to him that repenteth pardon, to him that beleeueth sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: here is faithfulnesse. Now hath he promised? he is <hi>faithfull</hi> to performe it. What man or deuill dares stand vp, to chalenge God with vnfaithfulnesse?</p>
               <p>This infalibilitie Christ knew, when to his Fathers faithfull hands he gaue vp the Ghost. You will say, who might better do it; the Sonne might well be confident of the Father. Not he alone the seruants haue bin faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full also in this emission, and found God as faithfull in acception. So Dauid, Stephen, &amp;c. God is faithfull, there is no distrust in him; all the feare is in thy selfe. How canst thou trust thy Iewell with a stranger? God
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:25651:419"/>
is thy Creator, and a <hi>Faithfull Creator;</hi> but how if thou be an vnfaithfull creature? Thou wilt frequent the doores of thy Patron, present gifts to thy Landlord, visite thy friend: but how if to him that made thee, thou makest thy selfe a stranger? How often hath God passed by thee, without thy salutation! In the temple he hath called to thee, thy heart hath not eccho'd, and sent out thy voice to call vpon him. There hath hee charged thee, <hi>Seeke my face;</hi> thou hast not answered, <hi>Thy face O Lord, I will seeke.</hi> By his Spirit he hath knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at thy doore, thou hast not opened to him. Now vpon some exigent thou bequeathest thy soule to him: vpon what acquaintance? Will this suddaine familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie be accepted?</p>
               <p>It is our owne ignorance or strangenes or vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes that hinders vs. The reprobates thinke Christ a stranger to them; <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 25. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>When did wee see thee hungry &amp;c.</hi> But indeed they are strangers to Christ, and hee may well say, when did I see you visite me? <hi>I was sicke and in prison, and yee came not at me.</hi> Would you haue God cleaue to them, that leaue him?

                  <hi>In well doing.</hi> The wicked man may commit his soule to Gods keeping, but how is hee sure God will take the charge of it? what should God doe with a fowle and polluted soule? The soule must at last bee committed to some: now hee onely is the receiuer of it in death, that was the keeper of it in life. If Satan haue alwayes ruled it, GOD will not embrace it. As <hi>Ieptha</hi> sayd to the Elders of <hi>Gilead:</hi>

                  <hi>Did ye not hate me, and expell me out of my fathers house? and why are yee come vnto me now, when you are in distresse?</hi> Did you thrust God out of your hearts, out of your houses, out of your barnes, out of your closets; and shall God open heauen to your soules?

We haue a soule within vs, but it is not ours; (and yet what is ours if our soule be not) it must bee committed to God; either in euill doing as to a Iudge, or in <hi>well doing</hi> as to a faithfull Creator. Some liue as if they had no soules; <hi>more belluino,</hi> like humane

To him they may boldly commend their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: for they that fit their soules for God in health, shall neuer find the offer of their death-bed refused.

It is an ill disiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that our fathers had so good workes, and wanted our faith: and wee haue the true faith, but want their workes. This <hi>Well</hi> is the very forme of a good worke: and <hi>Forma dat esse rei,</hi> it can not be good without it. Let mee take here iust cause to reproue two sorts of people.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some there are that trust God with their soules, and destroy their owne bodies. But God will take no charge of the soule but in well doing. Those vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that would kill themselues to preuent rauishments are reproued by iust censure. <hi>Satius incertum adulterium in futuro, quàm certum homicidium in praesenti.</hi> Better an vncertaine adulterie to be endured, then a certaine selfe-murther to be acted. How can they hope for Gods hand of mercie, that lay on themselues a hand of crueltie. <hi>Rhasis</hi> in the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> falling vpon his owne sword, and throwing himselfe downe from the wall, yet committed himselfe to Gods keeping, <hi>calling vpon the Lord of life and spirit, &amp;c.</hi> The Text sayes twice (with little credite to the owne Iudgement) that it <note place="margin">2. Matt. 14. 46.</note> was done <hi>Manfully.</hi> But it was <hi>magnè, potius quàm benè factum:</hi> done with desperate valour; with more ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then wisedome, temeritie then honesty. This was that the Deuill left out, when he cited Scripture to Christ; <hi>In all thy wayes;</hi> he made that a parenthesis, which was essentiall to the Text. This the originall <note place="margin">Math. 4. 6.</note> testified. Psal. 91. 11. <hi>Custodient in vijs tuis:</hi> but this
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:25651:421"/>
was none of his wayes downe from the pinacle, to shew the people a tumbling tricke, and to breake his necke. So the Deuill labours to secure men of Gods prouidence generally, though they be quite out of the way. He bids men be confident that God will keepe their soules, howsoeuer they walke: so vnder colour of Gods protection, he brings them to destruction. Hee tels a man of predestination, that he is sure of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall election to life, therefore may liue at his owne pleasure: so from Gods decree drawes encouragement to a secure life. He tels him of Iustification, that he is acquitted by the bloud of Christ; so emboldens him on the backe of presumption to ride post to Hell, whereas Predestination &amp; Iustification are onely made knowne to vs by <hi>well-doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is impossible for a man of an ill life, to hope that God will keepe his soule. Hee that liues ill, and hopes well, teacheth his ignorance to deceiue his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and them both to deceiue his soule. <note n="q" place="margin">Esa. 59. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Your iniquities haue separated betweene you and your God.</hi> But <note n="r" place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>separate your selues from the vncleane thing, and I will receiue you.</hi> Take away the barre, your sinnes: breake off the partition by repentance; then I will keepe you saith God. Commit your soules to the Lordes trust in <hi>well-doing,</hi> or not at all. If Christ had come downe from the pinacle headlong, and not by the staires; he had neglected the way, and so beene out of the compasse of Gods promise to keepe him. It is an ouer-bold presumption, to charge God to keepe thy soule, whilest thou doest wilfully loose it. Wilt thou clippe the wings of thy soule, and then bid it flie to God? It is all one, as if thou shouldest cut off a mans legge, and then send him on an arrand. Our presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is able to tie vp Gods armes, that he cannot helpe vs. Hee that will walke in prophanesse, and commit his soule to God; is like him that throwes himselfe
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:25651:422"/>
into a deepe pit, to trie whether God will helpe him out, and saue him from drowning. Man is timorous where he should bee bold, and bold where he should be timorous.</p>
               <p>God bids vs cast our care vpon him for this life: <note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 6. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Take no thought for your life,</hi> what you shall eate, or what you shall drinke, or wherewith you shall be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed: your heauenly Father knowes yee haue need of all these things. Yet wee dare not trust God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a pawne: vnlesse wee haue bread, we thinke wee shall starue. Here we feare, where wee ought not. God tells vs, the bread of heauen must feed our spirits; more necessary to maintaine life in the soule, then is bread to preserue life in the body: we neuer hunger after this, yet presume we haue sound soules, and trust God to keepe them. Here wee doe not feare where wee ought. Wee are so sottish, that wee dare trust God with the soule, the more precious part without well doing, the meanes to haue it saued: yet dare not trust him with our bodyes, vnlesse we can see our barnes full, or at lest our cupbords.</p>
               <p>But in vaine thou committest thy soule to God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou obeyest God. There is still a Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the promise: if thou keepe not the precept, thou hast no interest in the promise. If thou wilt not performe thy part, God is discharged of his part: if thou refuse to doe well, hee will not keepe thy Soule. The protection of God extends not to vs in lewd courses: we are then out of our way, and the Deuill may take vs vp as Vagabonds. <note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou doe well, shalt thou not be accepted? if thou doe euill, sinne lieth at the doore.</hi> If thou doe euill, Sinne is thy keeper, not God. There was a Temple, called the Temple of Trust: God will not be to them a Temple of Trust, that had no trust in their Temples.</p>
               <p>It is a good thing to haue God keepe the soule, but
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:25651:422"/>
the wicked cannot haue this hope. He that hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, layes it vp in his coffers; or if he sends it abroad, like a sterne laylor, he suffers it not to goe without a keeper; sound bonds. He that hath lands makes strong conueyances to his desired heires, that they may bee kept. If children, he prouides to haue them safely kept. He keepes his goods from the theefe, his chickens from the kite, his lambe from the wolfe, his fawne from the hound, his doue from the vermine: yet he keeps not his soule from the Deuill. O wretched man that must die, and knowes not what shall become of his soule. The world would haue it, but hee knowes it must not: himselfe would keepe it, but hee knowes he cannot: Sathan would haue it, and he knowes not whether he shall: he would haue God take it, and he knowes not whether he will. O miserable man, that must part with his soule he knowes not whether.</p>
               <p>We see what it is to lead an euill life, and to bee a stranger to God. He <note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 14.</note>
