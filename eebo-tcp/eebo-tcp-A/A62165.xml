            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <head type="sub">Published and subscribed with his owne hand at the Randevouze at <hi>Worcester,</hi> Octob. 11. 1642. in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Sergeant Major <hi>Berry, Thomas Cox,</hi> Doctor of Physick, Captain <hi>Walter Long;</hi> Captain <hi>Robert Long; Lyonell Copeley,</hi> Muster master Generall; <hi>Iohn Rushworth</hi> Clerke, Assistant to the Commons House of Parliament.</head>

Both these persons charge mee that I should say, <hi>That death did not so much trouble mee, as that I had endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to defend so bad a cause, which I was driven unto, as well by my owne ambition, as by perswasion of other men;</hi> and that I wished that all the Actions of the Parliaments Forces might hereafter be unsuccessefull; and especially, that I should desire God and the King to forgive mee this great
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61269:3"/>
sinne of Rebellion, &amp;c. They that know mee well, know that I have not so much vanity, as to thinke any discourse necessary for my defence in this case; yet that I may stand cleere, as well in the thoughts of strangers as of my friends, I thought fit to render this account to the world. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of death never hitherto so neerly toucht mee, but that if God shall once restore mee to my former strength, I shall by his help with as much alacity, and I hope courage, endeavour to defend, and maintaine with my dearest blood, this so good a cause, as ever I was at first engaged in it. <hi>Not my Ambition prompted mee unto it,</hi> but a legitimate and ardent desire of advancing that cause, which I conceive honours the meanest of them that are imployed therein; nor was I drawne into this businesse by any <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,</hi> but such as were backed by the best of Arguments, the maintaining of the true Religion, the honour and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my Prince, the Rights and Priviledges of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the whole Kingdome; such a successe I pray for to the designes of the Parliament, and in particular to this Army under the Command of his Excellencie the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> as by the best of men can possibly be desired, both on His Majesties Person, and this whole Kingdome. And lastly, I professe to the whole World, that my conscience did when I was in the gieatest danger of death, and doth still cleare mee from the guilt of Rebellious or tumultuous thoughts, and that the most puissant motive which carried mee on to this Action, was loyalty to my Soveraign, &amp; love to my Religion and Country: They certainly thought mee dead when they writ these Letters, and by this means ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to have served their ends, upon some feeble unresolved spirits. But I wonder they should write there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds of our men slain, when it is most apparant, that the number both of them that dyed in the place, and since, never amounted to thirty persons; &amp; their losse no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to ours, considering their great advantage of place, and that they were at least double for number. There was indeed a Divine, who I thinke was the Deane of <hi>Worcester,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61269:3"/>
who came to mee to the house where I was first taken up, and accompanied mee to the place where I now lye, hee continually urged and pressed my conscience, how great a sinne I was guilty of in taking up armes against my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, I was not then in case to entertain him in discourse, onely at last answered him, I never had, nor ever would take up Armes against my Soveraigne, but ever should be ready to lay my life, and whatsoever was deare unto mee at His feet: of this judgement and resolution I still am, and solemnely make this Protestation, in the same sence I have here already declared, and according to the sense of the Parliament in all their Declarations, of which I hope with Gods blessing upon my recovery to give further testimony to the World, by the continued engagement of my life and fortune, in this so just and honourable a cause.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> have this very <hi>Octob</hi> to chanced upon a <hi>Printed Declaration,</hi> pretended to goe out under your name: the Title of it premising, <hi>A vindication of your selfe, from some calumnious aspersions of my Lord</hi> Falkland, <hi>and Mr. Secretary</hi> Nicholas. It will hardly obtaine credit with men of free, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged understandings, that personages of so much trust and honour, should over-lightly adventure their owne fames, by imposing calumnies upon anothers. I therefore little doubt, but that these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable personages had their grounds from some such good hands: as might either take up some part of the report from your owne mouth, or from some others whom they credited. Such as heard it (at first or second hand) from those that visited you upon your bed at <hi>Worcester,</hi> at such times as you felt more ease from your wounds, and more wounds from your Conscience. For I cannot thinke, but that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those many visitants, you might utter more of the same kind of remorses, then you did unto my selfe. But leaving those honourable personages to the vindication of such <hi>particulars</hi> as you charge upon them, in the <hi>generall,</hi> I am induced to answer thus much for them: for that to my selfe in pretence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61269:4"/>
of your cosin Mr <hi>Iohn Sandys,</hi> you were so free and ingenuous in your acknowledgements and <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The person of your <hi>Confessor,</hi> I perceive you have mistaken: by reason, perhaps, of that <hi>Canonicall coat,</hi> in which I visited your selfe, and such other dying men, before you, as I could come at in the field, and time of battell; but that mistake may be rectified at our next meeting. In the meane time, if your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory were not then as weake as your body, and that you still continue in the same ingenuity which I left you, you will not, cannot deny the <hi>generalls,</hi> and <hi>scope</hi> of these passages to be true, which you here find asserted: and which upon my credit I will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the world; and if you please unto your selfe, at our next meeting. What you shall here find goes under the name of a Minister of Prince <hi>Ruperts:</hi> as the copie of it was at first given abroad. I had no time to alter it, or saw I any cause to change any thing I had written in it.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Minister</hi> being met in the field by my Lord <hi>Andover,</hi> was advised to visite Colonell <hi>Sandys,</hi> and to exhort him to repent of his sinnes; who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wounded Colonell in a little house, presented unto him (among his other sinnes) the unhappinesse of his present condition, to suffer in so bad a cause; This with some expressions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse he acknowledged, and withall professed, that if it were to doe againe, he would never appeare in it.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Minister</hi> diswading the people of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> from stripping him, contented one of them by taking off one of the <hi>Colonells</hi> spurres and giving them to him; but with this condition, that hee should carry up Master <hi>Sandys</hi> his legges: and upon this consideration, that if so hee did, the spurres would then hurt the bearer. But the Colonell feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chayre uneasie, the Minister borrowed a sheet of the house to carry him into the Towne. At
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61269:5"/>
all this was his Cozen, Master <hi>Iohn Sandys</hi> present, and with the <hi>Minister</hi> went all the way with the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell,</hi> and housed him at the <hi>Green-Dragon</hi> in <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> There the <hi>Minister</hi> left him for a while: Not long after came Serjeant Major <hi>Francklin</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell,</hi> and brought Master <hi>Catenby</hi> the Surgeon to dresse him. To whom the <hi>Colonell</hi> said, <hi>Woe, woe to evill Counsell, and happy are they that doe not take it;</hi> with other words to the like purpose, as the Serjeant Major told the <hi>Minister</hi> at first: since which time the Surgeon hath by word of mouth justified it to the <hi>Minister.</hi> The <hi>Minister</hi> now returning, first put the <hi>Colonell</hi> in minde of the haynousnesse of the sinne of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> that it was <hi>as the sinne of Witchcraft;</hi> and that God had commanded, <hi>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live,</hi> which doome was now likely to fall upon him, for God had found him out in his sinne: He acknowledged himselfe to have fallen into the sinne of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and that God was just in his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; professing therewithall his sorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse for it. Upon which the <hi>Minister</hi> returned; That herhaps if ever he recovered the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from others, and inconsideratenesse in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, might againe endanger to draw him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his <hi>Rebellion:</hi> At which words, a little hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up his hand, he professed <hi>He would rather have it cut off, then ever againe lift it up against the King.</hi> Nor did he at this profession make any mention at all of the Parliament; or conjoyne their cause with the Kings. Indeed, said the <hi>Minister,</hi> you have no reason to appeare against the King, if you well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61269:6"/>
the cause; and that His Majestie was but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to take up defensive Armes for the Reformed Religion, His owne Crowne, the Lawes and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Subject; And therefore there was much difference betwixt the two causes of the warre: these that suffered on the Kings side, being a kinde of Martyrs. Whereupon the <hi>Colonell</hi> acknowledged the Justnesse of the Kings cause; and that he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a speciall blessing of God to goe along with it, by the extraordinary successes of it: To this the <hi>Minister</hi> replyed, Sir, I am witnesse to all these words of yours; but doe you give me leave to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this repentance of yours unto the world? This he freely desired him to testifie, and askt God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse: withall praying for the King, and for a blessing upon his cause and proceedings.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minister</hi> then added, Sir, I have one sinne more to presse your conscience with: Sir, you are descended from a Bishop, and your family hath beene raised from the Church, therefore the spoyle and outrage committed by you in <hi>Canterbury</hi> Church, was more abhominable in you then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man. To which with some quicknesse he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, That it was much against his minde; and that so soone as he heard what his men were doing, he ranne among them with his <hi>Pole-Axe</hi> to beat them off; untill he had like to have beene hewen in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minister</hi> added, Sir, it uses to be required of men dying for their offences, to reveale something that may doe right to the party wronged: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61269:6"/>
Sir, it would much ease your conscience, and make the King some part of satisfaction, to discover the secret of the great designe against him; Of which, when by one or two earnest denyalls, he professed himselfe ignorant; The Minister then desired him to discover what strength the Parliament Forces were of: He said, he could not tell. How strong, said the Minister, are their Foot? Not considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, sayes he; Why Sir, said the Minister, you were present lately at their Muster on <hi>Dunsmore-Heath,</hi> and could you neither by your owne observation, nor from the report of others, make judgement of their numbers? Were they 8000, or 10000, or 16000? Neither, said the Colonell: not above 6000, or 7000. How strong then are their Horse? Seventy Troopes, said the Colonell: At which the Minister making some doubt, and wonder. On my faith its true, said he, its no time now to dissemble; you meane Dragooners and all, said the Minister: No, onely Troopers, said the other, of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>Then the Minister renewed the motion before made in the little house by the field, concerning the perfecting of his Will; for which he desired him to come againe a day or two after. So the Minister perceiving him faint, unwilling therefore to speake much, and desirous to take rest, tooke his leave; his Cozen <hi>Sandys</hi> and a Servant remaining still with him in the Chamber.</p>
            <p>His Cozen can affirme all this; and since told the Minister, that the Colonell said much more to him

in testimony of his repentance. And among the rest, he bade me report this passage for one. That he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, Cozen, what meant you being a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of so faire estate, to ingage your selfe in this Treason: The Colonell replyed to him, That he was so farre drawne in before he was aware, that he knew not how to come off without the danger of his head. This will his Cozen justifie to him.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO this Testimony of your <hi>Confession,</hi> some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in your <hi>Vindication</hi> provoketh me to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne this <hi>Postscript.</hi> And first to that (page 7.) of your <hi>Declaration,</hi> (yours if it be, which I much sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect) where you seeme to excuse your selfe from <hi>taking up Armes against your Soveraigne:</hi> and that you thinke your understanding the cause <hi>in the sense of the Parliament Declarations,</hi> can justifie you. Plainly, Sir, I was more watchfull upon you then so, to be deceived by words of doubtfull, or double sence. Your expressions were cleare and explicite, such as best became a Penitent and dying man: nor did you ever so much as once referre your selfe to any sence of the <hi>Parliament Declarations.</hi> And if upon recovery you ever <hi>ingage your selfe</hi> against the King, in this <hi>cause</hi> and <hi>sense,</hi> let your owne <hi>hand,</hi> then lifted up, be witnesse with me against you. Take heed, (Master <hi>Sandys)</hi> of equivocating with <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Annoynted;</hi> or of dallying with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations. But I will hope you to be sincere and reall, and that this <hi>Declaration</hi> (if yours) was but forced from you.</p>
            <p>The other points that I finde my selfe provoked to give answer to, are first, concerning the <hi>numbers on both sides slaine in battaile at</hi> Worcester: Though truely Sir, with no delight (God knowes) doe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61269:8"/>
(much lesse glory) in the numbers of <hi>slaine Countrey-men;</hi> yet Sir, whereas the Souldiers ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary phrase after a victory is, <hi>The more bloud, the more honour.</hi> I cannot but take notice of the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of honour, which those valiant <hi>Princes, Lords, Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> on the Kings party have received, by your affirming your <hi>losse never to have amounted to thirty persons; and that our losse was no way inferiour to yours, considering our great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of place; and that we were at least double for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> In confutation of all which in one period, let the <hi>Reader</hi> (till a larger <hi>Narration</hi> can be published) be pleased to accept of this little: First, That (if we count right) there were more then that number of thirty found dead in the field after the victory. More then that number also chased into <hi>Worcester;</hi> and there either slaine, or (as our Souldiers supposed when they gave them over) deadly wounded. More also then so many Prisoners. All which woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and captived men, Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> noble clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy gave free life and liberty unto. We heard also by Townesmen, and such as dwelt by the river and bridge, which your defeated Troopes fled over; that more then that number were taken up drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As for the slaine on the Kings side, on my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit we could never heare of five, which is just so many as your side lost Colours. Secondly, for the <hi>plate,</hi> 'twas a plain field upon a hill; the place cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by your selves to charge in: where the difficulty of your little ascent to it was fully recompenced, by your having both Winde and Sunne of us. As
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61269:8"/>
for inequality of numbers, you Sir, had ten Troopes, and the <hi>Prince</hi> had fourteene, but scarce halfe of them charged; as being sent to guard the Towne and Lane that led to it. Thus Sir, praying that by continuance in the same royall minde I left you, your selfe may confute this supposed <hi>Vindication,</hi> I remaine as ready, either to serve, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you, as I then was; for I heare you are yet living.</p>
