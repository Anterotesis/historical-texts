            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Er multas tribulaciones oportet introire in regnum dei. ¶ Thus ſayth the apoſtole ſaynt Poule in the boke of actes and dedes / that is to ſaye in englyſſhe. By many trybu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ns we muſte entre in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of god wherfore all thoſe whiche intende to com in to the kyngdome of heuen muſte pacyently take temporall trybulacyon. For that is the waye thyder by the ordynau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god. And thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moeſt pacyently take ther trybulaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n / they ſhall haue ther<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mooſt conſolacyon. For ſay nt Poule ſayth in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>conde Epyſtle to the Corynthes. ¶ Sicut ſocu ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus paſſionis. ſic erimus conſolacionis. ¶ That is to ſaye. Lyke as we are parteners in trybulacyons ſo ſhall we be parteners in Joye and conſolacyon. Thus trybulacyon is bytter / but the ende that hit bryngeth to is mooſt ſwete &amp; delectable. And reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that euerlaſtynge ſwetenes maketh fayth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full ſoules ſwetely to take mater of trybulacyon.</p>
            <p>Temporall aduerſyte &amp; trouble profyteth no thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge to the rewarde of eternall Joye but yf it be pacy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>entely taken. Thus pacyence maketh trybulacyon profytable. And the profyte of temporall proſperyte cometh of the vertue of mekenes wherby proſperyte is lytel ſet by. The parfyte pacyente herte maketh moche of aduerſyte. And the parfyte meke herte ſet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth <pb facs="tcp:8268:3"/> lytell by temporall proſperyte / &amp; lytell Joyeth therin but rather ſoroweth / bycauſe he fereth that he vſeth not parfeytly acordynge to the grete pleſure of god the goodes of this proſperyte. Yf thou aſke me why our lorde wyl gyue theſe temporall goodes to ſuche as he knoweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are wretched ſinners and vſe them euyl. I anſwere. One cauſe is to ſhewe his parfyte &amp; habonda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t goodneſſe whiche gyueth good thynges not only to ſuche as be good / but alſo to ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che as are euyl &amp; wretched ſynners. And to gyue vs example to folowe hym in doynge good for euyll / as he byddeth in the goſpell of Mathew. Loue your enemyes ſayth he / &amp; do well to ſuche as do euyll to you and praye for ſuche as purſue you &amp; ſpeke euyl of you. For ye doo thus than ye may knowe that ye are parfyte in vertue lyke as your fader in heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is parfyte &amp; maketh the ſonne to gyue lyght as well to the euyll men as to the good men. And maketh the vnryghtwyſſe men to haue profyte of the rayne as well as the ryghtwyſſe. And this is a grete com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forte to take pacyently trybulacyon. For yf we wyll for the loue of god breke our one frowarde herte a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for to wynne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of god &amp; loue ſuche as trouble vs &amp; praye for them / and do good ayenſt euyll / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue one of the greteſt tokenes that we are par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyte in the ſyght of god as his owne children / and folowers of hym / whiche thynge yf we wyll remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre vs is moſt Joyfull to vs. Alſo it maketh vs more pacyent yf we duely remembre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodes that
<pb facs="tcp:8268:5"/>
we haue reſceyued of god / the goodes of nature / as wytte / eloquence / ſebleneſſe of bodye / helthe / beaute &amp; goodes of fortune / as golde / ſyluer / clothe / lyuelo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de and how we haue myſpended them ſynfully / &amp; how pacyently he hath ſuffred vs longe tyme to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde in ſynne to the entent that fynaly remembryn ge his goodenes / his pacyence / &amp; longe ſufferynge / we ſholde tourne to hym / wherfore whan he ſtowe geth vs yf we remembre how wel we haue deſerued hit we ſhall by his grace more parfytly be ayen hit. Our lorde gyued good thynges / as helthe / rycheſſe &amp; proſperyte to euyll men &amp; wymen / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> remembryng his kyndeneſſe they ſholde be the more moeued to penaunce &amp; ſoryneſſe whan they ſee they haue offen ded ſo kynde a lorde whiche ſo gentelly calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his grete goodnes. And he ſendeth oftymes try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n to good folk whiche are not parfytly goode for they take not thankefully trybulaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n / but ſome tyme grudge vnder the rodde of chaſtyſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he kepeth them ſtyll vnder the rodde tyll they be ſo acuſtomed therwith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they can take it pacyen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly. Thus by his kyndeneſſe he bryngyth euyll folke to penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / and by his ſharpneſſe he bryngeth good folke to pacyence. Alſo he gyueth proſperyte and goodes of this worlde to good men and wymen to nouryſſhe them &amp; cheryſhe them in his loue / lyke as the fader telleth the childe to folowe hym by a fayre appell / he ſendeth alſo trybulaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n to euyll folke to make them drede hym. And thus the good folke he
<pb facs="tcp:8268:6"/>
bryngeth to loue by worldely proſperyte. And euyll folke he bryngeth to drede by aduerſyte.</p>
            <p>ONe cauſe why our lorde wyll that good folke haue aduerſyte and trybulacyon is this / by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that euyll folke ſhall not thynke that trybulacyon is ſo euyll that our lorde accepteth hit nought ne loueth them whiche hate hit for they ſee the contrarye that thoſe whiche be mooſt in vertue haue mooſt trybulacyon / as our ſauyour wiche ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dyd ſynne hadde mooſt bytter payne and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Alſo his bleſſyd moder / his apoſtles and his dyſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyples. And lyke wyſe now in theſe dayes ſuche fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke as our lorde loueth beſte ſuche he ſendeth mooſt ſorowe in ther herte / and mooſt payne or labour in bodye / with the whiche in the begynnyng they grut che / but fynally they are taught to ſuffre hit ſwetly and to gyue thankynges to our lorde therof / whiche by trybulacyon delyuereth them from grete ſynne / and brnngeth theym to grete grace in this worlde / and ordeyneth for them plentefully the pleſure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually and glorye of the lyfe that is to come.</p>
            <p>¶ He gyueth alſo the goodes of this lyfe to ſuche as be wretched and ſynfull lyuers after theyr ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne wyll and not after the wyll and lawe of god / by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe that good men and wymen ſhal not ſet theyr herte to moche on theſe goodes which they ſee that wretched people haue with the hatred of god / but that they ſhall loue thoſe goodes mooſt whiche ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue none but ſuche as be good / &amp; are ſpecyaly beloued
<pb facs="tcp:8268:6"/>

Our lorde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo gyueth wordely goodes to ſynfull folke / for yf he ſholde ſtryke euery ſynfull man &amp; woman with the ſtroke of ſharpe trybulacyon as ſoone as they hadde ſynned / than they ſholde thyuky that all ſyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne were punyſſhed in this lyfe / and that ther were no punyſſhement for ſynne ordeyned after this lyfe wherfore our lorde ſuffreth many one for to lyue in this lyfe after theyr owne pleſure / and to multeplye ſynne at ther pleſure a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to his grete dyſpleſure / ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uynge no punyſſhement in this worlde by cauſe we ſhall vnderſtande y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is reſerued to the other worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de / for god is ſo ryghtful that he may leue no ſynne vnpunyſſhed / wherfore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They abyde for noo thynge but for worldely good worſhype or ſolace / theyr hertes be ſo fixed in theſe worldely goodes that they loke lytell to the goodes of heuen and the rewarde of god. The ryghtwyſſe people whiche ſee by the ryghtwyſneſſe of god that noo ſynne may paſſe vnpunyſſhed / they deſyre of god to haue labour and trybulacyon in this worlde wherby they may eſcape y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bytter paynes and tour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes the whiche ben ordeyned for ſynners that haue lytell payne in this worlde / and they Joye of theyr trybulacyon.

And the payne the whiche is ſuffered after this lyfe it only profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to purgacyon of ſynne in ſuche as departe fro this lyfe in the ſtate of grace. Wherfore the holy man Job ſayth. ¶ Qui cepit verberare me ip<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terat me. ¶ He whiche hath begonnen to bete me he ſpare me not but bete me ynough / and in that only I wyll comforte me for that he gyueth me ſo grete payne and ſorowe and that he ſpareth me not. O take good hede of this holy ſoule whiche had loſte all his rycheſſe / all his childern / all his bodely helth that the fleſſhe felle roten fro his boones / and was deſpyſed of his frendes / and ſcorned of his wyfe. And yet all his ſufferaunce he helde it but as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge of his betynge and beſought god to bete hym fully / as who wolde ſaye / that god hadde but
<pb facs="tcp:8268:52"/>
lytell done to hym in all theſe / and other comforte he hadde not ne none other he deſyred to haue but that god wolde not ſpare hym. He vnderſtode that his betynge was payment to obteyne his letters of delyueraunce / and therfore he beſought god that he wolde gyue hym payment ynough that he ſholde not be taryed after his delyueraunce in defaute of payment. Alſo he vnderſtode that ſuche as our lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ſpareth in this lyfe he ſpareth them for to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after this lyfe. And ſuche as that our lorde lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth he beteth them in this lyfe bycauſe that he wyl ſpare them after this lyfe. The wretched folke are ſpared here by the grete wrath and grete yre of god for he wyll here after hym reuenge of them. And therfore Job deſyred to make all his paymenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. Thus yf that thou be dyſcomforted in that that thou art gretely beten with payne and trybulacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on / thou muſte comforte thy ſelfe ayen in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brynge how that our lorde loueth the and wyll ſpa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re the in tyme comynge. Our lorde wyll not bete the twyes for one thynge whan as one betynge is ſuffycyent / and the ſuffycyence is made by a good wyll and by the good takynge of betynge. For one gentyll and obedyent wyll maketh a lytel payne as acceptable to god for remyſſyon of ſynne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſſe of grace as ony grete payne without ſuche a good wyll.

Thus this holy fader Job offered his payne to god with a good hert and with a good wyl whan he deſyred that he ſholde not ſpare hym and all was by cauſe that he wolde that he ſholde ſpare hym in an other place / and therfore lyke as he deſyred to be beten here alſo he deſyred for to be ſpared there.
