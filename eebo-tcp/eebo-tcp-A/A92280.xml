            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Reaſons humbly propounded againſt diſſolving the Antient Revenue ariſing by Wine-Licences, and impoſing thirty ſhillings, or any other ſum, upon a Tun of Wine, in lieu thereof to be paid by the Merchant.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THe Wine-Merchants Trade up to the heighth of their (greatly impaired) Stocks and Credit, and although the addition of 30 s. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Tun of Wine may ſeem ſmall, yet it will ſubſtract no leſs then 27000 l. <hi>per annum</hi> out of the Merchants Stocks, which they muſt pay in lieu of about 12 or 13000 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> which the Retailers paid for their Wine Licenſes for that Revenue, as we are credibly informed never in the higheſt year yielded more; the payment of which 27000 l. will enforce them for want thereof to trade for about 100000 l. <hi>per annum</hi> leſs then now they do, which will not only be their loſs, and a further ſtep to their ruine, but the King alſo will ſuffer in his Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Cuſtoms upon Wines are already ſo exceeding high (even above the firſt coſt of their Wine) that Forreign Princes have taken notice and complained thereof; and we doubt not, but verily believe and expect, that an additional payment upon the Importer of Wine, will occaſion and induce thoſe Princes to encreaſe their Cuſtoms upon our Commodities and Manufactures imported into their Kingdoms, and ſo the Merchant will not only ſuffer a double miſchief and ruine, and Trade thereby leſſened, but alſo the whole Kingdom will ſuſtain great damage in vending their Commodities and Manufactures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Cuſtoms upon Wines are already ſo high, that the Merchants after all their great courage, hazards, perils and loſſes in forreign parts by Sea; and after arrival, are forc'd to ſell their choiceſt Wines at the Retailers Prizes for money to pay the Cuſtoms, which Wine they compound and mix with mean decaying Wines, and other Ingredients, to their great advantage: the addition of 27000 l. <hi>per annum</hi> will prove an exceeding preſſure upon the Merchants, and no leſs difficult for them to raiſe and multiply their neceſſities, and farther enable Retailers of VVine to prey upon them, and to encreaſe their ſaid evil compoſitions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That a Grant of Tonnage upon Merchants Importation of Wine, or any other Commodities, was never given to any in <hi>England</hi> but to the King, as Soveraign Lord, for protecting them in their Traffique at Sea and Land; nor is it granted to any other perſon in any part or place in the World where we have been or traded, but to the Soveraign, upon this general equity of protecting them in their Commerce: And we humbly hope this Honorable Houſe will not be prevailed with to make a Preſident herein.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the Revenue of Wine-Licenſes be diſſolved, the number of Vintners will be exceſſive.—In <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. when <hi>England</hi> abounded moſt in wealth, there were not above 2500 Taverns, and Wines were bought cheap beyond Sea, and not for ready money, but in Barter for other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. During the Diſorders, all who would ſold Wine without Licenſe; and though the wars had exhauſted the Kingdom, yet about <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. the number of Vintners was encreaſed unto about 4200. (beſides many untold, which were leſs obſervable) which produced greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations of Wine bought at enhaunced prizes, and not in Barter, but moſtly for ready money, to the Merchants damage, which Wines were bought up and vended, through the multitude of Vintners, at exceſſive prizes, which we muſt ſay is one of the great Leaks through which much of our wealth for this laſt 25 years hath iſſued.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Revenue of Wine-Licenſes proceedeth not out of the ſober uſe of Wine in the houſes of the Nobility and Gentry, who uſually have their Wines at the firſt hand, but upon the more extravagant expence thereof in Taverns; and there alſo nothing is impoſed, but every man doth limit his own expence and payments; but if this Revenue be diſſolved, and double the value thereof be charged upon the Merchant, it will reach all perſons and uſes without diſtinction.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Retailers of Wine were become ſo numerous and skilful in that hurtful Art of vitiating Wine, that the Act of 12 <hi>Caroli</hi> 2. inveſting the Crown with this Revenue of Wine-Licenſes, doth not only reſtrain the number, by appointing them to pay for Licenſes, but alſo doth ſomewhat chaſtiſe them for their ſaid unlawful practiſes: but if this Revenue of Wine-Licenſes be diſſolved, then the number will encreaſe, to the debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſuming of the Subject, and the ſaid Caſtigation will be removed.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The psofits ariſing by VVine-Licenſes is an antient Revenue belonging to the Crown, and though (till of late) impoſed only by Prerogative; yet it appeared ſo manifeſtly equal and neceſſary, that it was admitted without the leaſt oppoſition in the moſt ſtormy and adverſe times, therefore it is hoped the Retailers of Wine ſhall not be diſcharged from paying this their antient duty, which hath endured all weathers, and an impoſition laid upon the depreſſed Merchants.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Revenue of Wine-Licenſes ariſeth out of the vaſt gains of Retailers of Wine, whoſe beginnings, though very mean, yet in ſhort time they arrive to great Eſtates, and are obſerved within theſe laſt 25 years (wherein all other Traders have decayed) to have made more purchaſes then any other Traders in <hi>England,</hi> yet by their earneſt applications have brought an additional duty upon the Merchant, and now deſign to encreaſe the ſame, to free themſelves from paying for Licenſes.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Merchants Eſtates are uſually either in forreign parts, or in Retailers hands, or elſe floating on the Seas, and expoſed unto amazing hazards, and themſelves poſſeſt of little elſe then empty Warehouſes, and cannot procure money as Retailers of Wine may, who not only take much ready money, but alſo having their Cellars full of Wine, can value themſelves thereon at pleaſure: If the Merchant (though under this diſadvantage) muſt find money to pay vaſt Cuſtoms, yet it is hoped the ſame ſhall not be encreaſed to free Retailers of Wine from paying their antient duty.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The Revenue of Wine-Licenſes, as now placed, is to be paid by about 3000 perſons, who are Retailers of Wine, which can hardly be felt amongſt ſo many; but if in lieu thereof an Impoſition be upon the Merchant, the ſame will be paid out of the Purſes of a very few, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready very much burthened, and will be unto them an exceeding addition to their preſent payments and ſufferings, and but ſmall for the Retail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to pay, and no more then what they paid antiently.</p>
            <p n="12">12. If the Revenue ariſing by Wine-Licenſes be diſſolved, it will infringe the antient Liberties and Priviledges of all the Corporations in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who have power by the Act 7 <hi>Edwardi</hi> 6. to grant Licenſes unto Retailers to ſell Wine to be drank and ſpent out of their houſes: As alſo deprive very many Pattentees (who have paid great ſums for their Patents, and (as we are informed) have now ſome good allowance in the Rent of their Licenſes, in conſideration thereof) for they who have Patents, and they who have none, will be equally free to retail Wine, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the wealth and welfare of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object,</hi> We know it will be objected, That when Trade is free and open it comes moſt profitable both to King and Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This holds true in Merchandize, generally uſe full and neceſſary; but where the Merchandize is a coſtly and luxurious ſuperfluity, the more free the trade is, the more it conſumeth and deſtroyeth the Subject, who had better give the King treble the value of what he may have by opening ſuch a trade, then to have ſo much Wealth conſumed in ſo great a ſuperfluity; and if it be neceſſary by Licences to reſtrain the number of Traders in Ale and Beer, a Native neceſſary and cheap Commodity, and leſs apt to produce exceſs, then ſure it is much more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by Licences to reſtrain the number of Vintners, who deal in a coſtly luxurious forraign Commodity, which tendeth much more to exceſs.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>It may be objected, that it will be a great burthen for Retaylers of Wine at the ſame time to pay the new Impoſition, and alſo for Wine-Lycences. To which we anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the payment for Wine Licences is out of their great gain ariſing upon the Sale of Wine, at the preſent Prizes, ſo it is no burthen upon them and the Honourable Houſe of Commons have allowed them 4 <hi>d.</hi> upon the quart of French Wine, and 6 <hi>d.</hi> upon the quart of Spaniſh-wine to defray the new impoſition, which will fully do the ſame, and time being given for payment thereof, wherein then are they burthened? and how can they then be looſers? If neceſſary we could preſent a Clue which would lead unto and diſcover their gains, th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
